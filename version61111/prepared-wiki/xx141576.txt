[[Being Ridden]]

CATEGORIES: 2003 albums, Cex albums

Being Ridden is an album by Cex. It is his second album to move away from a straight ahead electronic music sounds and endulge in a more hip-hop based music, complete with rapping by Cex. The album cover is a parody of David Bowie's album cover for his album "Heroes".
The main difference between Being Ridden and BR Instrumentals, except for the duct tape covering Kidwell's mouth, is the track listing. Every track from Being Ridden is featured on BR Instrumentals except Stamina, Outher Countries and Nevermind.  These tracks only appear on Being Ridden and are replaced by My Hands Switched With Mannequin Hands, Bad Girls and M Ren Dvine. The three songs are on track 7, 10 and 13 on both albums.
