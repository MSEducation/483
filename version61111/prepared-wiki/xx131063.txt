Harry (Doc) Sage (March 16, 1864 â€“ May 27, 1947), nicknamed "Doc", was a Major League Baseball catcher in 1890 for the Toledo Maumees of the American Association.  He was a native of Rock Island, Illinois.
In his only major league season, Sage played in 81 out of 132 games for the Maumees. A good defensive catcher, his .948 fielding percentage was above the league average of .925. He was a huge liability at bat, however, hitting a paltry .149 (41-for-275). He managed to contribute some offense, however. He walked 29 times to raise his on-base percentage to .235, scored 40 runs, hit two home runs and drove in 25. 
Sage died in his hometown of Rock Island, Illinois, at the age of 83.
