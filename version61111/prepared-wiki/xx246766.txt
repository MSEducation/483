==History==

The Stocks House was built in 1677.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.zeus2.dk/nyboder.html|title=Nyboder|publisher=Clara & Flemming Svendsens Hjemmeside.|accessdate=2010-01-07[/tpl] Prior to that physical punishment had taken place at Jarmers Tower. The building was altered by Elias David Häusser between 1722 and 1724.
In 1741 the Stocks House was opened to civilian prisoners and it became a place for people who had been sentenced to "slavery", that is prisoners sentenced to penal labour in iron. A destinction was made between "honest" and "dishonest" prisoners, the latter being those who had been beaten at the whipping post  (Danish: Kag), a punishment which was not just corporal but associated with loss of honor.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.landsarkivetkbh.dk/hovedst/txt/kilder/stokhus.htm|title=Københavns Stokhus|publisher=landsarkivetkbh|accessdate=2010-01-07[/tpl]
