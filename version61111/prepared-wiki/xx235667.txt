Princess Kaiulani (sometimes titled Barbarian Princess) is a 2009 film based on the life of Princess Ka[tpl]okina[/tpl]iulani (1875–1899) of the Kingdom of Hawaii.

==Description==

The film stars Q'orianka Kilcher in the role of Princess Ka[tpl]okina[/tpl]iulani, one of the last heirs to the throne of the Kingdom of Hawaii. This movie was shown in Hawaii International Film Festival under the title Barbarian Princess; afterward, Roadside Attractions acquired this movie's United States rights and changed this movie's title for United States release.[tpl]cite news |title= Roadside drawn to Hawaiian biopic Princess Kaiulani |work= Screen Daily |date= February 10, 2010 |author= Jeremy Kay |url= http://www.screendaily.com/news/distribution/roadside-drawn-to-hawaiian-biopic-princess-kaiulani/5010583.article |accessdate= 2010-04-25 [/tpl]
The movie follows the progression of Ka[tpl]okina[/tpl]iulani's short life, beginning with a happy life in Honolulu interrupted by the events surrounding the imposition of the Bayonet Constitution.  The movie follows her through her education in Victorian England, the announcement of the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii, her campaign to attempt to convince the United States to reverse the overthrow, and her return to Hawaii.
The historical events are generally portrayed accurately,[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2012[/tpl] though some of the details, for example the reasons for King Kalākaua's signing of the Bayonet Constitution, are not explained in detail.  In contrast, many of the personal details of the princess's life, including particularly the depiction of her love life, are representative of who she was rather than strictly historical.  Her life also included many significant events that are not in this movie.
The movie was written and directed by Marc Forby, and also stars Barry Pepper as Lorrin Thurston, Will Patton as Sanford B. Dole, Julian Glover as Theophilus Harris Davies,  and Shaun Evans as Clive Davies.
The first public performance of the movie was in Honolulu on October 16, 2009, at the historic Hawaii Theatre, as part of the 2009 Hawaii International Film Festival.[tpl]cite web |url=http://hawaii.bside.com/2009/films/barbarianprincess_hawaii2009 |title=Barbarian Princess, 2009 |work=Hawaii International Film Festival web site |accessdate=2009-10-18 [/tpl] The performance was sold out.http://kgmb9.com/main/content/view/22057/40/[tpl]dead link|date=April 2010[/tpl]

==Controversy==

The film's working title "Barbarian Princess" provoked controversy in Hawaii, with individuals stating that it brings up painful memories of past discrimination.[tpl]cite news |title= Senators seek overthrow of ‘Princess’ film tax help |accessdate =2010-03-26  |date=March 25, 2008 |author=Richard Borreca |newspaper= Honolulu Star-Bulletin |url= http://archives.starbulletin.com/2008/03/25/news/story11.html [/tpl]  In response, the title was briefly changed to The Last Princess,[tpl]cite news |title= 'The Last princess': A Tale of Ka'iulani |author= Mike Gordon |newspaper= Honolulu Advertiser |date= April 6, 2008 |url= http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2008/Apr/06/il/hawaii804060310.html |accessdate= October 7, 2010 [/tpl] changed to Princess Kaiulani later in 2008,[tpl]cite news |title= Still Searching for a Title both Inoffensive and Provocative: The Princess paradox |author= Mike Gordon |newspaper= Honolulu Advertiser |date= September 26, 2008 |url= http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2008/Sep/26/il/hawaii809260338.html |accessdate= October 7, 2010 [/tpl] then shown as Barbarian Princess for the 2009 festival.  The producers stated that the title was meant to be ironic and is meant to draw audiences who may not be familiar with the history of Hawaii.[tpl]cite news |title= 'Princess' sparks heated debate |accessdate = 2010-03-26  |date= October 16, 2009 |author=Katherine Nichols and Gary Chun |newspaper= Honolulu Star-Bulletin |url= http://www.starbulletin.com/news/20091016_princess_sparks_heated_debate.html [/tpl] The film was finally released for wider distribution as Princess Kaiulani.
Many native Hawaiians were disappointed that the film used a non-Hawaiian for the title role.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl]

==Critical reception==

Princess Kaiulani was almost universally panned by critics. Rotten Tomatoes reported that only 23% of critics gave the film a positive review. Roger Ebert called it an "interesting but creaky biopic."
Hailed by the Hollywood Reporter and panned by the New York press, Princess Kaiulani was either praised or left audiences cold.[tpl]cite web |title= Princess Kaiulani |work= Box Office Mojo web site  |url=  http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=princesskaiulani.htm |accessdate= October 7, 2010 [/tpl]
The film won the Audience Award for "Best Feature" at the 2009 Honolulu International Film Festival in a tie with Precious: Based on the Novel "Push" by Sapphire.
