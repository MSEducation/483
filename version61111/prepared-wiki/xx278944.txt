==History==

Sheykh Alaeddin Mohammad was highly respected by Sultan Muhammad bin Baysonqor, one of the Timur's grandsons and ruler of Fars and Arak. Sheykh Alaeddin lead a comfortable life, until Sultan Muhammad rebelled against his uncle Shahrukh Mirza and lost the war even before it began. Shahrukh Mirza got very angry and captured Isfahan. Sultan Muhammad escaped to Lorestan. Shahrukh Mirza, who couldn't get Sultan Muhammad, arrested his favorite men. One of these men was Sheykh Alaeddin. Shahrukh Mirza exiled Sheykh Alaeddin to Saveh. Instigated by his wife, Goharshad Khatun, Shahrukh Mirza called back Sheykh Alaeddin from Saveh after some time and convicted him to death. 80 days after the death of Sheykh Alaeddin, Shahrukh Mirza died. After the Shahrukh Mirza's death, his nephew, Sultan Muhammad bin Baysonqor got back to Isfahan and ordered to bury the Sheykh Alaeddin's body in the Khanqah he had preached in. He ordered also to build a marvellous mausoleum on his grave. Sheykh Alaeddin's children have been also buried in the mausoleum, but their grave stone has been destroyed during the pass of time and their names have been forgotten.
