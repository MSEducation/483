==Gameplay==

In Pyroblazer, players take control of futuristic anti-gravity combat craft called Blazers and pilot them against each other across the lands of a world known as New Aperion. Players attack other players by collecting weapon and ammo upgrades throughout a race, and new, more powerful Blazers can be unlocked as a player wins the single-player Championship mode.IGN Pyroblazer First Look

===Multiplayer===

Aside from the single-player modes, six-person local multiplayer would also be featured in Pyroblazer, as well as an online multiplayer mode.
However, the multiplayer component of Pyroblazer was later removed due to funding.
