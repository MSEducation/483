CATEGORIES: Political parties in Namibia

The South West Party (in Afrikaans: Suidwes Party, in German: SÃ¼dwestpartei) was a political party in Namibia. Initially the party was known as Union Party (Unie Party in Afrikaans). The party was founded in Windhoek in September 1924 by F. van der Heever, A.P. Olivier, and Andries de Wet. It took the name SWP in 1926.
In 1926, the SWP created a pact with the National Party of South West Africa, against the German League in South West Africa (DBSW). The following year SWP and NPSWA merged to form the United National South West Party.
