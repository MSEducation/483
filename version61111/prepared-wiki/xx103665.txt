Cobb Field was a baseball park located in Billings, Montana from 1932 to 2007.  It was originally named Athletic Park and opened as Cobb Field on May 4, 1948 after renovations. It was the home of the Billings Mustangs, the Pioneer League Rookie Affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds, from 1948-2007.  Cobb Field was named after Bob Cobb, who was responsible for bringing the Mustangs to Billings.  It also hosted home games for local American Legion baseball teams. In 2006, the stadium welcomed the re-formed NCAA baseball team from nearby Montana State University Billings. From March to May, home games were played at the field.

==Features==

Cobb Field had a natural grass surface. The dimensions were 335 feet to left, 405 feet to center, and 325 feet to right. Cobb Field sat 4,200, though crowds had been known to eclipse 5,000. The stadium was primarily made up of the same wood used when it had been built and had shown substantial wear. Many areas of the stadium had needed wooden boards to be installed over holes in the floor.  
Cobb Field's concessions had undergone a drastic overhaul in its last few years.  In addition to the basic concession items, the Mustangs added the "Cobb Grill" and "Betisse's Bullpen", a patio on the left field line where Mustangs fans can enjoy a beer and roam about freely. "Betisse's Bullpen" also hosted pre-game tailgate parties.

On November 8, 2006, a $12.5 million stadium levy passed (with a 53% majority 'for' vote) allowing construction of a new stadium at the Cobb Field location.
