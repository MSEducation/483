The Joseph Garneau, Jr. House, later called the Thomas Kilpatrick House, is located at 3100 Chicago Street in the Gifford Park neighborhood of Omaha, Nebraska, United States. Built in 1890 for cracker magnate Joseph Garneau Jr., it changed hands in 1903 when Garneau moved to New York City to set up a wine importing business.  Thomas Kilpatrick lived in the house until his death in 1916.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cityofomaha.org/planning/landmarks/alphabetical-listing/garneau--kilpatrick-house|title=Garneau / Kilpatrick House|publisher=City of Omaha â€” Landmarks Heritage Preservation Commission|accessdate =2012-10-25[/tpl]
The Romanesque Revival style of the house led to it be designated an Omaha Landmark in 1980; it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1981.
It has served as the home of the Theta Lambda Chapter of Creighton University's Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity since 1981.  The fraternity has renovated the interior into apartment style housing.
