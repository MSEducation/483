Aberdeen University Sports Union (AUSU) is an elected body responsible for the running of organised student sport at the University of Aberdeen, Scotland. It is a constituent part of Aberdeen University Students' Association. It is not responsible for facilities and rents time for its clubs from Aberdeen Sports Village.

The Sports Union President for the 2013/2014 season is Marc McCorkell.

==History==

The University of Aberdeen Sports Union was created in 1999 from an amalgamation of three student bodies, to create the Aberdeen University Students' Association. At this point the ancient Athletics Association, as it was known, ceased to exist. At first the new sports body was called Sports Council but in 2002 this changed to Sports Union due to confusion over the number of councils at the university. The new body is identical in set up to its sister Aberdeen University Societies Union.

==Colours and playing strips==

The strip uses the four colours of the university crest - royal blue, gold, red and white. The design was based on the quarters of the university crest and the previous rugby 1st XV strips. The traditional colours of royal blue and gold had to be supplemented due to Heriot-Watt University carrying out a similar project several years previously and their colours also being royal blue and gold. The away strip was opposite with red as the main.[tpl]clarify|date=December 2010[/tpl]
