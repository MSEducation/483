The Terracotta Army or the "Terracotta Warriors and Horses" is a collection of terracotta sculptures depicting the armies of Qin Shi Huang, the first Emperor of China. It is a form of funerary art buried with the emperor in 210–209 BC and whose purpose was to protect the emperor in his afterlife.
The figures, dating from approximately the late third century BC,[tpl]cite journal |title=TL dating of pottery sherds and baked soil from the Xian Terracotta Army Site, Shaanxi Province, China |author=Lu Yanchou, Zhang Jingzhao, Xie Jun |journal= International Journal of Radiation Applications and Instrumentation.

The figures vary in height according to their roles, with the tallest being the generals. The figures include warriors, chariots and horses. Current (2007) estimates are that in the three pits containing the Terracotta Army there were more than 8,000 soldiers, 130 chariots with 520 horses, and 150 cavalry horses, the majority of which are still buried in the pits nearby Qin Shi Huang's mausoleum.Jane Portal and Qingbo Duan, The First Emperor: China's Terracotta Army, British Museum Press, 2007, p. 167 Other terracotta non-military figures were also found in other pits and they include officials, acrobats, strongmen, and musicians.

==Background==

[tpl]j|The Terracotta Army[/tpl] was discovered on 29 March 1974[tpl]cite book|last=Agnew|first=Neville|title=Conservation of Ancient Sites on the Silk Road|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=n8YAyXzJE2IC&pg=PA214|accessdate=11 July 2012|date=2010-08-03|publisher=Getty Publications|isbn=9781606060131|page=214[/tpl] to the east of Xi'an in Shaanxi province by a group of farmers  digging a water well approximately [tpl]convert|1.6|km[/tpl] east of the Qin Emperor's tomb mound at Mount Li (Lishan),[tpl]cite web|url=http://science.nationalgeographic.com/science/archaeology/emperor-qin/|title=Emperor Qin's Terracotta Army|author=O.

For centuries, there had been occasional reports of pieces of terracotta figures and fragments of the Qin necropolis {–}roofing tiles, bricks, and chunks of masonry having been dug up in the area.Clements, Jonathan (2006). The First Emperor of China. Sutton Publishing. ISBN 0-7509-3959-1. pp. 155, 157, 158, 160–161, 166.  This most recent discovery prompted Chinese archaeologists to investigate, and they unearthed the largest pottery figurine group ever found in China.
In addition to the warriors, an entire necropolis built for the emperor also has been found surrounding the first emperor's tomb mound. The earthen tomb mound is located at the foot of Mount Li and built in a pyramid shape [tpl]cite web|author=73号 Qin Ling Bei Lu |url=http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&source=embed&hl=en&geocode=&q=34.38130,+109.25365&aq=&sll=53.800651,-4.064941&sspn=14.588871,37.265625&ie=UTF8&t=h&ll=34.381864,109.254398&spn=0.004967,0.009098&z=16 |title=Google maps |publisher=Maps.google.co.uk |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2011-12-03[/tpl] with Qin Shi Huang’s necropolis complex constructed as a microcosm of his imperial palace or compound. It consists of several offices, halls, stables, and other structures placed around the tomb mound, which is surrounded by two solidly built rammed earth walls with gateway entrances. Up to [tpl]convert|5|m[/tpl] of reddish, sandy soil had accumulated over the site in the two millennia following its construction, but archaeologists found evidence of earlier disturbances at the site. During the excavations near the Mount Li burial mound, archaeologists found several graves dating from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, where diggers had apparently struck terracotta fragments. These were discarded as worthless and used along with soil to back fill the excavations.Clements, Jonathan (2006). The First Emperor of China. p. 160.

===History===

According to the writings of the historian Sima Qian (145{–}90 BC), work on the mausoleum began in 246 BC soon after Emperor Qin (then aged 13) ascended the throne, while the building work later involved 700,000 workers. Geographer Li Daoyuan, writing six centuries after the death of the First Emperor, recorded in Shui Jing Zhu that Mount Li was a favoured location due to its auspicious geology: "... famed for its jade mines, its northern side was rich in gold, and its southern side rich in beautiful jade; the First Emperor, covetous of its fine reputation, therefore chose to be buried there".[tpl]Cite book | author = Clements, Jonathan | year = 2006 | title = The First Emperor of China | page = 158 | isbn = 0-7509-3959-1[/tpl]Shui Jing Zhu Chapter 19 《水经注·渭水》Original text: 秦始皇大兴厚葬，营建冢圹于骊戎之山，一名蓝田，其阴多金，其阳多美玉，始皇贪其美名，因而葬焉。  Sima Qian, in his most noted work, Shiji, finished a century after completion of the mausoleum, wrote that the First Emperor was buried with palaces, towers, officials, valuable artefacts, and wondrous objects. According to this account, there were 100 rivers with their flow simulated by mercury, and above them the ceiling was decorated with heavenly bodies below which were the features of the land. Some translations of this passage refer to "models" or "imitations," however those words were not used in the original text, which makes no mention of the terracotta army.Sima Qian –  Shiji Volume 6 《史记·秦始皇本纪》 Original text: [tpl]lang|zh-hans|始皇初即位，穿治郦山，及并天下，天下徒送诣七十余万人，穿三泉，下铜而致椁，宫观百官奇器珍怪徙臧满之。令匠作机驽矢，有所穿近者辄射之。以水银为百川江河大海，机相灌输，上具天文，下具地理。以人鱼膏为烛，度不灭者久之。二世曰："先帝后宫非有子者，出焉不宜。" 皆令从死，死者甚众。葬既已下，或言工匠为机，臧皆知之，臧重即泄。大事毕，已臧，闭中羡，下外羡门，尽闭工匠臧者，无复出者。树草木以象山。[/tpl] Translation:  When the First Emperor ascended the throne, the digging and preparation at Mount Li began. After he unified his empire, 700,000 men were sent there from all over his empire. They dug down deep to underground springs, pouring copper to place the outer casing of the coffin. Palaces and viewing towers housing a hundred officials were built and filled with treasures and rare artifacts. Workmen were instructed to make automatic crossbows primed to shoot at intruders. Mercury was used to simulate the hundred rivers, the Yangtze and Yellow River, and the great sea, and set to flow mechanically. Above, the heaven is depicted, below, the geographical features of the land. Candles were made of "mermaid"'s fat which is calculated to burn and not extinguish for a long time. The Second Emperor said: "It is inappropriate for the wives of the late emperor who have no sons to be free", ordered that they should accompany the dead, and a great many died. After the burial, it was suggested that it would be a serious breach if the craftsmen who constructed the tomb and knew of its treasure were to divulge those secrets.  Therefore after the funeral ceremonies had completed, the inner passages and doorways were blocked, and the exit sealed, immediately trapping the workers and craftsmen inside. None could escape. Trees and vegetation were then planted on the tomb mound such that it resembled a hill.Jane Portal and Qingbo Duan, The First Emperor: China's Terracotta Army, British Museum Press, 2007, p. 17
Recent scientific work at the site has found high levels of mercury in the soil of the tomb mound,The first emperor: China's Terracotta Army Scientific Studies of High Level of Mercury in Qin Shihuangdi's tomb, by Duan Qingbo giving some credence to Sima Qian's account of the emperor's tomb. The tomb appears to be a hermetically-sealed space that is as big as a football pitch and located underneath the pyramidal tomb mound.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/e-h/firstemperor4a.html |title=The First Emperor |publisher=Channel4.com |accessdate=2011-12-03[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:DP-039QAig8J:ftp://124.42.15.59/ck/2011-01/165/096/062/464/On%2520the%2520Prediction%2520of%2520Heat%2520Transfer%2520Across%2520Turbulent%2520Liquid%2520Films.pdf+3d+reconstruction+of+underground+palace+of+qin+tomb&hl=en&gl=uk&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESg0Uyt9EYlzOcxA4XPYGfq7TW0LnYcEIcuIYTgZmhVOmZ8iZAf5H9R-1IJN0SrEck4vRM60ZDAv0XbQ4dbqoASdO7bbLhZzYEGTKa607_9Sh6bCIFkEX_pirIG1BthOknVjKOe0&sig=AHIEtbQA1PhVFoMbOjCMjxcO_CUt_rYkDg |title=Application of geographical methods to explore the underground palace of the Emperor Qin Shi Huang Mausoleum |publisher=Google  |accessdate=2011-12-03[/tpl] It remains unopened, one possible reason may be concerns about the preservation of valuable artifacts once the tomb is opened. For example, after their excavation, the painted surface present on some figures of the terracotta army began to flake and fade.[tpl]cite web|author=Nature |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2003/031127/full/news031124-7.html |title=Terracotta Army saved from crack up |publisher=Nature.com |accessdate=2011-12-03[/tpl] In fact, the lacquer covering the paint can curl in fifteen seconds once exposed to the dry air of Xi'an and can flake off in just four minutes.Larmer, Brook. "Terra-Cotta Warriors in Color." National Geographic June 2012: 86. Print Later historical accounts suggested that the tomb had been looted by Xiang Yu, a contender for the throne after the death of the first emperor,Shui Jing Zhu Chapter 19 《水经注·渭水》 Original text: 项羽入关，发之，以三十万人，三十日运物不能穷。关东盗贼，销椁取铜。牧人寻羊，烧之，火延九十日，不能灭。Translation Xiang Yu entered the gate, sent forth 300,000 men, but they could not finish carrying away his loot in 30 days. Thieves from northeast melted the coffin and took its copper. A shepherd looking for his lost sheep burned the place, the fire lasted 90 days and could not be extinguished.Sima Qian – Shiji Volume 8 《史记·高祖本纪》 Original text:  项羽烧秦宫室，掘始皇帝冢，私收其财物 Translation Xiang Yu burned the Qin palaces, dug up the First Emperor's tomb, and expropriated his possessions.Han Shu《汉书·楚元王传》：Original text: "项籍焚其宫室营宇，往者咸见发掘，其后牧儿亡羊，羊入其凿，牧者持火照球羊，失火烧其藏椁。" Translation: Xiang burned the palaces and buildings. Later observers witnessed the excavated site. Afterward a shepherd lost his sheep which went into the dug tunnel; the shepherd held a torch to look for his sheep, and accidentally set fire to the place and burned the coffin. however, there are indications that the tomb may not have been plundered.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4359774.stm |title=Royal Chinese treasure discovered |publisher=BBC News  |date=2005-10-20|accessdate=2011-12-03[/tpl]
Only a section of the site is currently excavated, while photographs and video recordings are prohibited in some viewing areas. Only a few foreign dignitaries, including Britain's monarch Elizabeth II, have been permitted to walk through the pits to observe the army at close quarters.  There also is speculation of a possible Hellenistic link to these sculptures, due to the lack of life-sized and realistic sculptures prior to the Qin Dynasty according to some scholars.Early links with West likely inspiration for Terracotta Warriors, argues SOAS scholar, School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), University of LondonLukas Nickel, The First Emperor and sculpture in China, SOAS, University of London, Cambridge University Press, 2013

===Construction of the Terracotta Army===

The terracotta army figures were manufactured in workshops by government laborers and local craftsmen using materials originated on Mount Li. Heads, arms, legs, and torsos were all created separately and then assembled.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.upf.edu/materials/huma/central/abast/ledder.htm |title=A Magic Army for the Emperor |publisher=Upf.edu |date=1979-10-01 |accessdate=2011-12-03[/tpl] Studies show that a total of eight face moulds were most likely used, with clay then added to provide individual facial features after assembly.Jane Portal and Qingdao Dan, The First Emperor: China's Terracotta Arm, British Museum Press, 2007, p. 170 It is believed that the warriors' legs were made in much the same way that terracotta drainage pipes were manufactured at the time. This would classify the process as assembly line production, with specific parts manufactured and assembled after being fired, as opposed to crafting one solid piece and subsequently firing it. In those times of tight imperial control, each workshop was required to inscribe its name on items produced to ensure quality control. This has aided modern historians in verifying which workshops were commandeered to make tiles and other mundane items for the terracotta army. Upon completion, the terracotta figures were placed in the pits in precise military formation according to rank and duty.
The terracotta figures are life-sized. They vary in height, uniform, and hairstyle in accordance with rank.  Most originally held real weapons such as spears, swords, or crossbows. Originally, the figures were  also painted with bright pigments, variously coloured pink, red, green, blue, black, brown, white, and lilac.[tpl]cite web|author=John Simpson, Greg Hurst 3 December 2011 12:01 am |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article2414695.ece |title=Terracotta soldier – in full colour |work=The Times |location=UK |accessdate=2011-12-03[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2010-09/09/content_11278335.htm |title=Terracotta army emerges in its true colors |work=China Daily  |accessdate=2011-12-03[/tpl] The coloured lacquer finish, individual facial features, and weapons used in producing these figures created a realistic appearance.  Most of the original weapons were thought to have been looted shortly after the creation of the army, or have rotted away, while the colour coating has flaked off or greatly faded.

===Pits===

There are four main pits approximately [tpl]convert|7|m[/tpl] deep associated with the terracotta army.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.history.ucsb.edu/faculty/barbierilow/Courses/fall%20of%20qin%20and%20tomb/player.html |title=The Necropolis of First Emperor of Qin |publisher=History.ucsb.edu |accessdate=2011-12-03[/tpl] These are located approximately [tpl]convert|1.5|km[/tpl] east of the burial mound with the soldiers within laid out as if to protect the tomb from the east, where all the Qin Emperor's conquered states lay. Pit one, which is [tpl]convert|230|m[/tpl] long and [tpl]convert|62|m[/tpl] wide,A Magic Army for the Emperor Lothar Ledderose contains the main army of more than 6,000 figures.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/kuaixun/74862.htm |title=The Mausoleum of the First Emperor of the Qin Dynasty and Terracotta Warriors and Horses |publisher=China.org.cn |date=2003-09-12 |accessdate=2011-12-03[/tpl] Pit one has 11 corridors, most of which are more than [tpl]convert|3|m[/tpl] wide and paved with small bricks with a wooden ceiling supported by large beams and posts. This design was also used for the tombs of nobles and would have resembled palace hallways when built. The wooden ceilings were covered with reed mats and layers of clay for waterproofing, and then mounded with more soil raising them about [tpl]convert|2|to|3|m[/tpl] above the surrounding ground level when completed.Jane Portal and Qingdao Dyan, The First Emperor: China's Terracotta Arm, British Museum Press, 2007, pp. 260–167 Pit two has cavalry and infantry units as well as war chariots and is thought to represent a military guard. Pit three is the command post, with high-ranking officers and a war chariot. Pit four is empty, perhaps left unfinished by its builders.
Some of the figures in pit one and two show fire damage while remains of burnt ceiling rafters have also been found.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8676886.stm |title=China unearths 114 new Terracotta Warriors |publisher=BBC News  |date=2010-05-12|accessdate=2011-12-03[/tpl]Terra Cotta Warriors[tpl]dead link|date=December 2011[/tpl] These, together with the missing weapons, have been taken as evidence of the reported looting by Xiang Yu and the subsequent burning of the site, which is thought to have caused the roof to collapse and crush the army figures below. The terracotta figures currently on display have been restored from the fragments.
A large number of other pits that formed the necropolis also have been excavated.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.travelchinaguide.com/cityguides/xian/terracotta/pits.htm |title=Terracotta Accessory Pits |publisher=Travelchinaguide.com |date=2009-10-10 |accessdate=2011-12-03[/tpl] These pits may lie within or outside the walls surrounding the tomb mound. They variously contain bronze carriages, terracotta figures of entertainers such as acrobats and strongmen, officials, stone armour suits, burials sites of horses, rare animals, and labourers, as well as bronze cranes and ducks set in an underground park.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/m/daminggong/2010-05/13/content_9845517_3.htm |title=Decoding the Mausoleum of Emperor Qin Shihuang |work=China Daily  |date=2010-05-13- |accessdate=2011-12-03[/tpl]

===Weaponry===

Weapons such as swords, spears, battle-axes, scimitars, shields, crossbows, and arrowheads were found at the pits of the terracotta warriors.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.travelchinaguide.com/attraction/shaanxi/xian/terra_cotta_army/weapon_1.htm |title=Exquisite Weaponry of Terra Cotta Army |publisher=Travelchinaguide.com |accessdate=2011-12-03[/tpl] Some of these weapons, such as the swords are still very sharp and found to be coated with chromium oxide. This layer of chromium oxide is 10–15 micrometre thick and has kept the swords rust-free and in pristine condition after 2,000 years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chinatourguide.com/xian/terracotta_warriors_details.html#Unearthed Bronze Weapons|title=Terracotta Warriors (Terracotta Army)|publisher=China Tour Guide|accessdate=2011-07-28[/tpl]Cotterell, Maurice.

An important element of the army is the chariot, and four types of chariots were found. In battle the fighting chariots form pairs at the head of a unit of infantry. The principal weapon of the charioteers was the ge or dagger-axe, an L-shaped bronze blade mounted on a long shaft used for sweeping and hooking at the enemy. Infantrymen also carried ge on shorter shafts, ji or halberds, and spears and lances. For close fighting and defence, both charioteers and infantrymen carried double-edged straight swords. The archers carried crossbows, with sophisticated trigger mechanisms, capable of firing arrows farther than 800 meters.
