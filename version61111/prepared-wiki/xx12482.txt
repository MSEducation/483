Early in 1896, just a few weeks after [[Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen|Röntgen]] published his first X-ray photograph, Pulyui published high-quality X-ray images in journals in Paris and London.<ref name=mayo/> Although Pulyui had studied with Röntgen at the [[University of Strasbourg]] in the years 1873–75, his biographer Gaida (1997) asserts that his subsequent research was conducted independently.<ref name=mayo/>
X-rays were generated and detected by Fernando Sanford (1854–1948), the foundation Professor of Physics at Stanford University, in 1891. From 1886 to 1888 he had studied in the Hermann Helmholtz laboratory in Berlin, where he became familiar with the cathode rays generated in vacuum tubes when a voltage was applied across separate electrodes, as previously studied by Heinrich Hertz and Philipp Lenard. His letter of January 6, 1893 (describing his discovery as "electric photography") to The Physical Review was duly published and an article entitled Without Lens or Light, Photographs Taken With Plate and Object in Darkness appeared in the San Francisco Examiner.[tpl]cite journal |last= Wyman|first=Thomas |date=Spring 2005 |title=Fernando Sanford and the Discovery of X-rays |journal= "Imprint", from the Associates of the Stanford University Libraries |pages=5–15[/tpl]
Starting in 1888, Philipp Lenard, a student of Heinrich Hertz, conducted experiments to see whether cathode rays could pass out of the Crookes tube into the air. He built a Crookes tube (later called a "Lenard tube") with a "window" in the end made of thin aluminum, facing the cathode so the cathode rays would strike it. He found that something came through, that would expose photographic plates and cause fluorescence. He measured the penetrating power of these rays through various materials. It has been suggested that at least some of these "Lenard rays" were actually X-rays.Thomson, 1903, p.185
Hermann von Helmholtz formulated mathematical equations for X-rays. He postulated a dispersion theory before Röntgen made his discovery and announcement. It was formed on the basis of the electromagnetic theory of light.Wiedmann's Annalen, Vol. XLVIII However, he did not work with actual X-rays.
In 1894 the Serbian-American engineer and inventor Nikola Tesla noticed damaged film in his lab that seemed to be associated with Crookes tube experiments and began investigating this radiant energy of "invisible" kindsMaja Hrabak et al., "Nikola Tesla and the Discovery of X-rays," in RadioGraphics, vol. 28, July 2008, 1189–92.

===Wilhelm Röntgen===

On November 8, 1895, German physics professor Wilhelm Röntgen stumbled on X-rays while experimenting with Lenard and Crookes tubes and began studying them. He wrote an initial report "On a new kind of ray: A preliminary communication" and on December 28, 1895 submitted it to the Würzburg's Physical-Medical Society journal.[ref]
 see also pp. 268 and 276 of the same issue.[/ref] This was the first paper written on X-rays. Röntgen referred to the radiation as "X", to indicate that it was an unknown type of radiation. The name stuck, although (over Röntgen's great objections) many of his colleagues suggested calling them Röntgen rays. They are still referred to as such in many languages, including German, Danish, Polish, Swedish, Finnish, Estonian, Russian, Japanese, Dutch, and Norwegian. Röntgen received the first Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/articles/karlsson/|title=The Nobel Prizes in Physics 1901–2000|last=Karlsson|first=Erik B.|date=9 February 2000|publisher=The Nobel Foundation|accessdate=24 November 2011|location=Stockholm[/tpl]
There are conflicting accounts of his discovery because Röntgen had his lab notes burned after his death, but this is a likely reconstruction by his biographers:[tpl]cite web|first=Peter|last=Peters|year=1995|title=W.
