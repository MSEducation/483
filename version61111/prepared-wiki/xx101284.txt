[[Natachata]]

CATEGORIES: Artificial intelligence applications

Natachata is a sexbot used to simulate smutty conversations via text messages  
with paying subscribers, fooling them into believing that she is human. Written by former rocket scientist Simon Luttrell, Natachata is widely used by porn chat merchants. Natachata can handle 15 messages per second at Â£1 for each SMS text message in the UK. 
Natachata operates by comparing incoming messages with a database of 100,000 sentences and then concocts a reply based on what it received. It then transcribes the message into slang, adds spelling mistakes and, after a random delay, sends a reply. Most users of such systems would be surprised to learn that they are not conversing with a human.[tpl]cite web|last=Ward |first=Mark |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/3503465.stm |title=UK | Magazine | Has text-porn finally made computers 'human'? |publisher=BBC News |date=2004-02-20 |accessdate=2011-12-18[/tpl]
