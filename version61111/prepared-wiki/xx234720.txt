In the 1966 Belgian Eurovision selection, Tonia performed four songs and the winner, "Un peu de poivre, un peu de sel" ("A Little Pepper, A Little Salt"), was chosen by postcard voting as the representative for the 11th Eurovision Song Contest which took place on 5 March in Luxembourg City.Eurovision Song Contest national finals database - 1966  "Un peu de poivre, un peu de sel" finished in fourth place of 18 entries, Belgium's highest placing in Eurovision to that date, which would not be bettered until 1978."Un peu de poivre, un peu de sel" at diggiloo.net  In 1968, Tonia again participated in the Belgian selection with the song "Il y avait", but failed to place in the top two.Eurovision Song Contest national finals database - 1968
