Solon gave voice to Athenian 'nationalism', particularly in the city state's struggle with Megara, its neighbour and rival in the Saronic Gulf. Plutarch professes admiration of Solon's elegy urging Athenians to recapture the island of Salamis from Megarian control.Plutarch Solon 8 s:Lives (Dryden translation)/Solon#8 The same poem was said by Diogenes Laërtius to have stirred Athenians more than any other verses that Solon wrote:
 
     Let us go to Salamis to fight for the island<br>
    We desire, and drive away our bitter shame! <ref>
Solon, quoted in Diogenes Laërtius 1.47[/ref]

 
It is possible that Solon  backed up this poetic bravado with true valour on the battlefield.Plutarch Solon 9 s:Lives (Dryden translation)/Solon#9

==Solon and Athenian sexuality==

As a regulator of Athenian society, Solon, according to some authors, also formalized its sexual mores. According to a surviving fragment from a work ("Brothers") by the comic playwright Philemon,Fr. 4 Solon established publicly funded brothels at Athens in order to "democratize" the availability of sexual pleasure.Rachel Adams, David Savran, The Masculinity Studies Reader; Blackwell, 2002; p.74 While the veracity of this comic account is open to doubt, at least one modern author considers it significant that in Classical Athens, three hundred or so years after the death of Solon, there existed a discourse that associated his reforms with an increased availability of heterosexual pleasure.One Hundred Years of Homosexuality: And Other Essays on Greek Love,'' p.101
Ancient authors also say that Solon regulated pederastic relationships in Athens; this has been presented as an adaptation of custom to the new structure of the polis.Bernard Sergent, "Paederasty and Political Life in Archaic Greek Cities" in Gay Studies from the French Culture; Harrington Park Press, Binghamton, NY 1993; pp.153-154Eros and Greek Athletics By Thomas Francis Scanlon, p.213 "So it is clear that Solon was responsible for institutionalizing pederasty to some extent at Athens in the early sixth century." According to various authors, ancient lawgivers (and therefore Solon by implication) drew up a set of laws that were intended to promote and safeguard the institution of pederasty and to control abuses against freeborn boys. In particular, the orator Aeschines cites laws excluding slaves from wrestling halls and forbidding them to enter pederastic relationships with the sons of citizens.Aeschines, Against Timarchus 6, 25, 26 http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/pwh/aeschines.html; compare also Plutarch, Solon 1.3. Accounts of Solon's laws by 4th Century orators like Aeschines, however, are considered unreliable for a number of reasons;Kevin Robb, Literacy and Paideia in Ancient Greece, Ox. Uni.Press, 1994; p128,P.J.Rhodes, The Reforms and Laws of Solon: an Optimistic View, in 'Solon of Athens: new historical and philological approaches', eds. J.Blok and A.Lardinois (Brill, Leiden 2006)
 Attic pleaders did not hesitate to attribute to him (Solon) any law which suited their case, and later writers had no criterion by which to distinguish earlier from later works. Nor can any complete and authentic collection of his statutes have survived for ancient scholars to consult.Kevin Robb, Literacy and Paideia in Ancient Greece, Ox.Uni.Press 1994; p128 (quoting F.E.Adcock) 
Besides the alleged legislative aspect of Solon's involvement with pederasty, there were also suggestions of personal involvement. According to some ancient authors Solon had taken the future tyrant Peisistratus as his eromenos. Aristotle, writing around 330 BC, attempted to refute that belief, claiming that "those are manifestly talking nonsense who pretend that Solon was the lover of Peisistratus, for their ages do not admit of it," as Solon was about thirty years older than Peisistratus.Aristotle, The Athenian Constitution, 2.17 Nevertheless the tradition persisted. Four centuries later Plutarch ignored Aristotle's skepticismHomosexuality & Civilization By Louis Crompton, p.25 and recorded the following anecdote, supplemented with his own conjectures:
 And they say Solon loved Peisistratus; and that is the reason, I suppose, that when afterwards they differed about the government, their enmity never produced any hot and violent passion, they remembered their old kindnesses, and retained "Still in its embers living the strong fire" of their love and dear affection.Plutarch, The Lives "Solon" Tr. John Dryden s:Lives (Dryden translation)/Solon 
A century after Plutarch, Aelian also said that Peisistratus had been Solon's eromenos. Despite its persistence, however, it is not known whether the account is historical or fabricated. It has been suggested that the tradition presenting a peaceful and happy coexistence between Solon and Peisistratus was cultivated during the latter's dominion, in order to legitimize his own rule, as well as that of his sons. Whatever its source, later generations lent credence to the narrative.Solon and Early Greek Poetry By Elizabeth Irwin p.272 n.24 Solon's presumed pederastic desire was thought in antiquity to have found expression also in his poetry, which is today represented only in a few surviving fragments.Ancient Greece By Matthew Dillon, Lynda Garland, p.475Nick Fisher, Against Timarchos, Oxford 2001; p.37  The authenticity of all the poetic fragments attributed to Solon is however uncertain - in particular, pederastic aphorisms ascribed by some ancient sources to Solon have been ascribed by other sources to Theognis instead.
