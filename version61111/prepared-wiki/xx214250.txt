[[Gardner color scale]]

CATEGORIES: Color, Scales

Gardner Color Scale is a one-dimensional scale to measure the shade of the color yellow.

==History==

Colors of transparent liquids have been studied visually since the early 19th century.  Changes in color can indicate contamination or impurities in the raw materials, process variations, or degradation of products over time.
One dimensional scales for yellowness were created, e.g., Gardner Color Scale.  The yellowness of the transparent liquid is determined by pouring the sample into a tube and comparing it to a pre determined and known standard.  The standard that the sample falls closest to then becomes the value for the liquid.  This procedure isn't extremely accurate due to variations of observers, illumination and to some extent the standards themselves.ASTM Paint and Coatings testing manual ISBN 0-8031-2060-5
