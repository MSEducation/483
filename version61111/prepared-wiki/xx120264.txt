The band recorded a demo version of the song that was released as a part of the 2005 Holiday single available to fan club members. Vedder on the song:
 were in Atlantic City and I wanted to play a song the next night. I went to learn it and it didn't come right away, so I started playing something else, and it was "Gone". What's nice about it was that it was done in an hour or so, with backgrounds. I played it the next night at the show.Cohen, Jonathan. "The 'Pearls' of Pearl Jam". Billboard. April 14, 2006. 

==Lyrics==

"Gone" is about leaving everything behind and moving along. The song brings into perspective perceptions that all is not lost if one chooses to incorporate change. When the song was performed on VH1 Storytellers in 2006, Vedder introduced it as "a car song.""Pearl Jam Concert Chronology: 2006". TwoFeetThick.com. In an interview Vedder stated:  The idea was that this guy was leaving Atlantic City and needing to find a new life without his past, without his possessions, and not really looking for more possessions. Because it takes place in a car, it's probably very similar to "Rearviewmirror" in a way. But I think this car is a hybrid, because I think he's only got one tank of gas, so I want him to go far. 
The line "nothing is everything" was taken from the song "Let's See Action" from the 1972 Pete Townshend solo album, Who Came First. Vedder thanks Townshend in the liner notes for the album.
