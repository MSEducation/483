L-Monoamine oxidases (MAO) ([tpl]EC number|1.4.3.4[/tpl]) are a family of enzymes that catalyze the oxidation of monoamines.[tpl]cite journal | author = Tipton KF, Boyce S, O'Sullivan J, Davey GP, Healy J | title = Monoamine oxidases: certainties and uncertainties | journal = Curr.

==Subtypes and tissue distribution==

In humans there are two types of MAO: MAO-A and MAO-B.[tpl]cite journal | author = Shih JC, Chen K | title = Regulation of MAO-A and MAO-B gene expression | journal = Curr. Med. Chem. | volume = 11 | issue = 15 | pages = 1995–2005 |date=August 2004 | pmid = 15279563 | doi =10.2174/0929867043364757  [/tpl]

==Function==

Monoamine oxidases catalyze the oxidative deamination of monoamines. Oxygen is used to remove an amine group from a molecule, resulting in the corresponding aldehyde and ammonia.
Monoamine oxidases contain the covalently bound cofactor FAD and are, thus, classified as flavoproteins.

==Substrate specificities==

They are well known enzymes in pharmacology, since they are the substrate for the action of a number of monoamine oxidase inhibitor drugs.  MAO-A is particularly important in the catabolism of monoamines ingested in food. Both MAOs are also vital to the inactivation of monoaminergic neurotransmitters, for which they display different specificities.
Specific reactions catalyzed by MAO include:

==Clinical significance==

Because of the vital role that MAOs play in the inactivation of neurotransmitters, MAO dysfunction (too much or too little MAO activity) is thought to be responsible for a number of psychiatric and neurological disorders. For example, unusually high or low levels of MAOs in the body have been associated with schizophrenia,[tpl]cite journal | author = Domino EF, Khanna SS | title = Decreased blood platelet MAO activity in unmedicated chronic schizophrenic patients | journal = Am J Psychiatry | volume = 133 | issue = 3 | pages = 323–6 |date=March 1976 | pmid = 943955 | doi = [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Schildkraut JJ, Herzog JM, Orsulak PJ, Edelman SE, Shein HM, Frazier SH | title = Reduced platelet monoamine oxidase activity in a subgroup of schizophrenic patients | journal = Am J Psychiatry | volume = 133 | issue = 4 | pages = 438–40 |date=April 1976 | pmid = 1267046 | doi = [/tpl]  depression,[tpl]cite journal | author = Meyer JH, Ginovart N, Boovariwala A, Sagrati S, Hussey D, Garcia A, Young T, Praschak-Rieder N, Wilson AA, Houle S | title = Elevated monoamine oxidase a levels in the brain: an explanation for the monoamine imbalance of major depression | journal = Arch.

Excessive levels of catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine) may lead to a hypertensive crisis, and excessive levels of serotonin may lead to serotonin syndrome.
In fact, MAO-A inhibitors act as antidepressant and antianxiety agents, whereas MAO-B inhibitors are used alone or in combination to treat Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases.[tpl]cite journal | author = Riederer P, Lachenmayer L, Laux G | title = Clinical applications of MAO-inhibitors | journal = Curr.

==Genetics==

The genes encoding MAO-A and MAO-B are located side-by-side on the short arm of the X chromosome, and have about 70% sequence similarity. Rare mutations in the gene are associated with Brunner syndrome.
A study based on the Dunedin cohort concluded that maltreated children with a low-activity polymorphism in the promoter region of the MAO-A gene were more likely to develop antisocial conduct disorders than maltreated children with the high-activity variant.[tpl]cite journal | author = Caspi A, McClay J, Moffitt TE, Mill J, Martin J, Craig IW, Taylor A, Poulton R | title = Role of genotype in the cycle of violence in maltreated children | journal = Science | volume = 297 | issue = 5582 | pages = 851–4 |date=August 2002 | pmid = 12161658 | doi = 10.1126/science.1072290 [/tpl] Out of the 442 total males in the study (maltreated or not), 37% had the low activity variant. Of the 13 maltreated males with low MAO-A activity, 11 had been assessed as exhibiting adolescent conduct disorder and 4 were convicted for violent offenses. The suggested mechanism for this effect is the decreased ability of those with low MAO-A activity to quickly degrade norepinephrine, the synaptic neurotransmitter involved in sympathetic arousal and rage. This is alleged to provide direct support for the idea that genetic susceptibility to disease is not determined at birth, but varies with exposure to environmental influences. However, most individuals with conduct disorder or convictions did not have low activity of MAO-A; maltreatment was found to have caused stronger predisposition for antisocial behavior than differences in MAO-A activity.
The claim that an interaction between low MAO-A activity and maltreatment would cause anti-social behavior has been criticized since the predisposition towards anti-social behavior could equally well have been caused by other genes inherited from abusive parents.[tpl]cite book | author =  Sesardic, Neven | title = Making sense of heritability | edition = | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, UK | year = 2005 | pages = | quote = | isbn = 0-521-82818-X [/tpl]

A particular variant (or genotype), dubbed "warrior gene" in the popular press, was over-represented in Māori. This supported earlier studies finding different proportions of variants in different ethnic groups. This is the case for many genetic variants, with 33% White/Non-Hispanic, 61% Asian/Pacific Islanders having the low-activity MAO-A promoter variant.[tpl]cite journal | author = Sabol SZ, Hu S, Hamer D | title = A functional polymorphism in the monoamine oxidase A gene promoter | journal = Hum.
