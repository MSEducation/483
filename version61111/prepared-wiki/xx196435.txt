The song was written by the songwriting team of Isaac Hayes and David Porter, who came up with the title of the song spontaneously when Hayes was trying to get Porter to hurry out of the Stax Studios restroom and get back to songwriting. Released as Stax 189 in the spring of 1966, the single peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot Black Singles chart, and at number 21 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States.Hogan, Ed (2006).

A revamped version of the song, "Hold On, Edwin's Coming", was recorded by Sam & Dave as a promotional single for Louisiana Governor Edwin Edwards' third election campaign in 1982. Three years later, Dave Prater teamed with new singing partner Sam Daniels as "The New Sam and Dave Review", and recorded "Medley/Hold On, I'm Comin'" for Atlantic Records.
