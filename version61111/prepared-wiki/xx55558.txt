==Secretagogues==

These are the drugs that increase Insulin output from Pancreas.

===Sulfonylureas===

Sulfonylureas were the first widely used oral anti-hyperglycaemic medications.  They are insulin secretagogues, triggering insulin release by inhibiting the KATP channel of the pancreatic beta cells.  Eight types of these pills have been marketed in North America, but not all remain available.  The "second-generation" drugs are now more commonly used.  They are more effective than first-generation drugs and have fewer side-effects.  All may cause weight gain. A 2012 study found sulfonylureas raise the risk of death compared with metformin.
Sulfonylureas bind strongly to plasma proteins. Sulfonylureas are useful only in Type II diabetes, as they work by stimulating endogenous release of insulin.  They work best with patients over 40 years old who have had diabetes mellitus for under ten years.  They cannot be used with type I diabetes, or diabetes of pregnancy.  They can be safely used with metformin or -glitazones.  The primary side-effect is hypoglycemia.
Typical reductions in glycated hemoglobin (A1C) values for second-generation sulfonylureas are 1.0–2.0%.

===Nonsulfonylurea secretagogues===

====Meglitinides====

Meglitinides help the pancreas produce insulin and are often called "short-acting secretagogues." They act on the same potassium channels as sulfonylureas, but at a different binding site.[tpl]cite journal |pmid=15647714 |pmc=1474831 |year=2004 |author1=Rendell |title=Advances in diabetes for the millennium: drug therapy of type 2 diabetes |volume=6 |issue=3 Suppl |pages=9 |journal=MedGenMed : Medscape general medicine[/tpl] By closing the potassium channels of the pancreatic beta cells, they open the calcium channels, thereby enhancing insulin secretion.
They are taken with or shortly before meals to boost the insulin response to each meal. If a meal is skipped, the medication is also skipped.
Typical reductions in glycated hemoglobin (A1C) values are 0.5–1.0%.
Adverse reactions include weight gain and hypoglycemia.

==Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors==

Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors are "diabetes pills" but not technically hypoglycemic agents because they do not have a direct effect on insulin secretion or sensitivity. These agents slow the digestion of starch in the small intestine, so that glucose from the starch of a meal enters the bloodstream more slowly, and can be matched more effectively by an impaired insulin response or sensitivity.  These agents are effective by themselves only in the earliest stages of impaired glucose tolerance, but can be helpful in combination with other agents in type 2 diabetes.
Typical reductions in glycated hemoglobin (A1C) values are 0.5–1.0%.
These medications are rarely used in the United States because of the severity of their side-effects (flatulence and bloating).  They are more commonly prescribed in Europe.  They do have the potential to cause weight loss by lowering the amount of sugar metabolized.
Research has shown that the culinary mushroom maitake (Grifola frondosa) has a hypoglycemic effect,[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1464-5491.2001.00532-5.x |pmid=11903406 |year=2001 |author1=Konno |first2=DG |first3=SA |first4=AA |first5=J |first6=H |title=A possible hypoglycaemic effect of maitake mushroom on type 2 diabetic patients |volume=18 |issue=12 |pages=1010 |journal=Diabetic Medicine|last2=Tortorelis |last3=Fullerton |last4=Samadi |last5=Hettiarachchi |last6=Tazaki[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1211/jpp.59.4.0013 |pmid=17430642 |year=2007 |author1=Hong |first2=M |first3=W |title=Anti-diabetic effect of an alpha-glucan from fruit body of maitake (Grifola frondosa) on KK-Ay mice |volume=59 |issue=4 |pages=575–82 |journal=The Journal of pharmacy and pharmacology |last2=Xun |last3=Wutong[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |pmid=7820117 |year=1994 |author1=Kubo |first2=H |first3=H |title=Anti-diabetic activity present in the fruit body of Grifola frondosa (Maitake).

==Peptide analogs==

===Injectable Incretin mimetics===

Incretins are insulin secretagogues.  The two main candidate molecules that fulfill criteria for being an incretin are glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and gastric inhibitory peptide (glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide, GIP). Both GLP-1 and GIP are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4).

====Injectable Glucagon-like peptide analogs and agonists====

Glucagon-like peptide (GLP) agonists bind to a membrane GLP receptor. As a consequence, insulin release from the pancreatic beta cells is increased.  Endogenous GLP has a half-life of only a few minutes, thus an analogue of GLP would not be practical.
These agents may also cause a decrease in gastric motility, responsible for the common side-effect of nausea, and is probably the mechanism by which weight loss occurs.

====Gastric inhibitory peptide analogs====

====Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 Inhibitors====

GLP-1 analogs resulted in weight loss and had more gastrointestinal side-effects, while in general DPP-4 inhibitors were weight-neutral and increased risk for infection and headache, but both classes appear to present an alternative to other antidiabetic drugs. However, weight gain and/or hypoglycaemia have been observed when DPP-4 inhibitors were used with sulfonylureas; effect on long-term health and morbidity rates are still unknown.[tpl]Cite journal|author=National Prescribing Service |journal=RADAR |title=Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors ('gliptins') for type 2 diabetes mellitus |date=August 1, 2010 |url=http://www.nps.org.au/health_professionals/publications/nps_radar/2008/august_2008/gliptins[/tpl]
Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors increase blood concentration of the incretin GLP-1 by inhibiting its degradation by dipeptidyl peptidase-4.
Examples are:

===Injectable Amylin analogues===

Amylin agonist analogues slow gastric emptying and suppress glucagon. They have all the incretins actions except stimulation of insulin secretion. [tpl]As of|2007[/tpl], pramlintide is the only clinically available amylin analogue. Like insulin, it is administered by subcutaneous injection. The most frequent and severe adverse effect of pramlintide is nausea, which occurs mostly at the beginning of treatment and gradually reduces. Typical reductions in A1C values are 0.5–1.0%.

==Glycosurics==

SGLT-2 inhibitors block the re-uptake of glucose in the renal tubules, promoting loss of glucose in the urine. This causes both mild weight loss, and a mild reduction in blood sugar levels with little risk of hypoglycaemia.[tpl]cite journal|last=Dietrich|first=E|author2=Powell, J|author3=Taylor, JR|title=Canagliflozin: a novel treatment option for type 2 diabetes.|journal=Drug Design, Development and Therapy|date=November 2013|volume=22|issue=7|pages=1399–1408|pmid=24285921|doi=10.2147/DDDT.S48937 [/tpl] Urinary tract infection is a common side effect.
