The dam is 34 kilometers north of Kandahar City and is operated by the Helmand and Arghandab Valley Authority.
The dam was first built between 1950 to 1952 during the reign of Zahir Shah, the last King of Afghanistan.
The contractor for the project was Morrison-Knudsen Afghanistan Incorporated.https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&mode=form&tab=core&id=c7152e5eb3ecc00e169e31c723038a9b
The dam is being rehabilitated with Canadian Forces assistance.  When the project is finished it is hoped that it will double the amount of irrigated land in the Arghandab River basin.
