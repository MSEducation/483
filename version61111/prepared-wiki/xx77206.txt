[[List of aircraft engines of Germany during World War II]]

CATEGORIES: World War II aircraft of Germany, Lists of aircraft engines

This is a list of all German motors including all aircraft engines, rocket motors, jets and any other powerplants, along with a very basic description.  It includes experimental engines as well as those that made it to production status.
The Reich Air Ministry used an internal designation system that included a number signifying the engine type, 9 for piston engines and 109 for jets and rockets, followed by a manufacturer's code. Each company was assigned a block of numbers for their designs:
Using this system the famous BMW engine used in the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 would be known as the 9-801. However this system was not widely used, even within the RLM, and a common name consisting of the manufacturer's name (often abbreviated) followed by the model number was much more common. The list below uses the common BMW 801 instead of the official 9-801.
Engines produced before the RLM's designation system was set up are often listed using the same basic terminology. So while the interwar Argus 10 engine can be referred to as the As 10, it is not correct to call it the 9–10, this designation was never applied.
The Luftwaffe also used engines from France, particularly the Gnôme-Rhône 14 for its Henschel Hs 129 ground attack aircraft and Messerschmitt Me 323 "Gigant" transporter.
