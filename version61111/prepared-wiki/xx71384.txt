The Southern alligator lizard (Elgaria multicarinata) is a lizard native to the Pacific coast of North America.[tpl]cite web|title=Southern Alligator Lizard|url=http://library.sandiegozoo.org/factsheets/alligator_lizard/alligatorlizard.htm|work=San Diego Zoo Factsheets|publisher=San Diego Zoo|accessdate=June 24, 2013|date=October 2008[/tpl] It is common throughout Southern California and can be found in grasslands, chaparral, and forests as well as urban areas. In dry climates, it is likely to be found in moist areas or near streams. Three subspecies can be distinguished: the California alligator lizard (E. m. multicarinata), the San Diego alligator lizard (E. m. webbii), and the Oregon alligator lizard (E. m. scincicauda).Stebbins, Robert (2003):331.

The southern alligator lizard has a long, somewhat prehensile tail, up to twice the length of its body.  Like many lizards, however, it can drop its tail if attacked, possibly giving it a chance to flee; the tail will regenerate, but will never be as long or richly colored as the original.[tpl]fact|date=June 2013[/tpl]  Individuals with intact tails can reach up to about 11in total length.[tpl]fact|date=June 2013[/tpl]
The lizards can frequently be found near human habitation and are notable for their fearless self-defense; they will often bite and defecate if handled. In the wild they eat small arthropods, slugs, lizards, small mammals and occasionally young birds and eggs.
