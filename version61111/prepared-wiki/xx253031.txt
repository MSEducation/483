Anabarilius alburnops (also known as silver minnow or silvery white fish,[tpl]cite doi |10.1007/s10641-008-9373-3[/tpl] a direct translation of its Chinese name, 银白鱼) is a species of ray-finned fish in the genus Alburnus. It is only known from Dian Lake and Songhuaba Reservoir, both in Kunming, Yunnan. It can reach sizes above [tpl]convert|31|cm|abbr=on[/tpl] SL.
The species was once common in Dian Lake, but has since 1950's dramatically declined; today, only few individuals are occasionally captured. Its decline is caused by introduced fish species, pollution, the loss of macrophytes (in part due to grass carp), over-fishing, and the loss of breeding sites. Along with many other fish species endemic to Dian Lake, it is a threatened species.
