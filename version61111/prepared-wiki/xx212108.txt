==Victims==

Authorities suspect there may have been other victims. [tpl]As of|2008[/tpl], detectives were investigating Hughes' possible involvement in other killings around the U.S. While Hughes was in the navy he spent time in Michigan, San Diego, Long Beach and  Frostburg, Maryland.

==First trial==

In December 1993, Hughes, a security guard, was arrested in Culver City. In 1998, he was convicted and given a life sentence without parole for the strangling murders of Teresa Ballard, Brenda Bradley, Terri Myles and Jamie Harrington.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2008/07/03/state/n130829D65.DTL |title=Convict appears in court in cold-case killings |last=Watkins |first=Thomas |date=2008-07-03 |work=San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate=2008-10-12 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5bWhbowo7 |archivedate=2008-10-12[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jun/28/local/me-serial28 |title=Inmate accused of murder in deaths of four women over 7-year span |last=Leonard |first=Jack |date=2008-06-28 |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=2008-10-12 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5bWoTCILL |archivedate=2008-10-12[/tpl]
Ballard, 26, was found in Los Angeles' Jesse Owens County Park on September 23, 1992. The other victims were found dumped in alleys in a Culver City commercial area: 38-year-old Bradley; Myles, 33, found on November 8, 1993; and Harrington, 29, found on November 14, 1993.

==Second trial==

On July 3, 2008, Hughes was charged with sexually assaulting and strangling two women and two teenage girls in the Los Angeles area between 1986 and 1993, after homicide detectives linked him to DNA samples from the victims using new forensic technologies. The case of Deanna Wilson, 30, who was found in a garage on August 30, 1990, was later dropped, but was used by prosecutors to establish Hughes' pattern. 
Hughes killed 15-year-old Yvonne Coleman on January 22, 1986. Her body was found in a park in Inglewood, California. The other two were killed in Los Angeles. Verna Williams, 36, was discovered in a stairwell on May 26, 1986. She was considered at the time to be a victim of the prolific, still unidentified serial killer known as the Southside Slayer. Deborah Jackson, 32, was found on June 25, 1993.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/07/03/BA0R11JS2H.DTL |title=Convicted serial killer faces more charges |last=Watkins |first=Thomas |date=2008-07-04 |work=San Francisco Chronicle |pages=B-6| accessdate=2008-10-12 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5bWfvMcmA |archivedate=2008-10-12[/tpl]
