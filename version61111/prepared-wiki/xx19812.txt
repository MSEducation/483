The ultimate energy source of the aurora is the solar wind flowing past the Earth. The magnetosphere and solar wind consist of plasma (ionized gas), which conducts electricity. It is well known (since Michael Faraday's work around 1830) that when an electrical conductor is placed within a magnetic field while relative motion occurs in a direction that the conductor cuts across (or is cut by), rather than along, the lines of the magnetic field, an electric current is said to be induced into that conductor and electrons flow within it. The amount of current flow is dependent upon a) the rate of relative motion, b) the strength of the magnetic field, c) the number of conductors ganged together and d) the distance between the conductor and the magnetic field, while the direction of flow is dependent upon the direction of relative motion. Dynamos make use of this basic process ("the dynamo effect"), any and all conductors, solid or otherwise are so affected including plasmas or other fluids.
In particular the solar wind and the magnetosphere are two electrically conducting fluids with such relative motion and should be able (in principle) to generate electric currents by "dynamo action", in the process also extracting energy from the flow of the solar wind. The process is hampered by the fact that plasmas conduct easily along magnetic field lines, but not so easily perpendicular to them. So it is important that a temporary magnetic connection be established between the field lines of the solar wind and those of the magnetosphere, by a process known as magnetic reconnection. It happens most easily with a southward slant of interplanetary field lines, because then field lines north of Earth approximately match the direction of field lines near the north magnetic pole (namely, into Earth), and similarly near the south magnetic pole. Indeed, active auroras (and related "substorms") are much more likely at such times. Electric currents originating in such way apparently give auroral electrons their energy. The magnetospheric plasma has an abundance of electrons: some are magnetically trapped, some reside in the magnetotail, and some exist in the upward extension of the ionosphere, which may extend (with diminishing density) some 25,000 km around Earth.
Bright auroras are generally associated with Birkeland currents (Schield et al., 1969;[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1029/JA074i001p00247 | last1 = Schield | first1 = M.

In between, some of the current connects directly through the ionospheric E layer (125 km); the rest ("region 2") detours, leaving again through field lines closer to the equator and closing through the "partial ring current" carried by magnetically trapped plasma. The ionosphere is an ohmic conductor, so such currents require a driving voltage, which some dynamo mechanism can supply. Electric field probes in orbit above the polar cap suggest voltages of the order of 40,000 volts, rising up to more than 200,000 volts during intense magnetic storms.
Ionospheric resistance has a complex nature, and leads to a secondary Hall current flow. By a strange twist of physics, the magnetic disturbance on the ground due to the main current almost cancels out, so most of the observed effect of auroras is due to a secondary current, the auroral electrojet. An auroral electrojet index (measured in nanotesla) is regularly derived from ground data and serves as a general measure of auroral activity.
Ohmic resistance is not the only obstacle to current flow in this circuit, however, the convergence of magnetic field lines near Earth creates a "mirror effect" that turns back most of the down-flowing electrons (where currents flow upward), inhibiting current-carrying capacity. To overcome this, part of the available voltage appears along the field line ("parallel to the field"), helping electrons overcome that obstacle by widening the bundle of trajectories reaching Earth; a similar "parallel potential" is used in "tandem mirror" plasma containment devices. A feature of such voltage is that it is concentrated near Earth (potential proportional to field intensity; Persson, 1963[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1063/1.1711018 | last1 = Persson | first1 = Hans | year = 1963 | title = Electric field along a magnetic line of force in a low-density plasma |journal = Physics of Fluids | volume = 6 | issue = 12| pages = 1756–1759 |bibcode = 1963PhFl....6.1756P [/tpl]), and indeed, as deduced by Evans (1974) and confirmed by satellites, most auroral acceleration occurs below 10,000 km. Another indicator of parallel electric fields along field lines are beams of upward flowing O+ ions observed on auroral field lines.
Some O+ ions ("conics") also seem accelerated in different ways by plasma processes associated with the aurora. These ions are accelerated by plasma waves, in directions mainly perpendicular to the field lines. They therefore start at their own "mirror points" and can travel only upward. As they do so, the "mirror effect" transforms their directions of motion, from perpendicular to the line to lying on a cone around it, which gradually narrows down.
In addition, the aurora and associated currents produce a strong radio emission around 150 kHz known as auroral kilometric radiation (AKR, discovered in 1972). Ionospheric absorption makes AKR observable from space only.
These "parallel potentials" accelerate electrons to auroral energies and seem to be a major source of aurora. Other mechanisms have also been proposed, in particular, Alfvén waves, wave modes involving the magnetic field first noted by Hannes Alfvén (1942), which have been observed in the lab and in space. The question is whether these waves might just be a different way of looking at the above process, however, because this approach does not point out a different energy source, and many plasma bulk phenomena can also be described in terms of Alfvén waves.
Other processes are also involved in the aurora, and much remains to be learned. Auroral electrons created by large geomagnetic storms often seem to have energies below 1 keV, and are stopped higher up, near 200 km. Such low energies excite mainly the red line of oxygen, so that often such auroras are red. On the other hand, positive ions also reach the ionosphere at such time, with energies of 20–30 keV, suggesting they might be an "overflow" along magnetic field lines of the copious "ring current" ions accelerated at such times, by processes different from the ones described above.

==Sources and types==

Our scientific understanding of auroras' causes is very incomplete. There are three possible main sources:
Any magnetic trapping is leaky—there always exists a bundle of directions ("loss cone") around the guiding magnetic field lines where particles are not trapped but escape. In the radiation belts of Earth, once particles on such trajectories are gone, new ones only replace them very slowly, leaving such directions nearly "empty". In the magnetotail, however, particle trajectories seem to constantly reshuffle, probably when the particles cross the very weak field near the equator. As a result, the flow of electrons in all directions is nearly the same ("isotropic"), and that assures a steady supply of leaking electrons.
The energization of such electrons comes from magnetotail processes. The leakage of negative electrons does not leave the tail positively charged, because each leaked electron lost to the atmosphere is quickly replaced by a low energy electron drawn upward from the ionosphere. Such replacement of "hot" electrons by "cold" ones is in complete accord with the 2nd law of thermodynamics.
Other types of auroras have been observed from space, e.g.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2007[/tpl] "poleward arcs" stretching sunward across the polar cap, the related "theta aurora", and "dayside arcs" near noon. These are relatively infrequent and poorly understood. There are other interesting effects such as flickering aurora, "black aurora" and subvisual red arcs. In addition to all these, a weak glow (often deep red) has been observed around the two polar cusps, the "funnels" of field lines separating the ones that close on the day side of Earth from lines swept into the tail. The cusps allow a small amount of solar wind to reach the top of the atmosphere, producing an auroral glow.

==Sounds associated with auroras==

Folktales and travelers' tales say that the aurora can generate noise such as claps, crackles, and static sounds, usually faint and brief.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/10/aurora-sounds-high-energy-particles-clapping_n_1661418.html|title=Aurora Sounds Explained: High-Energy Particles Cause 'Clapping' Noises, Meteorologists Say|date=10 July 2012|work=Huffington Post|accessdate=15 March 2013[/tpl] For a long time scientists were dubious, since sound has been hard to document, and auroral displays themselves are too high in the sky for them to be heard on the ground.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode.cfm?id=northern-lights-make-noise-too-12-07-11|title=Northern Lights Make Noise, Too|last=Mirsky|first=Steve|date=11 July 2012|work=Scientific American|accessdate=15 March 2013[/tpl] However, researchers from Aalto University in Finland published a study in 2012 saying that they recorded "clapping" sounds correlated to the visual presence of the aurora borealis, and that these sounds were produced approximately [tpl]convert|230|ft|m[/tpl] above ground.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.alaskadispatch.com/article/confirmed-aurora-borealis-makes-sounds|title=Confirmed: Aurora borealis makes sounds|last=O'Harra|first=Doug|date=10 July 2012|work=Alaska Dispatch|accessdate=15 March 2013[/tpl] They suggested that these sounds come from the solar particles associated with creating the aurora.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.aalto.fi/en/current//news/view/2012-07-09/ | title=Sounds of Northern Lights are born close to ground | publisher=Aalto University | date=9 July 2012 | accessdate=24 August 2012 | author=Unto, Laine[/tpl] The University of Alaska notes that aurora noise is so rare that hearing it is a "once in a lifetime experience", possible only during times of maximum aurora activity, on windless nights away from other noise sources.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.gi.alaska.edu/AuroraForecast/TravelersGuide|title=A Traveler’s Guide to the Aurora Borealis|last=Deehr|first=C.|year=2012|work=Geophysical Institute|publisher=University of Alaska Fairbanks|accessdate=15 March 2013[/tpl]

==Images==

Images of auroras are significantly more common today due to the rise of use of digital cameras that have high enough sensitivities.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.spaceweather.com/ |title=News and information about meteor showers, solar flares, auroras, and near-Earth asteroids |publisher=SpaceWeather.com |accessdate=5 August 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100804164127/http://spaceweather.com//| archivedate= 4 August 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Film and digital exposure to auroral displays is fraught with difficulties, particularly if faithfulness of reproduction is an objective. Due to the different spectral energy present, and changing dynamically throughout the exposure, the results are somewhat unpredictable. Different layers of the film emulsion respond differently to lower light levels, and choice of film can be very important. Longer exposures aggregate the rapidly changing energy and often blanket the dynamic attribute of a display. Higher sensitivity creates issues with graininess.
David Malin pioneered multiple exposure using multiple filters for astronomical photography, recombining the images in the laboratory to recreate the visual display more accurately.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.davidmalin.com/index.html |title=Astronomical photographs from David Malin Images |publisher=www.davidmalin.com |accessdate=3 August 2010 [/tpl] For scientific research, proxies are often used, such as ultra-violet, and re-colored to simulate the appearance to humans. Predictive techniques are also used, to indicate the extent of the display, a highly useful tool for aurora hunters.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/pmap/index.html |title=NOAA POES Auroral Activity |publisher=www.swpc.noaa.gov |accessdate=3 August 2010 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100728192250/http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/pmap/index.html| archivedate= 28 July 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Terrestrial features often find their way into aurora images, making them more accessible and more likely to be published by major websites.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.spaceweather.com/ |title=SpaceWeather.com |publisher=SpaceWeather.com |accessdate=26 July 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110717093810/http://www.spaceweather.com/| archivedate= 17 July 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl] It is possible to take excellent images with standard film (using ISO ratings between 100 and 400) and a single-lens reflex camera with full aperture, a fast lens (f1.4 50 mm, for example), and exposures between 10 and 30 seconds, depending on the aurora's display strength.Aurora image (JPG)
Early work on the imaging of the auroras was done in 1949 by the University of Saskatchewan using the SCR-270 radar.
