Ammavaru (Kannada ಅಮ್ಮಾವರು), according to a minor Hindu belief, is an ancient goddess who laid the egg that hatched Brahma, Shiva and Vishnu. In fact, "Amma" is a term meaning mother.  According to other Hindus, however, Shiva is without birth or death. Similar beliefs exist for Vishnu.She is thought to have existed before the beginning of time. 
Annually, the women of South India who believe in Ammavaru conduct a ritual prayer to the deity. A metal pot filled with rice is used to symbolize the goddess' body. The pot is clothed in a traditional sari. At the mouth of the pot, a painted coconut is used to symbolize the head. Varying implements are used to fashion the eyes, ears, and nose of the Goddess.
