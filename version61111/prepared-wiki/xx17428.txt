</ref> that a blunt shape (high drag) made the most effective heat shield. From simple engineering principles, Allen and Eggers showed that the heat load experienced by an entry vehicle was inversely proportional to the [[drag coefficient]], i.e. the greater the drag, the less the heat load. Through making the reentry vehicle blunt, air cannot "get out of the way" quickly enough, and acts as an air cushion to push the shock wave and heated shock layer forward (away from the vehicle).  Since most of the hot gases are no longer in direct contact with the vehicle, the heat energy would stay in the shocked gas and simply move around the vehicle to later dissipate into the atmosphere.
The Allen and Eggers discovery, though initially treated as a military secret, was eventually published in 1958.[tpl]cite journal |url=http://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=514520&id=2&qs=Ns%3DPublicationYear%257c1%26N%3D4294755112 |last1=Allen |first1=H.

==Entry vehicle shapes==

There are several basic shapes used in designing entry vehicles:

===Sphere or spherical section===

The simplest axisymmetric shape is the sphere or spherical section.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl]  This can either be a complete sphere or a spherical section forebody with a converging conical afterbody.  The aerodynamics of a sphere or spherical section are easy to model analytically using Newtonian impact theory.  Likewise, the spherical section's heat flux can be accurately modeled with the Fay-Riddell equation.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Fay |first1=J. A. |last2=Riddell |first2=F. R. |title=Theory of Stagnation Point Heat Transfer in Dissociated Air |journal=Journal of the Aeronautical Sciences |volume=25 |pages=73–85 |date=February 1958 |url=http://pdf.aiaa.org/downloads/TOCPDFs/36_373-386.pdf |format=PDF Reprint |accessdate=2009-06-29 |issue=2[/tpl]  The static stability of a spherical section is assured if the vehicle's center of mass is upstream from the center of curvature (dynamic stability is more problematic).  Pure spheres have no lift.  However, by flying at an angle of attack, a spherical section has modest aerodynamic lift thus providing some cross-range capability and widening its entry corridor.  In the late 1950s and early 1960s, high-speed computers were not yet available and computational fluid dynamics was still embryonic.  Because the spherical section was amenable to closed-form analysis, that geometry became the default for conservative design. Consequently, manned capsules of that era were based upon the spherical section.
Pure spherical entry vehicles were used in the early Soviet Vostok and Voskhod and in Soviet Mars and Venera descent vehicles.  The  Apollo Command/Service Module used a spherical section forebody heatshield with a converging conical afterbody.  It flew a lifting entry with a hypersonic trim angle of attack of −27° (0° is blunt-end first) to yield an average L/D (lift-to-drag ratio) of 0.368.Hillje, Ernest R., "Entry Aerodynamics at Lunar Return Conditions Obtained from the Flight of Apollo 4 (AS-501)," NASA TN D-5399, (1969).  This angle of attack was achieved by precisely offsetting the vehicle's center of mass from its axis of symmetry.  Other examples of the spherical section geometry in manned capsules are Soyuz/Zond, Gemini and Mercury. Even these small amounts of lift allow trajectories that have very significant effects on peak g-force (reducing g-force from 8-9g for a purely ballistic (slowed only by drag) trajectory to 4-5g) as well as greatly reducing the peak reentry heat.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl]

===Sphere-cone===

The sphere-cone is a spherical section with a frustum or blunted cone attached.  The sphere-cone's dynamic stability is typically better than that of a spherical section.  With a sufficiently small half-angle and properly placed center of mass, a sphere-cone can provide aerodynamic stability from Keplerian entry to surface impact.  (The "half-angle" is the angle between the cone's axis of rotational symmetry and its outer surface, and thus half the angle made by the cone's surface edges.)
The original American sphere-cone aeroshell was the Mk-2 RV (reentry vehicle), which was developed in 1955 by the General Electric Corp.  The Mk-2's design was derived from blunt-body theory and used a radiatively cooled thermal protection system (TPS) based upon a metallic heat shield (the different TPS types are later described in this article).  The Mk-2 had significant defects as a weapon delivery system, i.e., it loitered too long in the upper atmosphere due to its lower ballistic coefficient and also trailed a stream of vaporized metal making it very visible to radar.  These defects made the Mk-2 overly susceptible to anti-ballistic missile (ABM) systems.  Consequently an alternative sphere-cone RV to the Mk-2 was developed by General Electric.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl]  thumb|upright|left|Mk-6 RV, Cold War weapon and ancestor to most of NASA's entry vehiclesThis new RV was the Mk-6 which used a non-metallic ablative TPS (nylon phenolic).  This new TPS was so effective as a reentry heat shield that significantly reduced bluntness was possible.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl]  However, the Mk-6 was a huge RV with an entry mass of 3360 kg, a length of 3.1 meters and a half-angle of 12.5°.  Subsequent advances in nuclear weapon and ablative TPS design allowed RVs to become significantly smaller with a further reduced bluntness ratio compared to the Mk-6.  Since the 1960s, the sphere-cone has become the preferred geometry for modern ICBM RVs with typical half-angles being between 10° to 11°.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl]
Reconnaissance satellite RVs (recovery vehicles) also used a sphere-cone shape and were the first American example of a non-munition entry vehicle (Discoverer-I, launched on 28 February 1959).  The sphere-cone was later used for space exploration missions to other celestial bodies or for return from open space; e.g., Stardust probe.  Unlike with military RVs, the advantage of the blunt body's lower TPS mass remained with space exploration entry vehicles like the Galileo Probe with a half angle of 45° or the Viking aeroshell with a half angle of 70°. Space exploration sphere-cone entry vehicles have landed on the surface or entered the atmospheres of Mars, Venus, Jupiter and Titan.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl]

===Biconic===

The biconic is a sphere-cone with an additional frustum attached.  The biconic offers a significantly improved L/D ratio.  A biconic designed for Mars aerocapture typically has an L/D of approximately 1.0 compared to an L/D of 0.368 for the Apollo-CM.  The higher L/D makes a biconic shape better suited for transporting people to Mars due to the lower peak deceleration.  Arguably, the most significant biconic ever flown was the Advanced Maneuverable Reentry Vehicle (AMaRV).  Four AMaRVs were made by the McDonnell-Douglas Corp. and represented a significant leap in RV sophistication.  Three of the AMaRVs were launched by Minuteman-1 ICBMs on 20 December 1979, 8 October 1980 and 4 October 1981.  AMaRV had an entry mass of approximately 470 kg, a nose radius of 2.34 cm, a forward frustum half-angle of 10.4°, an inter-frustum radius of 14.6 cm, aft frustum half angle of 6°, and an axial length of 2.079 meters.  No accurate diagram or picture of AMaRV has ever appeared in the open literature.  However, a schematic sketch of an AMaRV-like vehicle along with trajectory plots showing hairpin turns has been published.Regan, Frank J. and Anadakrishnan, Satya M., "Dynamics of Atmospheric Re-Entry," AIAA Education Series, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc., New York, ISBN 1-56347-048-9, (1993).
AMaRV's attitude was controlled through a split body flap (also called a "split-windward flap") along with two yaw flaps mounted on the vehicle's sides.  Hydraulic actuation was used for controlling the flaps.  AMaRV was guided by a fully autonomous navigation system designed for evading anti-ballistic missile (ABM) interception.  The McDonnell Douglas DC-X (also a biconic) was essentially a scaled up version of AMaRV.  AMaRV and the DC-X also served as the basis for an unsuccessful proposal for what eventually became the Lockheed Martin X-33.  Amongst aerospace engineers, AMaRV has achieved legendary status alongside such marvels as the SR-71 Blackbird and the Saturn V Rocket.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl]

===Non-axisymmetric shapes===

Non-axisymmetric shapes have been used for manned entry vehicles.  One example is the winged orbit vehicle that uses a delta wing for maneuvering during descent much like a conventional glider. This approach has been used by the American Space Shuttle and the Soviet Buran. The lifting body is another entry vehicle geometry and was used with the X-23 PRIME (Precision Recovery Including Maneuvering Entry) vehicle. [tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl]
The FIRST (Fabrication of Inflatable Re-entry Structures for Test) system was an Aerojet proposal for an inflated-spar Rogallo wing made up from Inconel wire cloth impregnated with silicone rubber and silicon carbide dust. FIRST was proposed in both one-man and six man versions, used for emergency escape and reentry of stranded space station crews, and was based on an earlier unmanned test program that resulted in a partially successful reentry flight from space (the launcher nose cone fairing hung up on the material, dragging it too low and fast for the TPS, but otherwise it appears the concept would have worked; even with the fairing dragging it, the test article flew stably on reentry until burn-through). [tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl]
The proposed MOOSE system would have used a one-man inflatable ballistic capsule as an emergency astronaut entry vehicle. This concept was carried further by the Douglas Paracone project. While these concepts were unusual, the inflated shape on reentry was in fact axisymmetric. [tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl]

==Shock layer gas physics==

An approximate rule-of-thumb used by heat shield designers for estimating peak shock layer temperature is to assume the air temperature in kelvins to be equal to the entry speed in meters per second — a mathematical coincidence.  For example, a spacecraft entering the atmosphere at 7.8 km/s would experience a peak shock layer temperature of 7800 K.  This is unexpected, since the kinetic energy increases with the square of the velocity, and can only occur because the specific heat of the gas increases greatly with temperature (unlike the nearly constant specific heat assumed for solids under ordinary conditions).
At typical reentry temperatures, the air in the shock layer is both ionized and dissociated. This chemical dissociation necessitates various physical models to describe the shock layer's thermal and chemical properties.  There are four basic physical models of a gas that are important to aeronautical engineers who design heat shields:

===Perfect gas model===

Almost all aeronautical engineers are taught the perfect (ideal) gas model during their undergraduate education.  Most of the important perfect gas equations along with their corresponding tables and graphs are shown in NACA Report 1135.[tpl]cite journal |title=Equations, tables, and charts for compressible flow |publisher=NASA Technical Reports |issue=NACA-TR-1135 |year=1953 |url=http://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=451364&id=3qs=Ntt%3D1135%26Ntk%3Dall%26Ntx%3Dmode%2Bmatchall%26Ns%3DPublicationYear%257c1%26N%3D17 |journal=NACA Annual Report |volume=39 |pages=611–681[/tpl]  Excerpts from NACA Report 1135 often appear in the appendices of thermodynamics textbooks and are familiar to most aeronautical engineers who design supersonic aircraft.
The perfect gas theory is elegant and extremely useful for designing aircraft, but assumes the gas is chemically inert.  From the standpoint of aircraft design, air can be assumed to be inert for temperatures less than 550 K at one atmosphere pressure.  The perfect gas theory begins to break down at 550 K and is not usable at temperatures greater than 2000 K.  For temperatures greater than 2000 K, a heat shield designer must use a real gas model.

===Real (equilibrium) gas model===

An entry vehicle's pitching moment can be significantly influenced by real-gas effects. Both the Apollo-CM and the Space Shuttle were designed using incorrect pitching moments determined through inaccurate real-gas modeling. The Apollo-CM's trim-angle angle of attack was higher than originally estimated, resulting in a narrower lunar return entry corridor.  The actual aerodynamic center of the Columbia was upstream from the calculated value due to real-gas effects.  On Columbia’s maiden flight (STS-1), astronauts John W. Young and Robert Crippen had some anxious moments during reentry when there was concern about losing control of the vehicle.Kenneth Iliff and Mary Shafer, Space Shuttle Hypersonic Aerodynamic and Aerothermodynamic Flight Research and the Comparison to Ground Test Results, Page 5-6
An equilibrium real-gas model assumes that a gas is chemically reactive, but also assumes all chemical reactions have had time to complete and all components of the gas have the same temperature (this is called thermodynamic equilibrium).  When air is processed by a shock wave, it is superheated by compression and chemically dissociates through many different reactions (Direct friction upon the reentry object is not the main cause of shock-layer heating. It is caused mainly from isentropic heating of the air molecules within the compression wave.  Friction based entropy increases of the molecules within the wave also account for some heating.).[tpl]or|date=November 2013[/tpl]  The distance from the shock wave to the stagnation point on the entry vehicle's leading edge is called shock wave stand off.  An approximate rule of thumb for shock wave standoff distance is 0.14 times the nose radius. One can estimate the time of travel for a gas molecule from the shock wave to the stagnation point by assuming a free stream velocity of 7.8 km/s and a nose radius of 1 meter, i.e., time of travel is about 18 microseconds.  This is roughly the time required for shock-wave-initiated chemical dissociation to approach chemical equilibrium in a shock layer for a 7.8 km/s entry into air during peak heat flux.  Consequently, as air approaches the entry vehicle's stagnation point, the air effectively reaches chemical equilibrium thus enabling an equilibrium model to be usable. For this case, most of the shock layer between the shock wave and leading edge of an entry vehicle is chemically reacting and not in a state of equilibrium. The Fay-Riddell equation, which is of extreme importance towards modeling heat flux, owes its validity to the stagnation point being in chemical equilibrium.  The time required for the shock layer gas to reach equilibrium is strongly dependent upon the shock layer's pressure.  For example, in the case of the Galileo Probe's entry into Jupiter's atmosphere, the shock layer was mostly in equilibrium during peak heat flux due to the very high pressures experienced (this is counterintuitive given the free stream velocity was 39 km/s during peak heat flux).
Determining the thermodynamic state of the stagnation point is more difficult under an equilibrium gas model than a perfect gas model.  Under a perfect gas model, the ratio of specific heats (also called "isentropic exponent", adiabatic index, "gamma" or "kappa") is assumed to be constant along with the gas constant.  For a real gas, the ratio of specific heats can wildly oscillate as a function of temperature.  Under a perfect gas model there is an elegant set of equations for determining thermodynamic state along a constant entropy stream line called the isentropic chain.  For a real gas, the isentropic chain is unusable and a Mollier diagram would be used instead for manual calculation.  However, graphical solution with a Mollier diagram is now considered obsolete with modern heat shield designers using computer programs based upon a digital lookup table (another form of Mollier diagram) or a chemistry based thermodynamics program.  The chemical composition of a gas in equilibrium with fixed pressure and temperature can be determined through the Gibbs free energy method.  Gibbs free energy is simply the total enthalpy of the gas minus its total entropy times temperature.  A chemical equilibrium program normally does not require chemical formulas or reaction-rate equations.  The program works by preserving the original elemental abundances specified for the gas and varying the different molecular combinations of the elements through numerical iteration until the lowest possible Gibbs free energy is calculated (a Newton-Raphson method is the usual numerical scheme).  The data base for a Gibbs free energy program comes from spectroscopic data used in defining partition functions.  Among the best equilibrium codes in existence is the program Chemical Equilibrium with Applications (CEA) which was written by Bonnie J. McBride and Sanford Gordon at NASA Lewis (now renamed "NASA Glenn Research Center").  Other names for CEA are the "Gordon and McBride Code" and the "Lewis Code". CEA is quite accurate up to 10,000 K for planetary atmospheric gases, but unusable beyond 20,000 K (double ionization is not modeled).  CEA can be downloaded from the Internet along with full documentation and will compile on Linux under the G77 Fortran compiler.

===Real (non-equilibrium) gas model===

A non-equilibrium real gas model is the most accurate model of a shock layer's gas physics, but is more difficult to solve than an equilibrium model.  The simplest non-equilibrium model is the Lighthill-Freeman model.[tpl]cite journal |last=Lighthill |first=M.J. |title=Dynamics of a Dissociating Gas. Part I. Equilibrium Flow |journal=Journal of Fluid Mechanics |volume=2 |pages=1–32 |date=Jan 1957 |doi=10.1017/S0022112057000713 |issue=1|bibcode = 1957JFM.....2....1L [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last=Freeman |first=N.C. |title=Non-equilibrium Flow of an Ideal Dissociating Gas |journal=Journal of Fluid Mechanics |volume=4 |pages=407–425 |date=Aug 1958 |doi=10.1017/S0022112058000549 |issue=4|bibcode = 1958JFM.....4..407F [/tpl]  The Lighthill-Freeman model initially assumes a gas made up of a single diatomic species susceptible to only one chemical formula and its reverse; e.g., N2 → N + N and N + N → N2 (dissociation and recombination).  Because of its simplicity, the Lighthill-Freeman model is a useful pedagogical tool, but is unfortunately too simple for modeling non-equilibrium air.  Air is typically assumed to have a mole fraction composition of 0.7812 molecular nitrogen, 0.2095 molecular oxygen and 0.0093 argon.  The simplest real gas model for air is the five species model which is based upon N2, O2, NO, N and O. The five species model assumes no ionization and ignores trace species like carbon dioxide.
When running a Gibbs free energy equilibrium program, the iterative process from the originally specified molecular composition to the final calculated equilibrium composition is essentially random and not time accurate.  With a non-equilibrium program, the computation process is time accurate and follows a solution path dictated by chemical and reaction rate formulas.  The five species model has 17 chemical formulas (34 when counting reverse formulas).  The Lighthill-Freeman model is based upon a single ordinary differential equation and one algebraic equation.  The five species model is based upon 5 ordinary differential equations and 17 algebraic equations.  Because the 5 ordinary differential equations are loosely coupled, the system is numerically "stiff" and difficult to solve. The five species model is only usable for entry from low Earth orbit where entry velocity is approximately 7.8 km/s.  For lunar return entry of 11 km/s, the shock layer contains a significant amount of ionized nitrogen and oxygen.  The five species model is no longer accurate and a twelve species model must be used instead.  High speed Mars entry which involves a carbon dioxide, nitrogen and argon atmosphere is even more complex requiring a 19 species model.
An important aspect of modeling non-equilibrium real gas effects is radiative heat flux.  If a vehicle is entering an atmosphere at very high speed (hyperbolic trajectory, lunar return) and has a large nose radius then radiative heat flux can dominate TPS heating.  Radiative heat flux during entry into an air or carbon dioxide atmosphere typically comes from unsymmetric diatomic molecules; e.g., cyanogen (CN), carbon monoxide, nitric oxide (NO), single ionized molecular nitrogen, et cetera.  These molecules are formed by the shock wave dissociating ambient atmospheric gas followed by recombination within the shock layer into new molecular species.  The newly formed diatomic molecules initially have a very high vibrational temperature that efficiently transforms the vibrational energy into radiant energy; i.e., radiative heat flux.  The whole process takes place in less than a millisecond which makes modeling a challenge.  The experimental measurement of radiative heat flux (typically done with shock tubes) along with theoretical calculation through the unsteady Schrödinger equation are among the more esoteric aspects of aerospace engineering.  Most of the aerospace research work related to understanding radiative heat flux was done in the 1960s, but largely discontinued after conclusion of the Apollo Program.  Radiative heat flux in air was just sufficiently understood to ensure Apollo's success.  However, radiative heat flux in carbon dioxide (Mars entry) is still barely understood and will require major research.

===Frozen gas model===

The frozen gas model describes a special case of a gas that is not in equilibrium.  The name "frozen gas" can be misleading.  A frozen gas is not "frozen" like ice is frozen water.  Rather a frozen gas is "frozen" in time (all chemical reactions are assumed to have stopped).  Chemical reactions are normally driven by collisions between molecules.  If gas pressure is slowly reduced such that chemical reactions can continue then the gas can remain in equilibrium.  However, it is possible for gas pressure to be so suddenly reduced that almost all chemical reactions stop.  For that situation the gas is considered frozen.
The distinction between equilibrium and frozen is important because it is possible for a gas such as air to have significantly different properties (speed-of-sound, viscosity, et cetera) for the same thermodynamic state; e.g., pressure and temperature.  Frozen gas can be a significant issue in the wake behind an entry vehicle.  During reentry, free stream air is compressed to high temperature and pressure by the entry vehicle's shock wave.  Non-equilibrium air in the shock layer is then transported past the entry vehicle's leading side into a region of rapidly expanding flow that causes freezing.  The frozen air can then be entrained into a trailing vortex behind the entry vehicle.  Correctly modeling the flow in the wake of an entry vehicle is very difficult.  Thermal protection shield (TPS) heating in the vehicle's afterbody is usually not very high, but the geometry and unsteadiness of the vehicle's wake can significantly influence aerodynamics (pitching moment) and particularly dynamic stability.

==Thermal protection systems==

A thermal protection system or TPS is the barrier that protects a spacecraft during the searing heat of atmospheric reentry.  A secondary goal may be to protect the spacecraft from the heat and cold of space while on orbit.  Multiple approaches for the thermal protection of spacecraft are in use, among them ablative heat shields, passive cooling and active cooling of spacecraft surfaces.

===Ablative===

The ablative heat shield functions by lifting the hot shock layer gas away from the heat shield's outer wall (creating a cooler boundary layer). The boundary layer comes from blowing of gaseous reaction products from the heat shield material and provides protection against all forms of heat flux.  The overall process of reducing the heat flux experienced by the heat shield's outer wall by way of a boundary layer is called blockage.  Ablation occurs at two levels in an ablative TPS: the outer surface of the TPS material chars, melts, and sublimes, while the bulk of the TPS material undergoes pyrolysis and expels product gases.  The gas produced by pyrolysis is what drives blowing and causes blockage of convective and catalytic heat flux.  Pyrolysis can be measured in real time using thermogravimetric analysis, so that the ablative performance can be evaluated.Parker, John and C. Michael Hogan, "Techniques for Wind Tunnel assessment of Ablative Materials," NASA Ames Research Center, Technical Publication, August, 1965.  Ablation can also provide blockage against radiative heat flux by introducing carbon into the shock layer thus making it optically opaque.  Radiative heat flux blockage was the primary thermal protection mechanism of the Galileo Probe TPS material (carbon phenolic).  Carbon phenolic was originally developed as a rocket nozzle throat material (used in the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster) and for re-entry vehicle nose tips.
Early research on ablation technology in the USA was centered at NASA's Ames Research Center located at Moffett Field, California.   Ames Research Center was ideal, since it had numerous wind tunnels capable of generating varying wind velocities.  Initial experiments typically mounted a mock-up of the ablative material to be analyzed within a hypersonic wind tunnel.Hogan, C. Michael, Parker, John and Winkler, Ernest, of NASA Ames Research Center,  "An Analytical Method for Obtaining the Thermogravimetric Kinetics of Char-forming Ablative Materials from Thermogravimetric Measurements", AIAA/ASME Seventh Structures and Materials Conference, April, 1966
The thermal conductivity of a TPS material is proportional to the material's density.  Carbon phenolic is a very effective ablative material, but also has high density which is undesirable.  If the heat flux experienced by an entry vehicle is insufficient to cause pyrolysis then the TPS material's conductivity could allow heat flux conduction into the TPS bondline material thus leading to TPS failure.  Consequently for entry trajectories causing lower heat flux, carbon phenolic is sometimes inappropriate and lower density TPS materials such as the following examples can be better design choices:

====SLA-561V====

"SLA" in SLA-561V stands for "Super Light weight Ablator". SLA-561V is a proprietary ablative made by Lockheed Martin that has been used as the primary TPS material on all of the 70 degree sphere-cone entry vehicles sent by NASA to Mars. SLA-561V begins significant ablation at a heat flux of approximately 110 W/cm², but will fail for heat fluxes greater than 300 W/cm².  The Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) aeroshell TPS is currently designed to withstand a peak heat flux of 234 W/cm². The peak heat flux experienced by the Viking-1 aeroshell which landed on Mars was 21 W/cm².  For Viking-1, the TPS acted as a charred thermal insulator and never experienced significant ablation.  Viking-1 was the first Mars lander and based upon a very conservative design. The Viking aeroshell had a base diameter of 3.54 meters (the largest used on Mars until Mars Science Laboratory).  SLA-561V is applied by packing the ablative material into a honeycomb core that is pre-bonded to the aeroshell's structure thus enabling construction of a large heat shield.

====PICA====

Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablator (PICA), a carbon fiber preform impregnated in phenolic resin,[tpl]cite conference |url=http://www.jeanlachaud.com/research/Lachaud2010_AbstractOFWS5.pdf |first=Jean |last=Lachaud |first2=Nagi |last2=N.

It is a good choice for ablative applications such as high-peak-heating conditions found on sample-return missions or lunar-return missions. PICA's thermal conductivity is lower than other high-heat-flux ablative materials, such as conventional carbon phenolics.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2009[/tpl]
PICA was patented by NASA Ames Research Center in the 1990s and was the primary TPS material for the Stardust aeroshell.Tran, Huy K, et al., "Qualification of the forebody heatshield of the Stardust's Sample Return Capsule," AIAA, Thermophysics Conference, 32nd, Atlanta, GA; 23–25 June 1997. The Stardust sample-return capsule was the fastest man-made object ever to reenter Earth's atmosphere (12.4 km/s or 28,000 mph at 135 km altitude)  This was  faster than the Apollo mission capsules and 70% faster than the Shuttle.Stardust - Cool Facts  PICA was critical for the viability of the Stardust mission, which returned to Earth in 2006. Stardust's heat shield (0.81 m base diameter) was manufactured from a single monolithic piece sized to withstand a nominal peak heating rate of 1200 W/cm2. A PICA heat shield has also been used for the Mars Science Laboratory entry into the Martian atmosphere.

====SIRCA====

Silicone Impregnated Reusable Ceramic Ablator (SIRCA) was also developed at NASA Ames Research Center and was used on the Backshell Interface Plate (BIP) of the Mars Pathfinder and Mars Exploration Rover (MER) aeroshells.  The BIP was at the attachment points between the aeroshell's backshell (also called the "afterbody" or "aft cover") and the cruise ring (also called the "cruise stage").  SIRCA was also the primary TPS material for the unsuccessful Deep Space 2 (DS/2) Mars impactor probes with their 0.35 m base diameter aeroshells.  SIRCA is a monolithic, insulative material that can provide thermal protection through ablation.  It is the only TPS material that can be machined to custom shapes and then applied directly to the spacecraft.  There is no post-processing, heat treating, or additional coatings required (unlike Space Shuttle tiles).  Since SIRCA can be machined to precise shapes, it can be applied as tiles, leading edge sections, full nose caps, or in any number of custom shapes or sizes.  [tpl]as of|1996[/tpl], SIRCA had been demonstrated in backshell interface applications, but not yet as a forebody TPS material.Tran, Huy K., et al., "Silicone impregnated reusable ceramic ablators for Mars follow-on missions," AIAA-1996-1819, Thermophysics Conference, 31st, New Orleans, LA, June 17–20, 1996.

In fabrication, the empty honeycomb is bonded to the primary structure and the resin is gunned into each cell individually. ... The overall density of the material is 32 lb/ft3 (512 kg/m3).  The char of the material is composed mainly of silica and carbon. It is necessary to know the amounts of each in the char because in the ablation analysis the silica is considered to be inert, but the carbon is considered to enter into exothermic reactions with oxygen. ... At 2160O R (12000 K), 54 percent by weight of the virgin material has volatilized and 46 percent has remained as char. ... In the virgin material, 25 percent by weight is silica, and since the silica is considered to be inert the char-layer composition becomes 6.7 lb/ft3 (107.4 kg/m3) of carbon and 8 lb/ft3 (128.1 kg/m3) of silica."[/ref]

===Thermal soak===

Thermal soak is a part of almost all TPS schemes.  For example, an ablative heat shield loses most of its thermal protection effectiveness when the outer wall temperature drops below the minimum necessary for pyrolysis.  From that time to the end of the heat pulse, heat from the shock layer convects into the heat shield's outer wall and would eventually conduct to the payload.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2009[/tpl] This outcome is prevented by ejecting the heat shield (with its heat soak) prior to the heat conducting to the inner wall.
Typical Space Shuttle's TPS tiles (LI-900) have remarkable thermal protection properties. An LI-900 tile exposed to a temperature of 1000 K on one side will remain merely warm to the touch on the other side. However, they are relatively brittle and break easily, and cannot survive in-flight rain.

===Passively cooled===

In some early ballistic missile RVs, e.g. the Mk-2, and the sub-orbital Mercury spacecraft, radiatively cooled TPS were used to initially absorb heat flux during the heat pulse and then, after the heat pulse, radiate and convect the stored heat back into the atmosphere. However, the earlier version of this technique required a considerable quantity of metal TPS (e.g., titanium, beryllium, copper, etc.). Modern designers prefer to avoid this added mass by using ablative and thermal soak TPS instead.  thumb|upright|left|The Mercury Capsule design (shown with escape tower) originally used a radiatively cooled TPS, but was later converted to an ablative TPS
Radiatively cooled TPS can still be found on modern entry vehicles, but reinforced carbon-carbon (RCC) (also called carbon-carbon) is normally used instead of metal. RCC is the TPS material on the Space Shuttle's nose cone and wing leading edges. RCC was also proposed as the leading edge material for the X-33.  Carbon is the most refractory material known with a one atmosphere sublimation temperature of 3825 °C for graphite.  This high temperature made carbon an obvious choice as a radiatively cooled TPS material.  Disadvantages of RCC are that it is currently very expensive to manufacture and lacks impact resistance.http://history.nasa.gov/columbia/CAIB_reportindex.html Columbia Accident Investigation Board report.
Some high-velocity aircraft, such as the SR-71 Blackbird and Concorde, deal with heating similar to that experienced by spacecraft but at much lower intensity and for hours at a time.  Studies of the SR-71's titanium skin revealed the metal structure was restored to its original strength through annealing due to aerodynamic heating.  In the case of Concorde the aluminium nose was permitted to reach a maximum operating temperature of 127 °C (typically 180 °C warmer than the sub-zero ambient air); the metallurgical implications (loss of temper) that would be associated with a higher peak temperature were the most significant factors determining the top speed of the aircraft.
A radiatively cooled TPS for an entry vehicle is often called a hot metal TPS.  Early TPS designs for the Space Shuttle called for a hot metal TPS based upon nickel superalloy (René 41) and titanium shingles.http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/shuttle.htm Shuttle Evolutionary History. The earlier Shuttle TPS concept was rejected because it was believed a silica tile based TPS offered less expensive development and manufacturing costs.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2010[/tpl]  A nickel superalloy shingle TPS was again proposed for the unsuccessful X-33 single-stage to orbit (SSTO) prototype.http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20040095922_2004100223.pdf X-33 Heat Shield Development report.
Recently, newer radiatively cooled TPS materials have been developed that could be superior to RCC. Referred to by their prototype vehicle "SHARP" (Slender Hypervelocity Aerothermodynamic Research Probe), these TPS materials have been based upon substances such as zirconium diboride and hafnium diboride. SHARP TPS have suggested performance improvements allowing for sustained Mach 7 flight at sea level, Mach 11 flight at [tpl]convert|100000|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] altitudes, and significant improvements for vehicles designed for continuous hypersonic flight. SHARP TPS materials enable sharp leading edges and nose cones to greatly reduce drag for air breathing combined cycle propelled space planes and lifting bodies. SHARP materials have exhibited effective TPS characteristics from zero to more than 2000 °C, with melting points over 3500 °C. They are structurally stronger than RCC, thus not requiring structural reinforcement with materials such as Inconel.  SHARP materials are extremely efficient at re-radiating absorbed heat, thus eliminating the need for additional TPS behind and between SHARP materials and conventional vehicle structure. NASA initially funded (and discontinued) a multi-phase R&D program through the University of Montana in 2001 to test SHARP materials on test vehicles.http://hubbard.engr.scu.edu/docs/thesis/2003/SHARP_Thesis.pdfsharp structure homepage w left

===Actively cooled===

Various advanced reusable spacecraft and hypersonic aircraft designs have been proposed to employ heat shields made from temperature-resistant metal alloys that incorporated a refrigerant or cryogenic fuel circulating through them.  Such a TPS concept was proposed for the X-30 National Aerospace Plane (NASP).  The NASP was supposed to have been a scramjet powered hypersonic aircraft, but failed in development.
In the early 1960s various TPS systems were proposed to use water or other cooling liquid sprayed into the shock layer, or passed through channels in the heat shield. Advantages included the possibility of more all-metal designs which would be cheaper to develop, more rugged, and eliminate the need for classified technology. The disadvantage is increased weight and complexity, and lower reliability. The concept has never been flown, but a similar technology (the plug nozzle- J2T-200K & J2T-250K) did undergo extensive ground testing.

==Feathered reentry==

In 2004, aircraft designer Burt Rutan demonstrated the feasibility of a shape-changing airfoil for reentry with the suborbital SpaceShipOne. The wings on this craft rotate upward into the feather configuration that provides a shuttlecock effect. Thus SpaceShipOne does achieve much more aerodynamic drag on reentry while not experiencing significant thermal loads.
The configuration increases drag, as the craft is now less streamlined and results in more atmospheric gas particles hitting the spacecraft at higher altitudes than otherwise. The aircraft thus slows down more in higher atmospheric layers which is the very key to efficient reentry. Secondly the aircraft will automatically orient itself in this state to a high drag attitude.HowStuffWorks.com: SpaceShipOne
However, the velocity attained by SpaceShipOne prior to reentry is much lower than that of an orbital spacecraft, and engineers, including Rutan, recognize that a feathered reentry technique is not suitable for return from orbit.
On 4 May 2011, the first test on the SpaceShipTwo of the feathering mechanism was made during a glideflight after release
from the White Knight Two.
The feathered reentry was first described by Dean Chapman of NACA in 1958.[tpl]cite journal | url=http://naca.larc.nasa.gov/reports/1958/naca-tn-4276/naca-tn-4276.pdf | title=An approximate analytical method for studying reentry into planetary atmospheres | author=Chapman, Dean R. | journal=NACA Technical Note 4276 |date=May 1958 | page=38 | archiveurl=http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19930085059_1993085059.pdf | archivedate=2011-04-07[/tpl] In the section of his report on Composite Entry, Chapman described a solution to the problem using a high-drag device:

==Inflatable heat shield reentry==

Deceleration for atmospheric reentry, especially for higher-speed Mars-return missions, benefit from maximizing "the drag area of the entry system. The larger the diameter of the aeroshell, the bigger the payload can be."  An inflatable aeroshell provides one alternative for enlarging the drag area with a low-mass design.
Such inflatable shield/aerobrake was designed for the penetrators of Mars 96 mission. Since the mission failed due the launcher malfunction, the NPO Lavochkin and DASA/ESA have designed a mission for Earth orbit. The Inflatable Reentry and Descent Technology (IRDT) demonstrator have launched on Soyuz-Fregat on 8 February 2000. The inflatable shield was designed as a cone with two stages of inflation. Although the second stage of the shield failed to inflate, the demonstrator survived the orbital reentry and was recovered.Inflatable Re-Entry Technologies: Flight Demonstration and Future Prospects The subsequent missions flown on the Volna rocket were not successful due to launcher failure.IRDT demonstration missions
NASA launched an inflatable heat shield experimental spacecraft on 17 August 2009 with the successful first test flight of the Inflatable Re-entry Vehicle Experiment (IRVE).  The heatshield had been vacuum-packed into a 15-inch diameter payload shroud and launched on a Black Brant 9 sounding rocket from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility on Wallops Island, Virginia.  "Nitrogen inflated the 10-foot (3 m) diameter heat shield, made of several layers of silicone-coated Kevlar fabric, to a mushroom shape in space several minutes after liftoff."  The rocket apogee was at an altitude of [tpl]convert|131|miles[/tpl] where it began its descent to supersonic speed. Less than a minute later the shield was released from its cover to inflate at an altitude of [tpl]convert|124|miles[/tpl].  The inflation of the shield took less than 90 seconds.[ref]

==Entry vehicle design considerations==

There are four critical parameters considered when designing a vehicle for atmospheric entry:
Peak heat flux and dynamic pressure selects the TPS material.  Heat load selects the thickness of the TPS material stack.  Peak deceleration is of major importance for manned missions.  The upper limit for manned return to Earth from Low Earth Orbit (LEO) or lunar return is 10 Gs.Pavlosky, James E., St. Leger, Leslie G., "Apollo Experience Report - Thermal Protection Subsystem," NASA TN D-7564, (1974).  For Martian atmospheric entry after long exposure to zero gravity, the upper limit is 4 Gs.  Peak dynamic pressure can also influence the selection of the outermost TPS material if spallation is an issue.
Starting from the principle of conservative design, the engineer typically considers two worst case trajectories, the undershoot and overshoot trajectories.  The overshoot trajectory is typically defined as the shallowest allowable entry velocity angle prior to atmospheric skip-off.  The overshoot trajectory has the highest heat load and sets the TPS thickness.  The undershoot trajectory is defined by the steepest allowable trajectory.  For manned missions the steepest entry angle is limited by the peak deceleration.  The undershoot trajectory also has the highest peak heat flux and dynamic pressure.  Consequently the undershoot trajectory is the basis for selecting the TPS material.  There is no "one size fits all" TPS material.  A TPS material that is ideal for high heat flux may be too conductive (too dense) for a long duration heat load.  A low density TPS material might lack the tensile strength to resist spallation if the dynamic pressure is too high.  A TPS material can perform well for a specific peak heat flux, but fail catastrophically for the same peak heat flux if the wall pressure is significantly increased (this happened with NASA's R-4 test spacecraft).  Older TPS materials tend to be more labor-intensive and expensive to manufacture compared to modern materials.  However, modern TPS materials often lack the flight history of the older materials (an important consideration for a risk-averse designer).
Based upon Allen and Eggers discovery, maximum aeroshell bluntness (maximum drag) yields minimum TPS mass.  Maximum bluntness (minimum ballistic coefficient) also yields a minimal terminal velocity at maximum altitude (very important for Mars EDL, but detrimental for military RVs).  However, there is an upper limit to bluntness imposed by aerodynamic stability considerations based upon shock wave detachment. A shock wave will remain attached to the tip of a sharp cone if the cone's half-angle is below a critical value.  This critical half-angle can be estimated using perfect gas theory (this specific aerodynamic instability occurs below hypersonic speeds).  For a nitrogen atmosphere (Earth or Titan), the maximum allowed half-angle is approximately 60°.  For a carbon dioxide atmosphere (Mars or Venus), the maximum allowed half-angle is approximately 70°.  After shock wave detachment, an entry vehicle must carry significantly more shocklayer gas around the leading edge stagnation point (the subsonic cap).  Consequently, the aerodynamic center moves upstream thus causing aerodynamic instability.  It is incorrect to reapply an aeroshell design intended for Titan entry (Huygens probe in a nitrogen atmosphere) for Mars entry (Beagle-2 in a carbon dioxide atmosphere).  Prior to being abandoned, the Soviet Mars lander program achieved 1 successful landing (Mars 3), 2nd of the 3 entry attempts (others are Mars 2 and Mars 6).  The Soviet Mars landers were based upon a 60° half-angle aeroshell design.
A 45 degree half-angle sphere-cone is typically used for atmospheric probes (surface landing not intended) even though TPS mass is not minimized.  The rationale for a 45° half-angle is to have either aerodynamic stability from entry-to-impact (the heat shield is not jettisoned) or a short-and-sharp heat pulse followed by prompt heat shield jettison.  A 45° sphere-cone design was used with the DS/2 Mars impactor and Pioneer Venus Probes.
