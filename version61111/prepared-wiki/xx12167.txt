Wernher Magnus Maximilian, Freiherr von Braun (March 23, 1912 – June 16, 1977) was a German rocket engineer and space architect. He was one of the leading figures in the development of rocket technology in Germany during World War II and, subsequently, in the United States. He is credited as being the "Father of Rocket Science".
In his 20s and early 30s, von Braun was the central figure in the Nazis' rocket development program, responsible for the design and realization of the V-2 combat rocket during World War II. After the war, he and some select members of his rocket team were taken to the United States as part of the then-secret Operation Paperclip. Von Braun worked on the United States Army intermediate range ballistic missile (IRBM) program before his group was assimilated by NASA. Under NASA, he served as director of the newly formed Marshall Space Flight Center and as the chief architect of the Saturn V launch vehicle, the superbooster that propelled the Apollo spacecraft to the Moon.[tpl]cite web |publisher=NASA Marshall Space Flight Center |url=http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/vonbraun/bio.html |work=MSFC History Office |title=Biography of Wernher Von Braun[/tpl] According to one NASA source, he is "without doubt, the greatest rocket scientist in history".[tpl]cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/vonBraun/ |title=Wernher von Braun: Feature Articles |publisher=Earthobservatory.nasa.gov |accessdate=August 15, 2013[/tpl] His crowning achievement was to lead the development of the Saturn V booster rocket that helped land the first men on the Moon in July 1969.[tpl]cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Library/Giants/vonBraun|title=Wernher von Braun[/tpl] In 1975 he received the National Medal of Science.

==Early life==

Wernher von Braun was born in Wirsitz, in the Province of Posen, then a part of the German Empire, and was the second of three sons. He belonged to an aristocratic family, inheriting the German title of Freiherr (equivalent to Baron). His father, conservative civil servant Magnus Freiherr von Braun (1878–1972), served as a Minister of Agriculture in the Federal Cabinet during the Weimar Republic. His mother, Emmy von Quistorp (1886–1959), could trace her ancestry through both parents to medieval European royalty, a descendant of Philip III of France, Valdemar I of Denmark, Robert III of Scotland, and Edward III of England."Von Braun, Wernher", Erratik Institut. Retrieved 4 February 2011"Dr. Wernher von Braun'i mälestuseks", Füüsikainstituut. Retrieved 4 February 2011 Von Braun had an older brother Sigismund Freiherr von Braun and a younger brother, also named Magnus Freiherr von Braun.[tpl]cite news |work=The Huntsville Times |title=Von Braun's brother dies; aided surrender |date=June 27, 2003 |page=1A |first=Shelby G. |last=Spires |quote=Magnus von Braun, the brother of rocket pioneer Wernher von Braun who worked in Huntsville from 1950–1955, died Saturday in Phoenix, Arizona. He was 84. Though not as famous as his older brother, who died in 1977, Magnus von Braun made the first contact with U.S. Army troops to arrange the German rocket team's surrender at the end of World War II.[/tpl] After Wernher von Braun's  Lutheran confirmation, his mother gave him a telescope, and he developed a passion for astronomy. The family moved to Berlin in 1915 where his father worked at the department of interior.Magnus Freiherr von Braun, Von Ostpreußen bis Texas. Erlebnisse und zeitgeschichtliche Betrachtungen eines Ostdeutschen. Stollhamm 1955 Here 12-year-old von Braun, inspired by speed records established by Max Valier and Fritz von Opel in rocket-propelled cars, caused a major disruption in a crowded street by detonating a toy wagon to which he had attached a number of fireworks. He was taken into custody by the local police until his father came to collect him.
Wernher von Braun was an accomplished amateur pianist who could play Beethoven and Bach from memory. Von Braun learned to play the cello and the piano at an early age and originally wanted to become a composer. He took lessons from composer Paul Hindemith. The few pieces of von Braun’s youthful compositions that exist are reminiscent of Hindemith’s style.[tpl]cite book | last=Ward | first=Bob | year=2005 | title=Dr. Space: The Life of Werner Von Braun | isbn=978-1-591-14926-2[/tpl][tpl]rp|11[/tpl]
Beginning in 1925, von Braun attended a boarding school at Ettersburg Castle near Weimar where he did not do well in physics and mathematics. There he acquired a copy of Die Rakete zu den Planetenräumen (1923) (By Rocket into Interplanetary Space) (in German)[tpl]OCLC|6026491[/tpl] by rocket pioneer Hermann Oberth. In 1928, his parents moved him to the Hermann-Lietz-Internat (also a residential school) on the East Frisian North Sea island of Spiekeroog. Space travel had always fascinated von Braun, and from then on he applied himself to physics and mathematics to pursue his interest in rocket engineering.
In 1930, he attended the Technische Hochschule Berlin, where he joined the Verein für Raumschiffahrt (VfR, the "Spaceflight Society") and assisted Willy Ley in his liquid-fueled rocket motor tests in conjunction with Hermann Oberth.Various sources such as The Nazi Rocketeers (ISBN 0811733874 pp 5–8) list young Von Braun as joining the VfR as an apprentice to Willy Ley, one of the three founders. Later when Ley fled Germany because he was a Jew, Von Braun took over the leadership and changed its activity to military development.  In spring 1932, he graduated from the Technische Hochschule Berlin, with a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/wernher-von-braun-9224912 |title=Wernher von Braun biography |publisher=Biography.com |accessdate=March 1, 2014[/tpl] His early exposure to rocketry convinced him that the exploration of space would require far more than applications of the current engineering technology. Wanting to learn more about physics, chemistry, and astronomy, von Braun entered the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität for post-graduate studies and was graduated with a Dr. Phil. degree in physics in 1934.[tpl]cite web|url=http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/vonbraun/recollect-childhood.html |title=Early Experiences in Rocketry as Told by Werner Von Braun 1963 |publisher=History.msfc.nasa.gov |accessdate=August 15, 2013[/tpl] He also studied at ETH Zürich. Although he worked mainly on military rockets in his later years there, space travel remained his primary interest.
In 1930, von Braun attended a presentation given by Auguste Piccard. After the talk the young student approached the famous pioneer of high-altitude balloon flight, and stated to him: "You know, I plan on traveling to the Moon at some time." Piccard is said to have responded with encouraging words.As related by Auguste's son Jacques Piccard to fellow deep-sea explorer Hans Fricke, cited in: Fricke H. Der Fisch, der aus der Urzeit kam, pp. 23–24. Deutscher Taschenbuch-Verlag, 2010. ISBN 978-3-423-34616-0 (in German)
He was greatly influenced by Oberth, of whom he said:
[tpl]bquote|Hermann Oberth was the first, who when thinking about the possibility of spaceships grabbed a slide-rule and presented mathematically analyzed concepts and designs.... I, myself, owe to him not only the guiding-star of my life, but also my first contact with the theoretical and practical aspects of rocketry and space travel. A place of honor should be reserved in the history of science and technology for his ground-breaking contributions in the field of astronautics.[tpl]cite web|author=Leo Nutz, Elmar Wild |url=http://www.oberth-museum.org/index_e.html |title=Oberth-museum.org |publisher=Oberth-museum.org |date=December 28, 1989 |accessdate=August 15, 2013[/tpl][/tpl]

==German career==

===Involvement with the Nazi regime===

====Party membership====

Von Braun had an ambivalent and complex relationship with the regime of the Third Reich. He officially applied for membership in the NSDAP on November 12, 1937 and was issued membership number 5,738,692.[tpl]cite book|last=Neufeld|first=Michael|title=Von Braun Dreamer of Space Engineer of War|year=2007|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|location=New York|isbn=978-0-307-26292-9[/tpl][tpl]rp|96[/tpl]
Michael J. Neufeld, the widely published author of aerospace history and the chief of the Space History Division at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum, wrote that ten years after Von Braun obtained his Nazi Party membership, the rocket scientist produced an affidavit for the U.S. Army misstating the year of his membership, saying falsely:[tpl]rp|96[/tpl]
Whether von Braun's error with regard to the year was deliberate or a simple mistake has never been ascertained, although Neufeld stated he might have lied on the affidavit.[tpl]rp|96[/tpl] Neufeld further wrote:
His attitude toward the National Socialist regime in the late 1930s and early 1940s is difficult to discern, although he admitted in a 1952 memoir article that he "fared relatively rather well under totalitarianism."[tpl]rp|96–97[/tpl]

====Membership in the Allgemeine SS====

Von Braun was offered and accepted an honorary[tpl]cite book | last=Ward | first=Bob | year=2009 | title=Dr. Space: The Life of Wernher von Braun | publisher=US Naval Institute Press | isbn=978-1591149279[/tpl][tpl]rp|47[/tpl]Wernher von Braun FBI file rank in the Allgemeine SS. In 1947, he gave the U.S. War Department this explanation:
Von Braun joined the organization and was issued membership number 185,068.
Michael J. Neufeld writes:
Von Braun's feelings for the regime may have changed when he was arrested and accused of being a "communist sympathizer" who had attempted to sabotage or delay the weapons program. These charges could have led to the death penalty for treason. Not helping the matter was that von Braun had skills as a pilot and had access to an aircraft, which might have allowed him to escape to England. (See: Arrest and release by the Nazi regime).
When shown a picture of him behind Himmler, Braun claimed to have worn the SS uniform only that one time,"Dr. Space" pp. 35 "It had been thought that he publicly wore his uniform with swastika armband just once, during one of two formal..." but in 2002 a former SS officer at Peenemünde told the BBC that von Braun had regularly worn the SS uniform to official meetings. He began as an Untersturmführer (Second lieutenant) and was promoted three times by Himmler, the last time in June 1943 to SS-Sturmbannführer (major). Von Braun claimed this was a technical promotion received each year regularly by mail.Dr. Space, p. 35.

===The Prussian rocketeer and working under the Nazis===

Von Braun was working on his creative doctorate when the National Socialist German Workers Party (NSDAP, or Nazi party) came to power in a coalition government in Germany; rocketry almost immediately became part of the national agenda. An artillery captain, Walter Dornberger, arranged an Ordnance Department research grant for Von Braun, who then worked next to Dornberger's existing solid-fuel rocket test site at Kummersdorf. He was awarded a doctorate in physics[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/astros/vonbraun.htm |title=von Braun|publisher=Astronautix.com |accessdate=August 15, 2013[/tpl] (aerospace engineering) on July 27, 1934 from the University of Berlin for a thesis titled About Combustion Tests; his doctoral advisor was Erich Schumann.[tpl]rp|61[/tpl] However, this thesis was only the public part of von Braun's work. His actual full thesis, Construction, Theoretical, and Experimental Solution to the Problem of the Liquid Propellant Rocket (dated April 16, 1934) was kept classified by the army, and was not published until 1960.Konstruktive, theoretische und experimentelle Beiträge zu dem Problem der Flüssigkeitsrakete. Raketentechnik und Raumfahrtforschung, Sonderheft 1 (1960), Stuttgart, Germany. By the end of 1934, his group had successfully launched two rockets that rose to heights of 2.2 and [tpl]convert|3.5|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl].
At the time, Germany was highly interested in American physicist Robert H. Goddard's research. Before 1939, German scientists occasionally contacted Goddard directly with technical questions. Wernher von Braun used Goddard's plans from various journals and incorporated them into the building of the Aggregat (A) series of rockets. The A-4 rocket would become well known as the V-2.[tpl]ScienceWorldBiography|title=Robert Goddard|urlname=Goddard[/tpl] In 1963, von Braun reflected on the history of rocketry, and said of Goddard's work: "His rockets ... may have been rather crude by present-day standards, but they blazed the trail and incorporated many features used in our most modern rockets and space vehicles."[tpl]cite web |url=http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/vonbraun/recollect-childhood.html |title=Recollections of Childhood: Early Experiences in Rocketry as Told by Werner Von Braun 1963 |work=MSFC History Office |publisher=NASA Marshall Space Flight Center[/tpl] Goddard confirmed his work was used by von Braun in 1944, shortly before the Nazis began firing V-2s at England. A V-2 crashed in Sweden and some parts were sent to an Annapolis lab where Goddard was doing research for the Navy. If this was the so-called Bäckebo Bomb, it had been procured by the British in exchange for Spitfires; Annapolis would have received some parts from them. Goddard is reported to have recognized components he had invented, and inferred that his brainchild had been turned into a weapon.[tpl]cite web |url=http://blog.modernmechanix.com/2007/04/28/the-man-who-opened-the-door-to-space/ |title=The Man Who Opened the Door to Space |work=Popular Science |date=May 1959[/tpl]
There were no German rocket societies after the collapse of the VfR, and civilian rocket tests were forbidden by the new Nazi regime. Only military development was allowed and to this end, a larger facility was erected at the village of Peenemünde in northern Germany on the Baltic Sea. Dornberger became the military commander at Peenemünde, with von Braun as technical director. In collaboration with the Luftwaffe, the Peenemünde group developed liquid-fuel rocket engines for aircraft and jet-assisted takeoffs. They also developed the long-range A-4 ballistic missile and the supersonic Wasserfall anti-aircraft missile.
On December 22, 1942, Adolf Hitler signed the order approving the production of the A-4 as a "vengeance weapon" and the group developed it to target London. Following von Braun's July 7, 1943 presentation of a color movie showing an A-4 taking off, Hitler was so enthusiastic that he personally made von Braun a professor shortly thereafter.Speer, Albert (1969). Erinnerungen, p. 377. Verlag Ullstein GmbH, Frankfurt a.M. and Berlin, ISBN 3-550-06074-2. In Germany at this time, this was an exceptional promotion for an engineer who was only 31 years old.
By that time, the British and Soviet intelligence agencies were aware of the rocket program and von Braun's team at Peenemünde. Over the nights of August 17 and 18, 1943 RAF Bomber Command's Operation Hydra dispatched raids on the Peenemünde camp consisting of 596 aircraft and dropped 1,800 tons of explosives.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/peenemunde.html|title=Peenemünde, 17 and 18 August 1943|work=RAF History – Bomber Command|accessdate=November 15, 2006|publisher=Royal Air Force[/tpl] The facility was salvaged and most of the science team remained unharmed; however, the raids killed von Braun's engine designer Walter Thiel and Chief Engineer Walther, and the rocket program was delayed.[tpl]cite book |last=Middlebrook|first=Martin|title=The Peenemünde Raid: The Night of 17–18 August 1943|year=1982|publisher=Bobs-Merrill|location=New York|page=222 |isbn=0-672-52759-6[/tpl][tpl]cite book |last=Dornberger|first=Walter|authorlink=Walter Dornberger|title=V2—Der Schuss ins Weltall|year=1952 – US translation V-2 Viking Press:New York, 1954|publisher=Bechtle Verlag|location=Esslingan|page=164[/tpl]
The first combat A-4, renamed the V-2 (Vergeltungswaffe 2 "Retaliation/Vengeance Weapon 2") for propaganda purposes, was launched toward England on September 7, 1944, only 21 months after the project had been officially commissioned. Von Braun's interest in rockets was specifically for the application of space travel, which led him to say on hearing the news from London: "The rocket worked perfectly except for landing on the wrong planet." He described it as his "darkest day".[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2007[/tpl] However, satirist Mort Sahl is often credited with mocking von Braun with the paraphrase "I aim at the stars, but sometimes I hit London".[tpl]cite news |work=Time |title=The Moon and the Clones |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,988837,00.html |first=Lance |last=Morrow |date=August 3, 1998 |accessdate=August 30, 2009[/tpl] In fact that line appears in the film I Aim at the Stars, a 1960 biopic on von Braun.

===Experiments with rocket aircraft===

During 1936, von Braun's rocketry team working at Kummersdorf investigated installing liquid-fuelled rockets in aircraft. Ernst Heinkel enthusiastically supported their efforts, supplying a He 72 and later two He 112s for the experiments. Late in 1936, Erich Warsitz was seconded by the RLM to Wernher von Braun and Ernst Heinkel, because he had been recognized as one of the most experienced test-pilots of the time, and because he also had an extraordinary fund of technical knowledge.[tpl]cite book | last=Warsitz | first=Lutz | title = The First Jet Pilot: The Story of German Test Pilot Erich Warsitz | year = 2009 | publisher = Pen and Sword Books Ltd. | isbn=978-1-84415-818-8[/tpl][tpl]rp|30[/tpl] After von Braun familiarized Warsitz with a test-stand run, showing him the corresponding apparatus in the aircraft, he asked:
 “Are you with us and will you test the rocket in the air? Then, Warsitz, you will be a famous man. And later we will fly to the moon – with you at the helm!”[tpl]rp|35[/tpl] 
In June 1937, at Neuhardenberg (a large field about [tpl]convert|70|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] east of Berlin, listed as a reserve airfield in the event of war), one of these latter aircraft was flown with its piston engine shut down during flight by test pilot Erich Warsitz, at which time it was propelled by von Braun’s rocket power alone. Despite the wheels-up landing and having the fuselage on fire, it proved to official circles that an aircraft could be flown satisfactorily with a back-thrust system through the rear.[tpl]rp|51[/tpl]
At the same time, Hellmuth Walter's experiments into hydrogen peroxide-based rockets were leading towards light and simple rockets that appeared well-suited for aircraft installation. Also the firm of Hellmuth Walter at Kiel had been commissioned by the RLM to build a rocket engine for the He 112, so there were two different new rocket motor designs at Neuhardenberg: whereas von Braun’s engines were powered by alcohol and liquid oxygen, Walter engines had hydrogen peroxide and calcium permanganate as a catalyst. Von Braun’s engines used direct combustion and created fire, the Walter devices used hot vapours from a chemical reaction, but both created thrust and provided high speed.[tpl]rp|41[/tpl] The subsequent flights with the He 112 used the Walter-rocket instead of von Braun's; it was more reliable, simpler to operate and the dangers to test-pilot Erich Warsitz and machine were less.[tpl]rp|55[/tpl]

===Slave labor===

SS General Hans Kammler, who as an engineer had constructed several concentration camps, including Auschwitz, had a reputation for brutality and had originated the idea of using concentration camp prisoners as slave laborers in the rocket program. Arthur Rudolph, chief engineer of the V-2 rocket factory at Peenemünde, endorsed this idea in April 1943 when a labor shortage developed. More people died building the V-2 rockets than were killed by it as a weapon.[tpl]cite web|author=Tracy Dungan |url=http://www.v2rocket.com/start/chapters/mittel.html |title=Mittelbau Overview |publisher=V2rocket.com |accessdate=August 15, 2013[/tpl] Von Braun admitted visiting the plant at Mittelwerk on many occasions, and called conditions at the plant "repulsive," but claimed never to have witnessed any deaths or beatings, although it had become clear to him by 1944 that deaths had occurred.[tpl]cite web |url=http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/vonbraun/excerpts.html |title=Excerpts from "Power to Explore" |work=MSFC History Office |publisher=NASA Marshall Space Flight Center[/tpl] He denied ever having visited the Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp itself, where 20,000 died from illness, beatings, hangings and intolerable working conditions.[tpl]cite news |date=March 26, 2002 |url=http://www.time.com/time/columnist/jaroff/article/0,9565,220201,00.html |work=Time |title=The Rocket Man's Dark Side |first=Leon |last=Jaroff |accessdate=June 29, 2008[/tpl]
On August 15, 1944, von Braun wrote a letter to Albin Sawatzki, manager of the V-2 production, admitting that he personally picked labor slaves from the Buchenwald concentration camp, who, in an interview 25 years later, he admitted had been in a "pitiful shape".[tpl]Failed verification|date=August 2010|reason=maybe source has moved?

Maybe source was the book "Power to Explore"?[/tpl]
In Wernher von Braun: Crusader for Space, numerous statements by von Braun show he was aware of the conditions but felt completely unable to change them. A friend quotes von Braun speaking of a visit to Mittelwerk:
 It is hellish. My spontaneous reaction was to talk to one of the SS guards, only to be told with unmistakable harshness that I should mind my own business, or find myself in the same striped fatigues!... I realized that any attempt of reasoning on humane grounds would be utterly futile.[tpl]cite book|author1=Ernst Stuhlinger|author2=Frederick Ira Ordway|title=Wernher von Braun, crusader for space: a biographical memoir|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7pZTAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=December 18, 2011|date=April 1994|publisher=Krieger Pub.|isbn=978-0-89464-842-7|page=42[/tpl] 
When asked if von Braun could have protested against the brutal treatment of the slave laborers, von Braun team member Konrad Dannenberg told The Huntsville Times, "If he had done it, in my opinion, he would have been shot on the spot."[tpl]cite news |work=The Huntsville Times |title=Aide says von Braun wasn't able to stop slave horrors; Objection would have gotten rocket pioneer shot, Dannenberg says |date=October 4, 2002 |first=Lee |last=Roop |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20021026180521/http://www.al.com/news/huntsvilletimes/index.ssf?/xml/story.ssf/html_standard.xsl?/base/news/1033754724262943.xml |archivedate=October 26, 2002 |url=http://www.al.com/news/huntsvilletimes/index.ssf?/xml/story.ssf/html_standard.xsl?/base/news/1033754724262943.xml[/tpl]
Others claim von Braun engaged in brutal treatment or approved of it. Guy Morand, a French resistance fighter who was a prisoner in Dora, testified in 1995 that after an apparent sabotage attempt that von Braun ordered a prisoner to be flogged,[tpl]Cite book |last=Biddle |first=Wayne |title=Dark Side of the Moon: Wernher von Braun, the Third Reich, and the Space Race |publisher=W.

===Arrest and release by the Nazi regime===

According to André Sellier, a French historian and survivor of the Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp, Himmler had von Braun come to his Hochwald HQ in East Prussia in February 1944.[tpl]cite book|last1=Sellier |first=André |year=2003 |title=A History of the Dora Camp: The Untold Story of the Nazi Slave Labor Camp That Secretly Manufactured V-2 Rockets |place=Chicago, IL |publisher=Ivan R Dee |isbn=1-56663-511-X[/tpl] To increase his power-base within the Nazi regime, Heinrich Himmler was conspiring to use Kammler to gain control of all German armament programs, including the V-2 program at Peenemünde.[tpl]rp|38–40[/tpl] He therefore recommended that von Braun work more closely with Kammler to solve the problems of the V-2. Von Braun claimed to have replied that the problems were merely technical and he was confident that they would be solved with Dornberger's assistance.
Von Braun had been under SD surveillance since October 1943. A report stated that he and his colleagues Riedel and Gröttrup were said to have expressed regret at an engineer's house one evening that they were not working on a spaceship and that they felt the war was not going well; this was considered a "defeatist" attitude. A young female dentist who was an SS spy reported their comments.[tpl]rp|38–40[/tpl] Combined with Himmler's false charges that von Braun was a communist sympathizer and had attempted to sabotage the V-2 program, and considering that von Braun regularly piloted his government-provided airplane that might allow him to escape to England, this led to his arrest by the Gestapo.[tpl]rp|38–40[/tpl]
The unsuspecting von Braun was detained on March 14 (or March 15),[tpl]cite web |title=Highlights in German Rocket Development from 1927–1945 |url=http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/vonbraun/highlights.html |work=MSFC History Office |publisher=NASA Marshall Space Flight Center[/tpl] 1944 and was taken to a Gestapo cell in Stettin (now Szczecin, Poland),[tpl]rp|38–40[/tpl] where he was held for two weeks without knowing the charges against him. Through the Abwehr in Berlin, Dornberger obtained von Braun's conditional release and Albert Speer, Reichsminister for Munitions and War Production, convinced Hitler to reinstate von Braun so that the V-2 program could continue.[tpl]rp|38–40[/tpl] Quoting from the "Führerprotokoll" (the minutes of Hitler's meetings) dated May 13, 1944 in his memoirs, Speer later relayed what Hitler had finally conceded: "In the matter concerning B. I will guarantee you that he will be exempt from persecution as long as he is indispensable for you, in spite of the difficult general consequences this will have."

===Surrender to the Americans===

The Soviet Army was about [tpl]convert|160|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] from Peenemünde in the spring of 1945 when von Braun assembled his planning staff and asked them to decide how and to whom they should surrender. Afraid of the well-known Soviet cruelty to prisoners of war, von Braun and his staff decided to try to surrender to the Americans. Kammler had ordered relocation of von Braun's team to central Germany; however, a conflicting order from an army chief ordered them to join the army and fight. Deciding that Kammler's order was their best bet to defect to the Americans, von Braun fabricated documents and transported 500 of his affiliates to the area around Mittelwerk, where they resumed their work. For fear of their documents being destroyed by the SS, von Braun ordered the blueprints to be hidden in an abandoned mine shaft in the Harz mountain range.[tpl]cite book|last=Cadbury|first=Deborah|authorlink=Deborah Cadbury|title=Space Race|year=2005|publisher=BBC Worldwide Limited|isbn=0-00-721299-2[/tpl]
While on an official trip in March, von Braun suffered a complicated fracture of his left arm and shoulder after his driver fell asleep at the wheel. His injuries were serious, but he insisted that his arm be set in a cast so he could leave the hospital. Due to this neglect of the injury he had to be hospitalized again a month later where his bones had to be re-broken and re-aligned.
In April, as the Allied forces advanced deeper into Germany, Kammler ordered the science team to be moved by train into the town of Oberammergau in the Bavarian Alps where they were closely guarded by the SS with orders to execute the team if they were about to fall into enemy hands. However, von Braun managed to convince SS Major Kummer to order the dispersion of the group into nearby villages so that they would not be an easy target for U.S. bombers.
On May 2, 1945, upon finding an American private from the U.S. 44th Infantry Division, von Braun's brother and fellow rocket engineer, Magnus, approached the soldier on a bicycle, calling out in broken English: "My name is Magnus von Braun. My brother invented the V-2.

The American high command was well aware of how important their catch was: von Braun had been at the top of the Black List, the code name for the list of German scientists and engineers targeted for immediate interrogation by U.S. military experts. On June 19, 1945, two days before the scheduled handover of the area to the Soviets, US Army Major Robert B. Staver, Chief of the Jet Propulsion Section of the Research and Intelligence Branch of the U.S. Army Ordnance Corps in London, and Lt Col R. L. Williams took von Braun and his department chiefs by jeep from Garmisch to Munich. The group was flown to Nordhausen, and was evacuated [tpl]convert|40|mi[/tpl] southwest to Witzenhausen, a small town in the American Zone, the next day.[tpl]cite book|last=McGovern|first=J|title=Crossbow and Overcast|year=1964|publisher=W.

The team included the young L.S. Snell, then the leading British rocket engineer, later chief designer of Rolls-Royce Limited and inventor of the Concorde's engines.

==American career==

===U.S. Army career===

On June 20, 1945, the U.S. Secretary of State approved the transfer of von Braun and his specialists to America; however this was not announced to the public until October 1, 1945.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.v2rocket.com/start/chapters/paperclip.gif |title=Outstanding German Scientists Being Brought to U.S. |work=War Department press release |date=October 1, 1945 |publisher=V2Rocket.com[/tpl] Archived Von Braun was among those scientists for whom the U.S. Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency created false employment histories and expunged Nazi Party memberships and regime affiliations from the public record. Once “bleached” of their Nazism, the US Government granted the scientists security clearance to work in the United States.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]
The first seven technicians arrived in the United States at New Castle Army Air Field, just south of Wilmington, Delaware, on September 20, 1945. They were then flown to Boston and taken by boat to the Army Intelligence Service post at Fort Strong in Boston Harbor. Later, with the exception of von Braun, the men were transferred to Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland to sort out the Peenemünde documents, enabling the scientists to continue their rocketry experiments.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]
Finally, von Braun and his remaining Peenemünde staff (see List of German rocket scientists in the United States) were transferred to their new home at Fort Bliss, a large Army installation just north of El Paso. Von Braun would later write he found it hard to develop a "genuine emotional attachment" to his new surroundings."Red Moon Rising: Sputnik and the Hidden Rivalries That Ignited the Space Age", Matthew Brzezinski. Macmillan, 2008. ISBN 0-8050-8858-X, 9780805088588. pp. 84, 85, 87, 91, 92 His chief design engineer Walther Reidel became the subject of a December 1946 article "German Scientist Says American Cooking Tasteless; Dislikes Rubberized Chicken,' exposing the presence of von Braun's team in the country and drawing criticism from Albert Einstein and John Dingell. Requests to improve their living conditions such as laying linoleum over their cracked wood flooring were rejected. Von Braun remarked that "...at Peenemünde we had been coddled, here you were counting pennies..." At the age of 26, von Braun had thousands of engineers who answered to him, but was now answering to "pimply" 26 year-old Major Jim Hamill who possessed an undergraduate degree in engineering. His loyal Germans still addressed him as Herr Professor, but Hamill addressed him as Wernher and never bothered to respond to von Braun's request for more materials, and every proposal for new rocket ideas was dismissed.
While there, they trained military, industrial and university personnel in the intricacies of rockets and guided missiles. As part of the Hermes project, they helped refurbish, assemble, and launch a number of V-2s that had been shipped from Germany to the White Sands Proving Ground in New Mexico. They also continued to study the future potential of rockets for military and research applications. Since they were not permitted to leave Fort Bliss without military escort, von Braun and his colleagues began to refer to themselves only half-jokingly as "PoPs," "Prisoners of Peace."[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]
In 1950, at the start of the Korean War, von Braun and his team were transferred to Huntsville, Alabama, his home for the next 20 years. Between 1950 and 1956, von Braun led the Army's rocket development team at Redstone Arsenal, resulting in the Redstone rocket, which was used for the first live nuclear ballistic missile tests conducted by the United States. This led to development of the first high-precision inertial guidance system on the Redstone rocket.[tpl]cite web|last=Bucher, G. C.; Mc Call, J. C.; Ordway, F.

As director of the Development Operations Division of the Army Ballistic Missile Agency (ABMA), von Braun, with his team, then developed the Jupiter-C, a modified Redstone rocket.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,862899-1,00.html |work=TIME Magazine |title=Reach for the Stars |date=February 17, 1958[/tpl] The Jupiter-C successfully launched the West's first satellite, Explorer 1, on January 31, 1958. This event signaled the birth of America's space program.
Despite the work on the Redstone rocket, the twelve years from 1945 to 1957 were probably some of the most frustrating for von Braun and his colleagues. In the Soviet Union, Sergei Korolev and his team of scientists and engineers plowed ahead with several new rocket designs and the Sputnik program, while the American government was not very interested in von Braun's work or views and only embarked on a very modest rocket-building program. In the meantime, the press tended to dwell on von Braun's past as a member of the SS and the slave labor used to build his V-2 rockets.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]

===Popular concepts for a human presence in space===

Repeating the pattern he had established during his earlier career in Germany, von Braun – while directing military rocket development in the real world – continued to entertain his engineer-scientist's dream of a future world in which rockets would be used for space exploration. However, instead of risking being sacked, he now was increasingly in a position to popularize these ideas. The May 14, 1950 headline of The Huntsville Times ("Dr. von Braun Says Rocket Flights Possible to Moon") might have marked the beginning of these efforts. These disclosures rode a moonflight publicity wave that was created by the two 1950 U.S. science fiction films, Destination Moon and Rocketship X-M.
In 1952, von Braun first published his concept of a manned space station in a Collier's Weekly magazine series of articles entitled "Man Will Conquer Space Soon!". These articles were illustrated by the space artist Chesley Bonestell and were influential in spreading his ideas. Frequently von Braun worked with fellow German-born space advocate and science writer Willy Ley to publish his concepts, which, unsurprisingly, were heavy on the engineering side and anticipated many technical aspects of space flight that later became reality.
The space station (to be constructed using rockets with recoverable and reusable ascent stages) would be a toroid structure, with a diameter of [tpl]convert|250|ft|m[/tpl]; this built on the concept of a rotating wheel-shaped station introduced in 1929 by Herman Potočnik in his book The Problem of Space Travel – The Rocket Motor. The space station would spin around a central docking nave to provide artificial gravity, and would be assembled in a [tpl]convert|1,075|mi|km[/tpl] two-hour, high-inclination Earth orbit allowing observation of essentially every point on earth on at least a daily basis. The ultimate purpose of the space station would be to provide an assembly platform for manned lunar expeditions. More than a decade later, the movie version of 2001: A Space Odyssey would draw heavily on the design concept in its visualization of an orbital space station.
Von Braun envisaged these expeditions as very large-scale undertakings, with a total of 50 astronauts travelling in three huge spacecraft (two for crew, one primarily for cargo), each [tpl]convert|49|m|2|abbr=on[/tpl] long and [tpl]convert|33|m|2|abbr=on[/tpl] in diameter and driven by a rectangular array of 30 rocket propulsion engines.[tpl]cite web|url=http://er.jsc.nasa.gov/seh/lunarlan.html |title=Gallery of Wernher von Braun Moonship Sketches |work=The Space Educator's Handbook |publisher=NASA Johnson Space Center |first=Jerry |last=Woodfill[/tpl] Archived Upon arrival, astronauts would establish a permanent lunar base in the Sinus Roris region by using the emptied cargo holds of their craft as shelters, and would explore their surroundings for eight weeks. This would include a [tpl]convert|400|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] expedition in pressurized rovers to the crater Harpalus and the Mare Imbrium foothills.
At this time von Braun also worked out preliminary concepts for a manned mission to Mars that used the space station as a staging point. His initial plans, published in The Mars Project (1952), had envisaged a fleet of ten spacecraft (each with a mass of 3,720 metric tons), three of them unmanned and each carrying one 200-ton winged lander[tpl]cite web |url=http://er.jsc.nasa.gov/seh/vonlift.html |title=Gallery of Wernher von Braun Mars Exploration Sketches |work=The Space Educator's Handbook |publisher=NASA Johnson Space Center |first=Jerry |last=Woodfill[/tpl] Archived in addition to cargo, and nine crew vehicles transporting a total of 70 astronauts. Gigantic as this mission plan was, its engineering and astronautical parameters were thoroughly calculated. A later project was much more modest, using only one purely orbital cargo ship and one crewed craft. In each case, the expedition would use minimum-energy Hohmann transfer orbits for its trips to Mars and back to Earth.
Before technically formalizing his thoughts on human spaceflight to Mars, von Braun had written a science fiction novel on the subject, set in the year 1980. However, the manuscript was rejected by no less than 18 publishers.[tpl]cite book | last1=Bergaust | first=Erik |year=1976 |title=Wernher von Braun: The authoritative and definitive biographical profile of the father of modern space flight (Hardcover) |place= |publisher=National Space Institute (1976) |isbn=0-917680-01-4 [/tpl] Von Braun later published small portions of this opus in magazines, to illustrate selected aspects of his Mars project popularizations. The complete manuscript, titled Project MARS: A Technical Tale, did not appear as a printed book until December 2006.von Braun, Wernher: Project MARS: A Technical Tale. ISBN 0-9738203-3-0, ISBN 978-0-9738203-3-1
In the hope that its involvement would bring about greater public interest in the future of the space program, von Braun also began working with Walt Disney and the Disney studios as a technical director, initially for three television films about space exploration. The initial broadcast devoted to space exploration was Man in Space, which first went on air on March 9, 1955, drawing 42 million viewers and unofficially the second-highest rated television show in American history."How to Be Like Walt: Capturing the Disney Magic Every Day of Your Life", Pat Williams, Jim Denney. HCI, 2004. ISBN 0-7573-0231-9, ISBN 978-0-7573-0231-2. p. 237
Later (in 1959) von Braun published a short booklet"Wernher von Braun: First Men to the Moon". Reprint by Henry Holt & Co., Inc., January 2000, ISBN 978-0-03-030295-4 – condensed from episodes that had appeared in This Week Magazine before—describing his updated concept of the first manned lunar landing. The scenario included only a single and relatively small spacecraft—a winged lander with a crew of only two experienced pilots who had already circumnavigated the moon on an earlier mission. The brute-force direct ascent flight schedule used a rocket design with five sequential stages, loosely based on the Nova designs that were under discussion at this time. After a night launch from a Pacific island the first three stages would bring the spacecraft (with the two remaining upper stages attached) to terrestrial escape velocity, with each burn creating an acceleration of 8–9 times standard gravity. Residual propellant in the third stage would be used for the deceleration intended to commence only a few hundred kilometers above the landing site in a crater near the lunar north pole. The fourth stage provided acceleration to lunar escape velocity while the fifth stage would be responsible for a deceleration during return to the Earth to a residual speed that allows aerocapture of the spacecraft ending in a runway landing, much in the way of the Space Shuttle. One remarkable feature of this technical tale is that the engineer Wernher von Braun anticipated a medical phenomenon that would become apparent only years later: being a veteran astronaut with no history of serious adverse reactions to weightlessness offers no protection against becoming unexpectedly and violently spacesick.

===Concepts for orbital warfare===

Von Braun developed and published his space station concept during the very "coldest" time of the Cold War, when the U.S. government for which he worked put the containment of the Soviet Union above everything else. The fact that his space station – if armed with missiles that could be easily adapted from those already available at this time – would give the United States space superiority in both orbital and orbit-to-ground warfare did not escape him. Although von Braun took care to qualify such military applications as "particularly dreadful" in his popular writings, he elaborated on them in several of his books and articles. This much less peaceful aspect of von Braun's "drive for space" has recently been reviewed by Michael J. Neufeld from the Space History Division of the National Air and Space Museum in Washington.Neufeld MJ: "Space superiority: Wernher von Braun's campaign for a nuclear-armed space station, 1946–1956". Space Policy 2006; 22:52–62.

===NASA career===

The U.S. Navy had been tasked with building a rocket to lift satellites into orbit, but the resulting Vanguard rocket launch system was unreliable. In 1957, with the launch of Sputnik 1, there was a growing belief within the United States that America lagged behind the Soviet Union in the emerging Space Race. American authorities then chose to utilize von Braun and his German team's experience with missiles to create an orbital launch vehicle, Wernher von Braun had originally proposed in 1954 but had been denied.
NASA was established by law on July 29, 1958. One day later, the 50th Redstone rocket was successfully launched from Johnston Atoll in the south Pacific as part of Operation Hardtack I. Two years later, NASA opened the Marshall Space Flight Center at Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, and the ABMA development team led by von Braun was transferred to NASA. In a face-to-face meeting with Herb York at the Pentagon, von Braun made it clear he would go to NASA only if development of the Saturn was allowed to continue.[tpl]cite web |url=http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/ch2.htm |title=Stages to Saturn – The Saturn Building Blocks – THE ABMA TRANSFER |publisher=NASA[/tpl] Presiding from July 1960 to February 1970, von Braun became the center's first Director.
Von Braun's early years at NASA were not without some disappointments. One of those was the "infamous four inch flight" during which the first unmanned Mercury-Redstone rocket only rose a few inches before settling back onto the launch pad. It was later determined that the launch failure was the result of a "power plug with one prong shorter than the other because a worker filed it to make it fit."  Because of the difference in the length of one prong the launch system detected the difference in the power disconnection as a "cut-off signal to the engine."  The system stopped the launch, and the incident created a "nadir of morale in Project Mercury."
The Marshall Center's first major program was the development of Saturn rockets to carry heavy payloads into and beyond Earth orbit. From this, the Apollo program for manned moon flights was developed. Wernher von Braun initially pushed for a flight engineering concept that called for an Earth orbit rendezvous technique (the approach he had argued for building his space station), but in 1962 he converted to the lunar orbit rendezvous concept that was subsequently realized.[tpl]cite web |format=PDF |url=http://history.nasa.gov/Apollomon/apollo6.pdf |title=Concluding Remarks by Dr. Wernher von Braun about Mode Selection for the Lunar Landing Program |work=Lunar Orbit Rendezvous File |publisher=NASA Historical Reference Collection |date=June 7, 1962[/tpl] During Apollo, he worked closely with former Peenemünde teammate, Kurt H. Debus, the first director of the Kennedy Space Center. His dream to help mankind set foot on the Moon became a reality on July 16, 1969 when a Marshall-developed Saturn V rocket launched the crew of Apollo 11 on its historic eight-day mission. Over the course of the program, Saturn V rockets enabled six teams of astronauts to reach the surface of the Moon.
During the late 1960s, von Braun was instrumental in the development of the U.S. Space & Rocket Center in Huntsville. The desk from which he guided America's entry in the Space Race remains on display there.
During the local summer of 1966–67, von Braun participated in a field trip to Antarctica, organized for him and several other members of top NASA management."Space Man's Look at Antarctica". Popular Science, Vol. 190, No. 5, May 1967, pp. 114–116.  The goal of the field trip was to determine whether the experience gained by US scientific and technological community during the exploration of Antarctic wastelands would be useful for the manned exploration of space. Von Braun was mainly interested in management of the scientific effort on Antarctic research stations, logistics, habitation and life support, and in using the barren Antarctic terrain like the glacial dry valleys to test the equipment that one day would be used to look for signs of life on Mars and other worlds.
In an internal memo dated January 16, 1969,[tpl]cite web |url=http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/vonbraun/announcement_4.pdf |title=Adjustment to Marshall Organization, Announcement No. 4 |work=MSFC History Office |publisher=NASA Marshall Space Flight Center |date=January 16, 1969 |first=Wernher |last=von Braun[/tpl] von Braun had confirmed to his staff that he would stay on as a center director at Huntsville to head the Apollo Applications Program. A few months later, on occasion of the first moon-landing, he publicly expressed his optimism that the Saturn V carrier system would continue to be developed, advocating manned missions to Mars in the 1980s.[tpl]cite news |coauthors= |title=Next, Mars and Beyond |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,901107,00.html |quote=Even as man prepared to take his first tentative extraterrestrial steps, other celestial adventures beckoned him. The shape and scope of the post-Apollo manned space program remained hazy, and a great deal depends on the safe and successful outcome of Apollo 11. But well before the moon flight was launched, NASA was casting eyes on targets far beyond the moon. The most inviting: the earth's close, and probably most hospitable, planetary neighbor. Given the same energy and dedication that took them to the moon, says Wernher von Braun, Americans could land on Mars as early as 1982. |publisher=Time (magazine) |date=July 25, 1969 |accessdate=June 21, 2007 [/tpl]
However, on March 1, 1970, von Braun and his family relocated to Washington, D.C., when he was assigned the post of NASA's Deputy Associate Administrator for Planning at NASA Headquarters. After a series of conflicts associated with the truncation of the Apollo program, and facing severe budget constraints, von Braun retired from NASA on May 26, 1972. Not only had it become evident by this time that his and NASA's visions for future U.S. space flight projects were incompatible; it was perhaps even more frustrating for him to see popular support for a continued presence of man in space wane dramatically once the goal to reach the moon had been accomplished.
Dr. von Braun also developed the idea of a Space Camp that would train children in fields of science and space technologies as well as help their mental development much the same way sports camps aim at improving physical development.
[tpl]rp|354–355[/tpl]

===Career after NASA===

After leaving NASA, von Braun became Vice President for Engineering and Development at the aerospace company, Fairchild Industries in Germantown, Maryland on July 1, 1972.
In 1973 a routine health check revealed kidney cancer, which during the following years could not be controlled by surgery.German sources mostly specify the cancer as renal, while American biographies unanimously just mention cancer. The time when von Braun learned about the disease is generally given as between 1973 and 1976. The characteristics of renal cell carcinoma, which has a bad prognosis even today, do not rule out either time limit. Von Braun continued his work to the extent possible, which included accepting invitations to speak at colleges and universities as he was eager to cultivate interest in human spaceflight and rocketry, particularly with students and a new generation of engineers.
Von Braun helped establish and promote the National Space Institute, a precursor of the present-day National Space Society, in 1975, and became its first president and chairman. In 1976, he became scientific consultant to Lutz Kayser, the CEO of OTRAG, and a member of the Daimler-Benz board of directors. However, his deteriorating health forced him to retire from Fairchild on December 31, 1976. When the 1975 National Medal of Science was awarded to him in early 1977 he was hospitalized, and unable to attend the White House ceremony.

==Engineering philosophy==

Von Braun's insistence on further tests after Mercury-Redstone 2 flew higher than planned has been identified as contributing to the Soviet Union's success in launching the first human in space.[tpl]cite book|last=Launius|first=Roger|title=To Reach the Higher Frontier: A History of U.S. Launch Vehicles|year=2002|publisher=University of Kentucky|isbn=0-8131-2245-7[/tpl] The Mercury-Redstone BD flight was successful, but took up the launch slot that could have put Alan Shepard into space three weeks ahead of Yuri Gagarin. His Soviet counterpart Sergei Korolev insisted on two successful flights with dogs before risking Gagarin's life on a manned attempt. The second test flight took place one day after the Mercury-Redstone BD mission.[tpl]rp|[/tpl]
Von Braun took a very conservative approach to engineering, designing with ample safety factors and redundant structure. This became a point of contention with other engineers, who struggled to keep vehicle weight down so that payload could be maximized. Krafft Ehricke likened von Braun's approach to building the Brooklyn Bridge.[tpl]cite book | last = Sloop | first = John L. | title= Liquid hydrogen as a propulsion fuel, 1945-1959 | series = The NASA history series | volume = SP-4404 | year = 1978 | url = http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19790008823.pdf[/tpl][tpl]rp|208[/tpl] Many at NASA headquarters jokingly referred to Marshall as the "Chicago Bridge and Iron Works," but acknowledged that the designs worked.[tpl]cite episode | title = To the Moon | series = NOVA | date = July 13, 1999 | url = http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/2610tothemoon.html[/tpl] The conservative approach paid off when a fifth engine was added to the Saturn C-4, producing the Saturn V. The C-4 design had a large crossbeam that could easily absorb the thrust of an additional engine.[tpl]rp|371[/tpl]

==Personal life==

Von Braun had a charismatic personality and was known as a ladies' man.  As a student in Berlin, he would often be seen in the evenings in the company of two girlfriends at once.[tpl]rp|63[/tpl] He later had a succession of affairs within the secretarial and computer pool at Peenemünde.[tpl]rp|92–94[/tpl] In January 1943, he became engaged to Dorothee Brill, a physical education teacher in Berlin, and sought permission from the SS Race and Settlement Office to marry.  However, the engagement was broken due to his mother's opposition.[tpl]rp|146–147[/tpl] Later in 1943, while preparing V-2 launch sites in northeastern France, von Braun had an affair in Paris with a Frenchwoman, who was imprisoned for collaboration after the War and became destitute.[tpl]rp|147–148[/tpl]
During his stay at Fort Bliss, von Braun proposed marriage to Maria Luise von Quistorp (born [tpl]birth date|1928|06|10[/tpl]), his maternal first cousin, in a letter to his father. On March 1, 1947, having received permission to go back to Germany and return with his bride, he married her in a Lutheran church in Landshut, Germany. He and his bride, as well as his father and mother, returned to New York on March 26, 1947. On December 9, 1948, the von Brauns' first daughter, Iris Careen, was born at Fort Bliss Army Hospital.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,862899,00.html |work=TIME Magazine |title=Reach for the Stars |date=February 17, 1958[/tpl] The von Brauns had two more children, Margrit Cécile in 1952 and Peter Constantine in 1960.
On April 15, 1955, von Braun became a naturalized citizen of the United States.
