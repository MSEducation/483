An EMD GP15T is a 4-axle diesel-electric locomotive built by General Motors Electro-Motive Division between October 1982 and April 1983.  It was a very close cousin to the GP15-1, but used a turbocharger in order to generate more power from a smaller engine. Power was provided by an 8-cylinder diesel engine that generated [tpl]convert|1,500|hp|MW|2|abbr=on|lk=in[/tpl], the same as the GP15-1, but with four fewer cylinders. 
28 examples of this locomotive model were built for American railroads. The Chessie System received the majority of them as C&O 1500-1524 (25 units), while the rest went to the Apalachicola Northern in Florida as AN 720-722 (3 units).
Chessie Systems GP15Ts are equipped with dynamic braking and the optional inertial air filtration system, whereas ANs GP15Ts do not have dynamic braking, and also utilize the standard non-inertial intake system.
