==Description==

Polari is a mixture of Romance (Italian"British Spies: Licensed to be Gay." Time. 19 August 2008 or Mediterranean Lingua Franca), London slang, backslang, rhyming slang, sailor slang, and thieves' cant. Later it expanded to contain words from the Yiddish language, from the US forces (present in the UK during World War II) and from 1960s drug users. It was a constantly developing form of language, with a small core lexicon of about 20 words (including [tpl]lang|pld|bona[/tpl], [tpl]lang|pld|ajax[/tpl], [tpl]lang|pld|eek[/tpl], [tpl]lang|pld|cod[/tpl], [tpl]lang|pld|naff[/tpl], [tpl]lang|pld|lattie[/tpl], [tpl]lang|pld|nanti[/tpl], [tpl]lang|pld|omi[/tpl], [tpl]lang|pld|palone[/tpl], [tpl]lang|pld|riah[/tpl], [tpl]lang|pld|zhoosh[/tpl] ([tpl]lang|pld|tjuz[/tpl]), [tpl]lang|pld|TBH[/tpl], [tpl]lang|pld|trade[/tpl], [tpl]lang|pld|vada[/tpl]), and over 500 other lesser-known words.Baker, Paul (2002) Fantabulosa: A Dictionary of Polari and Gay Slang. London: Continuum ISBN 0-8264-5961-7 A Channel 4 television documentary revealed that (in London) there was once an "East End" version which stressed Cockney rhyming slang and a "West End" version which stressed theatrical and Classical influences. There was some interchange between the two.

==Usage==

Polari was used in London fishmarkets, the theatre, fairgrounds and circuses, hence the many borrowings from Romany. As many homosexual men worked in theatrical entertainment it was also used among the gay subculture, at a time when homosexual activity was illegal, to disguise homosexuals from hostile outsiders and undercover policemen. It was also used extensively in the British Merchant Navy, where many gay men joined ocean liners and cruise ships as waiters, stewards and entertainers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/mediacentre/displayrelease.aspx?id=563 |title=Gay men in the Merchant Marine, Liverpool Maritime Museum |publisher=Liverpoolmuseums.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-10-03[/tpl] On one hand, it would be used as a means of cover to allow gay subjects to be discussed aloud without being understood; on the other hand, it was also used by some, particularly the most visibly camp and effeminate, as a further way of asserting their identity.
The almost identical Parlyaree has been spoken in fairgrounds since at least the seventeenth centuryPartridge, Eric (1937) Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English and continues to be used by show travellers in England and Scotland. As theatrical booths, circus acts and menageries were once a common part of European fairs it is likely that the roots of Polari/Parlyaree lie in the period before both theatre and circus became independent of the fairgrounds. The Parlyaree spoken on fairgrounds tends to borrow much more from Romany, as well as other languages and argots spoken by travelling people, such as cant and backslang.
Henry Mayhew gave a verbatim account of Polari as part of an interview with a Punch and Judy showman in the 1850s. The discussion he recorded references the arrival of Punch in England, crediting these early shows to a performer from Italy called Porcini (see also John Payne Collier's account of Porsini—Payne Collier calls him Porchini—in Punch and Judy).Punch and Judy. (with Illustrations by George Cruickshank). Thomas Hailes Lacey, London, 1859 Mayhew provides the following:[tpl]Clarify|date=January 2010[/tpl]
 
 Punch Talk
"'[tpl]lang|pld|Bona Parle[/tpl]' means language; name of patter. '[tpl]lang|pld|Yeute munjare[/tpl]' – no food. '[tpl]lang|pld|Yeute lente[/tpl]' – no bed. '[tpl]lang|pld|Yeute bivare[/tpl]' – no drink. I've '[tpl]lang|pld|yeute munjare[/tpl],' and '[tpl]lang|pld|yeute bivare[/tpl],' and, what's worse, '[tpl]lang|pld|yeute lente[/tpl].' This is better than the costers' talk, because that ain't no slang and all, and this is a broken Italian, and much higher than the costers' lingo. We know what o'clock it is, besides."
There are additional accounts of particular words that relate to puppet performance: "'[tpl]lang|pld|Slumarys[/tpl]' – figures, frame, scenes, properties. '[tpl]lang|pld|Slum[/tpl]' – call, or unknown tongue" ("unknown" is a reference to the "swazzle", a voice modifier used by Punch performers, the structure of which was a longstanding trade secret).

==Decline in use==

Polari had begun to fall into disuse amongst the gay subculture by the late 1960s. The popularity of the Julian and Sandy characters played by Kenneth Williams and Hugh Paddick ensured that this secret language became public property, and the gay liberationists of the 1970s viewed it as rather degrading, divisive and politically incorrect as it was often used to gossip about, or criticise, others, as well as to discuss sexual exploits.  In addition, the need for a secret subculture code declined with the legalisation of adult homosexual acts in England and Wales in 1967.

==In popular culture==

Polari was popularised in the 1960s by camp characters Julian and Sandy in the popular BBC radio show Round the Horne starring Kenneth Horne, Kenneth Williams and Hugh Paddick.
In the first series of British comedians' panel television series Jokers Wild (1969), comedian Ray Martine is asked to explain the term palone (woman), which he used while telling a joke. In response to the definition, programme presenter Barry Cryer refers to Martine as a bona omi (good man).

==Use today==

Since the mid-1990s, with the redistribution of tapes and CDs of Round The Horne, and with increasing academic interest, Polari has undergone something of a revival. New words are being invented and updated to refer to more recent cultural concepts.
In 1990 Morrissey titled an album Bona Drag—Polari for "nice outfit." The same year Morrisey released the single "Piccadilly Palare," the title being a Polari description of male prostitution.
Also in 1990, comic book writer Grant Morrison created the Polari-speaking character Danny the Street (based on Danny La Rue), a sentient transvestite street, for the comic Doom Patrol.
The 1998 film Velvet Goldmine, which chronicles a fictional retelling of the rise and fall of glam rock, contains a flashback to 1970 in which a group of characters converse in Polari, while their words are humorously subtitled below.
In 2002, two books on Polari were published, Polari: The Lost Language of Gay Men, and Fantabulosa: A Dictionary of Polari and Gay Slang (both by Paul Baker). Also in 2002, hip hop artist Juha released an album called Polari, with the chorus of the title song written entirely in the slang.
Characters in Will Self's story, Foie Humain, the first part of Liver, use Polari.
Comedians Rik Mayall, Paul O'Grady, Julian Clary, David Walliams, and Matt Lucas  incorporate Polari in their comedy routines.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl]

==Entry into standard English==

A number of words from Polari have entered mainstream slang; some recent examples are:

===Naff===

The Polari word [tpl]lang|pld|naff[/tpl], meaning inferior or tacky, has an uncertain etymology. Michael Quinion states that it is probably from the sixteenth-century Italian word [tpl]lang|it|gnaffa[/tpl], meaning "a despicable person".
There are a number of folk etymologies, many based on acronyms—Not Available For Fucking, Normal As Fuck—though these are backronyms. More likely etymologies include northern UK dialect naffhead, naffin, or naffy, a simpleton or blockhead; niffy-naffy, inconsequential, stupid, or Scots nyaff, a term of contempt for any unpleasant or objectionable person. An alternative etymology may lie in the Romany [tpl]lang|rom|naflo[/tpl], itself rooted in násfalo, meaning ill.
The phrase "naff off" was used euphemistically in place of "fuck off" along with the intensifier "naffing" in Billy Liar by Keith Waterhouse (1959).[ref]

p35 "Naff off, Stamp, for Christ sake!" p46 "Well which one of them's got the naffing engagement ring?"
[/ref]
Usage of "naff" increased in the 1970s when television sitcom Porridge employed it as an alternative to expletives which were not considered broadcastable at the time. 
Princess Anne famously told reporters to "Naff Orf!" at the Badminton horse trials in April 1982.

===Zhoosh===

"[tpl]lang|pld|Zhoosh[/tpl]" ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|ʒ|ʊ|ʃ[/tpl], [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|ʒ|uː|ʃ|[/tpl] or [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|ʒ|ʊ|ʒ[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/zhoosh |title=Definition for zhoosh - Oxford Dictionaries Online (World English) |publisher=Oxforddictionaries.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-12[/tpl]), meaning to smarten up, style or improve something, has become commonplace more recently, having been used on the TV series Queer Eye for the Straight Guy and What Not to Wear. Its initial consonant has led new users to generate variant spellings such as "zoosh", "soozh", "tszuj", "zhoozh" "juushz" etc.[tpl]Clarify| reason = (i) Does this mean that "new users" pronounce the initial consonant differently from ʒ, or that they are trying to represent the ʒ sound in a variety of ways? (ii) Why would the variant spelling "zhoozh" have anything to do with the *initial* consonant?|date=June 2011[/tpl] In some pronunciations, the word begins and ends with the same phoneme, the voiced postalveolar fricative, which can be heard as the "s" sound in the words "television" and "pleasure". Others pronounce the final consonant like the "sh" in "push".
