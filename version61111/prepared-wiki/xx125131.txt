</ref>  The controversy attracted the attention of the [[Westboro Baptist Church]] which announced it would hold a protest at the school.<ref name="Webb_City_Fag_Churches_11-11-2004">

In the days following Mathewson's suspension, students on both sides of the Mathewson issue wore t-shirts, bumper stickers, and other displays of their beliefs.  Some opposed to Mathewson wore shirts supporting a ban on gay marriage, while at least one student in support of Mathewson wore a shirt reading "I Love Lesbians."  Lastaysha Myers, a friend and supporter of Mathewson, was later suspended for wearing pro-gay rights shirts on several occasions.  The ACLU filed a lawsuit in April 2005 on her behalf.[ref]

On the day of the Westboro Baptist Church's protest, the protesters were greatly outnumbered by counter-protesters against the church.  While the counter-protesters were not necessarily supporting the rights of Mathewson, or of gays in general, they were protesting the incendiary tactics of the church.  Mathewson's suit was withdrawn because he dropped out of school.  Myers' suit was withdrawn when the school district agreed to not limit the free speech of their students.[ref]
