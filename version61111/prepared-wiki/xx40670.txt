After the premiere the writer Leon Vallas opined that Stravinsky had written music 30 years ahead of its time, suitable to be heard in 1940. Coincidentally, it was in that year that Walt Disney released Fantasia, an animated feature film using music from The Rite and other classical compositions. The Rite segment of the film depicted the Earth's prehistory, leading to the extinction of the dinosaurs. Among those impressed by the film was Gunther Schuller, later a composer, conductor and jazz scholar. The Rite of Spring sequence, he says, overwhelmed him and determined his future career in music: "I hope Stravinsky appreciated that hundreds—perhaps thousands—of musicians were turned onto The Rite of Spring ... through Fantasia, musicians who might otherwise never have heard the work, or at least not until many years later".[tpl]cite journal|last= Teachout|first= Terry|title= Why 'Fantasia' Mattered—Just Ask Gunther Schuller|url= http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204644504576653263235079674.html?mod=googlenews_wsj%3Cbr%20/%3E|journal= Wall Street Journal|date= 28 October 2011[/tpl] In later life Stravinsky claimed distaste for the adaptation, though as Ross remarks, he said nothing critical at the time; according to Ross, the composer Paul Hindemith observed that "Igor appears to love it".Ross, pp. 297–98

==Recordings==

Before the first gramophone disc recordings of The Rite were issued in 1929, Stravinsky had helped to produce a pianola version of the work for the Aeolian Company. He also created a much more comprehensive arrangement for the French player piano company Pleyel, with whom he signed a contract in 1923 under which many of his early works were reproduced on this medium.White 1979, pp. 619–20 The Pleyel version of The Rite of Spring was issued in 1921; the British pianolist Rex Lawson recorded the work in this form in 1990.Hill, pp. 162–64
In 1929 Stravinsky and Monteux vied with each other to conduct the first orchestral gramophone recording of The Rite. While Stravinsky led L'Orchestre des Concerts Straram in a recording for the Columbia label, at the same time Monteux was recording it for the HMV label. Stokowski's version followed in 1930. Stravinsky made two more recordings, in 1940 and 1960.Hill, pp. 118–19 According to the critic Edward Greenfield, Stravinsky was not technically a great conductor but, Greenfield says, in the 1960 recording with the Columbia Symphony Orchestra the composer inspired a performance with "extraordinary thrust and resilience".[tpl]cite journal|authorlink= Edward Greenfield|last= Greenfield|first= Edward|title= Distinctive movements in the rites of rivals|journal= The Guardian|date= 20 May 1988|pages= p. 34[/tpl] In conversations with Robert Craft, Stravinsky reviewed several recordings of The Rite made in the 1960s. He thought Herbert von Karajan's 1963 recording with the Berlin Philharmonic, was good, but "the performance is ... too polished, a pet savage rather than a real one". Stravinsky thought that Pierre Boulez, with the Orchestre National de France (1963), was "less good than I had hoped ... very bad tempi and some tasteless alterations". A recording by The Moscow State Symphony Orchestra in 1962 was complimented by the composer for making the music sound Russian "which is just right", but Stravinsky's concluding judgement is that none of these three performances is worth preserving.Stravinsky and Craft 1982, pp. 88–89
As of 2013 there are well over 100 different recordings of The Rite commercially available, and many more held in library sound archives. It has become one of the most recorded of all 20th century musical works.[tpl]cite web|title= Stravinsky: The Rite of Spring (Le Sacre du Printemps)|url= http://www.prestoclassical.co.uk/w/53903/Igor-Feodorovich-Stravinsky-The-Rite-of-Spring|publisher= Presto Classical|accessdate= 27 August 2012[/tpl] A work that addresses this wealth of available recorded versions is Stefan Goldmanns "Edit", mounting one continuous recording from hundreds of cut segments from 14 recorded versions.[tpl]cite web|title= Stefan Goldmann: Le Sacre du Printemps Edit|url= http://www.littlewhiteearbuds.com/review/igor-stravinsky-le-sacre-du-printemps-stefan-goldmann-edit/|publisher= Little White Earbuds|accessdate= 15 October 2013[/tpl]

==Editions==

The first published score was the four-hand piano arrangement (Edition Russe de Musique, RV196), dated 1913. Publication of the full orchestral score was prevented by the outbreak of war in August 1914. After the revival of the work in 1920 Stravinsky, who had not heard the music for seven years, made numerous revisions to the score, which was finally published in 1921 (Edition Russe de Musique, RV 197/197b. large and pocket scores).
In 1922 Ansermet, who was preparing to perform the work in Berlin, sent to Stravinsky a list of errors he had found in the published score. In 1926, as part of his preparation for that year's performance with the Concertgebouw Orchestra, Stravinsky rewrote the "Evocation of the Ancestors" section and made substantial changes to the "Sacrificial Dance". The extent of these revisions, together with Ansermet's recommendations, convinced Stravinsky that a new edition was necessary, and this appeared in large and pocket form in 1929. It did not, however, incorporate all of Ansermet's amendments and, confusingly, bore the date and RV code of the 1921 edition, making the new edition hard to identify.
Stravinsky continued to revise the work, and in 1943 rewrote the "Sacrificial Dance". In 1948 Boosey and Hawkes issued a corrected version of the 1929 score (B&H 16333); Stravinsky's substantial 1943 amendment of the "Sacrificial Dance" was not incorporated into the new version and remained unperformed, to the composer's disappointment. He considered it "much easier to play ... and superior in balance and sonority" to the earlier versions.[tpl]cite journal|authorlink= Robert Craft|last= Craft|first= Robert|title=Le Sacre du Printemps: The Revisions|journal= Tempo|volume= New Series|issue= 122|date= September 1977|jstor= 945096[/tpl] [tpl]subscription[/tpl] A less musical motive for the revisions and corrected editions was copyright law. The composer had left Galaxy music publishing (agents for Editions Russe de la Musique, the original publisher) for Associated Music Publishers at the time, and orchestras would be reluctant to pay a second rental charge from two publishers to match the full work and the revised Sacrificial Dance; moreover, the revised dance could only be published in America. The 1948 score provided copyright protection to the work in America, where it had lapsed, but Boosey (who acquired the Editions Russe catalogue) did not have the rights to the revised finale.Walsh, pp. 151–52
The 1929 score as revised in 1948 forms the basis of most modern performances of The Rite. Boosey and Hawkes reissued their 1948 edition in 1965, and produced a newly engraved edition (B&H 19441) in 1967. The firm also issued an unmodified reprint of the 1913 piano reduction in 1952 (B&H 17271) and a revised piano version, incorporating the 1929 revisions, in 1967.
The Paul Sacher Foundation, in association with Boosey and Hawkes, announced in May 2013, as part of The Rite[tpl]'[/tpl]s centenary celebrations, their intention to publish the 1913 autograph score, as used in early performances. After being kept in Russia for decades, the autograph score was acquired by Boosey and Hawkes in 1947. The firm presented the score to Stravinsky in 1962, on his 80th birthday. After the composer's death in 1971 the manuscript was acquired by the Paul Sacher Foundation. As well as the autograph score, they have published the manuscript piano four-hands score.Van den Toorn, p. 36 (note 30)[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.paul-sacher-stiftung.ch/en/collections/p_t/igor_strawinsky.html|title= Collections: Igor Strawinsky|publisher= Paul Sacher Foundation|accessdate= 29 August 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.boosey.com/cr/news/Stravinsky-Rite-of-Spring-centenary-publications-announced/100069"| title= Stravinsky: Rite of Spring centenary publications announced|publisher= Boosey & Hawkes|accessdate= 3 April 2013[/tpl]
In 2000, Kalmus Music Publishers brought out an edition where former Philadelphia Orchestra librarian Clint Nieweg made over 21,000 corrections to the score and parts. Since then a published errata list has added some 310 more corrections, and this is considered to be the most accurate version of the work today.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.artsjournal.com/slippeddisc/2013/05/the-absolutely-right-rite-of-spring.html| title= The Absolutely Right Rite Of Spring[/tpl]
