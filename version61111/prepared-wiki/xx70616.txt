[[Nuclear weapons testing]]

CATEGORIES: Nuclear weapons, Nuclear weapons testing

Nuclear weapons tests are experiments carried out to determine the effectiveness, yield, and explosive capability of nuclear weapons. Throughout the 20th century, most nations that developed nuclear weapons tested them. Testing nuclear weapons can yield information about how the weapons work, as well as how the weapons behave under various conditions and how structures behave when subjected to nuclear explosions. Nuclear testing has often been used as an indicator of scientific and military strength, and many tests have been overtly political in their intention; most nuclear weapons states publicly declared their nuclear status by means of a nuclear test.
The first nuclear weapon was detonated as a test by the United States at the Trinity site on July 16, 1945, with a yield approximately equivalent to 20 kilotons of TNT. The first hydrogen bomb, codenamed "Mike", was tested at the Enewetak atoll in the Marshall Islands on November 1, 1952 (local date), also by the United States. The largest nuclear weapon ever tested was the "Tsar Bomba" of the Soviet Union at Novaya Zemlya on October 30, 1961, with the largest yield ever seen ([tpl]As of|2013|12|lc=y[/tpl]), an estimated 50–58 megatons.
In 1963, three (UK, US, Soviet Union) of the four nuclear states and many non-nuclear states signed the Limited Test Ban Treaty, pledging to refrain from testing nuclear weapons in the atmosphere, underwater, or in outer space. The treaty permitted underground nuclear testing. France continued atmospheric testing until 1974, and China continued until 1980. Neither has signed the treaty."The Treaty has not been signed by France or by the Peoples Republic of China." U.S. Department of State, Limited Test Ban Treaty.
Underground tests in the United States continued until 1992 (its last nuclear test), the Soviet Union until 1990, the United Kingdom until 1991, and both China and France until 1996. In signing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in 1996, these states have pledged to discontinue all nuclear testing. However, [tpl]As of|2013|12|lc=y[/tpl], the treaty has not yet entered into force because of failure to be signed/ratified by eight specific countries. Non-signatories India and Pakistan last tested nuclear weapons in 1998.
The most recent nuclear test [tpl]As of|2013|2|alt=occurred[/tpl] in February 2013 in North Korea. In January 2013, North Korea had announced that it planned to conduct further tests involving rockets that can carry satellites as well as nuclear warheads "to strike and attack the United States".[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2013/01/24/after-un-acts-nkorea-vows-to-beef-up-nukes | title=N.

==Types==

Nuclear weapons tests have historically been divided into four categories reflecting the medium or location of the test.
Underground testing also falls into two physical categories: tunnel tests which happen in generally horizontal tunnel "drifts", and shaft tests in vertically drilled holes.

===Salvo Tests===

Another way to classify nuclear tests are by the number of explosions which constitute the test.  The treaty definition of a salvo test is:
"In conformity with treaties between the United States and the Soviet Union, a salvo is defined, for multiple explosions for peaceful purposes, as two or more separate explosions where a period of time between successive individual explosions does not exceed 5 seconds and where the burial points of all explosive devices can be connected by segments of straight lines, each of them connecting two burial points, and the total length does not exceed 40 kilometers. For nuclear weapon tests, a salvo is defined as two or more underground nuclear explosions conducted at a test site within an area delineated by a circle having a diameter of two kilometers and conducted within a total period of time of 0.1 second."[tpl]cite paper|title=Worldwide Nuclear Explosions| first1=Xiaoping| last1=Yang| first2=Robert| last2=North first3=Carl| last3=Romney| first4=Paul R.| last4=Richards| url=http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~richards/my_papers/WW_nuclear_tests_IASPEI_HB.pdf[/tpl]
The USSR has exploded up to eight devices in a single salvo test; Pakistan's second and last official test exploded four different devices.  Almost all lists in the literature are lists of tests; in the lists in Wikipedia, (for example, Operation Cresset has separate items for Cremino and Caerphilly, which together constitute a single test) the lists are of explosions.

==Purpose==

Separately from these designations, nuclear tests are also often categorized by the purpose of the test itself.
Aside from these technical considerations, tests have been conducted for political and training purposes. Tests also often serve multiple purposes.

==Alternatives to full-scale testing==

Hydronuclear tests study nuclear materials under the conditions of explosive shock compression. They can create sub-critical conditions, or supercritical conditions with yields ranging from negligible all the way up to a substantial fraction of full weapon yield.[tpl]Citation |url=http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Nwfaq/Nfaq4-1.html#Nfaq4.1.9 |title=Nuclear Weapons Frequently Asked Questions |at=section 4.1.9 |author=Carey Sublette |date=9 August 2001 |accessdate=10 April 2011[/tpl]
Critical mass experiments determine the quantity of fissile material required for criticality with a variety of fissile material compositions, densities, shapes, and reflectors. They can be sub-critical or super-critical, in which case significant radiation fluxes can be produced. This type of test resulted in several criticality accidents.
Sub-critical (or cold) tests are any type of tests involving nuclear materials and possibly high-explosives (like those mentioned above) that purposefully result in no yield. The name refers to the lack of creation of a critical mass of fissile material. They are the only type of tests allowed under the interpretation of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty tacitly agreed to by the major atomic powers.[tpl]Citation |url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/nuke/RL34394.pdf |title=Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty: Issues and Arguments |author=Jonathan Medalia |date=12 March 2008 |publisher=Congressional Research Service |pages=20–22 |accessdate=9 December 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite paper|last=Medalia|first=Jonathan|date=2005-03-11|title=Nuclear Weapons: Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty|publisher=Congressional Record Service|number=IB92099|url=http://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/44946.pdf|accessdate=2013-12-09[/tpl]  Sub-critical tests continue to be performed by the United States, Russia, and the People's Republic of China, at least.[tpl]Citation|url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/world/us-conducts-subcritical-nuclear-test_815260.html|accessdate=2013-05-28|date=2012-12-07|title=US conducts 'subcritical' nuclear test[/tpl][tpl]Citation|url=http://barentsobserver.com/en/security/subcritical-nuke-tests-may-be-resumed-novaya-zemlya-02-10|title=Subcritical nuke tests may be resumed at Novaya Zemlya[/tpl]

==Compensation for victims==

Over 500 atmospheric nuclear weapons tests were conducted at various sites around the world from 1945 to 1980. As public awareness and concern mounted over the possible health hazards associated with exposure to the nuclear fallout, various studies were done to assess the extent of the hazard. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/ National Cancer Institute study claims that nuclear fallout might have led to approximately 11,000 excess deaths, most caused by thyroid cancer linked to exposure to iodine-131.Exposure of the American Population to Radioactive Fallout from Nuclear Weapons Tests
