The Sillan language, or Silla, was spoken in the ancient kingdom of Silla (57 BCE – 935 CE), one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. 
It is generally accepted that Silla language was similar with that of Goguryeo and Baekje.김수경(1989), 세나라 시기 언어 력사에 관한 남조선 학계의 견해에 대한 비판적 고찰 (Criticism about the language opinion during three kingdoms of Korea) Literary records of the Silla language, such as hyangga, are more numerous than those for the languages of Goguryeo and Baekje. Sillan is sometimes considered to be synonymous with Old Korean, though that is commonly used as a cover term for all three languages of the Three Kingdoms.
