[[Catopuma]]

CATEGORIES: Felines, Mammal genera

Catopuma is a genus containing two small Asian felines, the Bay Cat (C. badia) and the Asian Golden Cat (C. temminckii). 
Both are typically reddish brown in colour, with darker markings on the head. They inhabit forested environments in South East Asia, with the Bay Cat being restricted to the island of Borneo. Originally thought to be two subspecies of the same animal, recent genetic analysis has confirmed that they are, indeed, separate species.[tpl]cite book|author=Sunquist, Mel|author2=Sunquist, Fiona|year=2002|title= Wild cats of the World |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location= Chicago |page= 49|isbn= 0-226-77999-8[/tpl]
The two species diverged from one another 4.9-5.3 million years ago, long before Borneo separated from the neighboring islands.[tpl]cite book| editor = S.P. Wasser | author = W. E.
