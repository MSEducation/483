In general usage,  design of experiments (DOE) or experimental design is the design of any information-gathering exercises where variation is present, whether under the full control of the experimenter or not. However, in statistics, these terms are usually used for controlled experiments.   Formal planned experimentation  is often used in evaluating physical objects, chemical formulations, structures, components, and materials.  Other types of study, and their design, are discussed in the articles on computer experiments, opinion polls and statistical surveys (which are types of observational study), natural experiments and quasi-experiments (for example, quasi-experimental design). See Experiment for the distinction between these types of experiments or studies.
In the design of experiments, the experimenter is often interested in the effect of some process or intervention (the "treatment") on some objects (the "experimental units"), which may be people, parts of people, groups of people, plants, animals, etc. Design of experiments is thus a discipline that has very broad application across all the natural and social sciences and engineering.

==History of development==

===Controlled experimentation on scurvy===

In 1747, while serving as surgeon on HMS Salisbury, James Lind carried out a controlled experiment to develop a cure for scurvy.[tpl]Cite journal| last =Dunn | first =Peter | coauthors = | title =James Lind (1716-94) of Edinburgh and the treatment of scurvy  | journal =Archive of Disease in Childhood Foetal Neonatal | volume =76 | issue = 1| pages =64–65 | publisher =British Medical Journal Publishing Group | location =United Kingdom |date = January 1997| url =http://fn.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/76/1/F64 | doi = 10.1136/fn.76.1.F64| pmc =1720613 | accessdate =2009-01-17 | pmid=9059193[/tpl]
Lind selected 12 men from the ship, all suffering from scurvy. Lind limited his subjects to men who "were as similar as I could have them", that is he provided strict entry requirements to reduce extraneous variation. He divided them into six pairs, giving each pair  different supplements to their basic diet for two weeks. The treatments were all remedies that had been proposed:
The men given citrus fruits recovered dramatically within a week. One of them returned to duty after six days, and the others cared for the rest. The other subjects experienced some improvement, but nothing compared to the subjects who ate the citrus fruits, which proved substantially superior to the other treatments.

===Statistical experiments, following Charles S. Peirce===

A theory of statistical inference was developed by Charles S. Peirce in "Illustrations of the Logic of Science" (1877–1878) and "A Theory of Probable Inference" (1883), two publications that emphasized the importance of randomization-based inference in statistics.

====Randomized experiments====

Charles S. Peirce randomly assigned volunteers to a blinded, repeated-measures design to evaluate their ability to discriminate weights.[tpl]Cite journal| last1= Peirce|first1=Charles Sanders|last2=Jastrow|first2=Joseph |authorlink1=Charles Sanders Peirce|authorlink2=Joseph Jastrow|year=1885|title=On Small Differences in Sensation|url=http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Peirce/small-diffs.htm| journal=Memoirs of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=3|pages=73–83[/tpl][ref]

Peirce's experiment inspired other researchers in psychology and education, which developed a research tradition of randomized experiments in laboratories and specialized textbooks in the 1800s.

====Optimal designs for regression models====

Charles S. Peirce also contributed the first English-language publication on an optimal design for regression models in 1876.[ref][tpl]cite journal| author=Peirce, C. S. | year=1876| title=Note on the Theory of the Economy of Research | journal=Coast Survey Report | pages=197–201[/tpl], actually published 1879, NOAA PDF Eprint.
 Reprinted in Collected Papers 7, paragraphs 139–157, also in Writings 4, pp. 72–78, and in 
[/ref] A pioneering optimal design for polynomial regression was suggested by Gergonne in 1815. In 1918 Kirstine Smith published optimal designs for polynomials of degree six (and less).

===Sequences of experiments===

The use of a sequence of experiments, where the design of each may depend on the results of previous experiments, including the possible decision to stop experimenting, is within the scope of Sequential analysis, a field that was pioneeredJohnson, N.L. (1961). "Sequential analysis: a survey." Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series A. Vol. 124 (3), 372–411. (pages 375–376) by Abraham Wald in the context of sequential tests of statistical hypotheses.Wald, A. (1945) "Sequential Tests of Statistical Hypotheses", Annals of Mathematical Statistics, 16 (2), 117–186. Herman Chernoff wrote an overview of optimal sequential designs, while adaptive designs have been surveyed by S. Zacks.Zacks, S. (1996) "Adaptive Designs for Parametric Models". In: Ghosh, S. and Rao, C. R., (Eds) (1996). "Design and Analysis of Experiments," Handbook of Statistics, Volume 13. North-Holland. ISBN 0-444-82061-2.  (pages 151–180) One specific type of sequential design is the "two-armed bandit", generalized to the multi-armed bandit, on which early work was done by Herbert Robbins in 1952.[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1090/S0002-9904-1952-09620-8 | last1 = Robbins | first1 = H. | year = 1952 | title = Some Aspects of the Sequential Design of Experiments | url = | journal = Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society | volume = 58 | issue = 5| pages = 527–535 [/tpl]

==Principles of experimental design, following Ronald A. Fisher==

A methodology for designing experiments was proposed by Ronald A. Fisher, in his innovative books: "The Arrangement of Field Experiments" (1926) and The Design of Experiments (1935).  Much of his pioneering work dealt with agricultural applications of statistical methods.  As a mundane example, he described how to test the hypothesis that a certain lady could distinguish by flavour alone whether the milk or the tea was first placed in the cup. These methods have been broadly adapted in the physical and social sciences, and are still used in agricultural engineering.  The concepts presented here differ from the design and analysis of computer experiments.

==Example==

This example is attributed to Harold Hotelling.Herman Chernoff, Sequential Analysis and Optimal Design, SIAM Monograph, 1972.  It conveys some of the flavor of those aspects of the subject that involve combinatorial designs.
Weights of eight objects are measured using a pan balance and set of standard weights.  Each weighing measures the weight difference between objects in the left pan vs. any objects in the right pan by adding calibrated weights to the lighter pan until the balance is in equilibrium. Each measurement has a random error.  The average error is zero; the standard deviations of the probability distribution of the errors is the same number σ on different weighings; and errors on different weighings are independent.  Denote the true weights by
We consider two different experiments:
The question of design of experiments is: which experiment is better?
The variance of the estimate X1 of θ1 is σ2 if we use the first experiment.  But if we use the second experiment, the variance of the estimate given above is σ2/8.  Thus the second experiment gives us 8 times as much precision for the estimate of a single item, and estimates all items simultaneously, with the same precision. What the second experiment achieves with eight would require 64 weighings if the items are weighed separately. However, note that the estimates for the items obtained in the second experiment have errors that correlate with each other.
Many problems of the design of experiments involve combinatorial designs, as in this example.

==Discussion topics when setting up an experimental design==

An experimental design or randomized clinical trial requires careful consideration of several factors before actually doing the experiment.Ader, Mellenberg & Hand (2008) "Advising on Research Methods: A consultant's companion" An experimental design is the laying out of a detailed experimental plan in advance of doing the experiment. Some of the following topics  have already been discussed in the principles of experimental design section:
1. How many factors does the design have? and are the levels of these factors fixed or random?
2. Are control conditions needed, and what should they be?
3. Manipulation checks; did the manipulation really work?
4. What are the background variables?
5. What is the sample size. How many units must be collected for the experiment to be generalisable and have enough power?
6. What is the relevance of interactions between factors?
7. What is the influence of delayed effects of substantive factors on outcomes?
8. How do response shifts affect self-report measures?
9. How feasible is repeated administration of the same measurement instruments to the same units at different occasions, with a post-test and follow-up tests?
10. What about using a proxy pretest?
11. Are there lurking variables?
12. Should the client/patient, researcher or even the analyst of the data be blind to conditions?
13. What is the feasibility of subsequent application of different conditions to the same units?
14. How many of each control and noise factors should be taken into account?

==Statistical control==

It is best that a process be in reasonable statistical control prior to conducting designed experiments.  When this is not possible, proper blocking, replication, and randomization allow for the careful conduct of designed experiments.Bisgaard, S (2008) "Must a Process be in Statistical Control before Conducting Designed Experiments?", Quality Engineering, ASQ, 20 (2), pp 143 - 176
To control for nuisance variables, researchers institute control checks as additional measures.  Investigators should ensure that uncontrolled influences (e.g., source credibility perception) are measured do not skew the findings of the study.  A manipulation check is one example of a control check.  Manipulation checks allow investigators to isolate the chief variables to strengthen support that these variables are operating as planned.
One of the most important requirements of experimental research designs is the necessity of eliminating the effects of spurious, intervening, and antecedent variables. In the most basic model, cause (X) leads to effect (Y). But there could be a third variable (Z) that influences (Y), and X might not be the true cause at all. Z is said to be a spurious variable and must be controlled for. The same is true for intervening variables (a variable in between the supposed cause (X) and the effect (Y)), and anteceding variables (a variable prior to the supposed cause (X) that is the true cause). When a third variable is involved and has not been controlled for, the relation is said to be a zero order[tpl]disambiguation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl] relationship. In most practical applications of experimental research designs there are several causes (X1, X2, X3). In most designs, only one of these causes is manipulated at a time.

==Experimental designs after Fisher==

Some efficient designs for estimating several main effects were found independently and in near succession by Raj Chandra Bose and K. Kishen in 1940 at the Indian Statistical Institute, but remained little known until the Plackett-Burman designs were published in Biometrika in 1946. About the same time, C. R. Rao introduced the concepts of orthogonal arrays as experimental designs. This concept played a central role in the development of Taguchi methods by Genichi Taguchi, which took place during his visit to Indian Statistical Institute in early 1950s. His methods were successfully applied and adopted by Japanese and Indian industries and subsequently were also embraced by US industry albeit with some reservations.
In 1950, Gertrude Mary Cox and William Gemmell Cochran published the book Experimental Designs, which became the major reference work on the design of experiments for statisticians for years afterwards.
Developments of the theory of linear models have encompassed and surpassed the cases that concerned early writers. Today, the theory rests on advanced topics in linear algebra, algebra and combinatorics.
As with other branches of statistics, experimental design is pursued using both frequentist and Bayesian approaches: In evaluating statistical procedures like experimental designs, frequentist statistics studies the sampling distribution while Bayesian statistics updates a probability distribution on the parameter space.
Some important contributors to the field of experimental designs are C. S. Peirce, R. A. Fisher, F. Yates, C. R. Rao, R. C. Bose, J. N. Srivastava, Shrikhande S. S.,  D. Raghavarao, W. G. Cochran, O. Kempthorne, W. T. Federer, V. V. Fedorov, A. S. Hedayat, J. A. Nelder, R. A. Bailey, J. Kiefer, W. J. Studden, A. Pázman, F. Pukelsheim, D. R. Cox, H. P. Wynn, A. C. Atkinson, G. E. P. Box and G. Taguchi.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl]  The textbooks of D. Montgomery and  R. Myers have reached generations of students and practitioners.

==Human participant experimental design constraints==

Laws and ethical considerations preclude some carefully designed 
experiments with human subjects.  Legal constraints are dependent on 
jurisdiction.  Constraints may involve 
and confidentiality affecting both clinical (medical) trials and 
behavioral and social science experiments.
In the field of toxicology, for example, experimentation is performed 
on laboratory animals with the goal of defining safe exposure limits 
for humans.  Balancing
the constraints are views from the medical field.  Regarding the randomization of patients, 
"... if no one knows which therapy is better, there is no ethical 
imperative to use one therapy or another." (p 380)  Regarding 
experimental design, "...it is clearly not ethical to place subjects 
at risk to collect data in a poorly designed study when this situation 
can be easily avoided...". (p 393)
