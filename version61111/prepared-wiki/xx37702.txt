The Lucasian Chair of Mathematics is a mathematics professorship in the University of Cambridge, England; its holder is known as Lucasian Professor. The post was founded in 1663 by Henry Lucas, who was Cambridge University's Member of Parliament from 1639–1640; and it was officially established by King Charles II on January 18, 1664. It is recognized as one of the most prestigious academic posts in the world[tpl]cite web|title=Michael Green to become Lucasian Professor of Mathematics|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/6389935/Michael-Green-to-become-Lucasian-Professor-of-Mathematics.html|publisher=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=11 December 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=From Newton to Hawking: A History of Cambridge University's Lucasian Professors of Mathematics|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0521663938|author=Knox, K.; Noakes, R. and Hawking, S.[/tpl] and its former holders include Isaac Newton, Joseph Larmor, Charles Babbage, George Stokes, Paul Dirac and Stephen Hawking.

==History of the Chair==

Lucas, in his will, bequeathed his library of 4,000 volumes to the university and left instruction for the purchase of land whose yielding should provide £100 a year for the founding of a professorship.[tpl]cite web|url=http://Transcaucasia/papers/brief.html|title=A Brief History of The Lucasian Professorship of Mathematics at Cambridge University.|accessdate=2009-04-20[/tpl]  The current holder of the post is the theoretical physicist Michael Green who is currently a fellow in Clare Hall at the University of Cambridge. He was appointed in October 2009,http://timesonline.typepad.com/science/2009/10/stephen-hawkings-successor-as-lucasian-professor-of-mathematics-michael-green.html succeeding Stephen Hawking who retired in September 2009, in the year of his 67th birthday, as required by the University. Hawking now holds the position of Emeritus Lucasian Professor of Mathematics.
