Miranda made a total of fourteen Hollywood films between 1940 and 1953. Though hailed as a talented performer, her popularity waned by the end of World War II. She later grew to resent the stereotypical "Brazilian Bombshell" image she cultivated and attempted to break free of it with limited success. Undaunted, Miranda focused increasingly on her nightclub appearances, also becoming a fixture on television variety shows—indeed, for all the stereotyping she faced throughout her career, her performances made huge strides in popularizing Brazilian music, while at the same time paving the way for the increasing awareness of all Latin culture.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/carmen-miranda-mn0000181694/biography|title=Biography - Carmen Miranda |work=Jason Ankeny|page=AllMusic|accessdate=[/tpl]
Carmen Miranda was the first Latin American star to be invited to imprint her hands and feet in the courtyard of the Grauman's Chinese Theatre in 1941. She is considered the precursor of Brazil's Tropicalismo, cultural movement of the 1960s.[tpl]cite news|url=http://tropicalia.com.br/ruidos-pulsativos/geleia-geral/carmen-miranda|title=Carmen Miranda - Tropicália |work=Ana de Oliveira|page=http://tropicalia.com.br/|accessdate=13 January 2014[/tpl]

==Early life==

Carmen Miranda was born Maria do Carmo Miranda da Cunha in Várzea da Ovelha e Aliviada, a village in the northern Portuguese municipality of Marco de Canaveses. She was the second daughter of José Maria Pinto da Cunha (17 February 1887 – 21 June 1938) and Maria Emília Miranda (10 March 1886 – Rio de Janeiro, 9 November 1971).[tpl]harv|Tompkins|2001|p=192[/tpl] In 1909 when she was ten months old, her father emigrated alone to Brazil[tpl]cite journal|title=The century of the Brazilian Bombshell|journal=It's time for Brazil in Singapore|publisher=Sun Media|location=Singapore|pages=63[/tpl] and settled in Rio de Janeiro, where he opened a barber shop. Her mother followed in 1910 with their daughters Olinda and Maria do Carmo. Maria do Carmo, later Carmen, never returned to Portugal, but retained her Portuguese nationality. In Brazil, her parents had four more children: Amaro (1911), Cecília (1913), Aurora (1915–2005) and Óscar (1916).
She was christened Carmen by her father because of his love for the opera comique, and also after Bizet's masterpiece Carmen. This passion for opera influenced his children, and Miranda's love for singing and dancing at an early age. She went to school at the Convent of Saint Therese of Lisieux. Her father did not approve of her plans to enter show business. However, her mother supported her and was beaten when her husband discovered Miranda had auditioned for a radio show. She had previously sung at parties and festivals in Rio. Her older sister Olinda contracted tuberculosis and was sent to Portugal for treatment. Miranda went to work in a tie shop at age 14 to help pay her sister's medical bills. She next worked in a boutique, where she learned to make hats and opened her own hat business which became profitable.

==Career==

===Brazilian career===

Miranda was discovered when she was first introduced to composer Josué de Barros, who went on to promote and record her first album with Brunswick, a German recording company in 1929. In 1930, she was known to be Brazil's gem singer, and in 1933 went on to sign a two-year contract with Rádio Mayrink Veiga, becoming the first contract singer in the radio industry history of Brazil. In 1934, she was invited as a guest performer in Radio Belgrano in Buenos Aires. Ultimately, Miranda signed a recording contract with RCA Records. She led a successful career as a singer for ten years, singing in many popular styles, such as the samba and the Marchinha.
As with other popular singers of the era, Miranda made her screen debut in the Brazilian documentary A Voz Do Carnaval (1933). Two years later, she appeared in her first feature film entitled Alô, Alô Brasil. But it was the 1935 film Estudantes that seemed to solidify her in the minds of the movie-going public. In the 1936 movie Alô Alô Carnaval, she performed the famous song "Cantoras do Rádio" with her sister Aurora, for the first time.
During her later career, Miranda would become primarily identified with her colorful fruit-hat costume and image, though she only adopted that costume in 1939. In that year she appeared in the film Banana-da-Terra, where she wore a glamorized version of the traditional costume of a poor black girl of Bahia: flowing dress and fruit-hat turban. Singing the song "O que é que a Baiana Tem?"("What does a Baiana have?"), the intent was to empower a social class which was usually looked down upon.film, Carmen Miranda: Bananas Is My Business (Brazil, 1995).

===American stage and films===

After seeing one of her performances in Rio, theatre owner Lee Shubert signed Miranda and her band, the Bando da Lua, to a contract. In 1939, Miranda sailed from Brazil aboard the ocean liner SS Uruguay, arriving in New York on 18 May.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.moore-mccormack.com/SS-Uruguay-1938/SS-Uruguay-Timeline.htm |last1=Vinson |first1=Bill |last2=Casey |first2=Ginger Quering |title=S.S.

The New York World's Fair was attracting throngs to the Sunken Meadow fairgrounds just outside New York City in the summer of 1939, but Carmen Miranda still managed to make Schubert's show, a commercial success. Life magazine's reviewer noted:
Her fame grew quickly, having formally been presented to President Franklin D. Roosevelt at a White House banquet shortly after arrival.
In 1940, 20th Century Fox signed her to a contract for a one-time appearance in Down Argentine Way.[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-09-01/news/mn-25726_1_brazilian-government|title=5-Foot, 1-Inch Performer Died in 1955: Brazil Pays Homage to Carmen Miranda|date=1 September 1985|work=GLORIA HELENA REY |page=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=[/tpl] She received good reviews for her performance prompting Fox to sign her to a long-term film contract.[tpl]harv|Parish|2003|p=606[/tpl]
She was encouraged by the United States government as part of President Roosevelt's Good Neighbor policy, designed to strengthen links with Latin America and Europe. It was believed that in delivering content like hers, the policy would be better received by the American public.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.latinpost.com/articles/5706/20140109/the-brazilian-bombshell-carmen-miranda-hollywood-fruithat.htm|title="The Brazilian Bombshell" Carmen Miranda & Her Life with and without the Fruit Hat|work=Nicole Akoukou Thompson|page=Latin Post|date=9 January 2014[/tpl] Miranda's contract with 20th Century Fox lasted from 1941 to 1946; this period coincides with the time of World War II (1939–1945) and the creation in 1940 of the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs (OCIAA), based in Rio de Janeiro, whose goal was to obtain support from governments and Latin American societies for the cause of the United States.[tpl]cite news|url=http://cpdoc.fgv.br/producao/dossies/AEraVargas1/anos30-37/RelacoesInternacionais/BoaVizinhanca|title=Anos de Incerteza (1930–1937) a Política de boa vizinhança|page=Fundação Getúlio Vargas|date=[/tpl]
The interference was linked to the Good Neighbor policy and Roosevelt sought to forge better diplomatic relations with Brazil and other South American nations, and pledged to refrain from further military intervention, which has sometimes been done to protect U.S. business interests in industries such as mining or agriculture. Hollywood was asked to help out with the Good Neighbor Policy, and both Walt Disney Studios and 20th Century Fox participated. Miranda was considered the goodwill ambassador and promoter of intercontinental culture.[tpl]cite news|url=http://lanic.utexas.edu/project/etext/llilas/ilassa/2007/siwi.pdf|title=U.S. –Brazil Cultural Relations during World War II|work=Marcio Siwi|date=[/tpl]

===Criticism===

While Miranda's popularity in the United States continued to rise, she began to lose favor with some Brazilians. On 10 July 1940, she returned to Brazil where she was welcomed by cheering fans. Soon after her arrival, however, the Brazilian press began criticizing Miranda for giving in to American commercialism and projecting a negative image of Brazil. Members of the upper class felt her image was "too black" and she was criticized in one Brazilian newspaper for "singing bad-tasting black sambas". Other Brazilians criticized her for playing up the stereotype of a "Latina bimbo" after her first interview upon arriving in the United States. In an interview with the New York World-Telegram, Miranda discussed her then limited knowledge of the English language stating, "I say money, money, money. I say twenty words in English. I say money, money, money and I say hot dog!"[tpl]harv|Ruíz|2005|p=200[/tpl]
On 15 July, she appeared at a charity concert organized by Brazilian First Lady Darci Vargas. The concert was attended by members of Brazil's high society. She greeted the audience in English but was met with silence. When Miranda began singing a song from one of her club acts, "The South American Way", the audience began to boo her. She attempted to finish her act but gave up and left the stage after the audience continued to boo. The incident deeply hurt Miranda and she later cried in her dressing room. The following day, the Brazilian press criticized her for being "too Americanized".
Weeks later, Miranda responded to the criticism with the Portuguese language song "Disseram que Voltei Americanizada" (or "They Say I've Come Back Americanized"). Another song, "Bananas Is My Business" was based on a line in one of her movies and directly addressed her image. She was greatly upset by the criticism and did not return to Brazil again for fourteen years.

Miranda's films came under harsh scrutiny by Latin American audiences for characterizing Central and South America in a culturally homogenous way. When her films hit theatres in Central and South America, it was strongly felt that the films depicted Latin American cultures through the lens of American preconceptions, and not as they actually were. Many Latin Americans felt their cultures were being misrepresented, and felt that someone from their own region, Carmen Miranda, was misrepresenting them. Her film, Down Argentine Way (1940), was met with heavy criticism, with pundits in Argentina claiming that it failed to depict Argentinean culture. It was alleged that lyrics throughout the movie were filled with non-Argentine themes, and that the sets were not strictly Argentinean, but rather, a fusion of cultures from Mexico, Cuba, and Brazil. The film was subsequently banned in Argentina, for "wrongfully portraying life in Buenos Aires." Amanda Ellis, "Captivating a Country With Her Curves: Examining the Importance of Carmen Miranda's Iconography in Creating National Identities" (Masters Thesis, State University of New York at Buffalo, 2008), 31-33.  Similar sentiments arose in Cuba after her the debut of Miranda's film, Weekend in Havana (1941). Cuban audiences were offended by Miranda's portrayal of a Cuban female. Reviewers of the film asserted that an import from Rio could not possibly portray a woman from Havana. Further, they claimed that throughout the film Miranda does not "dance anything Cuban."  Miranda's performances, it was argued, were merely hybridizations of Brazilian culture and other Latin cultures. Critics contend that other of her films likewise misrepresented Latin locales, by assuming that Brazilian culture could suffice as a direct representation of Latin America.Shari Roberts.

===Peak years===

Upon returning to the United States, Miranda kept up her film career in Hollywood while also appearing on Broadway and performing in clubs and restaurants. 
The war years saw Carmen Miranda starring in eight of her fourteen films and, although the studios labelled her the "Brazilian Bombshell," the films tended to blur her Brazilian identity in favor of a generalized Latin American image, she began appearing in its films as a featured performer.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.tau.ac.il/eial/VI_2/mccann.htm|title=Brazil and World War II: The Forgotten Ally. What did you do in the war, Zé Carioca?|work=FRANK D. McCANN |page=University of New Hampshire|date=[/tpl]
In 1941, she shared the screen with Alice Faye and Don Ameche in That Night in Rio. Later that same year, she teamed up with Alice Faye again in Week-End in Havana. Miranda was now earning $5,000 a week. On 24 March 1941, she became one of the first Latinas to leave her hand and footprints in the sidewalk of the Grauman's Chinese Theater.
In 1943, she appeared in an extravaganza from noted director Busby Berkeley called The Gang's All Here. Berkeley's musicals were known for their lavish production, and Miranda's role as Dorita featured her number "The Lady in the Tutti-Frutti Hat." An optical trick from the set behind her made the fruit-bedecked hat she was wearing appear even larger than humanly possible. By then, Miranda seemed to be locked into such roles as the exotic songstress, and her studio contract even forced her to appear at events in her trademark film costumes, which grew even more outlandish. One song she recorded, "Bananas Is My Business" seemed to pay somewhat ironic tribute to her typecasting.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/carmen-miranda|title=Gale Encyclopedia of Biography: Carmen Miranda|work=Answers|page=|accessdate=20 December 2013[/tpl] The following year, Miranda made a cameo appearance in Four Jills in a Jeep. By 1945, she had become Hollywood's highest-paid entertainer and top female tax payer in the United States, earning more than $200,000 that year ($2.2 million in 2010 adjusted for inflation).[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=FL5VAAAAIBAJ&sjid=NpcDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5284,5623706&dq=carmen+miranda+highest+earning&hl=en|title=Large Earnings By Films Stars|date=17 June 1946|work=The Age|page=3|accessdate=21 November 2012[/tpl]

===Decline===

After World War II ended in 1945, the American public's tastes began to change and musicals began to fall out of favor. Hollywood studio heads and producers also felt that the novelty of Miranda's "Brazilian bombshell" image had worn thin.[tpl]harv|Tompkins|2001|p=195[/tpl]
As a result, Miranda's career declined. She made one last film for Fox, Doll Face (1945), before her contract was terminated in January 1946.[tpl]harv|Parish|2003|pp=607–608[/tpl]
She later signed a contract with Universal but at the time, Universal was undergoing a merger with another studio. Due to a change in management, no films for Miranda were planned.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.lifetimetv.co.uk/biography/biography-carmen-miranda|title=Biography: Carmen Miranda|date=|work=|page=Lifetime|accessdate=[/tpl] Eager to break away from her well established image, Miranda attempted to branch out with different roles. In 1946, she portrayed an Irish American character in If I'm Lucky. The following year, she played dual roles opposite Groucho Marx in Copacabana for United Artists. While the films were modest hits, film critics and the American public did not accept Miranda's new image.
Though her film career was faltering, Miranda music career remained solid and she was still a popular attraction at nightclubs.[tpl]harv|Parish|2003|p=608[/tpl] From 1948 to 1950, Miranda teamed with The Andrews Sisters to produce and record three Decca singles. Their first collaboration was on radio in 1945 when Miranda guested on ABC's The Andrews Sisters Show. The first single, "Cuanto Le Gusta", was the most popular (a best-selling record and a number-twelve Billboard hit). "The Wedding Samba" (#23) followed in 1950.[tpl]harv|Sforza|2000|p=289[/tpl]
In 1948, she co-starred opposite Wallace Beery and Jane Powell in A Date with Judy, and Nancy Goes to Rio in 1950 for MGM. She made her final film appearance in the 1953 film Scared Stiff with Martin and Lewis for Paramount.[tpl]harv|Hadley-Garcia|1990|p=123[/tpl]
Following the release of Scared Stiff in April 1953, she embarked on a four-month European tour. After collapsing from exhaustion during a club performance in Ohio in October 1953, dates for her future tour were canceled. On the suggestion of her doctor, Miranda returned to Brazil to rest. Miranda was still hurt over the criticism she received there in 1940, but was happy when she received a warm reception upon her return. She remained in Brazil until April 1955.

==Personal life==

On 17 March 1947, Miranda married American movie producer David Alfred Sebastian.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aelOAAAAIBAJ&sjid=HAAEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2632,5956195&dq=carmen+miranda+marriage&hl=en|title=Carmen Miranda Set For Trial Separation|date=27 September 1949|work=Toledo Blade|page=3|accessdate=21 November 2012[/tpl] In 1948 she became pregnant, but suffered a miscarriage.

In her later years, in addition to her already heavy smoking and alcohol consumption, Miranda began taking amphetamines and barbiturates, all of which took a toll on her health.[tpl]harv|Brioux|2007|p=176[/tpl]

==Death==

On 4 August 1955, Miranda was shooting a segment for the filmed NBC variety series The Jimmy Durante Show. According to Durante, Miranda had complained of feeling unwell before filming. Durante offered to get Miranda a replacement but she declined. After completing a song and dance number, "Jackson, Miranda, and Gomez", with Durante, she fell to one knee. Durante later said of the incident, "... I thought she had slipped. She got up and said she was outa sic breath. I tells her I'll take her lines. But she goes ahead with 'em.

==Image==

Miranda's Hollywood image was one of a generic Latinness that blurred the distinctions between Brazil, Portugal, Argentina, and Mexico as well as between samba, tango and habanera. It was carefully stylized and outlandishly flamboyant. She was often shown wearing platform sandals and towering headdresses made of fruit, becoming famous as "the lady in the tutti-frutti hat."[tpl]harv|Tompkins|2001|p=191[/tpl] Miranda's enormous, fruit-laden hats are iconic visuals recognized around the world. These costumes led to Saks Fifth Avenue developing a line of turbans and jewelry inspired by Carmen Miranda in 1939. Many costume jewelry designers made fruit jewelry also inspired by Carmen Miranda which is still highly valued and collectible by vintage and antique costume jewelry collectors. Fruit jewelry is still popular in jewelry design today. Much of the fruit jewelry seen today is often still called "Carmen Miranda jewelry" because of this.
Her image was much satirized and taken up as camp, and today, the "Carmen Miranda" persona is popular among drag performers.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl]
