KMMX (100.3 FM), known as "Mix 100", is a Hot Adult Contemporary formatted radio station licensed to Tahoka, Texas, and serving the greater Lubbock, Texas, area.

==History==

KMMX-FM originally signed on as "Mix 104.7" as a Soft AC. However, the station suffered from weak signal penetration into the Lubbock market. In the 1990s, a frequency swap with another market allowed KMMX to occupy the 100.3 frequency. By May 1997, the station became more of a CHR leaning Hot AC format with live air personalities, using the slogan "A 50/50 Mix Of The 80s & 90s." This was a response to the loss of KRLB 99.5 "The Music Station," which, as a result of the sale of Mainstream CHR Z102 to KRLB's parent company, changed formats from Hot Adult Contemporary to Classic Rock. 
In 1998, KMMX-FM dropped the ".3" from their name to a simplified "Mix 100 - Your Music Fix".  In 1999, the station again changed slogans to "The Best Mix Of The 80s, 90s, & Today".
Briefly in 2003, the station used the slogan "Lubbock's # 1 Hit music station." For much of the 2000s Mix 100 was "Lubbock's Pop-Rock", a hybrid adult top-40/Hot AC station.  Mix 100 shifted formats to mainstream CHR in 2010.

==Programming==

Mix 100 became the first radio station in Lubbock to carry the syndicated morning show "Kidd Kraddick in the Morning" in June 2001.

==In Fiction==

KMMX was the call sign on the side of a car driven by the camera operator of a fictional television news station in the episode "On Camera" of Emergency!.
