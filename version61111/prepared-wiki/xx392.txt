Catalan ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|k|æ|t|əl|æ|n[/tpl];Laurie Bauer, 2007, The Linguistics Student’s Handbook, Edinburgh; also [tpl]IPAc-en|k|æ|t|ə|ˈ|l|æ|n[/tpl] or [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|k|æ|t|əl|ən[/tpl]http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Catalan autonym: català [tpl]IPA-ca|kətəˈɫa|[/tpl] or [tpl]IPA-ca|kataˈɫa|[/tpl]) is a Romance language named for its origins in Catalonia, in what is northeastern Spain and adjoining parts of France. It is the national and only official language of Andorra,[tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2010|p=191[/tpl] and a co-official language of the Spanish autonomous communities of Catalonia, the Balearic Islands, and the Valencian Community (where the language is known as Valencian, and there exist regional standards). It also has semi-official status in the city of Alghero on the Italian island of Sardinia. It is also spoken with no official recognition in parts of the Spanish autonomous communities of Aragon (La Franja) and Murcia (Carche), and in the historic French region of Roussillon/Northern Catalonia, roughly equivalent to the department of Pyrénées-Orientales.[tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2005|p=1[/tpl]
According to the Statistical Institute of Catalonia in 2008 the Catalan language is the second most commonly used in Catalonia, after Spanish,http://www.idescat.cat/dequavi/?TC=444&V0=15&V1=2&VA=2008&x=13&y=12 as a native or self-defining language. The Generalitat of Catalunya spends part of its annual budget on the promotion of the use of Catalan in Catalonia and in other territories.Datos lingüísticos en Cataluña
Catalan evolved from common Latin around the eastern Pyrenees in the 9th century.[tpl]sfn|Costa Carreras|Yates|year=2009|pp=6–7[/tpl] During the Low Middle Ages it saw a golden age as the literary and dominant language of the Crown of Aragon, and was widely used all over the Mediterranean.[tpl]sfn|Costa Carreras|Yates|year=2009|pp=6–7[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2010|p=190-191[/tpl] The union of Aragon with the other territories of Spain in 1479 marked the start of the decline of the language.[tpl]sfn|Costa Carreras|Yates|year=2009|pp=6–7[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2010|p=190-191[/tpl] In 1659 Spain ceded Northern Catalonia to France, and Catalan was banned in both states in the early 18th century.[tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2010|p=190-191[/tpl] 19th-century Spain saw a Catalan literary revival,[tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2010|p=190-191[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Costa Carreras|Yates|year=2009|pp=6–7[/tpl] which culminated in the 1913 orthographic standardization, and the officialization of the language during the Second Spanish Republic (1931–39). However, the Francoist dictatorship (1939–75) banned the language again.[tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2010|p=190-191[/tpl]
Since the Spanish transition to democracy (1975–1982), Catalan has been recognized as an official language, language of education, and language of mass media, all of which have contributed to its increased prestige.[tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2003|p=207[/tpl] There is no parallel in Europe of such a large, bilingual, non-state speech community.[tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2003|p=207[/tpl]
Compared to other Romance languages, Catalan dialects feature relative uniformity,[tpl]sfn|Moll|1958|p=47[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Enciclopèdia Catalana|pp=634–635[/tpl] and are mutually intelligible.[tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2005|p=1[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Costa Carreras|Yates|2009|p=5[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Feldhausen|2010|p=5[/tpl] They are divided into two blocks, Eastern and Western, differing mostly in pronunciation.[tpl]sfn|Moll|1958|p=47[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Enciclopèdia Catalana|pp=634–635[/tpl] The terms "Catalan" and "Valencian" (respectively used in Catalonia and the Valencian Community) are two names for the same language."Dictamen de l'Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua sobre els principis i criteris per a la defensa de la denominació i l'entitat del valencià". Report from Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua about denomination and identity of Valencian.  Standard Catalan, a variety accepted by virtually all speakers,[tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2003|p=207[/tpl] is regulated by the Institute of Catalan Studies (IEC).
Catalan shares many traits with its neighboring Romance languages.[tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2005|p=1[/tpl] However, despite being mostly situated in the Iberian Peninsula, Catalan shows greater differences with Ibero-Romance (Spanish, Portuguese) in terms of vocabulary, pronunciation, and grammar than it does with Gallo-Romance (French, Italian, Occitan, etc.).Marc Howard Ross, Cultural Contestation in Ethnic Conflict, page 139. Cambridge University Press, 2007.[tpl]sfn|Jud|1925[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Colón|1993|pp=33–35[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Moll|1958|p=47[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Enciclopèdia Catalana|p=632[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Feldhausen|2010|p=4[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Schlösser|2005|p=60f[/tpl] These similarities are most notable with Occitan.[tpl]sfn|Enciclopèdia Catalana|p=632[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Feldhausen|2010|p=4[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Schlösser|2005|p=60f[/tpl]
Catalan has an inflectional grammar, with two genders (masculine, feminine), and two numbers (singular, plural). Pronouns are also inflected for case, animacy and politeness, and can be combined in very complex ways. Verbs are split in several paradigms and are inflected for person, number, tense, aspect, mood, and gender. In terms of pronunciation, Catalan has many words ending in a wide variety of consonants and some consonant clusters, in contrast with many other Romance languages.[tpl]sfn|Enciclopèdia Catalana|p=630[/tpl]

==Etymology and pronunciation==

The word Catalan derives from the territory of Catalonia, itself of disputed etymology. The main theory suggests that Catalunya (Latin Gathia Launia) derives from the name Gothia or Gauthia ("Land of the Goths"), since the origins of the Catalan counts, lords and people were found in the March of Gothia, whence Gothland > Gothlandia > Gothalania > Catalonia theoretically derived.[tpl]sfn|García Venero|2006[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Burke|1900|p=154[/tpl]
In English, the term referring to a person first appears in mid 14th century as Catelaner, followed in the 15th century as Catellain (from French). It is first attested a language name by 1792. The term Catalonian is first attested in 1707. Catalan can be pronounced as [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|k|æ|t|əl|æ|n[/tpl], [tpl]IPAc-en|k|æ|t|ə|ˈ|l|æ|n[/tpl] or [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|k|æ|t|əl|ən[/tpl].
The endonym is pronounced [tpl]IPA|/kə.təˈɫa/[/tpl] in the Eastern Catalan dialects, and [tpl]IPA|/ka.taˈɫa/[/tpl] in the Western dialects. In the Valencian Community, the term valencià ([tpl]IPA|/va.len.siˈa/[/tpl]) is frequently used instead. The names "Catalan" and "Valencian" are two names for the same language.[tpl]sfn|Lledó|2011|p=334-337[/tpl] See also status of Valencian below.

==History==

===Middle Ages===

By the 9th century, Catalan had evolved from Vulgar Latin on both sides of the eastern end of the Pyrenees, as well as the territories of the Roman province of Tarraconensis to the south.[tpl]sfn|Costa Carreras|Yates|year=2009|pp=6–7[/tpl] From the 8th century onwards the Catalan counts extended their territory southwards and westwards at the expense of the Muslims, bringing their language with them.[tpl]sfn|Costa Carreras|Yates|year=2009|pp=6–7[/tpl] This process was given definitive impetus with the separation of the County of Barcelona from the Carolingian Empire in 988.[tpl]sfn|Costa Carreras|Yates|year=2009|pp=6–7[/tpl]
In the 11th century, documents written in macaronic Latin begin to show Catalan elements,[tpl]sfn|Moran|2004|pp=37–38[/tpl] with texts written almost completely in Romance appearing by 1080.[tpl]sfn|Moran|2004|pp=37–38[/tpl] Old Catalan shared many features with Gallo-Romance, diverging from Old Occitan between the 11th and 14th centuries.[tpl]sfn|Riquer|1964[/tpl]
During the 11th and 12th centuries the Catalan rulers expanded up to north of the Ebro river,[tpl]sfn|Costa Carreras|Yates|year=2009|pp=6–7[/tpl] and in the 13th century they conquered the Land of Valencia and the Balearic Islands.[tpl]sfn|Costa Carreras|Yates|year=2009|pp=6–7[/tpl] The city of Alghero in Sardinia was repopulated with Catalan speakers in the 14th century. The language also reached Murcia, which became Spanish-speaking in the 15th century.[tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2010|p=190[/tpl]
In the Low Middle Ages, Catalan went through a golden age, reaching a peak of maturity and cultural richness.[tpl]sfn|Costa Carreras|Yates|year=2009|pp=6–7[/tpl] Examples include the work of Majorcan polymath Ramon Llull (1232–1315), the Four Great Chronicles (13th-14th centuries), and the Valencian school of poetry culminating in Ausiàs March (1397–1459).[tpl]sfn|Costa Carreras|Yates|year=2009|pp=6–7[/tpl] By the 15th century, the city of Valencia had become the sociocultural center of the Crown of Aragon, and Catalan was present all over the Mediterranean world.[tpl]sfn|Costa Carreras|Yates|year=2009|pp=6–7[/tpl] During this period, the Royal Chancery propagated a highly standardized language.[tpl]sfn|Costa Carreras|Yates|year=2009|pp=6–7[/tpl] Catalan was widely used as an official language in Sicily until the 15th century, and in Sardinia until the 17th.[tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2010|p=190[/tpl] During this period, the language was what Costa Carreras terms "one of the 'great languages' of medieval Europe".[tpl]sfn|Costa Carreras|Yates|year=2009|pp=6–7[/tpl]
Martorell's outstanding[tpl]sfn|Costa Carreras|Yates|year=2009|pp=6–7[/tpl] novel of chivalry Tirant lo Blanc (1490) shows a transition from Medieval to Renaissance values, something that can also be seen in Metge's work.[tpl]sfn|Costa Carreras|Yates|year=2009|pp=6–7[/tpl] The first book produced with movable type in the Iberian Peninsula was printed in Catalan.Trobes en llaors de la Verge Maria ("Poems of praise of the Virgin Mary") 1474.[tpl]sfn|Costa Carreras|Yates|year=2009|pp=6–7[/tpl]

===Start of the modern era===

With the union of the crowns of Castille and Aragon (1479), the use of Spanish gradually became more prestigious.[tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2010|p=190[/tpl] Starting in the 16th century, Catalan literature experienced a decline, the language came under the influence of Spanish, and the urban and literary classes became bilingual.[tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2010|p=190[/tpl]

===French state: 18th to 20th centuries===

With the Treaty of the Pyrenees (1659), Spain ceded the northern part of Catalonia to France, and soon thereafter the local Catalan varieties came under the influence of French, which in 1700 became the sole official language of the region.[tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2010|p=191[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.crdp-montpellier.fr/cd66/artscult/fichesVauban/cdvauban/PERIODES/moyenagetempsmodernes/chateaucollioureinterdictioncatalan.pdf|title=L'interdiction de la langue catalane en Roussillon par Louis XIV|publisher="CRDP, Académie de Montpellier[/tpl]
Shortly after the French Revolution (1789), the French First Republic prohibited official use of, and enacted discriminating policies against, the nonstandard languages of France (patois), such as Catalan, Alsatian, Breton, Occitan, Flemish, and Basque.
Following the French capture of Algeria (1833), that region saw several waves of Catalan-speaking settlers. People from the Spanish Alacant province settled around Oran, whereas Algiers received immigration from Northern Catalonia and Minorca. Their speech was known as patuet. By 1911, the number of Catalan speakers was around 100,000. After the declaration of independence of Algeria in 1962, almost all the Catalan speakers fled to Northern Catalonia (as Pieds-Noirs) or Alacant.[tpl]sfn|Marfany|2002[/tpl]
Nowadays, France only recognizes French as an official language. Nevertheless, on 10 December 2007, the General Council of the Pyrénées-Orientales officially recognized Catalan as one of the languages of the department[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cg66.fr/202-charte-en-faveur-du-catalan.htm|title=Charte en faveur du Catalan[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cg66.fr/199-la-catalanitat-a-catalunya-nord.htm|title=La catalanitat a la Catalunya Nord[/tpl] and seeks to further promote it in public life and education.

===Spanish state: 18th to 20th centuries===

The decline of Catalan continued in the 16th and 17th centuries. The Catalan defeat in the War of Spanish Succession (1714) initiated a series of measures imposing the use of Spanish in all spheres of public life.[tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2010|p=191[/tpl] These included preaching, theater, criminal courts, education, legal documents, and on the telephone.[tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2010|p=191[/tpl] In the 20th century these measures were mostly repealed and supplemented by others, like the prohibition of teaching Catalan, or sanctions for refusing to use Spanish.[tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2010|p=191[/tpl]
In parallel, however, the 19th century saw a Catalan literary revival (Renaixença), which has continued up to the present day.[tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2010|p=191[/tpl] This period starts with Aribau's Ode to the Homeland (1833); followed in the second half of the 19th century, and the early 20th by the work of Verdaguer (poetry), Oller (realist novel), and Guimerà (drama).[tpl]sfn|Costa Carreras|2007|pp=10-11[/tpl]
In the 19th century, the region of Carche, in the province of Murcia was repopulated with Catalan speakers from the Land of Valencia.[tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2005|p=1[/tpl]
The Second Spanish Republic (1931-1939) saw a brief period of tolerance, with most restrictions against Catalan being lifted.[tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2010|p=191[/tpl] However, the establishment of the Francoist dictatorship lead to a total ban on the language in 1940.[tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2010|p=191[/tpl] Despite some gradual relaxations allowing the publication of some books and magazines, Catalan was excluded from all public institutions until the adoption of the 1978 constitution.[tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2010|p=191[/tpl]

===Present day===

Since the Spanish transition to democracy (1975–1982), Catalan has been institutionalizated as an official language, language of education, and language of mass media; all of which have contributed to its increased prestige.[tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2003|p=207[/tpl] In Catalonia, there is no parallel of a large, bilingual, European, non-state speech community.[tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2003|p=207[/tpl] The teaching of Catalan is mandatory in all schools,[tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2010|p=191[/tpl] and it is not possible to use Spanish for studying in the public education system of Catalonia.

In Andorra, Catalan has always been the sole official language.[tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2010|p=191[/tpl] Since the promulgation of the 1993 constitution, several Andorranization policies have been enforced, like Catalan medium education.[tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2010|p=191[/tpl]
On the other hand, there are several language shift processes currently taking place. In Northern Catalonia, Catalan has followed the same trend as the other minority languages of France, with most of its native speakers being 60 or older (as of 2004).[tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2010|p=191[/tpl] Catalan is studied as a foreign language by 30% of the primary education students, and by 15% of the secondary.[tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2010|p=191[/tpl] The cultural associacion La Bressola promotes a network of community-run schools engaged in Catalan language immersion programs.
In the Alicante province Catalan is being replaced by Spanish, and in Alghero by Italian.[tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2003|p=207[/tpl] There are also well ingrained diglossic attitudes against Catalan in the Valencian Community, Ibiza, and to a lesser extent, in the rest of the Balearic islands.[tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2010|p=191[/tpl]

==Classification and relationship with other Romance languages==

The ascription of Catalan to the Occitano-Romance branch of Gallo-Romance languages is not shared by all linguists, particularly those from the Castillian sphere, like Menéndez Pidal.
According to Pèire Bèc, its specific classification is as follows:
Catalan bears varying degrees of similarity to the linguistic varieties subsumed under the cover term Occitan language (see also differences between Occitan and Catalan and Gallo-Romance languages). Thus, as it should be expected from closely related languages, Catalan today shares many traits with other Romance languages.

===Relationship with other Western Romance languages===

Catalan shares many traits with the other neighboring Romance languages (Italian, Sardinian, Occitan, and Spanish).[tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2005|p=1[/tpl] However, despite being mostly situated in the Iberian Peninsula, Catalan has marked differences with the Ibero-Romance group (Spanish and Portuguese) in terms of pronunciation, grammatical, and especially vocabulary; showing instead its closest affinity with Occitan[tpl]sfn|Enciclopèdia Catalana|p=632[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Feldhausen|2010|p=4[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Schlösser|2005|p=60f[/tpl] and to a lesser extent Gallo-Romance (French, Franco-Provençal, Gallo-Italian).[tpl]sfn|Jud|1925[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Colón|1993|pp=33–35[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Moll|1958|p=47[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Enciclopèdia Catalana|p=632[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Feldhausen|2010|p=4[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Schlösser|2005|p=60f[/tpl]
According to Ethnologue, the lexical similarity between Catalan and other Romance languages is 87% with Italian, 85% with Portuguese and Spanish, 76% with Ladin, 75% with Sardinian, and 73% with Romanian.

During much of its history, and especially during the Francoist dictatorship (1939-1975), the Catalan language has often been degraded as a mere dialect of Spanish.[tpl]sfn|Feldhausen|2010|p=4[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Schlösser|2005|p=60f[/tpl] This view, based on political and ideological considerations, has no linguistic validity.[tpl]sfn|Feldhausen|2010|p=4[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Schlösser|2005|p=60f[/tpl] Spanish and Catalan have important differences in the sound system, lexicon, and other less grammatical aspects, which puts the former many times closer to Occitan (and French).[tpl]sfn|Feldhausen|2010|p=4[/tpl]
There is evidence that, at least from the [tpl]smallcaps|a.d.[/tpl] 2nd century, the vocabulary and phonology of Roman Tarraconensis was different from the rest of Roman Hispania.[tpl]sfn|Enciclopèdia Catalana|p=632[/tpl] Differentiation has arisen generally because Spanish, Asturian, and Galico-Portuguese share certain peripheral archaisms (Spanish hervir, Asturian/Portuguese ferver vs. Catalan bullir, Occitan bolir "to boil") and innovatory regionalisms (Sp novillo, Ast nuviellu vs. Cat torell, Oc taurèl "bullock"), while Catalan has a shared history with the Western Romance innovative core, especially Occitan.[tpl]sfn|Colón|1993|p=55[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Enciclopèdia Catalana|p=632[/tpl]
The Germanic superstrate has had different outcomes in Spanish and Catalan. For example, Catalan fang "mud" and rostir "to roast", of Germanic origin, contrast with Spanish lodo and asar, of Latin origin; whereas Catalan filosa "spinning wheel" and pols "temple", of Latin origin, contrast with Spanish rueca and sien, of Germanic origin.[tpl]sfn|Enciclopèdia Catalana|p=632[/tpl]
The same happens with Arabic loanwords. Thus, Catalan alfàbia "large earthenware jar" and rajola "tile", of Arabic origin, contrast with Spanish tinaja and teja, of Latin origin; whereas Catalan oli "oil" and oliva "olive", of Latin origin, contrast with Spanish aceite and aceituna.[tpl]sfn|Enciclopèdia Catalana|p=632[/tpl] However, the Arabic element in Spanish is generally much more prevalent.[tpl]sfn|Enciclopèdia Catalana|p=632[/tpl]
Situated between two large linguistic blocks (Ibero-Romance and Gallo-Romance), Catalan has many unique lexical choices, such as enyorar "to miss somebody", apaivagar "to calm down somebody", or rebutjar "reject".[tpl]sfn|Enciclopèdia Catalana|p=632[/tpl]

These territories are sometimes referred to as the Països Catalans (Catalan Countries), a denomination based on cultural affinity and common heritage, that has also had a subsequent political interpretation but no official status. Various interpretations of the term may include some or all of these regions.

===Number of speakers===

The number of persons known to be fluent in Catalan varies depending on the sources used. A 2004 language study did not indicate the total number of speakers, but showed a total estimate of 9–9.5 million, by matching the percentage of speakers to the population of each area where Catalan is spoken.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www20.gencat.cat/portal/site/Llengcat/menuitem.b318de7236aed0e7a129d410b0c0e1a0/?vgnextoid=11a1d4b73920b110VgnVCM1000008d0c1e0aRCRD&vgnextchannel=11a1d4b73920b110VgnVCM1000008d0c1e0aRCRD&vgnextfmt=default&newLang=en_GB|title=Sociolinguistic situation in Catalan-speaking areas.

Año 2008, Encuesta de Usos Lingüísticos de la población (2003 y 2008), Instituto de Estadística de Cataluña According to Ethnologue: Languages of the World, ed. 17, Catalan had a total of 7.2 million native speakers in 2010, and 5 million second-language speakers in 1994.
The most important social characteristic of the Catalan language is that all the areas where it is spoken are bilingual in practice: together with the French language in Roussillon, with Italian in Alghero, with Spanish and French in Andorra and with Spanish in the rest of the territories.

==Phonology==

The Catalan phonology varies depending on the dialect. Notable features include:[tpl]sfn|Enciclopèdia Catalana|p=630[/tpl]
In contrast with other Romance languages, Catalan has many monosyllabic words; and those ending in a wide variety consonants and some consonant clusters.[tpl]sfn|Enciclopèdia Catalana|p=630[/tpl] Also, Catalan has final obstruent devoicing, thus featuring many couplets like amic "(male friend") vs. amiga ("female friend").[tpl]sfn|Enciclopèdia Catalana|p=630[/tpl]
Central Catalan is considered the standard pronunciation of the language.[tpl]sfn|Feldhausen|2010|p=5[/tpl] The descriptions below are mostly for this variety.Wheeler 2005 takes the same approach For the differences in pronunciation of the different dialects, see the section pronunciation of dialects in this article.

===Vowels===

Catalan has inherited the typical vowel system of Vulgar Latin, with seven stressed phonemes: [tpl]IPA|/a ɛ e i ɔ o u/[/tpl], a common feature in Western Romance, except Spanish.[tpl]sfn|Enciclopèdia Catalana|p=630[/tpl] Balearic has also instances of stressed /ə/.[tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2005|pages=37,53-54[/tpl] Dialects differ in the different degrees of vowel reduction,[tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2005|p=37[/tpl] and the incidence of the pair /ɛ e/.[tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2005|p=38[/tpl]
In Central Catalan, unstressed vowels reduce to three: [tpl]IPA|/a e ɛ/ > ə[/tpl]; [tpl]IPA|/o ɔ u/ > u[/tpl]; [tpl]IPA|/i/[/tpl] remains distinct.[tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2005|p=54[/tpl] The other dialects have different vowel reduction processes (see the section pronunciation of dialects in this article).

===Consonants===

The consonant system of Catalan is rather conservative, shared with most modern Western Romance languages.

===Phonological evolution===

==Dialects==

===Overview===

The dialects of the Catalan language feature a relative uniformity, especially when compared to other Romance languages;[tpl]sfn|Moll|1958|p=47[/tpl] both in terms of vocabulary, semantics, syntax, morphology, and phonology.[tpl]sfn|Enciclopèdia Catalana|pp=634–635[/tpl] Mutual intelligibility between dialects is very high,[tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2005|p=1[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Costa Carreras|Yates|2009|p=5[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Feldhausen|2010|p=5[/tpl] estimates ranging from 90% to 95%. The only exception is the isolated idiosyncratic Alguerese dialect.[tpl]sfn|Moll|1958|p=47[/tpl]
Catalan is split in two major dialectal blocks: Eastern Catalan, and Western Catalan.[tpl]sfn|Feldhausen|2010|p=5[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Enciclopèdia Catalana|pp=634–635[/tpl] The main difference lies in the treatment of unstressed a and e; which have merged to /ə/ in Eastern dialects, but which remain distinct as /a/ and /e/ in Western dialects.[tpl]sfn|Moll|1958|p=47[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Feldhausen|2010|p=5[/tpl] There are a few other differences in pronunciation, verbal morphology, and vocabulary.[tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2005|p=1[/tpl]
Western Catalan comprises the two dialects of North-Western Catalan and Valecian; the Eastern block comprises four dialects: Central Catalan, Balearic, Rossellonese, and Alguerese.[tpl]sfn|Feldhausen|2010|p=5[/tpl] Each dialect can be further subdivided in several subdialects.
Central Catalan is considered the standard pronunciation of the language and has the highest number of speakers.[tpl]sfn|Feldhausen|2010|p=5[/tpl] It is spoken in the densely populated regions of the Barcelona province, the eastern half of the province of Tarragona, and most of the province of Girona.[tpl]sfn|Feldhausen|2010|p=5[/tpl]

===[tpl]anchor|Dialect pronunciation section[/tpl]Pronunciation===

====Vowels====

Catalan has inherited the typical vowel system of Vulgar Latin, with seven stressed phonemes: [tpl]IPA|/a ɛ e i ɔ o u/[/tpl], a common feature in Western Romance, except Spanish.[tpl]sfn|Enciclopèdia Catalana|p=630[/tpl] Balearic has also instances of stressed /ə/.[tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2005|pages=37,53-54[/tpl] Dialects differ in the different degrees of vowel reduction,[tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2005|p=37[/tpl] and the incidence of the pair /ɛ e/.[tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2005|p=38[/tpl]
In Eastern Catalan (except Majorcan), unstressed vowels reduce to three: [tpl]IPA|/a e ɛ/ > ə[/tpl]; [tpl]IPA|/o ɔ u/ > u[/tpl]; [tpl]IPA|/i/[/tpl] remains distinct.[tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2005|p=54[/tpl] There are a few instances of unreduced e, o in some words.[tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2005|p=54[/tpl] Alguerese has lowered ə to a.
In Majorcan, unstressed vowels reduce to four: [tpl]IPA|/a e ɛ/[/tpl] follow the Eastern Catalan reduction pattern; however [tpl]IPA|/o ɔ/[/tpl] reduce to [tpl]IPA|o[/tpl], with [tpl]IPA|/u/[/tpl] remaining distinct, as in Western Catalan.[tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2005|pages=53-54[/tpl]
In Western Catalan, unstressed vowels reduce to five: [tpl]IPA|/e ɛ/ > e[/tpl]; [tpl]IPA|/o ɔ/ > o[/tpl]; [tpl]IPA|/a u i/[/tpl] remain distinct.[tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2005|p=53[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Carbonell|first=Joan F. |last2=Llisterri |first2=Joaquim |year=1999 |chapter=Catalan |title=Handbook of the International Phonetic Association: A Guide to the Usage of the International Phonetic Alphabet|place=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=54–55|isbn=978-0-521-63751-0[/tpl] This reduction pattern, inherited from Proto-Romance, is also found in Italian and Portuguese.[tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2005|p=53[/tpl] Some Western dialects present further reduction or vowel harmony in some cases.[tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2005|p=53[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Recasens|1996|pp=75–76,128–129[/tpl]
Central, Western, and Balearic differ in the lexical incidence of stressed /e/ and /ɛ/.[tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2005|pages=38[/tpl] Usually, words with /ɛ/ in Central Catalan correspond to /ə/ in Balearic and /e/ in Western Catalan.[tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2005|pages=38[/tpl] Words with /e/ in Balearic almost always have /e/ in Central and Western Catalan as well.[tpl]vague|date=April 2014[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2005|pages=38[/tpl] As a result, Central Catalan has a much higher incidence of /e/.[tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2005|pages=38[/tpl]

====Consonants====

===Morphology===

In verbs, 1st person present indicative desinence is -e (∅ in verbs of the 2nd and 3rd conjugation), or -o. E.g. parle, tem, sent (Valencian); parlo, temo, sento (North-Western). In verbs, 1st person present indicative desinence is -o, -i or ∅ in all conjugations.  E.g. parlo (Central), parl (Balearic), parli (Northern), ('I speak').
In verbs, the inchoative desinences are -isc/-ixo, -ix, -ixen, -isca.
In verbs, the inchoative desinences are -eixo, -eix, -eixen, -eixi.
In nouns and adjectives, maintenance of [tpl]IPA|/n/[/tpl] of medieval plurals in proparoxytone words. E.g. hòmens 'men', jóvens 'youth'.
In nouns and adjectives, loss of [tpl]IPA|/n/[/tpl] of medieval plurals in proparoxytone words. E.g. homes 'men', joves 'youth'.

===Vocabulary===

Despite its relative lexical unity, the two dialectal blocks of Catalan (Eastern and Western) show some differences in word choices.[tpl]sfn|Enciclopèdia Catalana|p=632[/tpl] Any lexical divergence within any of the two groups can be explained as an archaism. Also, usually Central Catalan acts as an innovative element.[tpl]sfn|Enciclopèdia Catalana|p=632[/tpl]

==Standards==

Standard Catalan, virtually accepted by all speakers,[tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2003|p=207[/tpl] is mostly based on Eastern Catalan,[tpl]sfn|Feldhausen|2010|p=5[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2003|p=170[/tpl] which is the most widely used dialect. Nevertheless, the standards of Valencia and the Balearics admit alternative forms, mostly traditional ones, which are not current in eastern Catalonia.[tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2003|p=170[/tpl]
The most notable difference between both standards is some tonic [tpl]angle bracket|e[/tpl] accentuation, for instance: francès, anglès (IEC) – francés, anglés (AVL). Nevertheless, AVL's standard keeps the grave accent [tpl]angle bracket|è[/tpl], without pronouncing this [tpl]angle bracket|e[/tpl] as [tpl]IPA|/ɛ/[/tpl], in some words like: què ('what'), or València. Other divergences include the use of [tpl]angle bracket|tl[/tpl] (AVL) in some words instead of [tpl]angle bracket|tll[/tpl] like in ametla/ametlla ('almond'), espatla/espatlla ('back'), the use of elided demonstratives (este 'this', eixe 'that') in the same level as reinforced ones (aquest, aqueix) or the use of many verbal forms common in Valencian, and some of these common in the rest of Western Catalan too, like subjunctive mood or inchoative conjugation in -ix- at the same level as -eix- or the priority use of -e morpheme in 1st person singular in present indicative (-ar verbs): jo compre instead of jo compro ('I buy').
In the Balearic Islands, IEC's standard is used but adapted for the Balearic dialect by the University of the Balearic Islands's philological section. In this way, for instance, IEC says it is correct writing cantam as much as cantem ('we sing') but the University says that the priority form in the Balearic Islands must be "cantam" in all fields. Another feature of the Balearic standard is the non-ending in the 1st person singular present indicative: jo compr ('I buy'), jo tem ('I fear'), jo dorm ('I sleep').
In Alghero, the IEC has adapted its standard to the Alguerese dialect. In this standard one can find, among other features: the definite article lo instead of el, special possessive pronouns and determinants la mia ('mine'), lo sou/la sua ('his/her'), lo tou/la tua ('yours'), and so on, the use of -v- [tpl]IPA|/v/[/tpl] in the imperfect tense in all conjugations: cantava, creixiva, llegiva; the use of many archaic words, usual words in Alguerese: manco instead of menys ('less'), calqui u instead of algú ('someone'), qual/quala instead of quin/quina ('which'), and so on; and the adaptation of weak pronouns.
In 2011, the Aragonese government passed a decree for the establishment of a new language regulator of Catalan in La Franja (the so-called Catalan-speaking areas of Aragon). The new entity, designated as Acadèmia Aragonesa del Català, shall allow a facultative education in Catalan and a standardization of the Catalan language in La Franja.

==[tpl]anchor|About Valencian[/tpl] Status of Valencian==

The vast majority of linguists hold that Catalan and Valencian are the same language, a position that is also shared by the majority of Valencian scholars.[tpl]sfn|Lledó|2011|p=336-337[/tpl] The official regulating body of the language of the Valencian Community, the Academy of the Valencian Language (Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua, AVL) also declares the linguistic unity between Valencian and Catalan."Dictamen de l'Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua sobre els principis i criteris per a la defensa de la denominació i l'entitat del valencià". Report from Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua about denomination and identity of Valencian.[tpl]sfn|Lledó|2011|p=344[/tpl]
[tpl]Quote box|width=72%|align=left|quote= The historical patrimonial language of the Valencian people, from a philological standpoint, is the same shared by the autonomous communinites of Catalonia and Balearic islands, and Principality of Andorra. Additionally, it is the patrimonial historical language of other territories of the ancient Crown of Aragon ... The different varieties of these territories constitute a language, that is, a "linguistic system" ... From this group of varieties, Valencian has the same hierarchy and dignity as any other dialectal modality of that linguistic system ...|source=Ruling of the Valencian Language Academy of 9 February 2005, extract of point 1.[tpl]sfn|Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua|2005[/tpl]Original full text of Dictamen 1: D’acord amb les aportacions més solvents de la romanística acumulades des del segle XIX fins a l’actualitat (estudis de gramàtica històrica, de dialectologia, de sintaxi, de lexicografia…), la llengua pròpia i històrica dels valencians, des del punt de vista de la filologia, és també la que compartixen les comunitats autònomes de Catalunya i de les Illes Balears i el Principat d’Andorra. Així mateix és la llengua històrica i pròpia d’altres territoris de l’antiga Corona d’Aragó (la franja oriental aragonesa, la ciutat sarda de l’Alguer i el departament francés dels Pirineus Orientals). Els diferents parlars de tots estos territoris constituïxen una llengua, és a dir, un mateix «sistema lingüístic», segons la terminologia del primer estructuralisme (annex 1) represa en el Dictamen del Consell Valencià de Cultura, que figura com a preàmbul de la Llei de Creació de l’AVL. Dins d’eixe conjunt de parlars, el valencià té la mateixa jerarquia i dignitat que qualsevol altra modalitat territorial del sistema lingüístic, i presenta unes característiques pròpies que l’AVL preservarà i potenciarà d’acord amb la tradició lexicogràfica i literària pròpia, la realitat lingüística valenciana i la normativització consolidada a partir de les Normes de Castelló.[/tpl]
Valencian is classified as a Western dialect, along with the North-Western varieties spoken in Western Catalonia (provinces of Lleida and most of Tarragona).[tpl]sfn|Feldhausen|2010|p=5[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2005|pages=2-3[/tpl] The various forms of Catalan and Valencian are mutually intelligible (ranging from 90% to 95%)Central Catalan has 90% to 95% inherent intelligibility for speakers of Valencian (1989 R. Hall, Jr.), cited on Ethnologue.
The AVL, created by the Valencian government, is in charge of dictating the official rules governing the use of Valencian, and its standard is based on that of the Institute of Catalan Studies (Institut d'Estudis Catalans, IEC).[tpl]sfn|Lledó|2011|p=338[/tpl] Currently, the majority of people who write in Valencian use this standard.[tpl]sfn|Lledó|2011|p=339[/tpl]
Despite the position of the official organizations, which is also shared with the residents of Catalonia, the majority of Valencian speakers consider their language unique and different from Catalan.[tpl]sfn|Lledó|2011|p=337[/tpl] This position is promoted by people who do not use Valencian regularly.[tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2003|p=207[/tpl] There is a minority of scholars who defend the position of the Royal Academy of Valencian Culture (Acadèmia de Cultura Valenciana, RACV), which uses for Valencian an independent standard from Catalan.[tpl]sfn|Lledó|2011|p=337[/tpl]
This clash of opinions has sparked much controversy. For example, during the drafting of the European Constitution in 2004, the Spanish government supplied the EU with translations of the text into Basque, Galician, Catalan, and Valencian, but the latter two were identical.Isabel I Vilar, Ferran.

==Vocabulary==

===Word choices===

Despite its relative lexical unity, the two dialectal blocks of Catalan (Eastern and Western) show some differences in word choices.[tpl]sfn|Enciclopèdia Catalana|p=632[/tpl] Any lexical divergence within any of the two groups can be explained as an archaism. Also, usually Central Catalan acts as an innovative element.[tpl]sfn|Enciclopèdia Catalana|p=632[/tpl]
Literary Catalan allows the use of words from different dialects, except those of very restricted use.[tpl]sfn|Enciclopèdia Catalana|p=632[/tpl] However, from the 19th century onwards, there is a tendency of favoring words of Northern dialects in detriment of others, even though nowadays there is a greater freedom of choice.[tpl]sfn|Enciclopèdia Catalana|p=632[/tpl]

===Latin and Greek learned words===

Like other languages, Catalan has a large list of learned words from Greek and Latin. This process started very early, and one can find such examples in Ramon Llull's work.[tpl]sfn|Enciclopèdia Catalana|p=632[/tpl] On the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries Catalan had a number of Greco-Latin learned words much superior to other Romance languages, as it can be attested for example in Roís de Corella's writings.[tpl]sfn|Enciclopèdia Catalana|p=632[/tpl]

===Word formation===

The process of word derivation in Catalan follows the same principles as the other Romance languages,[tpl]sfn|Enciclopèdia Catalana|p=631[/tpl] where agglutination is common. Many times, several affixes are appended to a preexisting lexeme, and some sound alternations can occur, for example elèctri'c ə'lɛktri'''k''' ("electrical") vs. ''electri'''c'''itat'' ələktri'''s'''i'tat. Prefixes are usually appended to verbs, for as in pre'veure ("foresee").[tpl]sfn|Enciclopèdia Catalana|p=631[/tpl]
There is greater regularity in the process of word-compouding, where one can find compounded words as much as in English.[tpl]sfn|Enciclopèdia Catalana|p=631[/tpl]

==Writing system==

Catalan uses the Roman alphabet, with some added symbols and digraphs.[tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2005|p=6[/tpl] The Catalan orthography is systematic and largely phonologically based.[tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2005|p=6[/tpl]

==Grammar==

The grammar of Catalan is similar to other Romance languages. Features include:[tpl]sfn|Swan|2001|pp=97-98[/tpl]

===Gender and number inflection===

|
|
|
|}
In gender inflection, the most notable feature is (compared to Portuguese, Spanish or Italian), the disapparition of the typical masculine suffix -o. Thus, the alternance of -o/-a, has been replaced by ø/-a.[tpl]sfn|Enciclopèdia Catalana|p=630[/tpl] There are only a few exceptions, like minso/minsa ("scarce").[tpl]sfn|Enciclopèdia Catalana|p=630[/tpl] Many not completely predictable morphological alternations may occur, like:[tpl]sfn|Enciclopèdia Catalana|p=630[/tpl]
Catalan has few suppletive couplets, like Italian and Spanish, and unlike French. Thus, Catalan has noi/noia ("boy"/"girl") and gall/gallina ("cock"/"hen"), whereas French has garçon/fille and coq/poule.[tpl]sfn|Enciclopèdia Catalana|p=630[/tpl]
There is a tendency to abandon traditionally gender-invariable adjectives in favour of marked ones, something prevalent in Occitan and French. Thus, one can find bullent/bullenta ("boiling") in constrast with traditional bullent/bullent.[tpl]sfn|Enciclopèdia Catalana|p=630[/tpl]
Like in the other Western Romance languages, the main plural expression is the suffix -s, which may create morphological alternations akin the ones found in gender inflection, albeit more rarely.[tpl]sfn|Enciclopèdia Catalana|p=630[/tpl]
The most important one is the addition of -o- before certain consonant groups, a phonetic phenomenon that does not affect feminine forms: el pols/els polsos ("the pulse"/"the pulses") vs. la pols/les pols ("the dust"/"the dusts").[tpl]sfn|Enciclopèdia Catalana|p=630-631[/tpl]

===Determiners===

|
|
|}
The inflection of determinatives is complex, specially because of the high number of elisions, but is similar to the neighboring languages.[tpl]sfn|Enciclopèdia Catalana|p=631[/tpl] Catalan has more contractions of preposition + article than Spanish, like dels ("of + the plural"), but not as many as Italian (which has sul, col, nel, etc.).[tpl]sfn|Enciclopèdia Catalana|p=631[/tpl]
Central Catalan has abandoned almost completely unstressed possessives (mon, etc.) in favour of constructions of article + stressed forms (el meu, etc.), a feature shared with Italian.[tpl]sfn|Enciclopèdia Catalana|p=631[/tpl]

===Personal pronouns===

The morphology of Catalan personal pronouns is complex, specially in unstressed forms, which are numerous (13 distinct forms, compared to 11 in Spanish or 9 in Italian; French has such a different system that comparisons are not feasible). [tpl]sfn|Enciclopèdia Catalana|p=631[/tpl] Features include the neuter gender (ho) and the great degree of freedom when combining different unstressed pronouns (65 combinations).[tpl]sfn|Enciclopèdia Catalana|p=631[/tpl]
The Catalan pronouns exhibit T–V distinction, like all other Romance languages (and most European languages, but not English). This feature implies the use of a different set of second person pronouns for formality.
This flexibility allows Catalan to use extraposition extensively, much more than French or Spanish. Thus, Catalan can have m'hi recomanaren ("they recommended me to him"), whereas in French one must say ils m'ont recommandé à lui, and Spanish me recomendaron a él.[tpl]sfn|Enciclopèdia Catalana|p=631[/tpl] This allows the placement of almost any nominal term as a sentence topic, without having to use so often the passive voice (as in French or English), or identifying the direct object with a preposition (as in Spanish).[tpl]sfn|Enciclopèdia Catalana|p=631[/tpl]

===Verbs===

Like all the Romance languages, Catalan verbal inflection is more complex than the nominal. Suffixation is omnipresent, whereas morphological alternations play a secondary role.[tpl]sfn|Enciclopèdia Catalana|p=631[/tpl] Vowel alternances are active, as well as infixation and suppletion. However, these are not as productive as in Spanish, and are mostly restricted to irregular verbs.[tpl]sfn|Enciclopèdia Catalana|p=631[/tpl]
The Catalan verbal system is basically common to all Western Romance, except that most dialects have replaced the analytic indicative perfect with a periphrastic form of anar ("to go") + infinitive.[tpl]sfn|Enciclopèdia Catalana|p=631[/tpl]
Catalan verbs are traditionally divided into three conjugations, with vowel themes -a-, -e-, -i-, the last two being split into two subtypes. However, this division is mostly theoretical.[tpl]sfn|Enciclopèdia Catalana|p=631[/tpl] Only the first conjugation is nowadays productive (with about 3500 common verbs), whereas the third (the subtype of servir, with about 700 common verbs) is semiproductive. The verbs of the second conjugation are fewer than 100, and it is not possible to create new ones, except by compounding.[tpl]sfn|Enciclopèdia Catalana|p=631[/tpl]

===Syntax===

The grammar of Catalan follows the general pattern of Western Romance languages. The primary word order is SVO (subject–verb–object).The World Atlas of Language Structures. wals.info.

==Catalan names==

In the Spanish state (as in Portugal), every person has officially two surnames, one of which is the father's first surname and the other is the mother's first surname.[tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2005|p=8[/tpl] The law contemplates the possibility of joining both surnames with the Catalan conjunction i ("and").[tpl]sfn|Wheeler|2005|p=8[/tpl]article 19.1 of Law 1/1998 stipulates that "the citizens of Catalonia have the right to use the proper regulation of their Catalan names and surnames and to introduce the conjunction between surnames"

==Sample text==

Selected text[tpl]sfn|Swan|2001|p=112[/tpl] from Manuel de Pedrolo's 1970 novel Un amor fora ciutat ("A love affair outside the city").
