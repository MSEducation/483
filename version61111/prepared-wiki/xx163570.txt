The Bundaberg Region is a local government area in the Wide Bay-Burnett region of Queensland, Australia, about [tpl]convert|360|km|mi[/tpl] north of Brisbane, the state capital. It is centred on the city of Bundaberg, and also contains a significant rural area surrounding the city. It was created in 2008 from a merger of the City of Bundaberg with the Shires of Burnett, Isis and Kolan.
The Bundaberg Regional Council, which administers the Region, has an estimated operating budget of A$89 million.

==History==

Local government in the Bundaberg area began on 11 November 1879 with the creation of 74 divisions around Queensland under the Divisional Boards Act 1879. These included the Barolin, Burrum and Kolan divisions.[tpl]cite QSA Agency|317|Barolin Divisional Board|12 September 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite QSA Agency|547|Burrum Divisional Board|12 September 2013[/tpl]
The first eight years saw several areas break away and become self-governing due to increases in local population. The first was Bundaberg itself, which with an area of [tpl]convert|4.1|km2|sqmi[/tpl] and a population of 1,192, split from Barolin on 22 April 1881 to form the Municipality of Bundaberg under the Local Government Act 1878. Areas to the south (Woongarra) and north (Gooburrum) of the Burnett River split from Kolan on 31 December 1885, and Barolin on 30 January 1886 respectively, while on 1 January 1887, the Isis Division further to the south split away from Burrum.Queensland Government Gazette, various issues. Accessed at Battye Library, Perth. Thus by 1887, the Municipality of Bundaberg and the Barolin, Gooburrum, Isis, Kolan and Woongarra Divisions covered the entire territory of what is now the Bundaberg Region.
On 31 March 1903, after the passage of the Local Authorities Act 1902, the Municipality became a Town while the Divisions became Shires. On 22 November 1913, Bundaberg was proclaimed a City.Queensland Government Gazette, Vol. CL, 22 November 1913, p.1422.
On 21 December 1917, the Shire of Barolin was abolished and its area split between the City of Bundaberg and the Shire of Woongarra.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.archivessearch.qld.gov.au/Search/AgencyDetails.aspx?AgencyId=316|title=Agency Details - Barolin Shire Council|author=Queensland Archives|accessdate=13 June 2011[/tpl] Bundaberg grew to [tpl]convert|45.2|km2|sqmi[/tpl] and was united with what was then its entire suburban extent.
On 21 November 1991, the Electoral and Administrative Review Commission, created two years earlier, produced its second report, and recommended that local government boundaries in the Bundaberg area be rationalised. The Local Government (Bundaberg and Burnett) Regulation 1993 was gazetted on 17 December 1993, and on 30 March 1994, the Shires of Gooburrum and Woongarra were abolished, with most transferred into a new Shire of Burnett. A portion of Woongarra was transferred to the City, more than doubling its area and increasing its population by 8,200 in 1991 census terms.
On 15 March 2008, under the Local Government (Reform Implementation) Act 2007 passed by the Parliament of Queensland on 10 August 2007, the City of Bundaberg merged with the Shires of Burnett, Isis and Kolan to form the Bundaberg Region.[tpl]cite book|title=Report of the Local Government Reform Commission|author=Queensland Local Government Reform Commission|volume=2|pages=51â€“56|isbn=1-921057-11-4|date=July 2007|url=http://www.dlgp.qld.gov.au/resources/map/reform/bundaberg-rationale.pdf|accessdate=11 June 2011[/tpl]

==Wards and councillors==

Although the Commission recommended the council be undivided with ten councillors and a mayor, the gazetted form was that of 10 divisions each electing a single councillor, plus a mayor representing the whole region.
Those elected on 15 March 2008 were as follows:[tpl]cite web|url=http://bundaberg.qld.gov.au/council/about-council/councillors|title=Councillors|author=Bundaberg Regional Council|accessdate=15 June 2011[/tpl]
