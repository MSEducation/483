Grace Submerged, the second album by Norwegian doom/gothic metal band Octavia Sperati, was released in May 2007 via Candlelight Records.  It was produced by Herbrand Larsen, who also plays keyboards and engineers albums for  Enslaved.  Ivar Bjornson (guitarist for Enslaved) makes an appearance here, co-writing "Dead End Poem".  The album features an interpretation of the Phil Lynott-penned "Don't Believe A Word", which Terrorizer Magazine called "a chilling ballad".
