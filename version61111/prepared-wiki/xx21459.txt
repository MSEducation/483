[[Falchion]]

CATEGORIES: Single-edged swords, Medieval blade weapons

A falchion ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|f|ɔː|l|tʃ|ən[/tpl]; Old French: fauchon; Latin: falx, "sickle") is a one-handed, single-edged sword of European origin, whose design is reminiscent of the Persian scimitar and the Chinese dao.
The weapon combined the weight and power of an axe with the versatility of a sword. Falchions are found in different forms from around the 11th century up to and including the sixteenth century. In some versions the falchion looks rather like the scramasax and later the sabre, and in some versions the form is irregular or like a machete with a crossguard.

==Types==

The blade designs of falchions varied widely across the continent and through the ages. They almost always included a single edge with a slight curve on the blade towards the point on the end and most were also affixed with a quilloned crossguard for the hilt in the manner of the contemporary arming swords. Unlike the double-edged swords of Europe, few actual swords of this type have survived to the present day; fewer than a dozen specimens are currently known.The Conyers Falchion accessed January 27, 2007.  Two basic types can be identified:
In addition, there are a group of 13th. and early 14th. century weapons sometimes identified with the falchion. These have a falchion-like blade mounted on a wooden haft [tpl]convert|1|-|2|ft|cm|abbr=on[/tpl] long, sometimes ending in a curve like an umbrella. These are seen in numerous illustration in the mid-13th. century Maciejowski Bible.e.g. folio 3v., folio 14v
A number of weapons superficially similar to the falchion existed in Western Europe, including the Messer, hanger and the backsword.

==Status==

It is sometimes presumed that these swords had a lower quality and status than the longer, more expensive swords. It is possible that some falchions were used as axe-like tools between wars and fights, since they were practical pieces of equipment. While falchions are commonly thought to be peasants' weaponshttp://www.middle-ages.org.uk/falchion-sword.htm this is not always the case; the Conyers falchion belonged to a landed family,Conyers Falchion, op cit and the falchion is shown in illustrations of combat between mounted knights.e.g.media:bannockburn.jpg Some later falchions were ornate and used by the nobility; there is an elaborately engraved and gold plated falchion from the 1560s in the Wallace Collection, engraved with the personal coat of arms of Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany.[ref]*
