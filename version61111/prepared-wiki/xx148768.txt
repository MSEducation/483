The Exploding Plastic Inevitable, sometimes simply called Plastic Inevitable or EPI, was a series of multimedia events organized by Andy Warhol between 1966 and 1967, featuring musical performances by The Velvet Underground and Nico, screenings of Warhol's films, and dancing and performances by regulars of Warhol's Factory, especially Mary Woronov and Gerard Malanga. Andy Warhol's Exploding Plastic Inevitable is also the title of a 18-minute film by Ronald Nameth with recordings from one week of performances of the shows which were filmed in Chicago, Illinois, in 1966. In December 1966 Warhol included a one-off magazine called The Plastic Exploding Inevitable as part of the Aspen No. 3 package.[tpl]Cite journal|title=From the research laboratories of Andy Warhol comes this issue of Aspen Magazine |date=April 1967 |url=http://www.ubu.com/aspen/advertisements/aspen3Ad.html |journal=Evergreen Review |volume=11 |issue=46[/tpl]
The Exploding Plastic Inevitable had its beginnings in an event staged on January 13, 1966 at a dinner for the New York Society for Clinical Psychiatry. This event, called "Up-Tight", included performances by the Velvet Underground and Nico, along with Malanga and Edie Sedgwick as dancers.[tpl]Cite journal|first=Branden W. |last=Joseph |authorlink=Branden W.

Andy Warhol's lights engineer Danny Williams pioneered many innovations that have since become standard practice in rock music light shows. In May 27, 28 and 29 the  EPI played The Fillmore in San Francisco, where Williams built a light show including stroboscopes, slides and film projections onstage. At Bill Graham's request he was soon to come back and build more. Film maker Jonas Mekas (who pioneered film projections during concerts at New York's Cinematheque), Andy Warhol and Danny Williams' influential ideas much contributed to the legendary Fillmore Auditorium prestige and image and were also later used at the Fillmore East and Fillmore West, both opened in 1968.
