In mathematics, the Bolza surface, alternatively, complex algebraic Bolza curve (named after Oskar Bolza), is a compact Riemann surface of genus 2 with the highest possible order of the conformal automorphism group in this genus, namely 48.  An affine model for the Bolza surface can be obtained as the locus of the equation
