As predicted by Marc Lépine in his suicide letter, some saw the event as the isolated act of a madman.  A psychiatrist interviewed Lépine's family and friends and examined his writings as part of the police investigation. He noted that Marc Lépine defined suicide as his primary motivation, and that he chose a specific suicide method: killing one's self after killing others (multiple homicide/suicide strategy) is considered a sign of a serious personality disorder.  Other psychiatrists emphasized the traumatic events of his childhood, suggesting that the blows he had received may have caused brain damage, or that Lépine was psychotic, having lost touch with reality as he tried to erase the memories of a brutal (yet largely absent) father while unconsciously identifying with a violent masculinity that dominated women.[tpl]Cite book | last = Fox | first = James Alan| last2 = Levin | first2 = Jack  |title = Extreme killing: Understanding serial and mass murder | publisher = Sage Publications |pages = 227–230 |year = 2005 | isbn = 0-7619-8857-2[/tpl] A different theory was that Lépine's childhood experiences of abuse led him to feel victimized as he faced losses and rejections in his later life.[tpl]cite news | last =Lortie | first = Marie-Claude |title = Poly un an après : Psychose?

Others expressed a broader analysis, framing Lépine's actions as the result of societal changes that had led to increased poverty, powerlessness, individual isolation, and polarization between men and women.[tpl]cite book |author=Young, Katherine K.; Nathanson, Paul |title=Legalizing misandry: from public shame to systematic discrimination against men |publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press |location=Montreal |year=2006 |page= 62|isbn=0-7735-2862-8 |oclc= |url= http://books.google.com/?id=cqKxhhu55SMC&pg=PA62[/tpl] Noting Lépine's interest in violent action films, some suggested that violence in the media and in society may have influenced his actions. Following the shootings at Dawson College on September 13, 2006, Globe and Mail columnist Jan Wong controversially suggested that Marc Lépine may have felt alienated from Quebec society as he was the child of an immigrant.

==Impact==

The injured and witnesses among university staff and students suffered a variety of physical, social, existential, financial, and psychological consequences, including post-traumatic stress disorder. A number of students committed suicide.[tpl]cite journal| last =Parent| first =G  | coauthors =Cousineau, M| title =Conséquences à long terme d'un mass murder: le cas de Polytechnique, neuf ans plus tard| journal =The International Journal of Victimology| volume =1| issue =3| year =2003| url =http://www.jidv.com/njidv/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=189:consequences-a-long-terme-dun-mass-murder-le-cas-de-polytechnique-neuf-ans-plus-tard&catid=109:jidv03&Itemid=391| accessdate =December 29, 2006[/tpl] In the suicide letters of at least two of them, the anguish they suffered following the massacre was cited as the reason for killing themselves. Nine years after the event, survivors reported still being affected by their experiences, though with time some of the effects had lessened.

===Police response===

Police response to the shootings was heavily criticized for the amount of time it gave Lépine to carry out the massacre. The first police officers to arrive at the scene established a perimeter around the building and waited before entering the building. During this period, several women were killed.[tpl]cite news | last =Sheppard| first =Robert| title =A sea change in police tactics when it comes to gunmen| publisher =CBC News| date = September 15, 2006| url =http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/realitycheck/sheppard/20060915.html | accessdate =December 29, 2006 [/tpl]  Subsequent changes to emergency response protocols led to praise of emergency responders' handling of the Dawson College shooting in 2006 in which one woman was killed by a shooter. In that incident, coordination amongst emergency response agencies and prompt intervention was credited with minimizing the loss of life.

===Gun control===

The massacre was a major spur for the Canadian gun control movement. One of the survivors, Heidi Rathjen, who was in one of the classrooms Lépine did not enter during the shooting, organized the Coalition for Gun Control with Wendy Cukier. Suzanne Laplante-Edward and Jim Edward, the parents of one of the victims, were also deeply involved.[tpl]cite news | last =Boyd| first =Denny| title =Couple salvages purpose from their daughter's tragic death|page =B1|work=Vancouver Sun | date = April 20, 1992[/tpl] Their activities, along with others, led to the passage of Bill C-68, or the Firearms Act, in 1995, ushering in stricter gun control regulations. These new regulations included requirements on the training of gun owners, screening of firearm applicants, rules concerning gun and ammunition storage and the registration of all firearms.  Between 2009 and 2012 survivors of the massacre and their families publicly opposed legislative actions by Stephen Harper's Conservative government aimed at ending the long-gun registry;[tpl]cite news |first=Susan|last=Delacourt|url=http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/734816--long-gun-registry-politics-taint-service-for-the-victims |title=Long-gun registry politics taint service for the victims |work=Toronto Star |accessdate=December 6, 2009 |date= December 5, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite news |first= Ingrid|last=Peritz|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/a-slap-in-the-face-for-victims/article1390008/ |title='A slap in the face' for victims|work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada   |accessdate=December 6, 2009|date= December 6, 2009 [/tpl] A bill was narrowly defeated in September 2010,[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/politics/article/1092302--montreal-massacre-survivor-slams-plan-to-scrap-long-gun-registry |title=Montreal massacre survivor slams plan to scrap long-gun registry  |first= Tonda|last= MacCharles |work= Toronto Star|date=November 24, 2011 |accessdate=5 December 2012[/tpl] but following their 2011 majority election win, the long-gun registry was abolished by the Harper government in April 2012.[tpl]cite news |url= http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/04/05/long-gun-registry-end-celebrated-by-harper-tories/ |title=Long-gun registry end to be celebrated by Tories as fury mounts in Quebec  |work=National Post |date=April 5, 2012 |accessdate=5 December 2012[/tpl] The Quebec government subsequently won a temporary injunction, preventing the destruction of the province's gun registry data, and ordering the continued registration of long guns in Quebec.[tpl]cite news |url= http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/04/21/quebec-court-backs-gun-registry-sets-stage-for-federal-legal-battle/ |title=Quebec court backs long-gun registry, sets stage for federal legal battle |first=Sue |last=Montgomery |work=National Post|date=April 21, 2012 |accessdate=5 December 2012[/tpl]

===Violence against women===

The massacre galvanized the Canadian women's movement, who see it as a symbol of violence against women. "The death of those young women would not be in vain, we promised", Canadian feminist Judy Rebick recalled. "We would turn our mourning into organizing to put an end to male violence against women."[tpl]cite news| last =Rebick| first =Judy| title = Where's the funding for abused women?| publisher =CBC| date = December 6, 2000| url =http://www.cbc.ca/news/viewpoint/columns/rebick/rebick001206.html | accessdate =March 7, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070321225539/http://www.cbc.ca/news/viewpoint/columns/rebick/rebick001206.html |archivedate = March 21, 2007[/tpl]
In response to the killings a House of Commons Sub-Committee on the Status of Women was created. It released a report "The War against Women" in June 1991, which was not endorsed by the full standing committee.[tpl]cite news | last =Vienneau| first =David| title =Probe on violence toward women blocked| page =A4 |work=Toronto Star| date =January 19, 1991[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last1= Hooks|first1=Tess|last2=LeClerc| first2= Patrice|last3= Beaujot|first3= Roderic|title=Female well-being: toward a global theory of social change|editor=Janet Mancini Billson, Carolyn Fluehr-Lobban|publisher=Zed Books|pages=102–103|isbn= 978-1-84277-009-2 |chapter= Women in Canada: a century of struggle| url=http://books.google.com/?id=a_2eWZK63_8C&pg=PA102|year=2005[/tpl]  However, following its recommendations, the federal government established the Canadian Panel on Violence Against Women in August 1991. The panel issued a final report, "Changing the Landscape: Ending Violence – Achieving Equality", in June 1993. The panel proposed a two-pronged "National Action Plan" consisting of an "Equality Action Plan" and a "Zero Tolerance Policy" designed to increase women's equality and reduce violence against women through government policy. Critics of the panel said that the plan failed to provide a workable timeline and strategy for implementation and that with over four hundred recommendations, the final report failed to make an impact.[tpl]cite web| last =Harder| first = Sandra | title = Violence against women: the Canadian Panel's final report | publisher = Government of Canada | url =http://publications.gc.ca/collections/Collection-R/LoPBdP/MR/mr122-e.htm | accessdate =February 3, 2007 [/tpl]
