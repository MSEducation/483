==Philosophy==

The courses and programs of Globaloria use a Constructionist Learning approach[tpl]cite web|last=Aronowitz|first=Scott|title=From Instruction to Construction: Rethinking the Classroom Model with Globaloria Read more at http://thejournal.com/articles/2010/05/19/from-instruction-to-construction-rethinking-the-classroom-model-with-globaloria.aspx#ig5EBtdDDWFEpmVP.99|url=http://thejournal.com/articles/2010/05/19/from-instruction-to-construction-rethinking-the-classroom-model-with-globaloria.aspx|work=The Journal|publisher=1105 Media Inc.|accessdate=24 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Rayala|first=Martin|title=Harnessing the Learning Potential of Social Networking and Game Design|journal=The Journal of Media Literacy|date=December 2012|volume=59|issue=1|page=9|url=http://www.worldwideworkshop.org/pdfs/Journal_of_Media_Literacy_2012.pdf|accessdate=19 January 2013[/tpl]  to achieve its goals: 1) engaging students in digital learning, 2) empowering teachers and principals through STEM, and 3) disrupting and restructuring the current education system.
The following mission statement is published on the Globaloria website:[tpl]cite web|title=Introduction to Globaloria|url=http://www.globaloria.org/intro|work=Globaloria|publisher=World Wide Workshop|accessdate=9 September 2013[/tpl]
Using Globaloria’s virtual network of educational tools and resources, students are encouraged to construct, interact, and play to deepen their learning and thinking about complex STEM, computing, and core curricular topics.
Globaloria is based on the MIT PhD research of Idit Harel Caperton, and her articles and books, Children Designers and Constructionism. Its project-based learning system integrates learning logs, analysis blogs, individual and team project spaces, skill-building tutorials, instructional help desk,[tpl]cite journal|last=Harel Caperton|first=Idit|title=Learning to Make Games for Impact|journal=The Journal of Media Literacy|date=February 1, 2012|month=December|volume=59|issue=1|page=34|accessdate=24 October 2013[/tpl]  and more, to blend online and in-class learning around any topic.[tpl]cite web|last=Meersschaert|first=Kate|title=EdLab Review: Globaloria|url=http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/7266|work=EdLab|publisher=Teachers College - Columbia University|accessdate=26 October 2013[/tpl] Harel Caperton wrote:
"Globaloria is true social learning: A networked social media technology platform... is the vehicle for acquiring mathematics, design, engineering, science and civics content in compliance with any state-mandated standards and the new Common Core standards--as well as for acquiring social skills of collaboration, and the habits of team-driving analytical thinking and problem-solving."
The World Wide Workshop team and its partners assert that these are the very skills needed to be productive, successful 21st-century citizens in the global knowledge economy.[tpl]cite journal|last=Alvarez|first=Cristina|title=The Do-It-Yourself Game Generation|journal=The Journal of Media Literacy|date=December 2012|volume=59|issue=1|pages=14–15|accessdate=24 October 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Miller|first=Elizabeth R.|title=Teaching digital literacy through game design|url=http://www.knightfoundation.org/blogs/knightblog/2012/1/30/teaching-digital-literacy-through-game-design/|work=Knight Blog|publisher=John S. & James L.

==Outcomes==

The key outcome of Globaloria courses in any implementation format is that each student successfully learns to take an idea from invention to completion, and to collaborate with peers to design, research, code, program and publish an original educational game (web/mobile). Along the way, students also master global thinking, social media tools such as blogs and wikis, and the skills required to document, chronicle, and co-learn as active members of an online learning community. A profile in Education Week highlighted that Globaloria users develop "the transferable skills of proposal writing, storyboarding, ActionScript software coding, informational blogging, and presentation of progress reports, as students follow a development plan similar to those in the commercial gaming industry through tools available through their account on Globaloria's social learning platform."[tpl]cite news|last=Quillen|first=Ian|title=Students Tackle Video Game Design|url=http://www.edweek.org/dd/articles/2012/06/13/03games.h05.html|accessdate=10 May 2013|newspaper=Education Week|date=13 June 2012[/tpl]
Research has shown that Globaloria educates students in technical and computational skills, as well as content knowledge, which results in improved academic performance and increased Constructionist and digital learning abilities, preparing them for college-level studies, digital citizenship, and careers in the global knowledge economy.[tpl]Cite report |author=Rockman, et al  |coauthors=Borland, J. |date=September 2013 |title=Globaloria: Second Year Implementation & Outcome Report for Silicon Valley  |url=http://www.worldwideworkshop.org/pdfs/Globaloria_San_Jose_Y2.pdf |publisher=World Wide Workshop |accessdate=October 24, 2013[/tpl][tpl]Cite report |author=Edvantia Inc |coauthors=Chadwick, K., Gore, J., Hsiang-Yeh, H. |date=February 2013 |title=Globaloria Replication Study: An Examination of the Relationships between Globaloria Participation and Student Achievement in Year 5 of the West Virginia Pilot Implementation |url= |publisher=World Wide Workshop |accessdate=October 24, 2013[/tpl] Additionally, Globaloria has been named by the National Center for Women and Information Technology as a "Promising Practice" for engaging girls in computing,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ncwit.org/resources/assessing-girls%E2%80%99-interest-confidence-and-participation-computing-activities-results |title=Assessing Girls' Interest, Confidence, and Participation in Computing Activities: Results for Globaloria West Virginia. |last1=Ashcraft |first1=Catherine |last2=Wu |first2=Zhen |last3=DuBow |first3=Wendy |last4=Reynolds |first4=Rebecca |date=August 2012 |website=National Center for Women & Information Technology |publisher=National Center for Women & Information Technology |accessdate=28 October 2013[/tpl] as a result of its success shrinking the digital divide faced by girls and minorities.[tpl]cite conference |url=http://www.worldwideworkshop.org/pdfs/aera2011_fullpaper_final.pdf |title=Possible Contributors to Evaluated Student Outcomes in a Discovery-Based Program of Game Design Learning. |last1=Reynolds |first1=Rebecca |date=April 2011 |conference= American Education Research Association annual conference |location=New Orleans, LA[/tpl]

==History==

===Pilot Platforms===

Dating back to its prototype in 2006, Globaloria was envisioned as a composition of multiple platforms, each of which would have its own network, themes, and active communities. Over time, these themed platforms were merged and become the vibrant Globaloria network that exists today.
Five Globaloria networks launched the pilot program, each of which was to focus on a broad theme: health, science, math, human rights, and important global issues. The game or sim the students created was about one of these global themes. An individual class or small group formed its own community within the network, connecting with other communities within that network. Each community received a wiki-like programmable technology space to serve as the community's virtual classroom or clubhouse. There, the learners created profile pages and project pages, as well as used a step-by-step curriculum to learn to design and build a game to be published on the web. Each community also received access to learning content, such as sample games with downloadable codes and custom tutorials. Every participant in the community learned to create a media-rich blog in which to think and reflect regularly on his or her game-making experience and learning process. Practicing how to learn online, blog, and use wiki software were identified as major skills for digital citizenship.
Three operational network platforms were tested in the beta version of Globaloria: MyHLife (MyHealthLife), MySLife (MyScienceLife), and MyGLife (My Global Life). Three additional social platforms were developed but not formally launched: MyRLife (MyHumanRightsLife), MyALife (MyArtLife), and MyMLife (MyMathLife).[tpl]cite web|title=Past Programs|url=http://worldwideworkshop.org/programs/past-programs|work=World Wide Workshop|publisher=World Wide Workshop|accessdate=28 October 2013[/tpl]
MyHLife
MyHLife (MyHealthLife) was an online platform within the Globaloria network that allowed students to become the makers of interactive web games and simulations that focus on important health issues such as nutrition, exercise, HIV/AIDS, and malaria. In the process of game and simulation making, students dove into the issues that affect them and their communities while improving their 21st century skills. In the summer of 2008, the World Wide Workshop Foundation worked with 10 students (ranging from 10–17 years old) from Rethink in New Orleans. With MyHLife, students worked together to create a web game called "The Ultimate Lunch Tray" that advocated for a healthier cafeteria and healthier lifestyles in New Orleans Public Schools.

MySLife
MySLife (MyScienceLife) was an online platform within the Globaloria network that allowed participants to become the makers of interactive web games and simulations that focused on science. In the 2008 pilot year and in partnership with Schlumberger-Seed, the World Wide Workshop directed participants from around the world to focus on two topics – global climate and energy. While participating in the process of game and simulation creation, participants learned 21st century learning skills as well as climate and energy topics such as greenhouse gases and wave energy science.
MyGLife
MyGLife (MyGlobalLife) was an online platform within the Globaloria network that allowed participants to become makers of interactive web games and simulations that focused on subject areas regarding math, science, history and social issues. It is now called Globaloria. In partnership with the Governor of West Virginia, Benedum Foundation, Center for Professional Development for the State of West Virginia (CPD), Knight Foundation, and other supporting organizations, the World Wide Workshop implemented a statewide pilot program that brought the Globaloria program into classrooms throughout West Virginia. With a customized curriculum, training, and support programs developed by the World Wide Workshop, Globaloria game and simulation production classes were introduced to seven groups, representing middle schools, high schools, vocational schools and community colleges for grade and credit in June 2007.

===U.S. Launch===

After several pilots of Globaloria internationally during 2006-2007, in July 2007, the Harel Caperton and the World Wide Workshop team discovered and pursued an exciting RFP: The governor and first lady of West Virginia were looking for an "innovative technology program that would transform education throughout the state by using the latest Web technology and innovative content." Having heard of the World Wide Workshop Foundation, Governor Joe Manchin believed that the Globaloria Program could help in this educational endeavor.[tpl]YouTube|id=ezJIyFBfUiY|title="Gayle Manchin - Transforming Education"[/tpl]
Funding was received, and in August 2007 the World Wide Workshop Foundation began to implement the Globaloria program statewide in West Virginia to stimulate economic and social development, foster job creation, and position the state as a leader in 21st century education.[tpl]cite speech |title=Erik Huey Remarks to the Third Annual Globaloria Colloquium |author=First Last |authorlink=First |date=April 1, 2000 |location=Charleston, WV |url=http://www.worldwideworkshop.org/pdfs/Erik_Huey_WV_Colloquium_Speech_102510.pdf |date=October 25, 2010 [/tpl] In its first pilot year, 89 students and 18 educators from seven learning institutions became the first participants to use the Globaloria-WV program’s MyGLife network for learning to design educational web-games. In the second pilot year, which started in August 2008, Globaloria-WV more than doubled in size to over 250 participants. With the support of the State of West Virginia and other partners, the World Wide Workshop continued its growth and impact throughout West Virginia, reaching schools across 25 counties in the past seven years.
