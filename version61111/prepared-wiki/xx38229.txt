==History==

===Birth of a "New City"===

In the 1960s, the British government decided that a further generation of new towns in the south-east of England was needed to relieve housing congestion in London.
Since the 1950s, overspill housing for several London boroughs had been constructed in Bletchley.[tpl]cite web|url=http://clutch.open.ac.uk/schools/eaton-overspill00/begining.html |title=Bletchley Pioneers, Planning, & Progress |publisher=Clutch.open.ac.uk |date=16 December 1944 |accessdate=2012-11-23[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://clutch.open.ac.uk/schools/eaton-overspill00/housing.html |title=Welcome to Adobe GoLive 4 |publisher=Clutch.open.ac.uk |accessdate=2012-11-23[/tpl]Need for more planned towns in the South-East.The Times. 2 December 1964 Accessed 21 September 2006 Further studiesSouth East Study 1961–1981 HMSO 1964, cited in The Plan for Milton Keynes.

Planning control was taken from elected local authorities and delegated to the Milton Keynes Development Corporation (MKDC).
The Corporation's strongly modernist designs featured regularly in the magazines Architectural Design and the Architects' Journal. MKDC was determined to learn from the mistakes made in the earlier New Towns and revisit the Garden City ideals. They set in place the characteristic grid roads that run between districts, as well as the intensive planting, lakes and parkland that are so evident today. Central Milton Keynes was not intended to be a traditional town centre but a business and shopping district that supplemented the Local Centres in most of the Grid Squares.  This non-hierarchical devolved city plan was a departure from the English New Towns tradition and envisaged a wide range of industry and diversity of housing styles and tenures across the city. The largest and almost the last of the British New Towns, Milton Keynes has stood the test of time far better than most, and has proved flexible and adaptable.Jeff Bishop Milton Keynes[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl] the Best of Both Worlds?

Retrieved 13 February 2007 The radical grid plan was inspired by the work of Californian urban theorist Melvin M.

'Cities and Spaces Hopkins, Baltimore. Retrieved 13 February 2007
The Government wound up MKDC in 1992, 25 years after the new town was created, transferring control to the Commission for New Towns (CNT) and then finally to English Partnerships, with the planning function returning to local authority control (since 1974 and the Local Government Act 1972, the  Borough of Milton Keynes). From 2004 to 2011, a Government quango, the Milton Keynes Partnership, had development control powers to accelerate the growth of Milton Keynes.
Along with many other towns and boroughs, Milton Keynes competed for formal city status in the 2000, 2002 and 2012 competitions, but was not successful. Nevertheless, the term "city" is used by its citizens, local media and bus services to describe itself, perhaps because the term "town" is taken to mean one of the constituent towns. Road signs refer to "Central Milton Keynes" or "Shopping" when directing traffic to the town centre.

===Prior history===

The area that was to become Milton Keynes encompassed a landscape that has a rich historic legacy. The area to be developed was largely farmland and undeveloped villages, but with evidence of permanent settlement dating back to the Bronze Age. Before construction began, every area was subject to detailed archaeological investigation: doing so has provided a unique insight into the history of a large sample of the landscape of south-central England. There is evidence of Iron Age, Romano-British, Anglo-Saxon, Anglo-Norman, Medieval and Industrial revolution settlements. Collections[tpl]cite web|url=http://clutch.open.ac.uk |title=Welcome to the Millennium CLUTCH Project |publisher=Clutch.open.ac.uk |accessdate=2012-11-23[/tpl] of oral history covering the 20th century completes a picture that is described in detail in another article.
Bletchley Park, the site of world War II British codebreaking and Colossus, the world's first programmable electronic digital computer, is within the town boundaries.
When the boundary of Milton Keynes was defined in 1967, some 40,000 people[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mkweb.co.uk/Milton_Keynes_General/DisplayArticle.asp?ID=285 |title=History in Milton Keynes | History Timeline, Local Town History & Visitor Map – Modern Milton Keynes |publisher=Mkweb.co.uk |date=22 October 2004 |accessdate=2012-11-23[/tpl] lived in three towns and seven villages in the "designated area" of [tpl]convert|21863|acre|sqkm[/tpl].

==Urban design==

Since the radical plan form and large scale of Milton Keynes attracted international attention, early phases of the town include work by celebrated architects, including Sir Richard MacCormac, Lord Norman Foster, Henning Larsen, Ralph Erskine, John Winter, and Martin Richardson.Jef Bishop Milton Keynes[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl] the Best of Both Worlds? Public and professional views of a new city. University of Bristol School for Advanced Urban Studies. Retrieved 13 February 2007.  The Corporation itself attracted talented young architects led by the young and charismatic Derek Walker. Though strongly committed to sleek "Miesian" minimalism inspired by the German/American architect Mies van der Rohe they also developed a strand of contextualism in advance of the wider adoption of commercial Post-Modernism as an architectural style in the 1980s. In the Miesian tradition were the Pineham Sewage Works, which Derek Walker regarded as his finest achievement, and the Shopping Building designed by Stuart Mosscrop and Christopher Woodward, which the Twentieth Century Society inter alia regards as the finest twentieth century retail building in Britain. The contextual tradition that ran alongside it is best exemplified by the Corporation's infill scheme at Cofferidge Close, Stony Stratford, designed by Wayland Tunley, which carefully inserts into a historic stretch of High Street a modern retail facility, offices and car park. The Development Corporation also led an ambitious Public art programme.
The urban design of the town has not been universally praised, however. Francis Tibbalds, president of the Royal Town Planning Institute, described the centre of Milton Keynes as "bland, rigid, sterile, and totally boring."http://designobserver.com/media/pdf/Milton_Keynes-_122.pdf

===Grid squares===

Milton Keynes Development Corporation planned the major road layout according to street hierarchy principles, using a grid pattern of approximately [tpl]convert|1|km|abbr=on[/tpl] intervals, rather than on the more conventional radial pattern found in older settlements. Major internal roads run between communities, rather than through them: these distributor roads are known locally as grid roads and the spaces between them[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl] the districts[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl] are known as grid squares.[tpl]cite book|first=Derek |last=Walker |title=The Architecture and Planning of Milton Keynes |publisher=Architectural Press |year=1982 |pages= 8 |location=London|isbn=0-85139-735-2[/tpl] cited in [tpl]cite book|first=Mark |last=Clapson |title=A Social History of Milton Keynes: Middle England/Edge City |pages= 40 |publisher=Frank Cass |location=London |year=2004|isbn=0-7146-8417-1[/tpl] Intervals of [tpl]convert|1|km|abbr=on[/tpl] were chosen so that people would always be within walking distance of a bus stop. Consequently each grid square is a semi-autonomous community, making a unique collective of 100 clearly identifiable neighbourhoods within the overall urban environment. The grid squares have a variety of development styles, ranging from conventional urban development and industrial parks to original rural and modern urban and pseudo-rural developments. Most grid squares have Local Centres, intended as local retail hubs and most with community facilities as well. Originally intended under the Master Plan to sit alongside the Grid Roads, the Local Centres were mostly in fact built embedded in the communities and some are becoming unviable as a result of this and pressure from the new hypermarkets.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2010[/tpl]

===Roads and cycleways===

Roundabout junctions were built at intersections because the grid roads were intended to carry large volumes of traffic: this type of junction is efficient at dealing with these volumes. The major roads are dual carriageway, the others are single carriageway. Along one side of each single carriageway grid road there is a (grassed) reservation to permit dualling or additional transport infrastructure at a later date. The edges of each grid square are landscaped and densely planted, some additionally have berms. The purpose of the berms is to reduce traffic noise for adjacent residents, but traffic noise can be significant at many locations even some distance from the grid roads.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2010[/tpl] Traffic movements are fast, with relatively little congestion since there are alternative routes to any particular destination. The national speed limit applies on dual carriageway sections of the grid roads ([tpl]convert|70|mph|abbr=on|0[/tpl]) and most single carriageway grid roads ([tpl]convert|60|mph|abbr=on|0[/tpl]), although some single carriageway speed limits have now been reduced to [tpl]convert|40|mph|abbr=on[/tpl]. Consequently the risk to unwary pedestrians and turning traffic is significant, although pedestrians rarely need to cross grid roads at grade, as underpasses exist in several places along each stretch of all of the grid roads. However, the new districts to be added by the expansion plans for Milton Keynes will depart from this model, with less separation and using 'at grade' crossings. Monitoring station data[tpl]cite web|author=Milton Keynes Council |url=http://www.mkweb.co.uk/environmental-health/DisplayArticle.asp?ID=17335 |title=Milton Keynes Council- Local Air Quality Management – Environme |publisher=Mkweb.co.uk |accessdate=2012-11-23[/tpl] shows that pollution is lower than in other settlements of a similar size. This can be partially attributed to the large number of trees, especially as trees line grid roads in most places.
There is a separate cycleway network (the "redways") that runs through the grid-squares and sometimes runs alongside the grid-road network. This was designed to segregate slow moving cycle and pedestrian traffic from fast moving motor traffic. In practice, it is mainly used for leisure cycling rather than commuting, mainly because the cycle routes include many underpasses beneath the grid-roads and because they take meandering scenic routes rather than straight lines. Despite what appears to be a desirable facility, rates of cycle commuting in Milton Keynes are well below the national average for urban areas. The detailed article includes a critical appraisal.

===Height===

The original design guidance declared that "no building be taller than the tallest tree". However, the Milton Keynes Partnership, in its expansion plans for Milton Keynes, believed that Central Milton Keynes (and elsewhere) needed "landmark buildings" and subsequently lifted the height restriction for the area. As a result, high rise buildings have been built in the central business district. Four of the pedestrian underpasses were closed in order to 'normalise' the streetscape of Central Milton Keynes and the character of the area was set to change under government pressure to increase densities of development. These changes are being opposed by pressure groups such as Urban Eden and the Milton Keynes Forum. More recent local plans have protected the existing boulevard framework and underpasses following the dissolution of Milton Keynes Partnership.
Recent large-scale buildings include The Pinnacle:MK on Midsummer Boulevard and the Vizion development on Avebury Boulevard. The Pinnacle was the largest office building to be constructed in Milton Keynes in 25 years. More recently the Network Rail National Centre has been built at the western limit of Silbury Boulevard; this building occupies a large land area but only rises to the equivalent of six stories; a return towards the design of the original Central Milton Keynes developments.

===Linear parks===

The flood plains of the Great Ouse and of its tributaries (the Ouzel and some brooks) have been protected as linear parks that run right through Milton Keynes. The Grand Union Canal is another green route (and demonstrates the level geography of the area[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl] there is just one minor lock in its entire [tpl]convert|10|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] route through from Fenny Stratford to the "Iron Trunk" Aqueduct over the Ouse at Wolverton). The Milton Keynes redway system of cycleways and footpaths uses these and other routes. The Park system was designed by landscape architect Peter Youngman, who also developed landscape precepts for the whole town: groups of grid squares were to be planted with different selections of trees and shrubs in order to give them distinct identities. However the landscaping of parks and of the grid roads was evolved under the leadership of Neil Higson, who from 1977 took over as Chief Landscape Architect and made the original grand but not entirely practical landscape plan more subtle.
A policy of creating "settings, strings, beads" for landscape features was introduced: 'settings' for historic villages and landscape features, 'strings' of landscape to make the linear parks hang together and 'beads' of public space where residents might linger. Higson also made the landscaping of the Grid Roads, one of the features of Milton Keynes, more subtle, with 'windows' cut into the roadside planting so that motorists travelling through had a sense of the major town they were in; early critics had said of Milton Keynes 'there is no there there', as the town could not be seen by the motorist just passing through. Now that the trees and shrubs have matured, the skill and lavish scale of the Grid Road planting makes a dramatic and welcome change from the monotony of many British towns and cities.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2010[/tpl]

==="City in the forest"===

The original Development Corporation design concept aimed for a "forest city" and its foresters planted millions of trees from its own nursery in Newlands in the following years. As of 2006, the urban area has 20 million trees. Following the winding up of the Development Corporation the lavish landscapes of the Grid Roads and of the major parks were transferred to The Parks Trust, a charity which is independent from the municipal authority and which was intended to resist pressures to build on the parks over time. The Parks Trust is endowed with a portfolio of commercial properties, the income of which pay for the upkeep of the green spaces, a maintenance model which has attracted international attention.[tpl]dead link|date=November 2012[/tpl]

===Further development plans===

In January 2004, Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott announced[tpl]cite news|author=Peter Hetherington, regional affairs editor |url=http://society.guardian.co.uk/urbandesign/story/0,11200,1116879,00.html?=rss |title=Milton Keynes to double in size over next 20 years | UK news | The Guardian |publisher=Society.guardian.co.uk |accessdate=2012-11-23 |location=London |date=6 January 2004[/tpl] the Government's plan to double the population of Milton Keynes by 2026. He appointed English Partnerships (EP) to do so, taking planning controls away from Milton Keynes Borough Council and making EP the statutory planning authority. Their proposal for the next phase of expansion moves away from grid squares to large scale, mixed use, higher density development. The more detailed article expands on the details of their proposals. As the first stage in that plan, the Government expanded[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2004/uksi_20040932_en.pdf |title=Statutory Instruments: 2004 No. 932 – Urban Development, England |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |accessdate=2012-11-23[/tpl] the boundaries of the designated area, adding large green-field expansion sites to the east and west that are to be developed by 2015.
In June 2004 Milton Keynes Partnership Committee (MKPC), was created by the Government and was a committee of the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA), the national housing and regeneration agency for England. MKPC was created to ensure a co-ordinated approach to planning and delivery of growth and development in the ‘new city’.
The Partnership brought together Milton Keynes Council, HCA, Local Strategic Partnership representatives from the health, community and business sectors and independent representation. The role of MKPC was to co-ordinate and implement the delivery of growth and ensure that homes, infrastructure, jobs and community facilities were provided as part of a joined up approach.
The day-to-day activities of MKPC were carried out by its staff of management, professional and technical experts, known collectively as Milton Keynes Partnership (MKP).
Milton Keynes Partnership was disbanded in 2011,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.miltonkeynespartnership.info |title=Milton Keynes Partnership |publisher=Miltonkeynespartnership.info |accessdate=2012-11-23[/tpl] holding its last meeting in March of that year.  Its functions were folded back into the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA), with Milton Keynes Council handling planning permission for established areas of the city.

==Culture==

The open air National Bowl is a 65,000 capacity venue for large scale events.
The 1,400 seat Milton Keynes Theatre opened in 1999. The theatre has an unusual feature: the ceiling can be lowered closing off the third tier (gallery) to create a more intimate space for smaller scale productions. There are further performance spaces in Bletchley, Wolverton, Leadenhall, Shenley Church End, Stantonbury and Walton Hall.
The municipal public art gallery[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mk-g.org |title=MK Gallery |publisher=Mk-g.org |date=13 November 2012 |accessdate=2012-11-23[/tpl] (Milton Keynes Gallery beside the main theatre) presents free exhibitions of international contemporary art.

It is closely associated with jazz artists Cleo Laine and the late John Dankworth. The venue also hosts an annual summer camp for young musicians.
Another music venue is The Pitz Club[tpl]cite web|author=UK |url=http://www.myspace.com/thepitzclub |title=The Pitz Club, Woughton Centre | Gratis muziek, tourneedata, foto's, video's |publisher=Myspace.com |date=21 September 2008 |accessdate=2012-11-23[/tpl] in the Woughton Centre, Leadenhall. It usually features a mixture of punk, alternative rock, and heavy metal. It actually ceased operations as a live music venue around 2010 when the local youth stopped going to the shows there, now it has The Crauford arms, and the Foundry, as well as The Buszy catering to non-mainstream tastes
There are two museums: the Bletchley Park complex, which as well as housing the museum of wartime cryptography, also hosts the National Museum of Computing including a working replica of the Colossus computer, and the Milton Keynes Museum, which includes the Stacey Hill Collection of rural life that existed before the foundation of the new town.
The town also has a literature scene, with groups like Speakeasy[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mkweb.co.uk/Art/Speakeasy |title=Milton Keynes – Speakeasy |publisher=MKWeb |date=22 October 2004 |accessdate=2012-11-23[/tpl] meeting regularly and hosting performance events, and the town's only poetry magazine, Monkey Kettle coming out twice a year.

The Buszy is the social enterprise arm of Make a Difference. All profits raised by the cultural activity at the venue are re-invested into Make a Difference. The venue hosts independent cinema, live performance, gigs, art shows/exhibitions, dance activity, a thrift shop, office and conference facilities and the city's only social enterprise hub.
Westbury Arts Centre is situated in the west of Milton Keynes, near Shenley Wood. And is based in a 16th Century grade 2 listed Farmhouse building. The Art Centre has been providing spaces for professional working artist to create work since 1994. The oldest part of the house was built in the sixteenth century and has been greatly extended over the years. It has several acres of garden and is home to several protected species of bats and newts. Including moat.
Milton Keynes also boasts several choirs[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl] the OU Choir, the Milton Keynes Chorale, the New English Singers, the Cornerstone Choir, Quorum,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.quorummk.org.uk |title=Quorum choir at Milton Keynes |publisher=Quorummk.org.uk |accessdate=2012-11-23[/tpl] and others, along with a variety of amateur drama groups, and amateur musical theatre groups.

==Education==

The Open University's headquarters are based in the Walton Hall district, though as this is a distance learning institution, the only students resident on campus are approximately 200 full-time postgraduates. Cranfield University, an all-postgraduate institution, is in nearby Cranfield, Bedfordshire. Milton Keynes College provides further education up to foundation degree level, however a Postgraduate Certificate in EducationMilton Keynes College, UCMK. Postgraduate Certificate in Education, in partnership with and accredited by Oxford Brookes University Retrieved 6 August 2009 course is available; run in partnership with and accredited by Oxford Brookes University.
In 1991 Leicester Polytechnic established a purpose built polytechnic campus in Kents Hill in Milton Keynes, opposite the Open University's Walton Hall site, which was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 1992. This was originally branded 'The Polytechnic: Milton Keynes'. Later in 1992 Leicester Polytechnic gained university status and was renamed De Montfort University and the site was rebranded De Montfort University Milton Keynes. However, DMU closed the MK site in 2003 and the Open University has expanded to take over the buildings.
Although the town does not yet have its own conventional local university, its founders hope that the University Campus Milton Keynes will be the seed for a future 'Milton Keynes University'. It is currently the UK's largest population centre without its own university proper.
Like many parts of the UK, the state secondary schools in Milton Keynes are Comprehensive schools, such as Stantonbury Campus and Denbigh School, although schools in the rest of Buckinghamshire still use the Tripartite System. Results are above the national average, though below that of the rest of Buckinghamshire[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl] but the demography of Milton Keynes is also far closer to the national average than is the latter. Access to selective schools is still possible in Milton Keynes as the grammar schools in Buckingham and Aylesbury accept some pupils from within the unitary authority area, with Buckinghamshire County Council operating bus services to ferry pupils to the schools.
Private schools in Milton Keynes include the 3 to 18 mixed sex Webber Independent School[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.webberindependentschool.com/home.php |title=The Webber Independent School |publisher=The Webber Independent School |accessdate=2012-11-23[/tpl] and the 2½ to 11 mixed sex Milton Keynes Preparatory School.[tpl]cite web|author=Autumn Term 2012 |url=http://www.mkprep.co.uk/ |title=Private school for children aged 2 months to 11 years old | Milton Keynes Preparatory School |publisher=Mkprep.co.uk |date=5 September 2012 |accessdate=2012-11-23[/tpl]
A problem with the education system in Milton Keynes is that there is currently no state Grammar school in the new town, forcing many students to commute by bus to either Aylesbury Grammar School, 23 miles to the south, or The Royal Latin School in Buckingham, 14 miles to the west.[tpl]cite news|author=Judith Judd and Fran Abrams |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/time-to-bring-back-grammar-schools-1338364.html |title=Time to bring back grammar schools? |publisher=The Independent |date=23 June 1996 |accessdate=22 April 2014 |location=London[/tpl]
The Safety Centre is a purpose-built interactive centre which provides safety education to visiting schools and youth groups via its full-size interactive demonstrations known as Hazard Alley. Another educational organisation is the Milton Keynes City Discovery Centre[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mkcdc.org.uk |title=MKCDC at Bradwell Abbey |publisher=Mkcdc.org.uk |accessdate=2012-11-23[/tpl] at Bradwell Abbey, which holds an extensive archive about Milton Keynes. MKCDC is therefore a research facility, as well as offering a broad education programme (with a focus on urban geography and local history) to schools, universities and professionals.

==Communications and media==

Milton Keynes has two commercial radio stations, Heart Four Countieshttp://www.heart.co.uk%20[tpl]dead link|date=November 2012[/tpl] covering Buckinghamshire, Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire and Northamptonshire, and MKFM which broadcasts on DAB Digital Radio full-time and on twice-yearly 28 day FM trial broadcasts. BBC Three Counties Radio is the local BBC Radio station, covering Buckinghamshire, Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire, but has different programming from the Bow Brickhill transmitter at breakfast. CRMK Online[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.crmk.co.uk |title=Radio for Milton Keynes |publisher=CRMK |accessdate=2012-11-23[/tpl] is a voluntary station broadcasting on the Internet.
For television, the area is in the overlap between the Oxford and the Sandy transmitters and so receives BBC Oxford and BBC East, and ITV Central and Anglia. Signal quality is weak in many areas due to distance and "terrain shadow".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.megalithia.com/elect/terrain.html |title=Terrain – shows radio profile between two UK sites to optimise you DTT, Freeview, DAB or analogue TV reception |publisher=Megalithia.com |date=4 August 2005 |accessdate=2012-11-23[/tpl] It was for this reason among others that Milton Keynes had a dedicated Cable TV network from the outset, although it is now ageing and in need of modernisation to cope with the imminent digital TV switchover; many residents have already opted for roof-top aerials and satellite dishes.

Milton Keynes is notable for being the only remaining town in the UK to broadcast TV in analogue signals, due to a long dispute between the local cable company Virgin Media and BT. The digital switchover for the Sandy transmitter took place in two phases over March/April 2011.
Milton Keynes has two free-to-residents local newspapers, the Milton Keynes Citizen, which is twice-weekly in some areas, and the MK News, a weekly.

As a key element of the New Town vision, Milton Keynes has a purpose built centre, with a very large "covered high street" shopping centre, theatre, art gallery, two multiplex cinemas, hotels, business district, ecumenical church, Borough Council offices and central railway station.

==Other amenities==

==Original towns and villages==

Milton Keynes consists of many pre-existing towns and villages, as well as new infill developments. The designated area outside the four main towns (Bletchley, Newport Pagnell, Stony Stratford, Wolverton) was largely rural farmland but included many picturesque North Buckinghamshire villages and hamlets: Bradwell village and its Abbey, Broughton, Caldecotte, Fenny Stratford, Great Linford, Loughton, Milton Keynes Village, New Bradwell, Shenley Brook End, Shenley Church End, Simpson, Stantonbury, Tattenhoe, Tongwell, Walton, Water Eaton, Wavendon, Willen, Great and Little Woolstone, Woughton on the Green. The historical settlements have been focal points for the modern development of the new town. Every grid square has historical antecedents, if only in the field names. The more obvious ones are listed below and most have more detailed articles.
Bletchley was first recorded in the 12th century as Blechelai. Its station was a major Victorian junction (the London and North Western Railway with the Oxford-Cambridge Varsity Line), leading to the substantial urban growth in the town in that period. It expanded to absorb the villages of Water Eaton and Fenny Stratford.
Bletchley Park was home to the Government Code and Cypher School during the Second World War. The famous Enigma code was cracked here, and the building housed what was arguably the world's first programmable computer, Colossus. The house is now a museum of war memorabilia, cryptography and computing.
The Benedictine Priory of Bradwell Abbey at Bradwell was of major economic importance in this area of north Buckinghamshire before the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The routes of the medieval trackways (many of which are now Redways or bridleways) converge on the site from some distance. Nowadays there is only a small medieval chapel and a manor house occupying the site.
New Bradwell, to the north of the medieval Bradwell (Abbey) and just across the canal and the railway to the east of Wolverton, was built specifically for railway workers. It has a working windmill, although technically this lies just a few yards outside of the parish boundary. The level bed of the old Wolverton to Newport Pagnell Line ends here and has been converted to a Redway, making it a favourite route for cycling.
Great Linford appears in the Domesday Book as Linforde, and features a church dedicated to Saint Andrew, dating from 1215. Today, the outer buildings of the 17th century manor house form an Arts Centre, and Linford Manor is a prestigious recording studio.
Milton Keynes Village is the original village to which the New Town owes its name. The original village is still evident, with a pleasant thatched pub, village hall, church and traditional housing. The area around the village has reverted to its original name of Middleton, as shown on old maps of the 1700s. The oldest[tpl]cite web|author=Milton Keynes Council |url=http://www.mkweb.co.uk/statistics/DisplayArticle.asp?ID=11415 |title=Milton Keynes Council – Statistics |publisher=Mkweb.co.uk |date=30 November 2004 |accessdate=2012-11-23[/tpl] surviving domestic building in the area, a 14th-century manor house, is here.
There has been a market in Stony Stratford since 1194 (by charter of King Richard I). The Rose and Crown Inn at Stratford is reputedly the last place the Princes in the Tower were seen alive.
The manor house of Walton village, Walton Hall, is the headquarters of the Open University and the tiny parish church (deconsecrated) is in its grounds.
The tiny Parish Church (1680) at Willen contains the only unaltered building by the architect and physicist Robert Hooke. Nearby, there is a Buddhist Temple and a Peace Pagoda. The district borders the River Ouzel: there is a large balancing lake here, to capture flash floods before they cause problems downstream on the River Great Ouse. The north basin is a wildlife sanctuary and a favourite of migrating aquatic birds. The south basin is for leisure use, favoured by wind surfers and dinghy sailors. The circuit of the lakes is a favoured "fun run". 
The original Wolverton was a medieval settlement just north and west of today's town. The Ridge and Furrow pattern of agriculture can still be seen in the nearby fields and the Saxon (rebuilt in 1819) Church of the Holy Trinity still stands next to the Norman Motte and Bailey site. Modern Wolverton was a 19th-century New Town built to house the workers at the Wolverton railway works (which built engines and carriages for the London and North Western Railway).

==Economy, demographics, geography and politics==

Data on the economy, demographics and politics of Milton Keynes are collected at the Borough level and are detailed at Economy of the Borough and Demographics of the Borough. However, since the urban area is predominant in the Borough, it is reasonable to assume that, other than for agriculture, the figures are broadly the same. For the borough as a whole, the service sector (including energy and construction) is the largest, followed by manufacturing (which includes hunting and forestry).
Milton Keynes is one of the more successful (per capita) economies in the South East, with a gross value added per capita index that was 47% higher than the national average (2005 data).Regional Gross Value Added pp 240–253 pub.
