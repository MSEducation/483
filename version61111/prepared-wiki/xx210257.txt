Andy Scott (born 1964) is a Scottish figurative sculptor, working in galvanised steel, fibreglass and cast bronze. 

==Biography==

Scott graduated from Glasgow School of Art in 1986 with a BA Hons in Fine Art Sculpture and in 1987 with a diploma in Postgraduate Studies.[tpl]cn|date=October 2013[/tpl]
His sculptural practice combines traditional dexterity and draughtsmanship with contemporary fabrication techniques, and many of his works are site specific, creating narratives and a powerful sense of place within urban developments.
Scott is based in Maryhill, Glasgow, and specialises in public art.
