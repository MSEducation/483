Ottawa ([tpl]IPAc-en|audio=Ottawa.ogg|ˈ|ɒ|t|ə|w|ə[/tpl] or [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|ɒ|t|ə|w|ɑː[/tpl]) is the capital of Canada, and the fourth largest city in the country. The city stands on the south bank of the Ottawa River in the eastern portion of Southern Ontario. Ottawa borders Gatineau, Quebec, and together they form the National Capital Region (NCR).[tpl]cite web|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/PDF/N-4.pdf |title=National Capital Act (R. S. C., 1985, c.

Founded in 1826 as Bytown and incorporated as "Ottawa" in 1855, the city has evolved into a political and technological centre of Canada. Its original boundaries were expanded through numerous minor annexations and ultimately replaced by a new city incorporation and major amalgamation in 2001 which significantly increased its land area. The name "Ottawa" is derived from the Algonquin word adawe, meaning  "to trade".[tpl]cite book|author=Alan Rayburn|title=Naming Canada: Stories About Canadian Place Names|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=aiUZMOypNB4C&pg=PA231|year=2001|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-0-8020-8293-0|page=231[/tpl] Initially an Irish and French Christian settlement,[tpl]sfn|Keshen|2001|pp=156[/tpl] Ottawa has become a multicultural city with a diverse population.[tpl]cite book|author=Caroline Andrew|title=Electing a Diverse Canada: The Representation of Immigrants, Minorities, and Women|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=EWCq1_Jg82gC&pg=PA118|year=2008|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5858-8|page=118[/tpl]

==History==

Étienne Brûlé, the first European to travel up the Ottawa River, passed by Ottawa in 1610 on his way to the Great Lakes.[tpl]sfn|Woods|1980|pp=5[/tpl] Three years later, Samuel de Champlain wrote about the waterfalls of the area and about his encounters with the Algonquins, who had previously been using the Ottawa River for centuries.[tpl]sfn|Woods|1980|pp=7[/tpl] The Algonquins called the river Kichi Sibi or Kichissippi meaning "Great River" or "Grand River".[tpl]cite book|author=John H.

Philemon Wright, a New Englander, created the first settlement in the area on 7 March 1800 on the north side of the river, across from Ottawa in Hull.[tpl]sfn|Wetering|1997|pp=123[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Lee|2006|pp=16[/tpl]  He, with five other families and twenty-five labourers, set about to create an agricultural community[tpl]sfn|Lee|2006|pp=20[/tpl] called Wrightsville. Wright pioneered the Ottawa Valley timber trade (soon to be the area's most significant economic activity) by transporting timber by river from the Ottawa Valley to Quebec City.[tpl]sfn|Wetering|1997|pp=11[/tpl]
Bytown, Ottawa's early name, was founded in 1826 because of preliminary work on the Rideau Canal.[tpl]sfn|Woods|1980|pp=60[/tpl] Its construction was overseen by Colonel John By, and the canal was intended to provide a secure route between Montreal and Kingston on Lake Ontario  by bypassing the stretch of the St. Lawrence River bordering New York State.[tpl]sfn|Legget|1986|pp=22-24[/tpl] Colonel By set up military barracks on the site of today's Parliament Hill.  He also laid out the streets of town with its "Upper Town" and "Lower Town" separated by the canal.  Bytown's population grew to 1,000 as the Rideau Canal was being completed in 1832.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bytownmuseum.com/EN/timeline.html|publisher=Bytown Museum|title=Timeline - Know your Ottawa!|year=2010 |accessdate=2 July 2011[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Mika|1982|pp=114[/tpl] Bytown saw some trouble in its early days, first with the Shiners' War from 1835 to 1845[tpl]cite web| url = http://whc-cpo.ca/historytour/upper_town_the_shiners'war_e.pdf | title = The Shiners' War| accessdate = 26 August 2010 | format = PDF | publisher = Workers' Heritage Centre[/tpl] and the Stony Monday Riot in 1849.[tpl]sfn|Martin|1997|pp=22[/tpl] Bytown was renamed Ottawa in 1855, when it was incorporated as a city.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0006008|title= Ottawa (ON)|accessdate=24 February 2009 |work= |publisher= The Canadian Encyclopedia|date= [/tpl]

==Geography==

Ottawa is situated on the south bank of the Ottawa River, and contains the mouths of the Rideau River and Rideau Canal.[tpl]cite book|author1=George Ripley|author2=Charles Anderson Dana|title=The American Cyclopaedia: a popular dictionary of general knowledge|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=KshPAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA733|year=1875|publisher=Appleton|page=733[/tpl] The older part of the city (including what remains of Bytown) is known as Lower Town, and occupies an area between the canal and the rivers. Across the canal to the west lies Centretown and Downtown Ottawa, which is the city's financial and commercial hub. As of 29 June 2007, the Rideau Canal, which stretches [tpl]convert|202|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] to Kingston, Fort Henry and four Martello towers in the Kingston area was recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[tpl]cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1221 |title=Rideau Canal |publisher= UNESCO World Heritage Centre |accessdate=27 May 2011[/tpl]

One federal crown corporation (the National Capital Commission, or NCC) has significant land holdings in both cities, including sites of historical and touristic importance. The NCC, through its responsibility for planning and development of these lands, is an important contributor to both cities. Around the main urban area is an extensive greenbelt, administered by the National Capital Commission for conservation and leisure, and comprising mostly forest, farmland and marshland.[tpl]cite book|author1=Jessica Brown|author2=Nora J.

===Climate===

Ottawa has a humid continental climate (Köppen Dfb) with four distinct seasons.[tpl]cite web|url = http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/maps/archives/3rdedition/environment/climate/030 |title = Climatic Regions Köppen |work = Atlas of Canada |publisher = Natural Resources Canada |date = June 2005|accessdate = 25 December 2012[/tpl] The average July maximum temperature is [tpl]convert|26.5|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl].  The average January minimum temperature is [tpl]convert|−14.8|°C|1[/tpl]. Winters can be very cold with minimum temperatures recorded as low as -36 °C.Statistics Canada climate normals
Summers are warm and humid in Ottawa. Daytime temperatures of [tpl]convert|30|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl] or higher are commonplace. Ottawa averages many days with humidex (combined temperature & humidity index) between [tpl]convert|30|°C|0[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|40|°C|0[/tpl] annually. Snow and ice are dominant during the winter season. Ottawa receives about [tpl]convert|224|cm|in|0[/tpl] of snowfall annually.  Days above freezing and nights below [tpl]convert|−20|°C|0[/tpl] both occur in the winter.
Spring and fall are variable, prone to extremes in temperature and unpredictable swings in conditions. Hot days above [tpl]convert|30|°C|0[/tpl] have occurred as early as March (as in 2012) or as late as October, although such events are unusual and brief. Annual precipitation averages around [tpl]convert|940|mm|0[/tpl].  There are about 2,130 hours of average sunshine annually (46% of possible).

==Neighbourhoods and outlying communities==

Ottawa is bounded on the east by the United Counties of Prescott and Russell; by Renfrew County and Lanark County in the west; on the south by the United Counties of Leeds and Grenville and the United Counties of Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry; and on the north by the Regional County Municipality of Les Collines-de-l'Outaouais and the City of Gatineau.[tpl]cite web|title=ManyEyes Map Viewer Ottawa |url=http://137.122.133.36/neighbourhoodstudy.ca/manyeyes/mapviewer.html#population |publisher=Ottawa Neighbourhood Study - University of Ottawa |year=2010 |accessdate=3 July 2011[/tpl] Modern Ottawa is made up of eleven historic townships, ten of which are from Carleton County and one from Russell.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ruralcouncil.ca/ORC/background.htm|title=Ottawa Rural Communities|year=2002|publisher=The Rural Council of Ottawa-Carleton|accessdate=2 June 2011[/tpl]
The city has a main urban area but there are many other urban, suburban and rural areas within the modern city's limits.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Google maps|title=Neighborhoods of Ottawa|url=http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&t=k&om=1&oe=UTF8&msa=0&msid=115838170672838983402.00043dad54fc8b7e8a93c|year=2011|accessdate=2 June 2011[/tpl] The main suburban area extends a considerable distance to the east, west and south of the centre, and includes the former cities of Gloucester, Nepean and Vanier, the former village of Rockcliffe Park and the community of Blackburn Hamlet, the community of  Orléans.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ottawa-information-guide.com/ottawa-neighbourhoods.html |title=Ottawa Neighbourhoods - The Central, East, West & South of Ottawa |publisher=Ottawa-information-guide.com |accessdate=3 July 2011[/tpl] The Kanata suburban area consists of Kanata  and the former village of Stittsville. Nepean is another major suburb which also includes Barrhaven. There are also the communities of Manotick and Riverside South  on the other side of the Rideau River, and Greely, southeast of Riverside South.
There are a number of rural communities (villages and hamlets) that lie beyond the greenbelt but are administratively part of the Ottawa municipality. Some of these communities are Burritts Rapids; Ashton; Fallowfield; Kars; Fitzroy Harbour; Munster; Carp; North Gower; Metcalfe; Constance Bay  and Osgoode  and Richmond. There are also a number of towns located within the federally defined National Capital Region but outside the city of Ottawa municipal boundaries, these include the urban communities of Almonte, Carleton Place, Embrun, Kemptville, Rockland, and Russell.

==Cityscape and infrastructure==

===Architecture===

Influenced by government structures, much of the city's architecture tends to be formalistic and functional. However, the city is also marked by Romantic and Picturesque styles of architecture such as the Parliament Building's gothic revival architecture.[tpl]cite book|author1=Shannon Ricketts|author2=Leslie Maitland|author3=Jacqueline Hucker|title=A guide to Canadian architectural styles|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-f2MYzP6IWAC&pg=PA73|year=2004|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-1-55111-546-7|page=73[/tpl] Ottawa's domestic architecture is dominated by single family homes. There are also smaller numbers of semi-detached, rowhouses, and apartment buildings. Most domestic buildings are clad in brick, with small numbers covered in wood or stone.
The skyline has been controlled by building height restrictions originally implemented to keep Parliament Hill and the Peace Tower at [tpl]convert|92.2|m[/tpl] visible from most parts of the City.[tpl]sfn|Keshen|2001|pp=455[/tpl] Today, several buildings are slightly taller than the Peace Tower, with the tallest located on Albert Street being the 29-storey Place de Ville (Tower C) at [tpl]convert|112|m[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|title=Place de Ville III|url=http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=1544|publisher=Skyscraper Source Media|year=2011|accessdate=1 June 2011[/tpl] Federal buildings in the National Capital Region are managed by Public Works Canada, while most of the federal land in the region is managed by the National Capital Commission; its control of much undeveloped land gives the NCC a great deal of influence over the city's development.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.canadascapital.gc.ca/bins/ncc_web_content_page.asp?cid=16302-22554-22561&lang=1 |title=Mandate and Mission  |publisher=The National Capital Commission |date=10 October 2008 |accessdate=8 June 2011[/tpl]

===Public transit===

The public transit system is operated by OC Transpo, a department of the city.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.octranspo1.com/about-octranspo |title=About OC Transpo |year=2009 |publisher=OC Transpo |accessdate=6 January 2011[/tpl] An integrated hub-and-spoke system of services is available consisting of: regular buses travelling on fixed routes in mixed traffic, typical of most urban transit systems; a bus rapid transit (BRT) system — a high-frequency bus service operating on the transitway — a network of mostly grade-separated dedicated bus lanes within their own right of way and having full stations with Park & Ride facilities further supported by on-road reserved bus lanes and priority traffic signal controls; a light rail transit (LRT) system known as the O-Train operating on one north-south route; and a door-to-door bus service for the disabled known as ParaTranspo.
Both OC Transpo and the Quebec-based Société de transport de l'Outaouais (STO) operate bus services between Ottawa and Gatineau.
Ottawa has approved a [tpl]convert|12.5|km|abbr=on[/tpl] light-rail transit line (LRT), called the Confederation Line, which includes a [tpl]convert|2.5|km|abbr=on[/tpl] tunnel through the downtown area that features three subway stations. Construction began in 2013, with operation scheduled to start in 2018.[tpl]cite news |last=Willing|first=Jon |title=Three LRT proposals now in city's hands |url= http://www.ottawasun.com/2012/09/10/ottawa-lrt-bidders-face-monday-deadline |newspaper= Ottawa Sun |accessdate=13 September 2012|date=10 September 2012[/tpl]

===Inter-city services===

Ottawa is served by a number of airlines that fly into the Ottawa Macdonald-Cartier International Airport, as well as two main regional airports Gatineau-Ottawa Executive Airport, and Ottawa/Carp Airport.[tpl]cite book|author1=Laura Purdom|author2=Donald Carroll|author3=Robert Holmes|title=Traveler's Companion Eastern Canada|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nD6yjUail9AC&pg=PA70|year= 2003|publisher=Globe Pequot|isbn=978-0-7627-2332-4|page=70[/tpl] The city is also served by inter-city passenger rail service at the Ottawa Train Station by Via Rail, and inter-city bus service operating out of the Ottawa Bus Central Station.

===Highways, streets and roads===

The city is served by two freeway corridors. The primary corridor is east-west and consists of provincial Highway 417 (designated as The Queensway) and Ottawa-Carleton Regional Road 174 (formerly Provincial Highway 17); a north-south corridor, Highway 416 (designated as Veterans' Memorial Highway), connects Ottawa to the rest of the 400-Series Highway network in Ontario. Highway 417 is also the Ottawa portion of the Trans-Canada Highway. The city also has several scenic parkways (promenades), such as Colonel By Drive, Queen Elizabeth Driveway, the Sir John A. Macdonald Parkway, Rockcliffe Parkway and the Aviation Parkway and has a freeway connection to Autoroute 5 and Autoroute 50, in Gatineau. In 2006, the National Capital Commission completed aesthetic enhancements to Confederation Boulevard, a ceremonial route of existing roads linking key attractions on both sides of the Ottawa River.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.canadascapital.gc.ca/bins/ncc_web_content_page.asp?cid=16300-20444-20505&lang=1 |title=Confederation Boulevard, National Capital Commission Web site |accessdate=11 February 2008[/tpl]

===Bicycle and pedestrian pathways===

There are numerous paved multi-use trails that wind their way through much of the city, including along the Ottawa River, Rideau River, and Rideau Canal. These pathways are used for transportation, tourism, and recreation.

===Navigable waterways===

Ottawa sits at the confluence of three major rivers: the Ottawa River, the Gatineau River and the Rideau River.[tpl]cite book|author=James R. Penn|title=Rivers of the world: a social, geographical, and environmental sourcebook|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=koacGt0fhUoC&pg=PA194|year=2001|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-042-0|pages=194–195[/tpl] The Ottawa and Gatineau rivers were historically important in the logging and lumber industries and the Rideau as part of the Rideau Canal system for military, commercial and, subsequently, recreational purposes. The Rideau Canal, connecting the Ottawa River and the Saint Lawrence River at Kingston, Ontario, by-passes unnavigable sections of the Rideau River as it winds its way through the city.  Rideau is a French word that means 'Curtain' in English, and the Rideau Falls resemble a curtain, thusly named by the early French canoeists.[tpl]cite book|author=Samuel Edward Dawson|title=The Saint Lawrence: Its Basin and Border-lands|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=r-LZjcqnPtEC&pg=PA267|year= 2007|publisher=Heritage Books|isbn=978-0-7884-2252-2|pages=267–[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Woods|1980|pp=7[/tpl] During part of the winter season the frozen waters of the canal form the world's largest skating rink thereby providing both a recreational venue and a [tpl]convert|7.8|km|mi[/tpl] transportation path to downtown for ice skaters (from Carleton University and Dow's Lake to the Rideau Centre and National Arts Centre).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.canadascapital.gc.ca/bins/ncc_web_content_page.asp?cid=16297-16299-10080&lang=1 |title=Rideau Canal Skateway - National Capital Commission:: |publisher=Canadian Heritage |date=7 March 2011 |accessdate=7 June 2011[/tpl]

==Demographics==

In 2011, the populations of the City of Ottawa and the Ottawa-Gatineau census metropolitan area (CMA) were 883,391 and 1,236,324 respectively,[tpl]cite web |url= http://www12.statcan.ca/census-recensement/2006/dp-pd/prof/92-591/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Tab=1&Geo1=CMA&Code1=505&Geo2=PR&Code2=35&Data=Count&SearchText=Ottawa%20-%20Gatineau&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&Custom= |title= Community Profiles from the 2006 Census: Ottawa-Gatineau Metropolitan Area|accessdate=24 February 2009 |work= |publisher= Statistics Canada|date= 19 January 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www12.statcan.ca/census-recensement/2006/dp-pd/prof/92-591/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=3506008&Geo2=PR&Code2=35&Data=Count&SearchText=ottawa&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&Custom= | title=Community Profiles from the 2006 Census – Ottawa, Ontario (City) | publisher= Statistics Canada |date=6 December 2010 |accessdate=22 September 2011[/tpl] while the Ottawa-Gatineau urban area had a population of 860,928.[tpl]cite web | title=Population and dwelling counts, for Canada, provinces and territories, and urban areas, 2006 and 2001 censuses - 100% data | url= http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/english/census06/data/popdwell/Table.cfm?T=802&PR=35&SR=1&S=3&O=D |publisher=Statistics Canada |date=5 November 2008 |accessdate=23 September 2011[/tpl] The city had a population density of 1,680.5 persons per km2 in 2006, while the CMA had a population density of 197.8 persons per km2.

The vast majority of the population growth is attributable to relocations to the city, and over 20 percent of the city's population is foreign-born.  Around 75% describe themselves as Christian, with Catholics accounting for 43.3%  of the population and members of Protestant churches was 27.6%.
Bilingualism became official policy for the conduct of municipal business in 2002,[tpl]cite web|url=http://ottawa.ca/city_hall/policies/bilingualism_policy/index_en.html|title=Bilingualism Policy|publisher=City of Ottawa|year=2011|accessdate=22 July 2011[/tpl] and 37% of the population can speak both languages, making it the largest city in Canada with both English and French as co-official languages.[tpl]cite book|author=Jenny Cheshire|title=English around the world: sociolinguistic perspectives|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ifl9ajM20fMC&pg=PA134|year=1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-39565-6|page=134[/tpl]  Mother tongue was listed as 62.8% English, 14.9% French and 21.6% list languages other than English and French as their mother tongue.

==Local government and politics==

Ottawa is a single-tier municipality, meaning it is in itself a census division and has no county or regional municipality government above it.[tpl]cite book|author1=Enid Slack|author2=Rupak Chattopadhyay|title=Finance and Governance of Capital Cities in Federal Systems|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2RBv66RWYHQC&pg=PA61|year=2009|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP|isbn=978-0-7735-3565-7|page=61[/tpl] As a single tier municipality, Ottawa has responsibility for all municipal services, including fire, emergency medical services, police, parks, roads, sidewalks, public transit, drinking water, storm water, sanitary sewage and solid waste. Ottawa is governed by the 24-member Ottawa City Council consisting of 23 councillors each representing one ward and the mayor, currently Jim Watson,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ottawa.ca/city_hall/mayor_council/mayor/index_en.html |title=City of Ottawa — Mayor |publisher=Ottawa.ca |accessdate=30 June 2010[/tpl] elected in a citywide vote.
Along with being the capital of Canada, Ottawa is politically diverse in local politics. Most of the city has traditionally supported the Liberal Party.[tpl]cite book|author=Tony L. Hill|title=Canadian politics, riding by riding: an in-depth analysis of Canada's 301 federal electoral districts|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=opvmE2AExc8C&pg=PA184|year= 2002|publisher=Prospect Park Press|isbn=978-0-9723436-0-2|pages=184–[/tpl] Perhaps the safest areas for the Liberals are the ones dominated by Francophones, especially in Vanier and central Gloucester. Central Ottawa is usually more left-leaning, and the New Democratic Party can win ridings there as government unions and activist groups are fairly strong. Some of Ottawa's suburbs are swing areas, notably central Nepean and, despite its Francophone population, Orléans. The southern and western parts of the old city of Ottawa are generally moderate and swing to the Conservative Party. The farther one goes outside the city centre like to Kanata and Barrhaven and rural areas, the voters tend to be increasingly conservative, both fiscally and socially. This is especially true in the former Townships of West Carleton, Goulbourn, Rideau and Osgoode, which are more in line with the conservative areas in the surrounding counties. However not all rural areas support the Conservative Party. Rural parts of the former township of Cumberland, with a large number of Francophones, traditionally support the Liberal Party, though their support has recently weakened.

==Education==

Ottawa is known as one of the most educated cities in Canada, with over half the population having graduated from College and/or university.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ottawa.ca/city_hall/glance/business_en.html|title=Quick Facts About Ottawa |publisher=City of Ottawa |accessdate=30 June 2010[/tpl] Ottawa has the highest per capita concentration of engineers, scientists, and residents with PhDs in Canada.[tpl]cite news |first=Roman |last=Zakaluzny |coauthors= |title=Where must Ottawa's tech sector go from here? |publisher= |url=http://www.ottawabusinessjournal.com/290233008271272.php |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070928061307/http://www.ottawabusinessjournal.com/290233008271272.php |archivedate=28 September 2007 |work=Ottawa Business Journal |pages= |accessdate=16 April 2007 |language=[/tpl]
