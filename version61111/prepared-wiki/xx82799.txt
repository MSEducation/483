[[Nicotine polacrilex]]

CATEGORIES: Smoking cessation

Nicotine Polacrilex is nicotine bound to an ion-exchange resin (polymethacrilic acid, such as Amberlite IRP64 or Purolite C115HMR...). It is added to gums and hard lozenges used for nicotine replacement therapy in smoking cessation. The use of the polymer as a delivery system maximizes the amount of nicotine released and absorbed by the oral mucosa. 80 to 90 percent of the nicotine released from the gum is absorbed by the mouth. Side effects of the gum include bad taste, nausea, dyspepsia, and stomatitis.
