[[Foias constant]]

CATEGORIES: Mathematical analysis, Mathematical constants

In mathematical analysis, the Foias constant, is a number named after Ciprian Foias.
If x1 > 0 and
then the Foias constant is the unique real number α such that if x1 = α then the sequence diverges to ∞.Ewing, J. and Foias, C. "An Interesting Serendipitous Real Number." In Finite versus Infinite: Contributions to an Eternal Dilemma (Ed. C. Caluse and G. Păun). London: Springer-Verlag, pp. 119–126, 2000.  Numerically, it is
No closed form is known.
When x1 = α then we have the limit:
where "log" denotes the usual natural logarithm.
A fortuitous observation between the prime number theorem and this constant goes as follows,
where [tpl]pi[/tpl] is the prime-counting function.Ewing, J. and Foias, C. "An Interesting Serendipitous Real Number." In Finite versus Infinite: Contributions to an Eternal Dilemma (Ed. C. Caluse and G. Păun). London: Springer-Verlag, pp. 119–126, 2000.
