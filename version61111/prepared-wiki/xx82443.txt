==Particular examples and uses==

Blood money is, colloquially, the reward for bringing a criminal to justice.  A common meaning in other contexts is the money-penalty paid by a murderer to the kinsfolk of the victim. These fines completely protect the offender (or the kinsfolk thereof) from the vengeance of the injured family. The system was common among Germanic peoples before the introduction of Christianity (weregild), and a scale of payments, graduated according to the heinousness of the crime, was fixed by laws, which further settled who could exact the blood-money, and who were entitled to share it. Homicide was not the only crime thus expiable: blood-money could be exacted for all crimes of violence. Some acts, such as killing someone in a church or while asleep, or within the precincts of the royal palace, were "bot-less"; and the death penalty was inflicted. Such a criminal was outlawed, and could be killed on sight.[tpl]cite book | last = | authorlink = | title = 1911 Edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica|edition= 1911|pages= 29-volumes| publisher = Encyclopaedia Britannica| asin= B0006P7UY8[/tpl]
