The Albert Hall, Nottingham, is a City Centre Conference and Concert venue, situated in Nottingham, England.

==History==

The original Albert Hall was started in 1873 as a Nottingham Temperance Hall. Watson Fothergill, a local architect won the commission. On completion the building cost around £15,000 (£[tpl]formatnum:[tpl]Inflation|UK|15000|1873|[tpl]CURRENTYEAR[/tpl]|r=-1[/tpl][/tpl] as of [tpl]CURRENTYEAR[/tpl]),[tpl]Inflation-fn|UK[/tpl]. It was the largest concert hall in Nottingham and a major venue for political rallies but it had frequent financial crises. It was put on the market in 1901 and was bought by a syndicate of local businessmen for £8,450 (£[tpl]formatnum:[tpl]Inflation|UK|8450|1901|[tpl]CURRENTYEAR[/tpl]|r=-1[/tpl][/tpl] as of [tpl]CURRENTYEAR[/tpl]),[tpl]Inflation-fn|UK[/tpl], opening as a Wesleyan Methodist mission in September 1902.
Although the outstanding debt was a millstone, the work of the mission went from strength to strength until 22 April 1906, when fire swept through the building. The Methodists then realised that the Hall was under-insured. This time, a prominent local Methodist, Albert Edward Lambert, who had been responsible for Nottingham Midland Station was asked to produce a plan. His new Albert Hall Methodist Mission was built in the style of an Edwardian Theatre or Music Hall and, in the practice of temperance halls, concerts and other events were staged in the building.
The new Hall was dedicated in March 1909 and officially opened on 15 September 1910 by Lady Florence Boot, wife of Jesse Boot of the Boots pharmacy chain.
The Hall continued to be used as a Methodist mission and remained the city's largest concert venue until 1982.Completion of The Royal Concert Hall The congregation then merged with that at Parliament Street Methodist Church.
Nottingham City Council purchased the Albert Hall in 1987 and a major refurbishment was undertaken. A new floor was inserted at the level of the front of the circle to reduce the volume of the main hall, and thus created a new separate ground floor hall. The building was linked with the adjacent Nottingham Playhouse and the bar block of the theatre was updated at the same time to allow the creation of a multipurpose centre. The work was completed in 1988 and Her Royal Highness the Princess of Wales unveiled a plaque on 23 February 1989 to commemorate the refurbishment.
The Nottingham Playhouse managed the Albert Hall until July 1990 when the Nottingham City Council leased the building to the Albert Hall Nottingham Ltd for use as a commercial conference and entertainment Venue.
