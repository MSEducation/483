It is 16 km south of Morwell in the Strzelecki Ranges and preserves a remnant of previously widespread wet sclerophyll forests and some rainforest remnants restricted to deep creek gullies. 320 plant species have been recorded for this park, including five rare or threatened species and 44 orchid species. 129 native fauna species have been recorded, including 19 mammals, 96 birds, 11 reptiles and three amphibians.
Weeds and pest animals represent a threat to the park, particularly because of its small size.
