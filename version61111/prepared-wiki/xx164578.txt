As a young man he was in Iowa where he married Laura Clapp. In 1886 Frank Mason Robinson settled in Atlanta, where he was secretary and bookkeeper for the Pemberton Chemical Company.
Dr. John Pemberton was experimenting with a medicial formula which included coca leaves and kola nuts as sources of its ingredients. Frank Mason Robinson gave the formula the name Coca-Cola, writing the name in Spencerian script which was popular with bookkeepers of the era. His script of Coca-Cola remains one of the most recognized trademarks in the world. The formula was introduced in May 1886 at the Jacobs Pharmacy in Atlanta.

He retired in 1914, but remained one of the company's directors.
Frank Mason Robinson had a home in Druid Hills, an early suburb of Atlanta. He also had a [tpl]convert|40|acre|m2|sing=on[/tpl] country home on the Cobb County banks of the Chattahoochee River.
