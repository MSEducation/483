The BG&CM Railroad or Bountiful Grain and Craig Mountain Railroad [tpl]reporting mark|BGCM[/tpl] is a Class III shortline railroad located in north central Idaho.

==Summary==

The BG&CM operated a line between Spalding and Cottonwood, along the former Second Subdivision of the Camas Prairie Railroad. Spalding is located about [tpl]convert|10|mi|km[/tpl] east of Lewiston, which is at Idaho's western border with Washington. BGCM connects with Great Northwest Railroad at Spalding. BGCM also operates the portion of the former Camas Prairie Railroad which runs from Spalding to Orofino, then to Kooskia along the river grade of the Clearwater River.
BGCM's route consists of the former Camas Prairie Railroad's Second Subdivision line, which was [tpl]convert|66.5|mi|0[/tpl] in length from Spalding to Grangeville.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=TaxeAAAAIBAJ&sjid=wC4MAAAAIBAJ&pg=5595,459947|newspaper=Lewiston Morning Tribune|title=Legal notices: Camas Prairie RailNet, Inc.|date=May 2, 2000|page=9B[/tpl] As of 2005, only the [tpl]convert|52|mi|km[/tpl] between Spalding and Cottonwood were operated; the last [tpl]convert|14.5|mi|km[/tpl] of track between Cottonwood and Grangeville were removed in late 2002 and 2003.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=t8VeAAAAIBAJ&sjid=AjIMAAAAIBAJ&pg=4903,1943178|newspaper=Lewiston Morning Tribune|last=Walker|first=Jodi|title=Cottonwood has a railroad, again|date=January 9, 2003|page=1A[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=x7BeAAAAIBAJ&sjid=qC8MAAAAIBAJ&pg=4593,2530420 |newspaper=Lewiston Morning Tribune|last=Williams|first=Elaine|title=Spalding line survives, barely|date=March 23, 2003|page=1E[/tpl] When BG&CM stepped in to operate the second subdivision line in December 2002, it was originally planning to operate the [tpl]convert|34|mi[/tpl] from Spalding to Craigmont,[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=g79eAAAAIBAJ&sjid=UTEMAAAAIBAJ&pg=4461,633560|newspaper=Lewiston Morning Tribune|last=Walker|first=Jodi|title=Camas Prairie line will run again|date=December 18, 2002|page=1A[/tpl] but a few weeks later decided to continue [tpl]convert|17|mi[/tpl] south, across Lawyer's Canyon to Cottonwood, stopping the salvage crews from going further north. 
In 2005, Watco Companies, owner of the BGCM's Spalding connection Great Northwest Railroad (GRNW), leased to BGCM the entire [tpl]convert|75|mi|-1|sing=on[/tpl] GRNW route east of Lewiston of mainline track, including the railroad from Orofino to Konkolville. 
The BGCM route had been acquired from Camas Prairie RailNet (CSPR) in December 2002, a subsidiary of North American RailNet, which had acquired the entire Camas Prairie line in April 1998 from the line's previous (and original) co-owners, Union Pacific Railroad and Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway. CSPR received permission from the Surface Transportation Board to abandon the Grangeville Branch in September 2000 and made its last run on that line in late November.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=oMYjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=MdEFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1412,3889542|newspaper=Moscow-Pullman Daily News|agency=Associated Press|title=Camas Prairie dream out of steam|date=November 30, 2000|page=2A[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=D6xeAAAAIBAJ&sjid=uS4MAAAAIBAJ&pg=6006,4116844|newspaper=Lewiston Morning Tribune|last=Walker|first=Jodi|title=Some cracks in the foundation: Last train to Grangeville|date=December 31, 2000|page=3A[/tpl] Watco had acquired the remainder of the Camas Prairie RailNet in March 2004.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bs9eAAAAIBAJ&sjid=BjMMAAAAIBAJ&pg=2559,178669|newspaper=Lewiston Morning Tribune|last=Williams|first=Elaine|title=Railroad changing hands|date=February 17, 2004|page=1A[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=98NeAAAAIBAJ&sjid=yDEMAAAAIBAJ&pg=2602,805813|newspaper=Lewiston Morning Tribune|title=Railroad changes hands, trains keep on running|last=Williames|first=Elaine|date=March 4, 2004|page=6A[/tpl]
As of April, 2013, the second sub is used for storage of empty flatcars between Lapwai and Culdesac. The grade crossing of US 95 south of Craigmont has been removed and the crossings in that town are graveled over. Also, one of the wooden trestles—Bridge 21.3http://www.loc.gov/pictures/resource/hhh.id0437.photos.224536p/—near Winchester was lost in a forest fire on September 7, 2011.http://www.kboi2.com/news/local/129416403.html All that remains of the trestle is a single rail suspended precariously across the chasm, as well as ashes and bits of metal beneath.https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151609980454055&l=8b6d283b66 A fire also destroyed the original elevators at Craigmont, beginning on May 12, 2013. The fire smoldered for nearly three weeks.http://lmtribune.com/northwest/article_bbd1e439-691f-5025-a74b-8e12d834a362.html

==History==

The Camas Prairie Railroad was formed in 1909, and was jointly owned and operated by the former Northern Pacific Railway (later Burlington Northern Santa Fe), and the former Oregon-Washington Railroad and Navigation Company (later Union Pacific). The two railroads were competitors throughout the Pacific Northwest, battling to capture railroad traffic in timber, minerals, and agricultural products.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aZ5fAAAAIBAJ&sjid=zDEMAAAAIBAJ&pg=4221,4430352|newspaper=Lewiston Morning Tribune|title=Camas Prairie Railroad was born to squabbling parents|date=September 30, 1990|page=12-centennial[/tpl] Camas Prairie Railroad was sold by co-owners UP and BNSF to North American RailNet of Bedford, Texas in April 1998 and it became Camas Prairie RailNet, Inc. After six years it was sold to Watco and became Great Northwest Railroad in March 2004. There were about [tpl]convert|177|mi|km[/tpl] of track in the transaction: [tpl]convert|72|mi|km[/tpl] from Riparia, Washington, east to Lewiston; [tpl]convert|74|mi[/tpl] from Lewiston east to Kooskia; and [tpl]convert|31|mi[/tpl] from Orofino northeast to near Jaype. The Orofino to Jaype segment was out of service.
BGCM is owned by Railroad Materials Salvage of Richmond, Missouri.
In 2009, BGCM's owner attempts to purchase a portion of the Arizona and California Railroad, running [tpl]convert|49.4|mi|km[/tpl] between Rice, California and Ripley, California through Blythe, California from RailAmerica then-recently granted for abandonment, but failed to get an offer of financial assistance.http://docs.stb.dot.gov/?sGet&Dl5ZTH1WXw1zAAsBXBdTV0x6Sw1xfAMCXAEHCW4DFncBenELWAEFAW0DGgYBdBVRAlxHcUsOS1FELBVCO1RFS0ZcQQ0AfQcHS1deVEpdTl1VcAEAWAICDgoBamB0C20xNzgvMy8wME0zMgw%3D
