Holding Out for a Hero is an ITV entertainment programme in which contestants won't win money for themselves, but for somebody else, who they'll considered to be their hero. The show is presented by Gethin Jones. Every week, three contestants compete to win a huge sum of money for a charity close to their heart.

Their job in the show is answering five multiple-choice questions correctly so that they'll have an opportunity to help the "hero". Each correct answer will add the cash to their own Jackpot. The cash value is chosen by the contestants from the cash cards which are placed around the table. However, if the contestant gets a wrong answer to a single question, the corresponding amount which chosen by him/her is subtracted from his/her own Jackpot.
The person who has the biggest number of Jackpot wins the game. The others also win a small prize of money as a consolation.

===The lifelines===

Each contestant has three lifelines:
Each of the lifelines can only be used once during the game, and a contestant has no way to use more than one of the lifelines on one single question.
