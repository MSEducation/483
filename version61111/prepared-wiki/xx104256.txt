[[SX-Windows]]

CATEGORIES: Windowing systems

SX-Windows was a non-preemptive multitasking operating system, using the event driven paradigm. It runs on top of the Human 68k DOS operating system which resembled MS-DOSâ€”it is very similar to the relationship between Windows 3.1 and MS-DOS.
SX-Window was a standard window system for Sharp Corporation's X68000 series in Japan. It was introduced for X68000 in 1989, and came preinstalled on the X68000 EXPERT model. It was developed by Hudson. The look and feel of the GUI is like NeXT, and its API is similar Macintosh Programmer's Toolkit. It has a garbage collection system without MMU unit of MPU, but it's difficult to program because all pointers derived from handles become invalid once any API is called. X68000 was very powerful for game software, but this GUI was very slow as no hardware acceleration card was supported for this window system. Only few applications and games were developed for this system. Final version number is 3.1.
