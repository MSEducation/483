[[Y-Δ transform]]

CATEGORIES: Electrical circuits, Electric power, Graph operations, Circuit theorems

The Y-Δ transform, also written wye-delta and also known by many other names, is a mathematical technique to simplify the analysis of an electrical network. The name derives from the shapes of the circuit diagrams, which look respectively like the letter Y and the Greek capital letter Δ. This circuit transformation theory was published by Arthur Edwin Kennelly in 1899.A.E. Kennelly, Equivalence of triangles and stars in conducting networks, Electrical World and Engineer, vol. 34, pp. 413–414, 1899.   It is widely used in analysis of three-phase electric power circuits. 
The Y-Δ transform can be considered a special case of the star-mesh transform for three resistors.

==Names==

The Y-Δ transform is known by a variety of other names, mostly based upon the two shapes involved, listed in either order. The Y, spelled out as wye, can also be called T or star; the Δ, spelled out as delta, can also be called triangle, Π (spelled out as pi), or mesh. Thus, common names for the transformation include wye-delta or delta-wye, star-delta, star-mesh, or T-Π. [tpl]clear[/tpl]

==Basic Y-Δ transformation==

The transformation is used to establish equivalence for networks with three terminals. Where three elements terminate at a common node and none are sources, the node is eliminated by transforming the impedances. For equivalence, the impedance between any pair of terminals must be the same for both networks. The equations given here are valid for complex as well as real impedances.

===Circuit Analysis: Techniques for Solving Δ-load to Y-load in 3 phase circuits===

A given three phase circuit that has a combination of Δ-loads and Y-loads should be converted to the Y configuration. By converting from Δ to Y, each circuit element/phase can be analyzed separately.  Converting from Δ to Y is an technique aimed to simplify circuit analysis. (Note: harmonic behavior from the original circuit remained unchanged). The conversion from the Δ notation to Y notation is as follows.

==A proof of the existence and uniqueness of the transformation==

In fact, the superposition theorem not only establishes the relation between the values of the resistances, but also guarantees the uniqueness of such solution.

==Simplification of networks==

Resistive networks between two terminals can theoretically be simplified to a single equivalent resistor (more generally, the same is true of impedance). Series and parallel transforms are basic tools for doing so, but for complex networks such as the bridge illustrated here, they do not suffice. 
The Y-Δ transform can be used to eliminate one node at a time and produce a network that can be further simplified, as shown. 
The reverse transformation, Δ-Y, which adds a node, is often handy to pave the way for further simplification as well.

==Graph theory==

In graph theory, the Y-Δ transform means replacing a Y subgraph of a graph with the equivalent Δ subgraph. The transform preserves the number of edges in a graph, but not the number of vertices or the number of cycles. Two graphs are said to be Y-Δ equivalent if one can be obtained from the other by a series of Y-Δ transforms in either direction. For example, the Petersen family is a Y-Δ equivalence class.

The impedance between N1 and N2 with N3 disconnected in Δ:
Thus,
The corresponding impedance between N1 and N2 in Y is simple:
hence:
For example, adding (1) and (3), then subtracting (2) yields
thus,
where 
For completeness:

Let 
We can write the Δ to Y equations as
Multiplying the pairs of equations yields
and the sum of these equations is
Note the similarity between (8) and {(1),(2),(3)}
Divide (8) by (1)
