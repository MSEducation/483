CATEGORIES: Sordariomycetes, Fungi families

The Lulworthiaceae are a family of marine fungi in the Ascomycota, class Sordariomycetes.[tpl]cite journal |last=Lumbsch TH, Huhndorf SM. |date=December 2007 |title=Outline of Ascomycota – 2007 |journal=Myconet |volume=13 |issue= |pages=1–58  |url=http://www.fieldmuseum.org/myconet/outline.asp |accessdate= |publisher=The Field Museum, Department of Botany, Chicago, USA [/tpl] Species in the family have a widespread distribution in both temperate and tropical oceans, and are typically found growing on submerged wood or on seaweed.[tpl]cite book |author=Cannon PF, Kirk PM. |title=Fungal Families of the World |publisher=CABI|location=Wallingford |year=2007 |pages=194–95 |isbn=0-85199-827-5[/tpl] In 2000, Molecular analysis of several species of Lulworthia and Lindra led to the reassignment of their parent genera to the new order Lulworthiales in addition to the new family Lulworthiaceae.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.2307/3761504 |author=Kohlmeyer J, Spatafora JW, Volkmann-Kohlmeyer B. |year=2000 |title=Lulworthiales, a new order of marine Ascomycota |jstor=3761504 |journal=Mycologia |volume=92 |issue=3 |pages=453–58[/tpl]

==History and taxonomy==

The type genus Lulworthia was originally described in 1916 by George Kenneth Sutherland to contain the species Lulworthia fucicola, a fungus found on the seaweed commonly known as the bladder wrack at Lulworth on the coast of Dorset, UK.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0007-1536(14)80029-6 |author=Sutherland GK. |year=1916 |title=Additional notes on marine pyrenomycetes |journal=Transactions of the British Mycological Society |volume=5 |issue= |pages=257–63[/tpl] The fungus has since been collected several times from submerged wood, but never again from the original algal host; it was subsequently reported that specimens found on wood were morphologically different from those originally described growing on algae.[tpl]cite journal |author=Kholmeyer J, Volkmann-Kohlmeyer B. |year=2000 |title=Illustrated key to the filamentous higher marine fungi |journal=Botanic Marina |volume=34 |issue= |pages=1–61[/tpl] Since the original specimens had deteriorated beyond use, a holotype was designated, using  submerged-wood specimens found in Chile in 1984.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.3852/mycologia.97.2.549 |author=Campbell J. |year=2005 |title=Neotypification of Lulworthia fucicola |journal=Mycologia |volume=97 |issue=2 |pages=549–51 |pmid=16396361[/tpl]
The genus Rostrupiella was created in 2007 to contain the species Rostrupiella danica, a Lulworthia-like species collected on driftwood found along the Danish coast and from the northwestern coast of the USA.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1515/BOT.2007.034 |author=Koch J, Pang KL, Jones EBG. |year=2007 |title=Rostrupiella danica gen. et sp nov., a Lulworthia-like marine lignicolous species from Denmark and the USA |journal=Botanic Marina |volume=50 |issue=5–6 |pages=294–301 [/tpl] 

==Description==

The ascomata, roughly spherical to cylindrical in shape, may be either embedded in or on the material to which the fruit body is attached. Atop the ascomata is a small rounded process with an opening (an ostiole) through which ascospores may be released. The brown- to black-colored ascomata can be either leathery (coriaceous) or dark-colored and readily broken (carbonaceous). The internal structure of the ascomata, the centrum, is at first filled with a transparent pseudoparenchyma (a type of tissue made of hyphae that are twisted and matted together) dissolves upon reaching maturity. The Lulworthiaceae have ascospores that are both filamentous, and transparent.
