CATEGORIES: 1634 births, 1703 deaths, Counts of France, House of Aubigné

Charles d'Aubigné, Count of Aubigné (1634–1703) was the brother of the second wife of King Louis XIV of France, the Marquise of Maintenon.  The king showered gifts and titles upon his new wife's brother (full sibling, she had two, the oldest brother was a half sibling Theodore Agrippa II) upon their marriage; in a letter patent Louis conferred upon him the titles of Comte d'Aubigné et Pair de France, Marquis de Maintenon, Duc de Saint-Cloud, Baron de Surimeau, Maréchal de France et Chevalier du Saint-Esprit (reçu le 31 décembre 1688), along with the style of Son Altesse Serenissime (His Most Serene Highness), a dignity normally reserved only for the Princes of the Blood.  While he did not receive his sister's title until her death the combination of Serenity, being a member of the most prestigious chivalric order in France at that time, the Order of the Holy Spirit, as well as having his father's title restored to him as well as made a peer, which was not automatic in France for nobles as in England, put him in a most wonderful position at court.
