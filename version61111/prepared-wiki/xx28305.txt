BioWare is a Canadian video game developer founded in February 1995 by newly graduated medical doctors Ray Muzyka, Greg Zeschuk, and Augustine Yip. BioWare is currently owned by American company Electronic Arts. The company specializes in role-playing video games, and became famous for launching highly praised and successful licensed franchises, Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter Nights, and Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. They proceeded to make several other successful games based on original IP: Jade Empire, the Mass Effect series, and the Dragon Age series. In 2011, BioWare launched their first MMORPG, Star Wars: The Old Republic.

==History==

BioWare was established in February 1995 by Ray Muzyka, Greg Zeschuk, Trent Oster, Brent Oster, Marcel Zeschuk, and Augustine Yip. The three doctors (Muzyka, Zeschuk, Yip) had recently graduated together from medical school at the University of Alberta;[tpl]cite web|title=Alberta Inventors and Inventions – Dr. Ray Muzyka & Dr. Greg Zeschuk|url=http://www.abheritage.ca/abinvents/inventors/muzykaandzeschuk_biography.htm|publisher=Heritage Community Foundation|year=2003|accessdate=June 22, 2009[/tpl] they had done some programming for use in med school and played video games for recreation, eventually deciding to develop their own.[tpl]cite web|title=IGN Presents the History of BioWare|url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/106/1062745p1.html|accessdate=December 29, 2011|date=January 21, 2010[/tpl] Their success in the medical field provided them with the funding they needed to launch a video game company. To make their first game, they pooled their resources which resulted in capital of $100,000.
Their first game, Shattered Steel, began its life as a proof-of-concept demo, similar to the MechWarrior games. This demo was submitted to ten publishers, seven of whom returned to the company with an offer. A publishing deal for Shattered Steel was eventually signed with Interplay Entertainment. Brent Oster and Trent Oster left BioWare at that time to form Pyrotek Studios, which continued developing Shattered Steel but broke up a year later, with Oster returning to BioWare to finish the game. BioWare's first game was released the following year. Shattered Steel's release was described by IGN as a "modest success" with "decent sales". Two noteworthy points were the deformable terrain (player weapon damage caused craters in the environment) and zone damage (well-placed gunfire could shoot mounted weapons off enemies). A sequel to Shattered Steel was planned for 1998 but never realized.
BioWare's founders and staff were keenly interested in both computerized and pen-and-paper variants of role-playing games.Their next development project, therefore, was determined to be an RPG. When Interplay financed "exploratory development", BioWare presented the publishers with a demo called Battleground: Infinity. Interplay suggested that the demonstrated gameplay engine would be well-suited to the Dungeons & Dragons license which it had acquired from SSI. Accordingly, Infinity was reworked in line with the Dungeons & Dragons ruleset.
This resulted in Baldur's Gate, which witnessed a development cycle of three years. During this time, the three doctors continued to practice medicine. However, in the final years of the project, the demands of development prompted Muzyka and Zeschuck to leave medicine and move into full-time development. Augustine Yip decided to continue with his medical practice. Baldur's Gate sold more than two million copies after its release, nearly matching the sales of Diablo. Following the success of Baldur's Gate, the Infinity Engine was used for the games Planescape: Torment and the Icewind Dale series. The success of Baldur's Gate was followed by an expansion pack for the game: Tales of the Sword Coast.[tpl]cite web|title=The History of BioWare|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/the-history-of-bioware-article|accessdate=December 29, 2011|last=Whitehead|first=Dan|date=November 16, 2007[/tpl]
At this point, BioWare decided to return to the action genre. The company's initial thought was to develop a sequel to Shattered Steel, but eventually a sequel to MDK from Shiny Entertainment was chosen for development. MDK 2 was released on PC, Dreamcast, and eventually PlayStation 2, offering BioWare their first taste of developing games for consoles. MDK 2 drew the same level of praise as its predecessor but, despite the success, BioWare returned to the Baldur's Gate series for their next project.
Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn was released in 2000, two years after the release of Baldur's Gate. Baldur's Gate II sold two million copies, matching the sales of the first game in the series. However, the success of both Baldur's Gate II and MDK 2 were not enough to stabilize Interplay financially. The company experienced multiple failures, which eventually led to bankruptcy. Following Interplay's bankruptcy, BioWare began to work with Infogrames, which was later renamed to Atari. Neverwinter Nights was originally to be published by Interplay, but the company lost the license of the game to Atari and part of their Dungeons & Dragons license, to BioWare. After selling their D&D license to Atari, BioWare developed Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and Jade Empire. It had publishing relationships with Interplay Entertainment, Infogrames/Atari, LucasArts, and Microsoft.
The next few years saw a number of changes in BioWare's corporate status. In November 2005, it was announced that BioWare and Pandemic Studios (itself founded by former Activision employees) would be joining forces, with private equity fund Elevation Partners investing in the partnership. On October 11, 2007, however, it was announced that this new partnership (organized as VG Holding Corp) had been bought by Electronic Arts.[tpl]cite web|last=Klepek|first=Patrick|title=EA Acquires BioWare, Pandemic|url=http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3163607|publisher=1UP.com|date=October 11, 2007|accessdate=June 14, 2009[/tpl] BioWare therefore became a unit of EA, but retained its own branding.
In 2007, BioWare released the science fiction RPG Mass Effect. The following year, BioWare released Sonic Chronicles: The Dark Brotherhood on the Nintendo DS, its first title for a handheld game console.  Near the end of 2009, BioWare released the fantasy RPG Dragon Age: Origins, and in January 2010, Mass Effect 2. Later, EA announced that BioWare would be merged with Mythic Entertainment, another division of EA, so that they could have all of their RPG development in one business unit.
BioWare completed three major games between 2011 and 2012. The MMORPG Star Wars: The Old Republic is based on BioWare's previous contribution to the Star Wars franchise,[tpl]cite web|last=Glasser|first=AJ|title=Star Wars: The Old Republic – What We Know So Far|url=http://kotaku.com/5066929/star-wars-the-old-republic--what-we-know-so-far|publisher=Kotaku|date=October 22, 2008|accessdate=June 14, 2009[/tpl] and was announced on October 21, 2008, although BioWare had first mentioned an unspecified new collaboration with LucasArts in October the previous year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lucasarts.com/company/release/news20071030.html|title=LucasArts and BioWare Corp. to Create Ground-Breaking Interactive Entertainment Product|publisher=LucasArts.com[/tpl] The other games were Dragon Age II, the sequel to Dragon Age: Origins, and Mass Effect 3.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.actiontrip.com/previews/360/masseffect_i_2.phtml|title=ActionTrip Mass Effect Interview[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/ray-muzyka-biowares-illusive-man-live-q-and-a|title=BioWare's Illusive Man Live QA|last=Purchese|first=Robert|date=January 28, 2010|publisher=Eurogamer.net|accessdate=February 2, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2010/01/29/bioware-says-dragon-age-2-to-look-super-hot/|title=BioWare says Dragon Age 2 to look 'super hot'|last=Ransom-Wiley|first=James|publisher=Joystiq|date=January 29, 2010|accessdate=July 7, 2010[/tpl]
The growth of the RPG/MMO Group as part of Electronic Arts in 2008+ has resulted in three additional studios being added to the BioWare Group outside BioWare's original home base in Edmonton. The first, located in Austin, Texas and headed by industry veterans Gordon Walton and Richard Vogel, was created to work on the Star Wars: The Old Republic MMORPG project. Both the studio and the project were announced on March 13, 2006. On March 2, 2009, BioWare announced it had opened a new studio in Montreal, Quebec to assist with existing projects as necessary.[tpl]cite web|last=Thorsen|first=Tor|title=BioWare Mass-ing Montreal devs|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6205477.html|publisher=GameSpot|date=March 2, 2009|accessdate=June 22, 2009[/tpl] In 2009 Mythic Entertainment, based in Fairfax, Virginia, became part of the RPG/MMO Group, later being renamed BioWare Mythic in early 2010.
On June 24, 2009, Electronic Arts announced a restructuring of their RPG and MMO games development into a new group that included both Mythic Entertainment and BioWare. Ray Muzyka, co-founder and General Manager of BioWare was appointed the Group General Manager of this newly formed "BioWare Group". BioWare's other co-founder, Greg Zeschuk, became the Group Creative Officer for the new RPG/MMO studio group. Rob Denton stepped up as General Manager of Mythic, reporting to Muzyka, and later became the Group Operations Officer of the new group. BioWare's studios remained unchanged and continued to report to Muzyka.[tpl]cite web|title=Bioware and Mythic Form New MMO/RPG Group|url=http://forums.warhammeronline.com/warhammer/board/message?board.id=dev_discussions&thread.id=2509|publisher=Mythic Entertainment|date=June 24, 2009|accessdate=July 18, 2009[/tpl]
The company announced that it would be opening up a new customer service office in Galway, Ireland, in 2011.[tpl]cite web|url=http://insideireland.ie/2010/05/26/archive3648-3708/|title=Electronic Arts to create 200 jobs in Galway[/tpl]
The company was also a starting place for other Albertan game developers, such as being the former employer of the HermitWorks Entertainment staff.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl] The group developed the well-received genre mixing game Space Trader, which was developed under an art grant from the Canadian government.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl]
Following the release of Mass Effect 3 in March 2012, numerous players complained about its endings failing to fulfill the developer's earlier promises regarding the conclusion of the trilogy. In response to these criticisms, BioWare announced on April 5 that they would reschedule their post-release content production and release an "Extended Cut" DLC that would expand the original endings and address the most common points of critique.[tpl]cite web|url=http://blog.bioware.com/2012/04/05/mass-effect-3-extended-cut/|title=Mass Effect 3 Extended Cut|publisher=BioWare|date=April 5, 2012|accessdate=April 5, 2012[/tpl] The Extended Cut was released as a free download on June 26, 2012.[tpl]cite web|url=http://blog.bioware.com/2012/06/22/mass-effect-3-extended-cut-2/|title=Mass Effect 3: Extended Cut|publisher=BioWare|date=June 22, 2012|accessdate=June 23, 2012[/tpl] In the aftermath of the controversy, Forbes contributor Erik Kain wrote that it "may end up being a healthy one for the industry, opening a new chapter in gamer/developer/publisher relations", calling BioWare and EA's decision to act on the fans' complaints a "remarkable" choice that made gamers realize "that they are entitled, and that it isn't a bad thing, to quality games".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2012/06/26/what-the-mass-effect-3-extended-cut-means-for-the-future-of-the-gaming-industry/|title=What The 'Mass Effect 3' Extended Cut Means for the Future of the Gaming Industry|last=Kain|first=Erik|date=June 26, 2012|work=Forbes|accessdate=July 21, 2012[/tpl]
On September 18, 2012, the next day after the official announcement of the third Dragon Age title, both Ray Muzyka and Greg Zeschuk, two of the remaining co-founders of BioWare, simultaneously announced they will be retiring from the gaming industry.[tpl]cite web|url=http://blog.bioware.com/2012/09/18/from-ray-muzyka/|title=From Ray Muzyka|last=Muzyka|first=Ray|date=September 18, 2012|publisher=BioWare Blog|accessdate=September 20, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://blog.bioware.com/2012/09/18/from-greg-zeschuk/|title=From Greg Zeschuk|last=Zeschuk|first=Greg|date=September 18, 2012|publisher=BioWare Blog|accessdate=September 20, 2012[/tpl] After almost a year without a formal head, EA appointed Matthew Bromberg the group general manager of the BioWare label on September 9, 2013. Former CEO and president of Major League Gaming, Bromberg worked as the general manager of BioWare Austin since 2012; after his promotion, Jeff Hickman took over as the general manager in Austin. Aaryn Flynn remains in charge of BioWare Canada (Edmonton and Montreal) and Jon Van Caneghem, the head of Victory Games and Waystone Studio (also parts of the BioWare label).[tpl]cite web|url=http://venturebeat.com/2013/09/09/ea-names-new-chief-of-bioware-label-exclusive/|title=EA names new chief of BioWare label (exclusive)|last=Takahashi|first=Dean|date=9 September 2013|work=VentureBeat|accessdate=10 September 2013[/tpl]

==Structure==

After the retirement of the two remaining BioWare co-founders, Ray Muzyka and Greg Zeschuk, Matthew Bromberg is the current group general manager of the BioWare label. The BioWare group consists of following studios:
Former members of the BioWare group include:

==Games==

Following games have been developed by BioWare Edmonton ("BioWare" before 2006), BioWare Montreal, and BioWare Austin.

==Game engines==

Between 1998 and 2011, BioWare developed a number of in-house video game engines to serve as technical basis for their games. Some of these engines were then licensed to other companies to develop their own games. Others came with modding toolkits, allowing the fan community to implement original adventures using the technology of BioWare's games.

===Infinity Engine===

BioWare created the Infinity Engine to use it as a core component for development of 2D role-playing video games based on Dungeons & Dragons, the Baldur's Gate series (1998–2001). The engine was also used by Black Isle Studios to create the critically acclaimed Planescape: Torment (1999) and the Icewind Dale series (2000–2002).

===Aurora Engine===

The Aurora Engine was the successor to the Infinity Engine, featuring full 3D environments, real-time lighting and shadows, and surround sound.[tpl]cite web|last=Shields|first=Jo|title=The new night|url=http://www.hexus.net/content/item.php?item=411|publisher=HEXUS.net|date=August 27, 2002|accessdate=May 19, 2009[/tpl] BioWare used the Aurora Engine to produce their 2002 Neverwinter Nights, as well as two expansion packs. The game included the so-called "Aurora toolset", a collection of tools allowing users to create their own digital adventure modules to be played either in single-player or in online multiplayer. The toolset enjoyed great popularity among the modding community, with over a thousand fan-made modules produced in it within half a year after the release.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/131327/postmortem_biowares_neverwinter_.php?page=4|title=Postmortem: Bioware's Neverwinter Nights|last=Greig|first=Scott|author2=et al.|date=4 December 2002|work=Gamasutra|page=4|accessdate=19 January 2013|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20121111000517/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/131327/postmortem_biowares_neverwinter_.php?page=4|archivedate=11 November 2012[/tpl]
Obsidian Entertainment (successor to Black Isle Studios) used an updated version of BioWare's Aurora, titled "Electron Engine", to produce Neverwinter Nights 2 (2006) and its three expansion packs (2007–2009). Like the original, the Electron toolset was released with the game.
The Polish studio CD Projekt RED used the Aurora Engine to develop The Witcher, the 2007 video game adaptation of the eponymous Polish fantasy novel series, although the rendering module was rewritten from scratch.

===Odyssey Engine===

BioWare used an updated version of the Aurora, titled the Odyssey Engine, to produce the critically acclaimed Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic in 2003 and their first original IP RPG Jade Empire in 2005. Odyssey Engine was the first BioWare engine to allow developing for video game consoles, with both KotOR and JE originally released for the Xbox before being ported to the PC platform.
Obsidian Entertainment used the Odyssey Engine to develop Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II – The Sith Lords (2004), a sequel to the original KotOR. BioWare maintained limited oversight on Obsidian's development of The Sith Lords, as well as  Neverwinter Nights 2.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl]

===Eclipse Engine===

The Eclipse Engine succeeded the Odyssey Engine and, among other things, supported PhysX hardware acceleration.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2006/11/07/bioware-integrates-physx-into-eclipse|title=BioWare Integrates PhysX into Eclipse|last=Hatfield|first=Daemon|date=7 November 2006|work=IGN|publisher=News Corporation|accessdate=19 January 2013[/tpl] It was used to produce Dragon Age: Origins (2009) and its expansion pack (2010). Like Neverwinter Nights, Origins was released with a toolset to allow the players to run their own adventure modules on the Eclipse Engine.[tpl]cite web|url=http://social.bioware.com/page/da-toolset|title=Dragon Age Origins Toolset|work=BioWare Social Network|accessdate=19 January 2013[/tpl]
A heavily upgraded version of the Eclipse Engine, internally known as the "Lycium Engine", was used to produce Dragon Age II (2011).

===Other developments===

BioWare licensed Epic Games' Unreal Engine 3 to develop the original Mass Effect trilogy (2007–2012), and Simutronics' HeroEngine for Star Wars: The Old Republic (2011), the successor to the KotOR series.
Both Dragon Age: Inquisition and the next Mass Effect installment have been announced to be based on EA DICE's Frostbite 3 engine, as part of the general move towards a unified technology foundation across all of Electronic Arts' developer studios.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2013/11/19/electronic-arts-frostbite-battlefield-mass-effect/|title=From Battlefield to Mass Effect: How one engine is shaping the future of EA Games|last=Seppala|first=Timothy J.|date=19 November 2013|work=Engadget|accessdate=14 December 2013[/tpl]

==Controversies==

===Mass Effect sex claims===

In January 2008,  neoconservative blogger Kevin McCullough wrote an article claiming that BioWare's Mass Effect contained full-frontal nudity and graphic sodomy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://gamepolitics.com/2008/01/14/conservative-blogger-claims-mass-effect-offers-customizable-sodomy |title=Blog Archive » Conservative Blogger Claims '&'Mass Effect'&' Offers "Customizable Sodomy" |publisher=GamePolitics.com |accessdate=2009-03-24[/tpl] Further allegations were made in a Fox News segment where Martha MacCallum and Cooper Lawrence furthered the claims while also admitting that they had never played Mass Effect.[tpl]cite news |first=Seth |last=Schiesel |title=Author Faults a Game, and Gamers Flame Back |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/26/arts/television/26mass.html?_r=3&ref=arts |work=New York Times |date=2008-01-26 |accessdate=2008-01-26 [/tpl] Both fans of the game and Electronic Arts refuted the allegations and McCullough and Lawrence apologized.[tpl]cite web|last=Crecente |first=Brian |url=http://kotaku.com/348187/ea-calls-fox-out-on-insulting-mass-effect-inaccuracies |title=News: EA Calls Fox Out on "Insulting" '&'Mass Effect'&' Inaccuracies |publisher=Kotaku.com |date=2008-01-23 |accessdate=2009-03-24[/tpl]

===Mass Effect 3 ending===

In March 2012, BioWare released Mass Effect 3, the final chapter of its initial Mass Effect trilogy. Leading up to its release, the developer's web site announced that "the decisions you make completely shape your experience and outcome". However, many players[tpl]who|date=September 2012[/tpl] claimed that the endings of the released game consisted of choices made at the time, regardless of decisions made in any of the games[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]. This has caused a significant number of users to complain about what they perceived to be false advertising.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/116735-BioWare-Falsely-Advertised-Mass-Effect-3|title=Bioware Falsely Advertised Mass Effect 3|last=Chalk|first=Andy|date=April 11, 2012|accessdate=July 15, 2012[/tpl] In response to these criticisms, BioWare defended their vision of the ending and stood behind their writers and developers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://blog.bioware.com/2012/03/21/4108/|title=To Mass Effect 3 players, from Dr. Ray Muzyka, co-founder of BioWare|last=Muzyka|first=Ray|date=March 21, 2012|publisher=BioWare Blog|accessdate=September 25, 2012[/tpl] On June 26, 2012, BioWare released a free DLC titled Extended Cut, which expanded the original endings to correct some of the concerns the players had felt since the release.

==Awards and recognition==

In addition to numerous game awards, the company has been awarded with a number of business related awards:
