Geneva Mitchell (February 3, 1907[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]March 10, 1949) was an American film actress. She appeared in over 70 films between 1929 and 1946.

==Career==

Modern viewers will recognize Mitchell from her appearances in the Three Stooges 1935 films Restless Knights, Pop Goes the Easel, and particularly Hoi Polloi. In Hoi Polloi, Mitchell plays a dance instructor who directs the Stooges to "do exactly as I do." Before she begins her dance, a bumblebee lands on her bare back, and then crawls under her dress. She becomes alarmed.  Naturally, the Stooges mimic her every startled move. This hilarious footage was to be reused six years later in In the Sweet Pie and Pie.

==Death==

Poor health curtailed Mitchell's career after 1936, as she appeared in only one film throughout the 1940s. She died in Los Angeles, California on March 10, 1949 at age 42.

==Personal==

Mitchell's circumstances often made the news.  She impulsively married and quickly threw over a scion of the prominent industrial Savage family, was often seen with actor/director Lowell Sherman, and reported her brother as having been kidnapped by gangsters.  She became entangled in legal wranglings involving Sherman's estate, and her publicist was sentenced to jail over a stunt she reportedly instigated.[tpl]cn|date=December 2012[/tpl]
