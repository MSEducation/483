[[Swæfberht]]

CATEGORIES: Kentish monarchs, 7th-century English monarchs

Swæfberht was a King of Kent, reigning jointly with Oswine, and possibly also Swæfheard.
Swæfberht issued an undated charter that was witnessed by Oswine http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+11, and is probably the Gabertus who witnessed a charter issued by Oswine in July 689 http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+12. He is usually combined with Swæfheard because of their similar names and overlapping dates, but multiple kingship was commonplace in Anglo-Saxon England, especially in Essex, where Swæfheard originated.
