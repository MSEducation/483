Vagabond Ways is a rock album by Marianne Faithfull. This is her first album of original material since A Secret Life (1994). This work, produced by Daniel Lanois and Mark Howard, is a balladry-like extension of her then neo-cabaret persona, interpreting songs by herself and legendary songwriters of her generation, like Pink Floyd's Roger Waters, Leonard Cohen and the songwriting duo Elton John/Bernie Taupin.
Incarceration of a Flower Child was written by Roger Waters in 1968, and never recorded by Pink Floyd. The lyrics seem to be about the downfall of Syd Barrett, but Waters has never confirmed this.
