John R Gordon is an Afrocentric white gay male writer resident in Shepherds Bush, London, England.  Although he was a "white person from a white suburb", according to Gordon, in the 1980s he became deeply interested in black cultural figures such as James Baldwin, Malcolm X and Frantz Fanon, and they have influenced his work ever since.

==Early work==

He wrote a 1999 sitcom pilot The Melting Pot about a macho black British man (Felix Dexter) coming to terms with his brother's homosexuality.  Although it never made it beyond Channel 4's Sitcom Festival to television, the Independent praised it for offering innovative characters and situations.James Rampton, "Comedy: Situation vacant", The Independent, 07 July 1999, http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/comedy-situation-vacant-1104780.html

The film, Noah's Arc: Jumping The Broom, was given a limited release in six American cities, where it played to sold-out houses at the end of October 2008 and recouped $500,000 in ticket sales alone.
