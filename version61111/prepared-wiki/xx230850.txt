[[JSMDB]]

CATEGORIES: Proprietary database management systems

JSMDB was a very small memory-based database management system. The internal data was stored as key-value mappings using java.util.TreeMap's, and the data was modified and/or retrieved using method calls instead of a query language like SQL.
The JSMDB implemented check constraints, unique key constrains, foreign keys constraints and transactions. But since it was designed to have a small run-time (about 20Kb) and to run as an embedded database engine for desktop/mobile applications, it did not implement multiples connections nor multiple transactions.
This software not available anymore, and it was designed to implement a database manager for the Personal Management System (not available too). Both software were removed from public availability to comply with some contract rules of the author's current job.
