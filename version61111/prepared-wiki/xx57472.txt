Ghetto house, or booty house,[tpl]cite web|last=Barat|first=Nick|title=Feature: On the Floor with Chicagoâ€™s Juke DJs|url=http://www.thefader.com/2007/01/26/on-the-floor/|work=Fader|publisher=The Fader, Inc.|accessdate=11 February 2013|date=26 January 2007[/tpl] is a type of Chicago house which started being recognized as a distinct style from around 1992 onwards.  It features minimal 808 and 909 drum machine-driven tracks[tpl]cite news|last=Matos|first=Michelangelo|title=How Chicago house got its groove back|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/a-history-of-the-second-wave-of-chicago-house-music/Content?oid=6194277|accessdate=28 September 2013|newspaper=Chicago Reader|date=3 May 2012[/tpl] and sometimes sexually explicit lyrics.
The template of classic Chicago house music (primarily, "It's Time for the Percolator" by Cajmere) was used with the addition of sexual lyrics. It has usually been made on minimal equipment with little or no effects.  It usually features a "4-to-the-floor" kick drum (full sounding, but not too long or distorted) along with Roland 808 and 909 synthesized tom-tom sounds, minimal use of analogue synths, and short, slightly dirty sounding (both sonically and lyrically) vocals samples, often repeated in various ways. Also common are 808 and 909 clap sounds, and full "rapped" verses and choruses.

==Chicago Juke==

The 2000s saw a rise in Chicago Juke, a faster variant of Ghetto House which began forming in the late 1980s. Chicago Juke songs are generally around 150-160 BPM[tpl]cite news|last=Sheffield|first=Hazel|title=Footwork takes competitive dancing to the Chicago streets|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/may/27/footwork-street-dance-chicago|accessdate=11 February 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=27 May 2010[/tpl] with kick drums, usually in a One-And-Two A-And-Four style pattern[tpl]clarify|date=March 2013[/tpl], pounding rapidly (and at times very sparsely) in syncopation with crackling snares, claps, and other sounds reminiscent of old drum machines. The production style is often markedly low-fi, much like Baile Funk. Chicago Juke evolved to match the energy of footwork, a dance style born in the disparate ghettos, house parties and underground dance competitions of Chicago. RP Boo, a former footwork dancer, is generally credited with making the first songs that fall within the canon[tpl]cite web|last=Quam|first=Dave|title=Bangs & Works Vol. 1 Liner Notes|url=http://www.planet.mu/discography/ZIQ290|publisher=Planet Mu|accessdate=14 May 2012[/tpl] Living hand in hand with juke music, footwork is one of the last untapped (and resultantly, unfiltered) hood dance music styles in the world.FEATURE: Juke And Footwork - From Chicago To The World - Rip It Up Magazine - Retrieved 6-10-10 Footwork is a controlled and complex moving of the feet at high speeds, a modern form of house dance footwork and breakdancing footwork. Producers in the Chicago Juke and booty house genre include Dude 'n Nem, DJ Slugo, DJ Chip, DJ Nate, DJ Tha Pope, and DJ Rashad & Spinn. Teklife is arguably the most prominent collective in the modern day footwork scene.
In December 2005, DJ Gant-Man became the first DJ/producer to have a Chicago Juke house remix for a major artist on a major label with his remix for Beyonce's "Check on It" featuring Slim Thug on Columbia/Sony Records. It has helped bring Chicago Juke into the mainstream.

==Juke and Europe==

Juke/footwork has been popular in the clubs of Europe particularly in Paris and Brussels for a number of years with the Booty Call club nights and artists such as Kill Frenzy and DJ Hilti putting out releases via the Juke Trax label. It has however only recently begun to flourish in UK clubs, due to the "Bangs and Works Volume 1" compilation on the Planet Mu label. Though earlier releases by DJ Slugo can be found on UK label WIDE, Planet Mu were the first to grab any media attention. Hyperdub has also been a recent heavy supporter of juke and footwork, releasing a multitude of DJ Rashad's material.
Various artists evolving around what is often labeled by various subcultural media as the deeper or rather avant-garde sub-sonorities of dubstep music, have started to integrate juke elements to their works in the last few years, perhaps subsequently to the recent bloom of juke music in Europe.
