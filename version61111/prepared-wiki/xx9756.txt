Because of their broad range of properties,[tpl]Cite book  | last1 = Painter | first1 = Paul C. | last2 = Coleman | first2 = Michael M. | title = Fundamentals of polymer science : an introductory text | year = 1997 | publisher = Technomic Pub.

Polymers, both natural and synthetic, are created via polymerization of many monomers. Their consequently large molecular mass relative to small molecule compounds produces unique physical properties, including toughness, viscoelasticity, and a tendency to form glasses and semicrystalline structures rather than crystals.
The term "polymer" derives from the ancient Greek word πολύς (polus, meaning "many, much") and μέρος (meros, meaning "parts"), and refers to a molecule whose structure is composed of multiple repeating units, from which originates a characteristic of high relative molecular mass and attendant properties.http://goldbook.iupac.org/M03667.html; accessed 7 October 2012. Per the IUPAC Gold Book and PAC sources referenced therein, "In many cases, especially for synthetic polymers, a molecule can be regarded as having a high relative molecular mass if the addition or removal of one or a few of the units has a negligible effect on the molecular properties."  However, they note that the "statement fails in the case of certain macromolecules for which the properties may be critically dependent on fine details of the molecular structure." The units composing polymers derive, actually or conceptually, from molecules of low relative molecular mass.[tpl]GoldBookRef | title = macromolecule (polymer molecule) | file = M03667[/tpl] The term was coined in 1833 by Jöns Jacob Berzelius, though with a definition distinct from the modern IUPAC  definition.If two substances had empirical formulae that were integer multiples of each other -- e.g., acetylene (C2H2) and benzene (C6H6) -- Berzelius called them "polymeric".  See:  Jöns Jakob Berzelius (1833) "Isomerie, Unterscheidung von damit analogen Verhältnissen" (Isomeric, distinction from relations analogous to it), Jahres-Bericht über die Fortschitte der physischen Wissenschaften …, 12 :  63-67.  From page 64:  "Um diese Art von Gleichheit in der Zusammensetzung, bei Ungleichheit in den Eigenschaften, bezeichnen zu können, möchte ich für diese Körper die Benennung polymerische (von πολυς mehrere) vorschlagen."  (In order to be able to denote this type of similarity in composition is accompanied by differences in properties, I would like to propose the designation "polymeric" (from πολυς, several) for these substances.) Originally published in 1832 in Swedish as:  Jöns Jacob Berzelius (1832) "Isomeri, dess distinktion från dermed analoga förhållanden," Årsberättelse om Framstegen i Fysik och Kemi, pages 65-70 ; the word "polymeriska" appears on page 66.See also:  William B. Jensen (2008) "Ask the Historian:  The origin of the polymer concept," Journal of Chemical Education, 88 :  624-625.  Available on-line at:  University of California.edu. The modern concept of polymers as covalently bonded macromolecular structures was proposed in 1920 by Hermann Staudinger, who spent the next decade finding experimental evidence for this hypothesis.[tpl]cite book|last1=Allcock|first1=Harry R.|last2=Lampe|first2=Frederick W.|last3=Mark|first3=James E.|title=Contemporary Polymer Chemistry|publisher=Pearson Education|edition=3|year=2003|page=21|isbn=0-13-065056-0[/tpl]
Polymers are studied in the fields of biophysics and macromolecular science, and polymer science (which includes polymer chemistry and polymer physics). Historically, products arising from the linkage of repeating units by covalent chemical bonds have been the primary focus of polymer science; emerging important areas of the science now focus on non-covalent links. Polyisoprene of latex rubber and the polystyrene of styrofoam are examples of polymeric natural/biological and synthetic polymers, respectively. In biological contexts, essentially all biological macromolecules—i.e., proteins (polyamides), nucleic acids (polynucleotides), and polysaccharides—are purely polymeric, or are composed in large part of polymeric components—e.g., isoprenylated/lipid-modified glycoproteins, where small lipidic molecule and oligosaccharide modifications occur on the polyamide backbone of the protein.[tpl]cite journal | author1 = Ten Feizi | author2 = Wengang Chai | title =  Oligosaccharide microarrays to decipher the glyco code | journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 5 | pages = 582–588 | year = 2004 | doi = 10.1038/nrm1428 | issue = 7[/tpl]

==Common examples==

Polymers are of two types:
Most commonly, the continuously linked backbone of a polymer used for the preparation of plastics consists mainly of carbon atoms. A simple example is polyethylene ('polythene' in British English), whose repeating unit is based on ethylene monomer. However, other structures do exist; for example, elements such as silicon form familiar materials such as silicones, examples being Silly Putty and waterproof plumbing sealant. Oxygen is also commonly present in polymer backbones, such as those of polyethylene glycol, polysaccharides (in glycosidic bonds), and DNA (in phosphodiester bonds).

==Polymer synthesis==

Polymerization is the process of combining many small molecules known as monomers into a covalently bonded chain or network. During the polymerization process, some chemical groups may be lost from each monomer. This is the case, for example, in the polymerization of PET polyester. The monomers are terephthalic acid (HOOC-C6H4-COOH) and ethylene glycol (HO-CH2-CH2-OH) but the repeating unit is -OC-C6H4-COO-CH2-CH2-O-, which corresponds to the combination of the two monomers with the loss of two water molecules. The distinct piece of each monomer that is incorporated into the polymer is known as a repeat unit or monomer residue.
Laboratory synthetic methods are generally divided into two categories, step-growth polymerization and chain-growth polymerization.[tpl]Cite book  | last1 = Sperling | first1 = L. H. (Leslie Howard) | title = Introduction to physical polymer science | year = 2006 | publisher = Wiley | location = Hoboken, N.J. | isbn = 0-471-70606-X | page = 10 [/tpl] The essential difference between the two is that in chain growth polymerization, monomers are added to the chain one at a time only,Sperling, p. 11 such as in polyethylene, whereas in step-growth polymerization chains of monomers may combine with one another directly,Sperling, p. 15 such as in polyester.  However, some newer methods such as plasma polymerization do not fit neatly into either category. Synthetic polymerization reactions may be carried out with or without a catalyst. Laboratory synthesis of biopolymers, especially of proteins, is an area of intensive research.

===Biological synthesis===

There are three main classes of biopolymers: polysaccharides, polypeptides, and polynucleotides.
In living cells, they may be synthesized by enzyme-mediated processes, such as the formation of DNA catalyzed by DNA polymerase. The synthesis of proteins involves multiple enzyme-mediated processes to transcribe genetic information from the DNA to RNA and subsequently translate that information to synthesize the specified protein from amino acids. The protein may be modified further following translation in order to provide appropriate structure and functioning.

===Modification of natural polymers===

Naturally occurring polymers such as cotton, starch and rubber were familiar materials for years before synthetic polymers such as polyethene and perspex appeared on the market. 
Many commercially important polymers are synthesized by chemical modification of naturally occurring polymers. Prominent examples include the reaction of nitric acid and cellulose to form nitrocellulose and the formation of vulcanized rubber by heating natural rubber in the presence of sulfur.
Ways in which polymers can be modified include oxidation, cross-linking and end-capping.
Especially in the production of polymers, the gas separation by membranes has acquired increasing importance in the petrochemical industry and is now a relatively well-established unit operation.
The process of polymer degassing is necessary to suit polymer for extrusion and pelletizing, increasing safety, environmental, and product quality aspects. Nitrogen is generally used for this purpose, resulting in a vent gas primarily composed of monomers and nitrogen.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/intratec/membranes-on-polyolefins-plants-vent-recovery|title= Membranes on Polyolefins Plants Vent Recovery, Improvement Economics Program|publisher=by Intratec, ISBN 978-0615678917[/tpl]

==Polymer properties==

Polymer properties are broadly divided into several classes based on the scale at which the property is defined as well as upon its physical basis.[tpl]cite journal|author=S.A. Baeurle|doi=10.1007/s10910-008-9467-3|title=Multiscale modeling of polymer materials using field-theoretic methodologies: a survey about recent developments|journal=Journal of Mathematical Chemistry |volume=46|issue=2|pages=363–426|year=2009[/tpl] The most basic property of a polymer is the identity of its constituent monomers. A second set of properties, known as microstructure, essentially describe the arrangement of these monomers within the polymer at the scale of a single chain. These basic structural properties play a major role in determining bulk physical properties of the polymer, which describe how the polymer behaves as a continuous macroscopic material. Chemical properties, at the nano-scale, describe how the chains interact through various physical forces. At the macro-scale, they describe how the bulk polymer interacts with other chemicals and solvents.

===Monomers and repeat units===

The identity of the monomer residues (repeat units) comprising a polymer is its first and most important attribute. Polymer nomenclature is generally based upon the type of monomer residues comprising the polymer. Polymers that contain only a single type of repeat unit are known as homopolymers, while polymers containing a mixture of repeat units are known as copolymers. Poly(styrene), for example, is composed only of styrene monomer residues, and is therefore classified as a homopolymer. Ethylene-vinyl acetate, on the other hand, contains more than one variety of repeat unit and is thus a copolymer. Some biological polymers are composed of a variety of different but structurally related monomer residues; for example, polynucleotides such as DNA are composed of a variety of nucleotide subunits.
A polymer molecule containing ionizable subunits is known as a polyelectrolyte or ionomer.

===Microstructure===

The microstructure of a polymer (sometimes called configuration) relates to the physical arrangement of monomer residues along the backbone of the chain.Sperling, p. 30 These are the elements of polymer structure that require the breaking of a covalent bond in order to change. Structure has a strong influence on the other properties of a polymer. For example, two samples of natural rubber may exhibit different durability, even though their molecules comprise the same monomers.

====Polymer architecture[tpl]Anchor|Intermolecular forces[/tpl]====

An important microstructural feature of a polymer is its architecture and shape, which relates to the way branch points lead to a deviation from a simple linear chain.[tpl]Cite book  | last1 = Rubinstein | first1 = Michael | last2 = Colby | first2 = Ralph H. | title = Polymer physics | year = 2003 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford ; New York | isbn = 0-19-852059-X | page = 6 [/tpl] A branched polymer molecule is composed of a main chain with one or more substituent side chains or branches. Types of branched polymers include star polymers, comb polymers, brush polymers, dendronized polymers, ladders, and dendrimers. There exist also two-dimensional polymers which are composed of topologically planar repeat units.
A polymer's architecture affects many of its physical properties including, but not limited to, solution viscosity, melt viscosity, solubility in various solvents, glass transition temperature and the size of individual polymer coils in solution.
A variety of techniques may be employed for the synthesis of a polymeric material with a range of architectures, for example Living polymerization.
