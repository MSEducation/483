Saša Kajkut (Serbian Cyrillic: Саша Кајкут, born 7 July 1984 in Banja Luka) is a Bosnian football player playing for Hong Kong First Division League club South China.
As a teenager, he played for the local team Borac where he started his professional career. After that he moved to Croatian 2nd division teams Zadar and Pomorac.
In addition to being a regular for his national side, one of Kajkut’s remarkable memorable moment in his career is connected to the 2nd leg match for Sheriff (a Moldova team) against a team from Androrra in 2007 UCL qualifier (first qualifying round).  He first passed the ball to Balima for scoring Sheriff’s lead of 0-1 in 68th minute (just 3 minutes after he entered the game), and then scored his first goal for the new team in 77th minute. He created history in just 12 minutes, as he became the first ever player from Banja Luka scoring in an official Champions League Match. With this extraordinary performance he became one of the favorite players for Sheriff fans though he only stayed there for one single season.
On 31 December 2013, Kajkut signed for South China permanently after a successful trial.
