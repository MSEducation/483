In the Wake of the Wind is an album by David Arkenstone, released in 1991. It is the first album in a trilogy that includes Quest of the Dream Warrior and Return of the Guardians. The music is based on a fantasy story contained in the booklet that tells of a strange wind called The Lion's Breath and a young man named Andolin who desires to vanquish it. This album contains some of Arkenstone's most evocative, varied, and sweeping compositions and arrangements, with frequent use of orchestral instruments. It reached #1 on the Billboard New Age chart and received a Grammy nomination. The track "Morning Sun on the Sails" is dedicated to Aaron Copland.  Also, the first track on the album "Papillon (On the Wings of the Butterfly)" plays once every twenty minutes in the loop of songs played at Innoventions Plaza at Walt Disney World's Epcot.  The Glassmen Drum and Bugle Corps, from Toledo, Ohio performed arrangements of Overture, Morning Sun on the Sails, The Lion's Breath, and Sailing as part of their 1993 field show for Drum Corps International, entitled, "A Voyage Through Imagination."
