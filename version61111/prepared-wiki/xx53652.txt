Cispius is the nomen of the Roman gens Cispia.

==Cispius Laevus==

The Mons Cispius, or Cispian Hill, is one of several summits of the Esquiline Hill in Rome. The grammarian Festus says that it was named for a Cispius Laevus of Anagnia, of the Publilia voting tribe (tribus). This Cispius may be legendary.Ronald Syme, "Senators, Tribes and Towns," Historia 13 (1964), pp. 107, 115.

==M. Cispius==

Marcus Cispius was a tribune of the plebs in 57 BC, and was among those tribunes who actively supported Cicero in his efforts to overturn the legislation that brought about his exile.Cicero, Post Reditum in Senatu 21; Pro Sestio 76. Earlier, however, Cicero had brought a civil suit in which he spoke against Cispius, his brother, and their father. Sometime after Cispius's tribunate, most likely in early 56, he was defended by Cicero on a charge of electoral corruption (ambitus) and convicted.Michael C. Alexander, Trials in the Late Roman Republic, 149 BC to 50 BC (University of Toronto Press, 1990), pp. 127, 136; W. Jeffrey Tatum, The Patrician Tribune (University of North Caroline Press, 1999), pp. 178 and 318, note 203. Cicero calls him "a man of character and principle."Vir optimus et constantissimus (Pro Sestio 76), as translated by Ronald Syme, The Roman Revolution (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1939), p. 81. The two men maintained their friendship in the 50s; in 55, Cicero wrote a letter of recommendationAd familiares 13.6.2. to the proconsul of Africa, Q. Valerius Orca, on behalf of men associated with Cispius.John Nicholson, "The Delivery and Confidentiality of Cicero's Letters," Classical Journal 90 (1994), pp. 47–48. Cispius may have been a praetorCIL 4, 1278. sometime after 54.General sources on Marcus Cispius: Cicero, Pro Sestio 76, Pro Plancio 77–75; Bobbio Scholiast 165 Stangl; MRR2 pp. 202, 544.

==L. Cispius (Laevus)==

Lucius Cispius, probably with the cognomen Laevus, was a commander of the fleet (praefectus classis) in 46 BC, serving under Julius Caesar. He took part in the blockade of Thapsus. Cispius was not of senatorial rank, and has been tentatively linked to a pottery manufacturing family in Arretium. It is possible that he was the son of Marcus Cispius (above), though this filiation would place them on opposite sides in the civil war.T.P. Wiseman, New Men in the Roman Senate (Oxford University Press, 1971), no. 120, p. 224, as cited by Elizabeth Rawson, "Caesar, Etruria and the Disciplina Etrusca," Journal of Roman Studies 68 (1978), p. 151.  In 43, a Cispius Laevus was a legate of Munatius Plancus, carrying dispatches to Rome for him; this man was most likely Caesar's naval commander.Cicero, Ad familiares 10.18.1–2 and 21.3; MRR2 pp. 351, 544, and MRR3 p. 53; Ronald Syme, review of Broughton, Classical Philology 50 (1955), p. 135, and "Senators, Tribes and Towns," p. 115.
