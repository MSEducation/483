==Personal life==

The daughter of critic and editor Wilson Follett, Barbara Follett was schooled at home and was writing poetry by age four.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,835766,00.html |title=Books: Tragedy in a Hothouse |author= |date=June 3, 1966 |work=Time Magazine |accessdate=January 3, 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110201212017/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,835766,00.html| archivedate= 1 February 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Her first novel, The House Without Windows, was published when she was twelve years old, with the help and guidance of her father.
When she was fourteen her father left her mother for another woman, a devastating blow to Barbara who was deeply attached to her father. The family fell upon hard times, and at the age of sixteen, as the Great Depression was gaining momentum, Follett was, from necessity, working as a secretary in New York.
While still a teenager, she married Nickerson Rogers. Follett believed that Rogers was unfaithful, and became depressed. According to Rogers, she left her apartment after a quarrel on December 7, 1939, with thirty dollars in her pocket, and was never seen again. She was twenty-five years old.
Rogers did not contact the police until two weeks later, and requested a missing persons bulletin four months after that; no serious effort to find her was ever made by anyone. Her body was never found, no evidence either indicating or excluding foul play was ever produced, and the date and circumstances of her death were never established.

==Writing career==

Her first novel, The House Without Windows, was accepted and published in 1927 by the Knopf publishing house to critical acclaim by the New York Times, the Saturday Review, and H. L. Mencken. Follett was thirteen years old, and famous.
Her next novel, The Voyage of the Norman D., based on her experience on a coastal schooner in Nova Scotia, was published in 1928, again to critical acclaim in major publications. Follett was fourteen, and had reached the apex of her life and career, as this was the time when her father abandoned her mother. 
She wrote several more manuscripts, including the novel-length Lost Island and Travels Without a Donkey, a travelogue (the title plays on Robert Louis Stevenson's Travels with a Donkey).
