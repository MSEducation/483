==Surprise==

The surprise is a mechanical gold and enameled peacock, sitting in the branches of an engraved gold tree with flowers made of enamel and precious stones. The peacock can be lifted from within the tree and wound up. Placed on a flat surface, it struts around, moving its head and spreads and closes his enamel tail.
Dorofeiev, the Fabergé workmaster, reportedly worked on the peacock and its prototypes for three years.

==History==

The 'Peacock egg' was inspired by the 18th century Peacock clock by James Cox. It was housed first in the Winter Palace, and now in the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia. The Peacock clock was a present from Grigori Alexandrovich Potemkin to Catherine the Great.Mieks - Fabergé Peacock
In 1927 the Peacock egg was sold with nine other Imperial eggs by the Antikvariat to Emanuel Snowman of Wartski in London. Bought by a Mr. Hirst in 1935, it was sold to Dr. Maurice Sandoz of Switzerland in 1949, and donated to his Foundation Edouard et Maurice Sandoz, Lausanne, Switzerland in 1955. Since its purchase by Sandoz, it has only been seen publicly six times, the last time in 2009.
