CATEGORIES: Dermal and subcutaneous growths, Immune system disorders

Mastocytosis, one of the mast cell diseases, is a rare disorder of both children and adults caused by the presence of too many mast cells (mastocytes) and CD34+ mast cell precursors.[tpl]cite journal |author=Horny HP, Sotlar K, Valent P |title=Mastocytosis: state of the art |journal=Pathobiology |volume=74 |issue=2 |pages=121–32 |year=2007 |pmid=17587883 |doi=10.1159/000101711[/tpl]
People affected by masyocytosis are susceptible to itching, hives, and anaphylaxic shock, caused by the release of histamine from mast cells. The current classifications, definitions & diagnostic criteria for mastocytosis are being reviewed for revision to better describe the collection of related disorders.http://www.mastocytosis.ca/masto.htm

==Classification==

Mastocytosis can occur in a variety of forms:
There are three classes of systemic mastocytosis: indolent systemic mastocytosis, aggressive systemic mastocytosis, and Leukemic systemic (which affects 3% of cases).[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]

==Mast Cell Diseases==

Other types of mast cell disease include:
Other known but rare mast cell proliferation diseases are mast cell leukemia and mast cell sarcoma.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]

==Signs and symptoms==

When too many mast cells exist in a person's body and undergo degranulation, the additional chemicals can cause a number of symptoms which can vary over time and can range in intensity from mild to severe.  Because mast cells play a role in allergic reactions, the symptoms of mastocytosis often are similar to the symptoms of an allergic reaction.  They may include, but are not limited to:[tpl]cite journal |author=Hermine O, Lortholary O, Leventhal PS, et al. |title=Case-Control Cohort Study of Patients' Perceptions of Disability in Mastocytosis |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=3 |issue=5 |pages=e2266 |year=2008 |pmid=18509466 |pmc=2386235 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0002266 |url= |editor1-last=Soyer |editor1-first=H. Peter[/tpl]

==Pathophysiology==

Mast cells are located in connective tissue, including the skin, the linings of the stomach and intestine, and other sites. They play an important role in helping defend these tissues from disease. By releasing chemical "alarms" such as histamine, mast cells attract other key players of the immune defense system to areas of the body where they are needed.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]
Mast cells seem to have other roles as well. Because they gather together around wounds, mast cells may play a part in wound healing. For example, the typical itching felt around a healing scab may be caused by histamine released by mast cells. Researchers also think mast cells may have a role in the growth of blood vessels (angiogenesis). No one with too few or no mast cells has been found, which indicates to some scientists we may not be able to survive with too few mast cells.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]
Mast cells express a cell surface receptor, c-kit[tpl]cite journal |author=Orfao A, Garcia-Montero AC, Sanchez L, Escribano L |title=Recent advances in the understanding of mastocytosis: the role of KIT mutations |journal=Br. J. Haematol. |volume=138 |issue=1 |pages=12–30 |year=2007 |pmid=17555444 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06619.x[/tpl] (CD117), which is the receptor for stem cell factor (scf). In laboratory studies, scf appears to be important for the proliferation of mast cells. Mutations of the c-kit receptor, leading to uncontrolled stimulation of the receptor, is a cause for the disease. Inhibiting the tyrosine kinase receptor with imatinib (see below) may reduce the symptoms of mastocytosis.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]

==Diagnosis==

Doctors can diagnose urticaria pigmentosa (cutaneous mastocytosis, see above) by seeing the characteristic lesions that are dark-brown and fixed. A small skin sample (biopsy) may help confirm the diagnosis.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]
By taking a biopsy from a different organ, such as the bone marrow, the doctor can diagnose systemic mastocytosis. Using special techniques on a bone marrow sample, the doctor looks for an increase in mast cells. Another sign of this disorder is high levels of certain mast-cell chemicals and proteins in a person's blood and sometimes in the urine.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]

==Epidemiology==

No one is sure how many people have either type of mastocytosis, but mastocytosis generally has been considered to be an "orphan disease" (orphan diseases affect 200,000 or fewer people in the United States). Mastocytosis, however, often may be misdiagnosed, especially because it typically occurs secondary to another condition, and thus may occur more frequently than assumed.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]

==Treatment==

There is currently no cure for mastocytosis, but there are a number of medicines to help treat the symptoms: [tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]
Antidepressants are an important and often overlooked tool in the treatment of mastocytosis. Depression and other neurological symptoms have been noted in mastocytosis.[tpl]cite journal| author=Moura DS, Sultan S, Georgin-Lavialle S, Pillet N, Montestruc F, et al | year=2011 | title=Depression in Patients with Mastocytosis: Prevalence, Features and Effects of Masitinib Therapy | journal=PLoS ONE | volume=6 | issue=10| pages=e26375 | url=http://www.plosone.org/article/citationList.action?articleURI=info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0026375 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0026375[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Rogers MP, Bloomingdale K, Murawski BJ, Soter NA, Reich P, Austen KF |title=Mixed organic brain syndrome as a manifestation of systemic mastocytosis |journal=Psychosom Med |volume=48 |issue=6 |pages=437–47 |year=1986 |pmid=3749421 |doi= |url=http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=3749421[/tpl] Some antidepressants, such as doxepin, are themselves potent antihistamines and can help relieve physical as well as cognitive symptoms.
Dihydropyridines and calcium channel blockers are sometimes used to treat high blood pressure. At least one clinical study suggested nifedipine, one of the dihydropyridines, may reduce mast cell degranulation in patients who exhibit urticaria pigmentosa. A 1984 study by Fairly et al. included a patient with symptomatic urticaria pigmentosa who responded to nifedipine at dose of 10 mg po tid.[tpl]cite journal |author=Fairley JA, Pentland AP, Voorhees JJ |title=Urticaria pigmentosa responsive to nifedipine |journal=J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. |volume=11 |issue=4 Pt 2 |pages=740–3 |year=1984 |pmid=6491000 |doi= 10.1016/S0190-9622(84)70233-7|url=[/tpl] However, nifedipine has not been approved by the FDA for treatment of mastocytosis.
In rare cases in which mastocytosis is cancerous or associated with a blood disorder, the patient may have to use steroids and/or chemotherapy. The novel agent imatinib (Glivec or Gleevec) has been found to be effective in certain types of mastocytosis.[tpl]cite journal |author=Droogendijk HJ, Kluin-Nelemans HJ, van Doormaal JJ, Oranje AP, van de Loosdrecht AA, van Daele PL |title=Imatinib mesylate in the treatment of systemic mastocytosis: a phase II trial |journal=Cancer |volume=107 |issue=2 |pages=345–51 |year=2006 |pmid=16779792 |doi=10.1002/cncr.21996 |url=[/tpl]
There are clinical trials currently underway testing stem cell transplants as a form of treatment.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]

==Research==

National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases scientists have been studying and treating patients with mastocytosis for several years at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]
Some of the most important research advances for this rare disorder include improved diagnosis of mast cell disease and identification of growth factors and genetic mechanisms responsible for increased mast cell production. Researchers are currently evaluating approaches to improve ways to treat mastocytosis.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]
Scientists also are focusing on identifying disease-associated mutations (changes in genes). NIH scientists have identified some mutations, which may help researchers understand the causes of mastocytosis, improve diagnosis, and develop better treatments.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]
