[[Norovirus cis-acting replication element]]

CATEGORIES: Norovirus, Non-coding RNA

In molecular biology, the Norovirus cis-acting replication element (CRE) is an RNA element which is found in the coding region of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase in Norovirus. It occurs near to the 5' end of the RNA dependant RNA polymerase gene, this is the same location that the Hepatitis A virus cis-acting replication element is found in.[tpl]cite journal |last=Victoria |first=M |coauthors=Colina, R; Miagostovich, MP; Leite, JP; Cristina, J |title=Phylogenetic prediction of cis-acting elements: a cre-like sequence in Norovirus genome? |journal=BMC Research Notes |date=Sep 7, 2009 |volume=2 |pages=176 |pmid=19735574 |doi=10.1186/1756-0500-2-176 |pmc=2749865[/tpl]
