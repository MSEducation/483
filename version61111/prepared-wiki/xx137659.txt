Cuty was the top goal scorer of Deportivo Saprissa during the 50s and beginnings of the 60s. During those years, he played the same role in Costa Rica's national squad, team where he played his first game being just 16 years old. In 27 matches, he scored 23 goals, and is still in the top 5 among the best scorers in the Costa Rica national football team.[tpl]cite web|publisher=RSSSF|author=Mamrud, Roberto|title=Costa Rica - Record International Players|url=http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/cos-recintlp.html|accessdate=2009-06-02[/tpl] He played in the qualifying rounds of the 1962 FIFA World Cup.[tpl]FIFA player|50809|Jorge Hernan Monge[/tpl]
Cuty won a total of 6 Costa Rican national championships, and was the best goal scorer in several seasons. He still holds the Costa Rican record for most goals scored by a player in a single game, with 6, in 1958 against Club Sport La Libertad.
His career was cut short in 1968, when injuries caused by a car accident forced him to retire. He was only 28 when he quit the fields.
