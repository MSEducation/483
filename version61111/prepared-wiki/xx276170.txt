==History==

St. John’s is the first Catholic parish in the city of Indianapolis.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/indianapolis/stjohn.htm |title=St. John the Evangelist Catholic Church |publisher= National Park Service |accessdate=2011-09-26|last=|first= [/tpl]  The present site on which the church was built was purchased in 1846, and the parish built its second church there.  When it became too small, Dietrich Bohlen was hired to design the present church.  It was built in the Gothic Revival style from 1863-1867.  The spires on the two towers that flank the main façade were designed by Oscar Bohlen of D. A. Bohlen & Son and built in 1893.
The intention was for St. John’s to serve as the cathedral when the Diocese of Vincennes moved to Indianapolis.  It partially served that function.  It was the Proto-cathedral of the Diocese of Vincennes  from 1871-1898.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.stjohnsindy.org/who-we-are/our-history|title= Our History |publisher= St. John the Evangelist Church |accessdate=2011-09-26|last=|first= [/tpl]   Pope Leo XIII officially moved the See City to Indianapolis on March 28, 1898[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dindi.html |title= Archdiocese of Indianapolis |publisher= Catholic-Hierarchy|accessdate=2011-09-26|last=|first=[/tpl] and St. John’s continued as the cathedral church until 1907 when it was replaced by Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral. The parish continued to house the diocesan chancery until 1968 and the Metropolitan Tribunal until 1982.
