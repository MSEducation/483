==Profile==

Damon Knight wrote, "As a science fiction writer she has few peers; her work is not only technically brilliant but has a rare human warmth and richness."[ref][tpl]cite book |title= A Century of Science Fiction|last=Knight |first= Damon|authorlink= Damon Knight|year=1962 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |location=New York |isbn= |page= 151|accessdate=July 21, 2012 |url=http://books.google.com/books/about/A_Century_of_Science_Fiction.html?id=jH_jAAAACAAJ[/tpl]
[/ref] Brian Aldiss noted [tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl] that she could "do the hard stuff magnificently," while Theodore Sturgeon observed [tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl] that she "generally starts from a base of hard science, or rationalizes psi phenomena with beautifully finished logic."
According to The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction, she "was in the vanguard of those sf writers trying to apply to the soft sciences the machinery of the hard sciences".John Clute and Peter Nicholls, eds., The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction, St. Martin's Griffin, 1995
Her stories have been included in anthologies and a few have had radio and television adaptations. One collection of her stories has been published.
It was while she worked as a laboratory technician in 1947 that she began writing science fiction. Strongly influenced by Ludwig von Bertalanffy's General Systems Theory, her fiction has often demonstrated a foresight in scientific advancements.
