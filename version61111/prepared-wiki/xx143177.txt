Hassan is a licensed mental health counselor (LMHC) in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and is a former member of the Unification Church.

The sociologist Eileen Barker, who has studied the Unification Church, has commented on the book.Church Times (UK) 23 November 1990 p. 13]  She expressed several concerns but nevertheless recommended the book.  The book has been reviewed in the American Journal of Psychiatry,American Journal of Psychiatry 147:7 July 1990 and in the The Lancet.Review of Books The Lancet, Peter Tyrer, 24 June 1989
The book was well received by other authors on the subject, such as Dr. Margaret Singer, Rabbi James A. Rudin and conservative Rabbi and theologian Harold S. Kushner.  Singer writes:
 "...A major contribution...For the first time, a skilled and ethical exit counselor has spelled out the details of the complicated yet understandable process of helping free a human being from the bondage of mental manipulation.....Steve Hassan has written a 'how to do something about it' book."

==Critical Viewpoints==

John B. Brown II of the "Pagan Unity Campaign" criticized a policy stated in the book (page 114) which says that although Hassan had '"decided not to participate in forcible interventions, believing it was imperative to find another approach"', "Forcible intervention can be kept as a last resort if all other attempts fail."  Brown states that this indicates that Hassan advocates resorting to a forcible intervention if all other attempts fail.[tpl]Citation| first=John B. | last=Brown II| coauthors=| contribution=Jehovah's Witnesses and the Anticult Movement: Human Rights Issues| title=Religion, Globalization, and Conflict: International Perspectives| editor-first=| editor-last=| coeditors=| publisher=CESNUR| place= San Diego State University, San Diego, California| pages=| date=13 July 2006| id= | contribution-url=http://www.cesnur.org/2006/sd_brown.htm| format=| accessdate=2010-03-02 [/tpl]
According to Douglas Cowan, in this book Hassan utilizes a language opposing "freedom" and "captivity", based on the conceptual framework of brainwashing and thought control, and the alleged abuses of civil liberties and human rights. He writes that these are the precipitating motivation for secular anticultists such as Hassan.Cowan, Douglas E.

Irving Hexham, professor of Religious Studies at the University of Calgary, writes that Hassan's description of destructive cults (page 37), as "a group which violates the rights of its members and damages them through the abusive techniques of unethical mind control" is not helpful as he fails to describe how to decide if a group is a cult or not, what are "abusive techniques" and what is "mind control".Hexham, Irving and  Poewe, Karla, New Religions as Global Cultures: Making the Human Sacred, pp.27, Westview Press (1997), ISBN 0-8133-2508-0. "In his book combating Cult Mind Control, Steven Hassan says a "destructive cult . . . is a group which violates the rights of its members and damages them through the abusive techniques of unethical mind control" ( Hassan 1990: 37 ). "The problem with definitions like this is that they raise more problems than they solve. Before we can decide whether a group is a cult or not, we must first define 'rights,' 'abusive techniques,' and 'mind control.' Hassan attempts to do this, but his explanations are not very helpful."
