The Pays d'Ouche is an historical and geographical region in Normandy. It extends from the southwest of Évreux up to Bernay and Beaumont-le-Roger as a northern limit, and down to L'Aigle and to Gacé in the south. 
Since the French revolution, the main part is located in the department of Eure (Haute-Normandie region), and another one in the neighboring Orne department (Basse-Normandie region), where its capital town L'Aigle is situated. 
The Risle River and other tributaries of the Seine flow through this area. Its chalky soil is not agriculturally productive. The principal towns of the area are l'Aigle, population 8, 972 (INSEE, 1999), on the River Risle and Conches-en-Ouche, population 5,352 (INSEE, 1999), on the River Rouloir.
