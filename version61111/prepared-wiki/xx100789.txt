O is Damien Rice's first studio album, originally released on 1 February 2002, in Ireland and in the United Kingdom. The album is dedicated to Rice's friend Mic Christopher, who died of a head injury in 2001.
Rice wanted to make the album without the backing of a major record label, believing if he signed such a deal it would compromise his future work, forcing him to move in directions he did not wish to.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cluas.com/music/albums/damienrice.htm|title=Album Reviews - Damien Rice 'O'|publisher=CLUAS|year=2002|accessdate=2009-03-05[/tpl]
