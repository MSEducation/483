IARPA is composed of three program offices—Smart Collection, Incisive Analysis, and Safe and Secure Operations. The goal of the Office of Smart Collection is to "dramatically improve the value of collected data from all sources". The Office of Incisive Analysis exists to "maximize insight from the information we collect, in a timely fashion". IARPA's third division, the Office of Safe and Secure Operations, exists to "counter new capabilities implemented by our adversaries that would threaten our ability to operate freely and effectively in a networked world".

==The Metaphor Program==

The Metaphor Program is a two-phase project designed to first develop automated techniques for recognizing, defining, and categorizing linguistic metaphors and then use that information to characterize differing cultural perspectives. The Program is headed by Heather McCallum-Bayliss. In May 2011, IARPA issued an open solicitation for private-sector parties to participate.[tpl]cite news|last=Madrigal|first=Alexis|title=Why Are Spy Researchers Building a 'Metaphor Program'?|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/05/why-are-spy-researchers-building-a-metaphor-program/239402/#slide1|newspaper=The Atlantic|date=May 25, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Metaphor Program Broad Agency Announcement|url=https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&mode=form&id=20ff241cdc2146dc147b4014730fc807&tab=core&_cview=0|publisher=IARPA|accessdate=May 20, 2011[/tpl]
