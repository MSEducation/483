Initially, the Tokugawa shogunate was interested in assuring a consistent value in minted copper coins; and this led to the perceived need for attending to the supply of copper.
This bakufu title identifies a regulatory agency with responsibility for supervising the minting of copper coins and for superintending all copper mines, copper mining and copper-extraction activities in Japan.Hall, John Wesley. (1955) Tanuma Okitsugu: Forerunner of Modern Japan, p. 201.
