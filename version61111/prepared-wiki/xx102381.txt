Barnstorm is the first album by Joe Walsh following his departure from the James Gang, released in October 1972 (see 1972 in music).  The core band on this album – Walsh, bassist Kenny Passarelli and drummer/multi-instrumentalist Joe Vitale – was also named Barnstorm. It was the first album to be recorded at Caribou Ranch in Colorado. 

==History==

With this album, Walsh and Barnstorm moved away from the hard rock sound of the James Gang and explored a more folk-based, acoustic sound, influenced by such artists as James Taylor and Crosby, Stills, and Nash.
Taking a cue from The Who's Pete Townshend, Walsh utilized the ARP Odyssey synthesizer to great effect on such songs as "Mother Says" and "Here We Go." Walsh also experimented with acoustic guitar, slide guitar, fuzzboxes and keyboards as well as running his guitar straight into a Leslie 122 to get swirly, organ-like guitar tones. The lone hard rock track on Barnstorm, "Turn To Stone," has become the best known song from the album, since Walsh later re-recorded it for his solo album So What.
At the time of its release, Barnstorm was only moderately successful. For years, the only CD version available was an expensive Japanese import. Nonetheless, the album became a cult classic among Walsh fans. It was reissued in the U.S. on CD by Hip-O Select/Geffen Records in January 2006.

==Reception==

Writing for Allmusic, critic Thom Jurek called the track "Birdcall Morning" a masterpiece and one of the greatest rock & roll love song of the early 70's. In his review, he wrote of the album "While it's true that Walsh established himself as a late-'60s/early-'70s guitar hero on the Gang's more boogie-oriented rock numbers, it's Walsh's love of lushly textured production and spacy, open-ended songs featuring both acoustic and electric guitars that is showcased here on this wildly adventurous and forgotten unqualified masterpiece... Walsh tips the scales one more time back to the mysterious in the acoustic guitar and harmonica moment "Comin' Down." It's another love song, which evokes the notion of the past as a way of creating a hopeful present. And it just whispers to a close, leaving the listener literally stunned at what has just transpired in the space of 35 minutes."
