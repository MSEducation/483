Winnie the Pooh is a comic strip based on the characters created by A.A. Milne in his 1920s books, which ran from June 19, 1978 until April 2, 1988.[ref]

Based on the Disney adaptations of the characters, the strip was written by Don Ferguson and drawn by Richard Moore, although the feature was usually billed as "by Disney."  To the established cast of characters, Ferguson and Moore added Sir Brian and the Dragon, inspired by characters from Milne's poetry.
The strip originally was syndicated by King Features. In recent years Creators Syndicate has offered reprints as part of a "classics" package.
