</ref>  Electromagnetic coils are used in [[electrical engineering]], in applications where [[electric current]]s interact with [[magnetic field]]s, in devices such as [[inductor]]s, [[electromagnet]]s, [[transformer]]s, and sensor coils.  Either an electric current is passed through the wire of the coil to generate a magnetic field,  or conversely an external ''time-varying'' magnetic field through the interior of the coil generates an [[Electromotive force|EMF]] ([[voltage]]) in the conductor.
A current through any conductor creates a circular magnetic field around the conductor due to Ampere's law.[ref]
