====Bachelor of Commerce====

The Bachelor of Commerce degree is designed to provide the student with a wide range of managerial skills while at the same time building competence in a particular area of business studies; see below.  Most universities therefore plan the degree such that additional to their major, students are exposed to general business principles, taking courses in accounting/finance, human resources, statistics, marketing, economics, and information systems. For a comparison with other degrees in business and management, see further under Bachelor's degree.

====Areas of study====

Depending on the institution, a formal academic major may or may not be established. Regardless, the Bachelor of Commerce requires students to take the majority of their courses in business-related subjects, namely the following and others depending on students' particular interests.

===Duration===

The curriculum generally lasts three years in Australia, New Zealand, India, Malta, South Africa, parts of Canada, Hong Kong and the United Kingdom. It requires four years in the Republic of Ireland, the majority of Canada, Ghana, Philippines and the Netherlands. In South Africa, and some universities in India, the BCom (Hons) is considered an additional postgraduate qualification, whereas in Malta, the additional year is not considered as a postgraduate qualification. In Pakistan, http://pu.edu.pk/home/department/22/Hailey-College-of-Commerce the BCom is of two-years, the BCom (Hons) of three-years; while a four-year program is known as BS (Hons) Commerce.

==Further study==

BCom graduates often undertake the Master of Commerce, or other post-graduate masters programs such as the Master of Finance (MFin), Master of Accounting (MAcc), Master in Business Administration (MBA). 
The degree - with appropriate courses - is usually recognised by the various professional accounting bodies, and graduates often therefore pursue accounting designations such as the Chartered Accountant (CA), Certified Public Accountant (CPA), Certified Management Accountant (CMA) or Certified General Accountant (CGA). 
Graduates also commonly pursue professional certifications such as the CFA, CIM and PMP.

==History==

The Bachelor of Commerce degree was first offered at the University of Birmingham. The University's School of Commerce was founded by William Ashley, an Englishman from Oxford University, who was the first Professor of Political Economy and Constitutional History in the Faculty of Arts of the University of Toronto. Ashley left Toronto in 1892, spent a few years at Harvard University and then went back to England to the new University of Birmingham where he founded the School of Commerce and began the program - the forerunner of many BCom degree programs throughout the British Empire. Eighteenth-century economists had divided the English economy into three sectors: agriculture, manufacturing, and commerce. Commerce included the transportation, marketing, and financing of goods. The Birmingham program included economic geography, economic history, general economics, modern languages, and accountancy.
