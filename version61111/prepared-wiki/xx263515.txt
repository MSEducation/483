==Reception==

The Allmusic review by Jason Ankeny awarded the album four and a half stars and said the album is an "intoxicating mosaic of jazz, pop, and Latin elements...stands as a monumental testament to Riddle's consummate skill as an arranger and his almost alchemical faculty for creating a seamless whole from disparate parts".[tpl]cite web|last=Ankeny|first=Jason|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=communication-r739991|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|publisher=Allmusic|title=Communication|accessdate=January 2, 2011[/tpl]
