The Powderhorn is an important watershed for the Gunnison River. The area protects the East, Middle, and West forks of Powderhorn Creek which flows north directly to the Gunnison River. Calf Creek, which is on National Forest land flows south and eventually joins the Lake Fork River that also flows into the Gunnison via Lake City. Within the area there are numerous small lakes and beaver ponds. The largest of these are Devil's Lake and Powderhorn Lake.
Much of the area sits above timberline at [tpl]convert|12000|ft|m[/tpl] and it is recognized as one of the largest expanses of tundra in the continental United States. The lower portions of the area are characterized by large stands of ponderosa pine and groves of aspen and sagebrush.
In the area's southwest corner is Cannibal Plateau where Alferd Packer and his party became lost in the winter of 1874. Packer ate his four companions to survive.[tpl]cite book |first=Mark |last=Pearson |year=2001 |title=Colorado's Canyon Country: A Guide to Hiking and Floating BLM Wildlands |location=Englewood, CO |publisher=Westcliffe Publishers |isbn=1565793870[/tpl]
