==Church==

The Roman Catholic Church of Saint Lukas the Evangelist, with retarding late-classicist and romantic elements, was built in 1872. Even up until 1911, the church was not consecrated. The chronostikon on the tower says that the building was restored in 1983. It is a one-ship building with a narrow closure of Presbyterium, a tower built in the shield frontispiece and built out sacristy. In the 1960s, the ceilings and vaults were completed with painted murals. Above the entry to the ship, there is an organ chorus held by two cast-iron pillars and a forged rail. On the main altar there is a painting of Saint Lukas from 1873, and on the sides there are statues of Jesus's and Mary's hearts. The side altar of the Lurd Panna Maria and the pulpit with a baldachin and window, sill with relief decoration, all date from when the church was built. In 1875, Pavol Szabo gave the church the font of red marble. There is also a red wooden relief of Pieta, and a wooden cross with the corpus here. The parish acquired its first organ in 1873 with donations from parishioners, while the current organ, dating from 1896, came from the donations from the people of Dulovce living in America.
