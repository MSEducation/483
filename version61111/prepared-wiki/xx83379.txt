CATEGORIES: Dinghies

The Flying Scot is a day sailer dinghy used for pleasure sailing as well as racing throughout North America.  The Flying Scot was designed in 1957 by Gordon K. (Sandy) Douglass who had already designed the Thistle and Highlander dinghies.  It is manufactured by Flying Scot Inc. based in the western Maryland town of Deer Park.http://www.flyingscot.com/contact.html
The Flying  Scot is noted for ease of handling and durability, and has been a popular choice of individual owners, sailing schools, and rental operators since its introduction. A highly popular design, about 6000 Flying Scots have been built, and it has been included as a Sailing Hall of Fame Design. Based in Maryland its manufacturer is Flying Scot Inc., originally the Gordon  Douglass  Boat Company.
The hull design of the Flying Scot makes it able to plane in winds of 15 knots or more, exceeding the waterline hull speed.
Races are held throughout the year in the USA and Canada by the Flying Scot Sailing Association and its local fleets.  As a one-design, all Flying Scot boats are built to the same specifications and thus have equal chances in winning a race, no matter when the boat was built. This makes the boats especially appealing to amateur racing associations since this type of construction strives to eliminate variables other than the skill of the crew. The Flying Scot was inducted into the American Sailboat Hall of Fame in 1998.
The Flying Scot Association says, "The Scot's performance offers thrills to even the experienced sailor and provides for tight, competitive racing. There are more than 100 fleets racing Flying Scots in the USA and Canada. The Scot is normally raced with a crew of two or three, but can be single handed as well.   It can also carry as many as eight adults. The sail plan consists of main, jib and spinnaker. Simple rigging and uniform construction fosters tactical racing."
