==Club career==

Šimić started his senior footballing career in his native Croatia, playing for his local club H.N.K. Rijeka.[tpl]Cite web|publisher=1HNL.net|title=Zdravko Šimić|url=http://www.1hnl.net/igrac.php?id=973|accessdate=2008-12-29[/tpl]
He then moved to N.K. Pomorac where he became a more regular feature in the team's setup, helping them to win promotion to the Prva HNL (Croatian First Football League) in 2002.
In 2005, he was sold to then-Malaysian Super League club Sabah FA, where he could not help his club to avoid relegation, and in 2006, he returned home to Croatia to play for N.K. Draga.
Within two years, Šimić was on his way back to Southeast Asia, this time to Singapore where he is currently playing for Sengkang Punggol as a midfielder and its captain.
On 21 May 2008, Šimić scored his first goal for Sengkang against the Young Lions in dramatic fashion. He stepped up to take a penalty kick, subsequently blasting his effort over the bar, but the referee, Sukhbir Singh, ruled that the Cubs' defenders had stepped into the box before the kick was taken, and called for a retake. Šimić then scored from the spot on his second try. It was his first goal in the S.League, as well as Sengkang's first win in the season since it began.

==International career==

Šimić had a short stint playing for the Under-15, Under-17 and Under-19 teams of the Croatian National Team. There, he played alongside current Croatian National Team stars Igor Tudor (Hajduk Split) and Dario Šimić (AS Monaco).
