Flatbush is a community which consists of several neighborhoods in the New York City borough of Brooklyn.
The name Flatbush is an Anglicization of the Dutch language Vlacke bos (vlacke = vlak = flat; "flat woodland" or "wooded plain"),[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nycgovparks.org/sub_your_park/historical_signs/hs_historical_sign.php?id=11822|title=Flatbush Malls|publisher=NYC Dept. of Parks & Recreation|date=December 12, 2001|accessdate=May 29, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prospectpark.org/history_nature/historic_places/h_lefferts|title=Lefferts Historic House|publisher=Prospect Park Alliance|accessdate=May 29, 2009[/tpl] so named from woods that grew on the flat country.[tpl]cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9V1IAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA126#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States | publisher=Govt.

The Flatbush community has been receiving an influx of immigrants from the Caribbean (West Indies), mostly from Haiti, Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica, Grenada, Guyana, Barbados, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Dominica, Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis and Belize,[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2008[/tpl] since the 1980s, as well as immigrants from South Asia, primarily India, Pakistan and Bangladesh and African countries like Ghana, Zimbabwe, Nigeria, and Kenya. Haitians are the largest ethnic group in Flatbush.  Prior to the arrival of these groups, the Flatbush community had already been diverse, with many Italians, African-Americans and Jews. Flatbush is patrolled by the NYPD's 67th and 70th Precincts.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/precincts/precinct_070.shtml |title=70th Precinct, NYPD |publisher=Nyc.gov |date= |accessdate=January 27, 2011[/tpl]67th Precinct, NYPD.

==History==

===Pre-1900===

Flatbush was originally chartered as the Dutch Nieuw Nederland colony town of Midwout in 1651. Both names were used in the Dutch era, and Midwood was an alternative name for Flatbush into the early 20th century. In a reversal, Midwood, now the area immediately south of Brooklyn College, is often alternatively called "Flatbush,"[tpl]Cite web|url = http://urbanography.com/urban/0006/vita3.htm|title = When the Dream Was Made|year = 2000|accessdate = Sep 3, 2013|website = Urbanography|last = Matus|first = Irvin Leigh|quote = the Vitagraph Studio lot in Brooklyn, located adjacent to the Brighton railroad, in what is now Midwood, called South Greenfield at the time: William Shea, among the first actors in the Big V's stock company, recalled the Brighton's role after filming began in 1905: After the building of the Flatbush studio, interior scenes were taken at the Nassau Street address and exterior scenes at Flatbush. In a picture that had both interior and exterior scenes it was a case of collecting all necessary wardrobe and props and moving to Flatbush. It must have been a sight to see fifteen or twenty people get off a train, some carrying bundles and boxes with a sword or spear sticking out, a little bit of a fellow struggling along with a suit of armor, and various other bulky properties distributed among members of the party, but it was part of the game. Very few of the actors kicked and the populace became used to seeing us doing all kinds of stunts.[/tpl] especially among Orthodox Jews. Midwood's residents predominately feature a mix of the latter and Irish Americans.
Flatbush and the five other towns of what was to become Kings County, were surrendered to the English in 1664. The town was the county seat for Kings County and was a center of life for what we now call Brooklyn. The compact center of the village of Flatbush was at the intersection of what are now Flatbush and Church avenues, where we still find an old Dutch Reformed Church and Erasmus Hall, the oldest high school in New York City.
Flatbush played a key role in the American Revolution.  Flatbush was nearby where significant skirmishes and battles of the Battle of Long Island took place. As Kings County was settled largely by the Dutch, and as the Dutch were prominent in the slave trade, the area was somewhat sympathetic to the British side of the American Revolutionary War at the beginning of the conflict.  Kings County at the time had the highest concentration of slaves north of the Mason-Dixon Line, and when a Loyalist Governor of Virginia supported freedom for slaves who supported and fought on the British side, landowners in Brooklyn were concerned that a full conflict between the Colonies and the British would result in loss of their critical source of labor.The Ordeal of Kings County by Edwin G. Burrows as part of Tiedemann and Fingerhut (editors) The Other New York: The American Revolution Beyond New York City 2005 Loyalist residents of Flatbush included David Mathews, Mayor of New York City, who lived at what is now the intersection of Flatbush and Parkside avenues.Vanderbilt, Gertrude Lefferts  The Social History of Flatbush, and Manners and Customs of the Dutch Settlers of Kings County D. Appleton & Company, 1881
The influence of Dutch merchant and farming families remained strong in the area until after consolidation into the City of Greater New York in 1898, after which the development of Flatbush as a suburb, and then an integral part of the larger city, proceeded apace.
Before it was incorporated into the City of Brooklyn in 1894, Flatbush described both the Town of Flatbush, incorporating a large swath of central Kings County extending east to the Queens County border, and the Village of Flatbush, formerly the heart of the current community. Many of the remaining early Dutch structures are in the Flatlands and Marine Park neighborhoods.

===Post-1900===

In the first half of the 20th century, Flatbush had a sizable population of Irish-Americans, Italian-Americans and Jews. Much as it is today, it was a working-class neighborhood. A vast portion of Flatbush residents closely followed the Brooklyn Dodgers, which at the time were not only the team of Brooklyn but also of Flatbush in particular. Duke Snider was known as “the Duke of Flatbush”. By 1958, however, the Dodgers left Brooklyn, and Ebbets Field eventually was torn down. Due to shifting neighborhood boundaries, Ebbets Field today technically would be in Crown Heights, as the ballpark was located just north of Empire Boulevard.
During the 1970s and early 1980s, Flatbush experienced a shift in demographics as it went from being a mostly White, Irish, Italian and Jewish community to a mostly Black, West Indian community. While most sections of Flatbush were working class before the demographic shift, there were a few affluent areas. Prospect Park South had a sizable number of more affluent homeowners, and more than a few doctors resided on a stretch of Parkside Avenue immediately adjacent to Prospect Park.  By the mid-1980s, however, there were a number of abandoned or semi-abandoned buildings in the community, with a number of apartment houses falling into a state of disrepair. Many of the affluent residents left Flatbush and were replaced by lower income residents. While crime generally had always been a problem in the community (e.g., a number of stores on Flatbush and Church Avenues were looted during the 1977 blackout), a drug epidemic ravaged Flatbush during the 1980s and early 1990s. The area around the Parade Grounds was particularly notorious for drug turf wars and shootouts. Street gangs also were prevalent in Flatbush. Columbia Pictures shot some of the 1974 film The Lords of Flatbush here, and CBS aired a short-lived sitcom in 1979, Flatbush, based somewhat on The Lords of Flatbush, but set in contemporary times.

===Flatbush today===

While Flatbush today is predominantly African American and West Indian, there are sizable numbers of Caucasians, Latinos and Indian Americans living within its borders.  While a majority of residents are working class, there also are middle-class and wealthier residents who call Flatbush home. The primary commercial strips are Flatbush, Church, and Nostrand Avenues, with Coney Island Avenue also emerging as a major strip. One can find Caribbean, Soul food, Chinese, Mexican and South Asian restaurants.  Most of the businesses are small, with some larger businesses also present, such as Old Navy, Rite-Aid, Stop & Shop, Staples, GameStop, and Target.
Flatbush housing varies in character. It generally features apartment buildings, though some rowhouses also are present.  Victorian-style (albeit older) housing can be found in Prospect Park South, and brownstones are in Prospect-Lefferts Gardens.

==General vicinity==

===Notable institutions===

Well-known institutions within Flatbush include Erasmus Hall High School, the Parade Grounds, the Flatbush Dutch Reformed Church, Brooklyn College, and Ebbets Field (demolished in 1960), the last Brooklyn home of the Brooklyn Dodgers baseball team, as well as Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin and the Mirrer Yeshiva. Due to imprecisely defined, shifting boundaries, the Ebbets Field site would be considered today by some to be in Crown Heights.

===Location and neighborhoods===

Flatbush includes the southernmost portion of Prospect Park.
The neighborhoods of Flatbush extend south from the old Brooklyn City Line north of the southern edges of Prospect Park, the Brooklyn Botanic Garden and Empire Boulevard.  The southern border of Flatbush neighborhoods is approximately on the line of the Long Island Rail Road's Bay Ridge Branch, which runs to the south of Avenue H, the campus of Brooklyn College, and "The Junction" where Flatbush and Nostrand Avenues intersect. Flatbush's eastern border is roughly around New York Avenue, while its western border is Coney Island Avenue.
Neighborhoods within Flatbush include the planned communities of Prospect Park South, the Beverley Squares (Beverley Square East and Beverley Square West), Prospect-Lefferts Gardens, Ditmas Park, Fiske Terrace and Albemarle-Kenmore Terrace.  Bordering Flatbush on the north are the community of Crown Heights and the former neighborhood of Pigtown. On the east, within the old town of Flatbush, is East Flatbush, on the west are Kensington and Parkville (formerly Greenfield), and on the south is Midwood.  Many consider Midwood to be a part of Flatbush, but historically it was part of the neighboring former towns of New Utrecht, Gravesend and Flatlands.

==Transportation==

Flatbush is well served by public transportation. The BMT Brighton Line ([tpl]NYCS trains|Brighton[/tpl]) has a number of stops within the community. The stretch of stations from Prospect Park to Avenue H is in Flatbush. Service to Manhattan can take as little as half an hour. All stations of the IRT Nostrand Avenue Line ([tpl]NYCS trains|Nostrand[/tpl]) are also within Flatbush, including the Flatbush Avenue – Brooklyn College station, currently the southern terminal of the line. This stop is about one block west of Brooklyn College and one block north of the Junction Mall.[tpl]cite web|url=http://outside.in/places/flatbush-junction-mall-brooklyn |title=Flatbush Junction Mall site |publisher=Outside.in |date= |accessdate=January 27, 2011[/tpl]
Several bus routes run through Flatbush. The B6, B8, B35, B41, B44 and B49 are major routes that serve the neighborhood. Some of these lines have limited-stop runs. The B23 was discontinued in 2010. The Q35 connects Flatbush with Rockaway Beach, while the B103 provides a relatively rapid limited-stop connection from Canarsie and Flatbush to Downtown Brooklyn.

==Education==

In addition to a number of elementary and intermediate schools, Flatbush has one high school within its borders. Erasmus Hall High School, located near the intersection of Flatbush and Church Avenues, is one of the oldest high schools in the city. With its relatively unique architecture and long list of famous alumni, Erasmus Hall has been a mainstay in Flatbush for centuries.
Additionally, Flatbush shares Brooklyn College with Midwood. While located in what traditionally has been considered Midwood, shifting neighborhood boundaries have caused at least part of the institution to be located in Flatbush. Brooklyn College is a member of the CUNY system.
