The Baltimore County Sheriff's Office (BCoSO) is the enforcement arm of the Baltimore County, Maryland court and is headquartered in the Baltimore County Courthouse, in the County Seat of  Towson, Maryland. The Baltimore County Sheriff's Office is one of the oldest sheriff's offices in existence in the State of Maryland, dating back to 1659, the traditional year of the County's "erection" (founding). 

==Patch Description==

The agency's uniform shoulder patch depicts two Maryland Militiamen, who also happened to be  Baltimore County Deputy Sheriffs who were killed during the British land and sea attack at the Battle of North Point on September 12, 1814, in the War of 1812 (later celebrated as a state, county, and city holiday as "Defenders' Day" - simultaneous with the bombardment of Fort McHenry from the Patapsco River on September 13-14th, and the inspiration for the writing of the National Anthem, "The Star-Spangled Banner" by Francis Scott Key, 1779-1843). Henry Wells and Richard McComas have historically been given credit for shooting and killing the commanding British General Robert Ross and were later both killed in the following skirmish and battle. A memorial known as the "Wells-McComas Monument" to the two fallen Militia Soldiers/Deputies is located on North Gay Street by the intersecting Aisquith and Orleans Streets in "Ashland Square" in East Baltimore City, where they were buried beneath after being exhumed in the 1870s from their original grave site and moved with great ceremony and publicity to Ashland Square.  A smaller memorial where the two Deputies/Militiamen and nearby General Ross were killed is located on Old Battle Grove Road in Dundalk near "Battle Acre", the small, one-acre park donated to the State in 1839 marking the center of the North Point Battlefield off Old North Point Road and German Hill Road, from September 12th, 1814. Large stone base signs with historical markers noting the "Battle of North Point" and "War of 1812" sites are also erected north and south of the battlefield area in the median strip of the Baltimore Beltway, (Interstate 695) by the Maryland Department of Transportation's State Highway Administration that were placed through the efforts in 2004 of various local historical preservation-minded citizens and the Dundalk-Patapsco Neck Historical Society.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2008[/tpl]
