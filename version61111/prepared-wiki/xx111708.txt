==History==

Originally, Tihar was a maximum security prison run by the State of Punjab.  In 1966 control was transferred to the National Capital Territory of Delhi.  Beginning in 1984, additional facilities were constructed, and the complex became Tihar Prison.
Under the charge of Kiran Bedi, when she was Inspector General of Prisons, she instituted a number of prison reforms at Tihar, including changing its name to Tihar Ashram. She also instituted a Vipassana meditation program for both staff and inmates; initial classes were taught by S. N. Goenka. The Prison has also produced an inmate who has passed the Indian Administrative Service civil service examinations.Relief to Tihar inmate after he makes it to IAS   The Hindu, 11 February 2009
