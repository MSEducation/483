==History==

In 1972 the state owned National Bus Company decided to bring together the scheduled coach services operated by its bus operating companies under one brand. Initially branded as National, the National Express brand was first used in 1974.National Express Group: Our History National ExpressNational Express Group PLC and Saltire Holdings Ltd Monopolies and Mergers Commission February 1994 page 3 The National Express network was largely a branding exercise, with services continuing to be operated by the individual companies.
With the privatisation of the National Bus Company in the 1980s, National Express was subject to a management buyout in March 1988. The management team began to diversify, and in 1989 purchased Crosville WalesArriva Buses Wales history Arriva but its financial performance began to deteriorate from early 1990. A new management team took over the company in July 1991, with the backing of development and venture capital investors. The new team refocused the group on its core activities and sold Crosville Wales to British Bus.Competition Commission report 1996 paragraphs 3.5 to 3.7 In October 1991 it purchased Speedlink, an operator of coach services between Gatwick and Heathrow Airports. In December 1992 National Express Group plc was floated on the London Stock Exchange. The prospectus stated the objectives of the company were to refocus and improve the profitability of the core coach business, to develop new products and services within its existing operations, and to acquire new businesses in the passenger transport market.

===Default on East Coast rail franchise===

On 1 July 2009, the Department for Transport announced that it would take the National Express East Coast franchise into public ownership at the end of the year after National Express announced it would not invest any further funds into the franchise, effectively declaring it planned on defaulting.[tpl]cite news | title=£30bn shortfall threatens rail and road plans | url=http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/jul/01/transport-east-coast-mainline-nationalised | work= | publisher=The Guardian | date=1 July 2009 | accessdate=1 July 2009 | location=London | first=Dan | last=Milmo[/tpl] Further controversy ensued when, on 27 July 2009, the Commons Transport Committee said that ministers should consider operating the East Coast Main Line as a public railway after National Express announced they would walk away.[tpl]cite web | title=East coast rail link to London should stay in state hands – MPs | url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/scotland/top-stories/east-coast-rail-link-to-london-should-stay-in-state-hands-mps-1-761870 | work= | publisher=The Scotsman | date=27 July 2009 | accessdate=27 July 2009[/tpl] Directly Operated Railways took over the East Coast franchise on 14 November 2009.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/8343769.stm|title=East Coast rail change confirmed|date=5 November 2009|accessdate=5 November 2009|publisher=BBC News Online[/tpl] Also in November 2009 the government announced that National Express East Anglia would not be granted a three-year extension that it had otherwise qualified for, because of the East Coast default.National Express loses East Anglia franchise three years early The Telegraph 26 November 2009

===Operational safety concerns===

On 3 January 2007 a speeding National Express coach overturned on the M4/M25 slip road, leaving three passengers dead. The driver was jailed for five years.
In July 2009, a junior transport minister, the Gillingham MP Paul Clark, spelt out a series of concerns to National Express in a letter following a meeting with an employee of National Express East Coast who lives in his constituency. The worker claimed that due to reduced maintenance checks, some trains were in use with defective brakes, an allegation strongly denied by the company, which said it would "never compromise on safety". He wrote: "As a result of reduced maintenance checks, 'some long-haul sets trains are in use with brake defects'. Increasing cuts in staff combined with an increasing pressure to ensure that trains run safely has resulted in fears among staff that a major accident is 'just around the corner'." Passengers, he added, "have been 'poisoned' as a result of coffee machines not being cleaned correctly, with cleaning fluids left in situ". The minister said he was "shocked and appalled at the information with which I've been provided. You will understand that these allegations are exceptionally serious".[tpl]cite news | title=National Express's east coast line is 'an accident waiting to happen' | url=http://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jul/06/national-express-safety-warning | work= | publisher=The Guardian | date=27 July 2009 | accessdate=27 July 2009 | location=London | first=David | last=Teather[/tpl]
School bus drivers in the US have raised concerns about the safety of the buses run by Durham, a subsidiary of National Express and the second largest operator of school bus services in North America. According to representatives of Durham bus drivers, fluid leaks, tires that need to be replaced, black mold and non-functional emergency equipment are regular concerns, whilst workers continued to operate buses while sick because they cannot afford to miss a day of work and drivers are not paid for all the time they work.

===Offers for the company===

With the company's finances under stress largely as a result of having overbid for the National Express East Coast rail franchise, National Express became a takeover target in 2009.
