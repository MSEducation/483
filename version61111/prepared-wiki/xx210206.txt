Radovan Karadžić ([tpl]lang-sr|Радован Караџић[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-sh|râdovaːn kârad͡ʒit͡ɕ|pron[/tpl]; born 19 June 1945) is a former Bosnian Serb politician. During the breakup of Yugoslavia, Karadžić, as President of the Republika Srpska, sought the direct unification of that entity with Serbia.Daily report: East Europe, Issues 191-210. Front Cover United States. Foreign Broadcast Information Service. Pp. 38. (A recorded conversation between Branko Kostic and Srpska's President Radovan Karadzic, Kostic asks whether Karadzic wants Srpska to be an autonomous federal unit in federation with Serbia, Karadzic responds by saying that he wants complete unification of Srpska with Serbia as a unitary state similar to France.) He is detained in the United Nations Detention Unit of Scheveningen, accused of war crimes committed against Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian Croats during the Siege of Sarajevo, as well as ordering the Srebrenica massacre.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/kar-ai000428e.htm|title=THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL TRIBUNAL FOR THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA THE PROSECUTOR OF THE TRIBUNAL AGAINST RADOVAN KARADZIC AMENDED INDICTMENT|publisher=UN|accessdate=13 September 2010|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080209130506/http://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/kar-ai000428e.htm|archivedate=9 February 2008[/tpl]
Educated as a psychiatrist, he co-founded the Serbian Democratic Party in Bosnia and Herzegovina and was the first President of Republika Srpska from 1992 to 1996.

==Early life==

Radovan Karadžić was born in Petnjica near Šavnik in PR Montenegro, Yugoslavia, to a family hailing from the Drobnjaci Serb clan. His father Vuko had been a member of the Chetniks—the army of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia's government-in-exile during World War II—and was imprisoned by the post-war communist regime for much of his son's childhood. Radovan Karadžić moved to Sarajevo in 1960 to study psychiatry at the Sarajevo University School of Medicine.
He studied neurotic disorders and depression at Næstved Hospital in Denmark in 1970, and during 1974 and 1975 he underwent further medical training at Columbia University in New York.[ref]

He also became a poet and was  influenced by Serbian writer Dobrica Ćosić, who encouraged him to go into politics. Karadžić flirted with Bosnia's Green Party. During his spell as an ecologist, he declared that "Bolshevism is bad, but nationalism is even worse".
==Financial misdeeds== 
Soon after graduation, Karadžić started working in a treatment centre at the psychiatric clinic of the main Sarajevo hospital, Koševo. According to testimony, he often supplemented his income by issuing fake medical and psychological evaluations to healthcare workers who wanted early retirement or to criminals who tried to avoid punishment by pleading insanity.[tpl]cite book |author=Sudetic, Chuck |title=Blood and Vengeance: One Family's Story of the War in Bosnia |year=1999 |location=New York |publisher=Penguin Books[/tpl] In 1983, Karadžić started working at a hospital in the Belgrade suburb of Voždovac. With his partner Momčilo Krajišnik, then manager of a mining enterprise Energoinvest, he managed to get a loan from an agricultural-development fund and they used it to build themselves houses in Pale, a Serb-populated village above Sarajevo turned into a ski resort by the Communist establishment.
On 1 November 1984 the two were arrested for fraud and spent 11 months in detention before their friend Nikola Koljević managed to bail them out.[tpl]cite book|author=Judah, Tim|title=The Serbs: History, Myth and the Destruction of Yugoslavia|year=1997|location=New Haven and London|publisher=Yale University Press[/tpl] For lack of evidence, Karadžić was released and his trial was brought to a halt. The trial was revived and on 26 September 1985 Karadžić was sentenced to three years in prison for embezzlement and fraud. As he had already spent over a year in detention, Karadžić did not serve the remaining sentence in prison.[tpl]cite web|accessdate=22 July 2008|url=http://www.politika.rs/rubrike/Hronika/Uhapshen-Radovan-Karadzic.sr.html|title=Radovan Karadžić captured|publisher=Serbian newspaper Politika[/tpl]

==Political life==

Following encouragement from Dobrica Ćosić, later the first president of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and Jovan Rašković, the Croatian Serb leader, he cofounded the Serbian Democratic Party ([tpl]lang|sr-Latn|Srpska Demokratska Stranka[/tpl]) in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1989. This aimed at gathering the Republic's Bosnian Serb community and joining Croatian Serbs in leading them in staying part of Yugoslavia in the event of secession by those two republics from the federation. [tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl]
Throughout September 1991, the SDS began to establish various "Serb Autonomous Regions" throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina. After the Bosnian parliament voted on sovereignty on 15 October 1991, a separate Serb Assembly was founded on 24 October 1991, in order to exclusively represent the Serbs in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The following month, Bosnian Serbs held a referendum which resulted in an overwhelming vote in favour of staying in a federal state with Serbia and Montenegro, as part of Yugoslavia. In December 1991, a top secret document entitled ‘For the organisation and activity of organs of the Serbs people in Bosnia-Herzegovina in extraordinary circumstances’ was drawn up by the SDS leadership. This was a centralised programme for the takeover of each municipality in the country, through the creation of shadow governments and para-governmental structures through various "crisis headquarters", and by preparing loyal Serbs for the takeover in co-ordination with the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA).[tpl]cite book|last=Gow|first=James|title=The Serbian Project and Its Aversaries: A Strategy of War Crimes|year=2003|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|location=Montreal|isbn=1850654999|pages=122-123[/tpl]  
On 9 January 1992, the Bosnian Serb Assembly proclaimed the Republic of the Serb people of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Република српског народа Босне и Херцеговине/Republika srpskog naroda Bosne i Hercegovine). On 28 February 1992, the constitution of the Serb Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina was adopted and declared that the state's territory included Serb autonomous regions, municipalities, and other Serbian ethnic entities in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as "all regions in which the Serbian people represent a minority due to the Second World War genocide", although how this was established was never specified, and it was declared to be a part of the federal Yugoslav state. [tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl]
On 29 February and 1 March 1992 a referendum on the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina from Yugoslavia was held. Many Serbs boycotted the referendum while Bosniaks and Croats and pro-secession Serbs turned out, and 64% of eligible voters voted 98% in favor of independence.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2010[/tpl]

===President of Republika Srpska===

On 6 April 1992, Bosnia was recognized by the United Nations as an independent state. [tpl]Reference necessary|text=Karadžić declared the independent Serbian Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina|date=May 2011[/tpl], renamed Republika Srpska a few months later. Karadžić was voted President of this Bosnian Serb administration in Pale on about 13 May 1992 after the breakup of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. At the time he assumed this position, his de jure powers, as described in the constitution of the Bosnian Serb administration, included commanding the army of the Bosnian Serb administration in times of war and peace, and having the authority to appoint, promote and discharge officers of the army. Karadžić made three trips to the UN in New York in February and March 1993 for negotiations on the future of Bosnia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/diana/karadzic/3junea.htm|title=Doe v.

He went to Moscow in 1994 for meetings with Russian officials on the Bosnian situation.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/karadzic-arrest-hailed-as-step-towards-serbia-eu-membership/2008/07/22/1216492402328.html|title=Karadzic arrest hailed as step towards Serbia EU membership|accessdate=25 July 2008|work=Sydney Morning Herald | date=22 July 2008[/tpl] In 1994, the Greek Orthodox Church declared Karadžić as "one of the most prominent sons of our Lord Jesus Christ working for peace" and decorated him with the nine-hundred-year-old Knights' Order of the First Rank of Saint Dionysius of Xanthe.[tpl]cite book|first=Mitja|last=Velikonja|title=Religious separation and political intolerance in Bosnia-Herzegovina|publisher=Texas A&M University Press|year=2003|location=College Station|isbn=978-1-58544-226-3|page=265[/tpl] Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew announced that "the Serbian people have been chosen by God to protect the western frontiers of Orthodoxy".
On Friday, 4 August 1995, with a massive Croatian military force poised to attack the Serb-held Krajina region in central Croatia, Karadžić announced he was removing General Ratko Mladić from his commandant post and assuming personal command of the VRS himself. Karadžić blamed Mladić for the loss of two key Serb towns in western Bosnia that had recently fallen to the Croats, and he used the loss of the towns as the excuse to announce his surprise command structure changes. General Mladić was demoted to an "adviser". Mladić refused to go quietly, claiming the support of the Bosnian Serb military and the people. Karadžić countered by attempting to pull political rank as well as denouncing Mladić as a "madman", but Mladić's popular support forced Karadžić to rescind his order on 11 August.

===War crimes charges===

Karadžić is accused by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) of personal and command responsibility for numerous war crimes committed against non-Serbs, in his roles as Supreme Commander of the Bosnian Serb armed forces and President of the National Security Council of the Republika Srpska. He is accused by the same authority of being responsible for the deaths of more than 7,500 Muslims. Under his direction and command, Bosnian Serb forces initiated the Siege of Sarajevo. He is accused by the ICTY of ordering the Srebrenica genocide in 1995, directing Bosnian Serb forces to "create an unbearable situation of total insecurity with no hope of further survival of life" in the UN safe area. In addition, he is accused by the ICTY of ordering that United Nations personnel be taken hostage in May–June 1995.
He was jointly indicted by the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in 1995, along with General Ratko Mladić. The indictment charges Karadžić on the basis of his individual criminal responsibility (Article 7(1) of the Statute) and superior criminal responsibility (Article 7(3) of the Statute) with:
The United States government offered a $5 million reward for his and Ratko Mladić's arrests.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rewardsforjustice.net/english/index.cfm?page=Karadzic|title=Rewards for Justice[/tpl]

===Ongoing Bosnian Genocide Trial===

Currently, former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadžić and Ratko Mladić are both on trial on two counts of genocide and other war crimes committed in Srebrenica, Prijedor, Ključ, and other districts of Bosnia. Karadžić and Mladić are charged, separately, with:
The Yugoslav war crimes court rejected on 27 June 2012 one of the two genocide charges against Karadžić.Prosecutor's Marked-up Indictment, ICTY Case No. IT-95-5/18-PT THE PROSECUTOR v RADOVAN KARADZIC, 19 October 2009.

==Fugitive==

Authorities missed arresting Karadžić in 1995, when he was an invitee of the United Nations. During his visit to the United Nations in 1993, he was handed a service of process for a civil claim under the Alien Tort Act. The Courts ruled that Karadžić was properly served and the trial was allowed to proceed in United States District Court.Kadić v. Karadžić, 70 F.3d 232 (2d Cir. 1995)

===Allegedly evading capture in Austria===

There have been reports that Radovan Karadžić evaded capture in May 2007 in Vienna, Austria, where he lived under the name Petar Glumac, posing as a Croatian seller of herbal solutions and ointments. Austrian police talked to him during the raid regarding an unrelated homicide case in the area where Karadžić lived but failed to recognize his real identity. He had a Croatian passport under the name Petar Glumac and claimed to be in Vienna for training.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.apa.at/cms/site/news_item.html?channel=CH0069&doc=CMS1217014246968|title=Karadzic nannte sich "Peter Schauspieler"|accessdate=26 July 2008|publisher=Austria Press Agency[/tpl] The police did not ask any further questions nor demanded to fingerprint him as he appeared calm and readily answered questions.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSL543550020080725?pageNumber=1&virtualBrandChannel=0|title=Karadzic escaped arrest in Austria last year|accessdate=26 July 2008|publisher=Reuters|first=Boris|last=Groendahl|date=25 July 2008[/tpl] Nevertheless, this claim has come into doubt ever since a man named Petar Glumac, an alternative medical practitioner from Novo Selo, Serbia, claims to have been the person the police talked with in Vienna. Glumac bears a striking resemblance to Karadžić's identity as Dragan Dabić.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.euronews.net/en/article/28/07/2008/radovan-karadzic-may-not-have-been-in-vienna|title=Radovan Karadzic may not have been in Vienna|publisher=EuroNews[/tpl] On the other hand his nephew, Dragan Karadžić, has claimed in an interview to the Corriere della Sera that Radovan Karadžić attended football matches of Serie A and that he visited Venice under the false identity of Petar Glumac.

===Arrest and trial===

The arrest of Radovan Karadžić took place on 21 July 2008 in Belgrade. He was in hiding, posing as a doctor of alternative medicine mostly in Belgrade but also in Vienna, Austria.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.wtop.com/?nid=383&sid=1444312|title=Karadzic interviewed about details of his arrest|accessdate=26 July 2008|agency=Associated Press[/tpl] The reward money for his arrest was allegedly never claimed; however, it is rumored that Karadžić was arrested by locals who came to find out his identity and simply claimed the cash. This would explain how the Serbian government claims that its police (MUP) had nothing to do with the arrest. Karadžić was transferred into ICTY custody in the Hague on 30 July.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/110336/Karadzic-being-held-in-same-jail-as-Milosevic-was gmanews.tv/story |title= Karadzic being held in same jail as Milosevic was |publisher=gmanews.tv[/tpl] Karadžić appeared before Judge Alphons Orie on 31 July, in the tribunal, which has sentenced 64 accused since 1993.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.icty.org/sid/24 |title=ICTY -TPIY: Key Figures |publisher=ICTY, [/tpl] During the first hearing Radovan Karadžić expressed a fear for his life by saying: "If Holbrooke wants my death and regrets there is no death sentence at this court, I want to know if his arm is long enough to reach me here."[tpl]cite news|author=Post Store |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/31/AR2008073100363.html?hpid=moreheadlines |title=Karadzic appears at UN court |work=Washington Post |date= 1 August 2008|accessdate=20 December 2010[/tpl] and stated that the deal he made with Richard Holbrooke is the reason why it took 13 years for him to appear in front of the ICTY.[tpl]cite web|author=(AFP) – 1 August 2008 |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gZy0ZegDYcy8yLg1vT7wnZjJcRvw |title=Holbrooke promised no ICTY trial: Karadzic |publisher=Google  |date=1 August 2008 |accessdate=20 December 2010[/tpl] He also made similar accusations against the former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.[tpl]cite news|agency=AFP |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hDjfrs7G6ubbn16kfGGmiJuCRu0Q |title=US wants me dead: Karadzic |publisher=Google  |date=1 August 2008 |accessdate=20 December 2010[/tpl] Muhamed Sacirbey, Bosnian foreign minister at the time, claimed that a Karadžić-Holbrooke deal was made in July 1996.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=65316&sectionid=351020606 |title=Karadzic-Holbrooke deal confirmed |publisher=Presstv.ir |accessdate=20 December 2010[/tpl]
In August 2008 Karadžić claimed there is a conspiracy against him and refused to enter a plea, therefore the court entered a plea of not guilty on his behalf to all 11 charges.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7587623.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Karadzic refuses war crimes pleas | date=29 August 2008 | accessdate=22 May 2010[/tpl] He called the tribunal, chaired by Scottish judge Iain Bonomy, a "court of NATO" disguised as a court of the international community.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.cctv.com/english/20080830/100530.shtml |title= cctv.com/english |title=UN tribunal enters plea for Karadzic |publisher=cctv.com [/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/30/world/europe/30hague.html?ref=europe |title=Karadzic Declines to Plead at War Crimes Court |publisher=New York Times | first=Marlise | last=Simons | date=30 August 2008[/tpl] On 13 October 2009, the BBC reported that Karadžić's plea to be granted immunity from his charges was denied.

On Monday 26 October 2009 Karadžić's trial was suspended after 15 minutes after he carried out his threat to boycott the start of the hearing. Judge O-Gon Kwon said that in the absence of Karadžić, who was defending himself, or any lawyer representing him, he was suspending the case for 24 hours, when the prosecution would begin its opening statement.[ref][tpl]cite news|first=Alex |last=Watts |date=26 October 2009|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/World-News/Radovan-Karadzic-Beast-Of-Bosnia-Boycotts-Start-Of-His-Genocide-Trial-At-The-Hague/Article/200910415417404?f=rss |title='Beast Of Bosnia' Boycotts Genocide Trial |publisher=Sky News Online |accessdate=28 January 2010[/tpl]

 "There is no doubt that the United States and Germany had their own interests in igniting wars in Croatia, Slovenia and Bosnia"[tpl]Cite web|author=Papadopoulos, Marcus|title=Radovan Karadzic: The other side to the Bosnian story| url=http://www.ap-ps.org/?page_id=813|publisher=Politics First|date=May 2011|accessdate=26 May 2011[/tpl][tpl]deadlink|date=July 2013[/tpl]
 
 "You want to take Bosnia and Herzegovina down the same highway to hell and suffering that Slovenia and Croatia are travelling. Do not think that you will not lead Bosnia and Herzegovina into hell, and do not think that you will not perhaps lead the Muslim people into annihilation, because the Muslims cannot defend themselves if there is war – How will you prevent everyone from being killed in Bosnia and Herzegovina?"
