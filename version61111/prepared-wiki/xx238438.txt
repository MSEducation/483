The park protects mountain goat habitat, namely a canyon formed by Horneline Creek cutting through a glacial terrace, and is accessed via the Kechika River, with a 250 km bost trip from Fireside.  The Davie Trail, an historic trail from Fort Ware to Lower Post, traverses part of the Kechika River next to the Rocky Mountain Trench.BC Parks infopage

==Flora and fauna==

The steep-walled canyon formed by Horneline Creek's course through the glacial terrace has exposed a natural mineral lick, attracting 60 to 75 goats at a time.  Grasslands and groups of aspen line the canyon's rim.BC Parks infopage
