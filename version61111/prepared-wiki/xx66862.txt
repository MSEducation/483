==History==

Key West's aviation history begins with a 1913 flight to Cuba by Augustin Parla. In 1928, Pan American Airways began scheduled flights from Key West.http://www.keywestinternationalairport.com/key-west-airport-history.htm Meacham Field was the primary runway for Key West. It was pressed into Army use after the Pearl Harbor bombing, and then later during World War II by the Navy as an adjunct runway to the Trumbo Point Seaplane Base and the main Naval Air Station for fixed-wing and lighter-than-air (i.e., blimp) aircraft on Boca Chica Key. After the war the city took over what became Key West Municipal Airport.http://www.flheritage.com/wwii/sites.cfm?PR_ID=158 In January 1953 the city gave Monroe County clear title to Meacham Field, allowing the county to apply for CAA grants.http://www.keyshistory.org/txairportsdetails.html Around then the airport became Key West International Airport.
Jet flights started in 1968: National 727s to Miami.
