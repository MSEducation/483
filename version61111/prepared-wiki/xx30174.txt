The Solway Firth ([tpl]lang-gd|Tràchd Romhra[/tpl]) is a firth that forms part of the border between England and Scotland, between Cumbria (including the Solway Plain) and Dumfries and Galloway. It stretches from St Bees Head, just south of Whitehaven in Cumbria, to the Mull of Galloway, on the western end of Dumfries and Galloway. The Isle of Man is also very near to the firth. The firth comprises part of the Irish Sea.
The coastline is characterised by lowland hills and small mountains. It is a mainly rural area with fishing and hill farming (as well as some arable farming) still playing a large part in the local economy, although tourism is increasing. It has also been used for the location of films such as The Wicker Man (starring Edward Woodward), which was filmed around Kirkcudbright.
The Solway Coast was designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty in 1964.[tpl]cite web| url=http://solwaycoastaonb.org.uk/aboutus.php| title=Solway Coast AONB| publisher=| accessdate=2009-08-10[/tpl] Construction of Robin Rigg Wind Farm began in the firth in 2007.

==Wildlife==

The water itself is generally benign with no notable hazards excepting some large areas of salt and mud flats, which often contain dangerous patches of quicksand that move frequently. It is recommended [tpl]By whom|date=August 2009[/tpl] that visitors do not attempt to navigate them without expert guidance.
There are over [tpl]convert|290|km2|sqmi[/tpl] of Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) in the area, as well as National Nature Reserves at Caerlaverock and in Cumbria.[ref]

==Long distance walking route==

A [tpl]convert|53|mi[/tpl] long-distance walking route called the Annandale Way,Annandale Way website running through Annandale from the source of the River Annan in the Moffat Hills to the Solway Firth, was opened in September 2009.The Long Distance Walkers Association - Annandale Way

==Islands in the Solway==

Unlike other parts of the west coast of Scotland, the Solway Firth is generally devoid of islands. However there are a few examples:
The Isle of Whithorn is actually a peninsula.

==Rivers==

The Solway Firth forms the estuary of the River Eden and the River Esk.
The following rivers also flow into the firth:

==History==

The name 'Solway' is of Anglo-Saxon origin, and originates in the thirteenth century as the name of a ford across the mud flats at Eskmouth. Sol is the word for mud, and wæth refers to a ford. The three fords in the area at that time were the Annan or Bowness Wath, the Dornock Wath (once called the Sandywathe), and the main one was the Solewath, or Solewath, or Sulewad.
Between 1869 and 1921, the estuary was crossed by the Solway Junction Railway on a 1780 m (5850 ft) iron viaduct (Edgar and Sinton, 1990).  The line was built to carry iron ore from the Whitehaven area to Lanarkshire and was financed and operated by the Caledonian Railway of Scotland.  The railway was not a financial success.  After the railway ceased operating, the bridge provided a popular  footpath for residents of Scotland (which was dry on a Sunday) to travel to England where alcoholic drink was available.  The viaduct was demolished between 1931 and 1933.

==Hazards==

The Ministry of Defence had by 1999 fired more than 6,350 depleted uranium rounds into the Solway Firth from its testing range at Dundrennan Range.[tpl]cite news| author=Rob Edwards| url=http://www.sundayherald.com/search/display.var.2192940.0.radiation_at_solway_range_hits_new_high.php| title=Radiation at Solway range hits new high| publisher=Sunday Herald| date=| accessdate=2009-08-10[/tpl] The adjacent Irish Sea is a carrier of radioactive pollution [tpl]Dubious|date=July 2010[/tpl] as Sellafield is nearby.
