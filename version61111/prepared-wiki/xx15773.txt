==Music career==

===Early career===

After a short time singing in local clubs and bars, in the 1980s. In 1987 he joined Push, a British funk band, and toured with them in Japan. In Asia he joined a blues band in Thailand for a while before separating from the group and journeying throughout India on his own. Seal returned to England, sleeping on the couch of friend Julian Bunster, then a model. He sometimes asked him "Do I sing well?"; to which he often received the response that he sang better than most current artists. His break came when he met the producer Adamski. He was given the lyrics of the song "Killer", which was a huge hit in 1990.

===Seal (1991)===

Seal first came to public attention as vocalist on the Adamski single "Killer" in 1990. The single eventually reached number one in 1990 in the UK. Seal subsequently signed to ZTT Records and released his self-titled début album (produced by Trevor Horn) in 1991. Two versions of the album are known to be in circulation: the original "premix" version and a second, more common version with an updated mix. This is attributed to the demand for a produced single rushing the final album edit, and as Seal puts it, his and producer Horn's "inability to let go."[tpl]cite web|url=http://futureloveparadise.co.uk/index.html?s=anthology&d=disc-album&p=seal1edit |title=10 Years on and Still the Web's Best Source of Seal Info |publisher=Future Love Paradise |accessdate=26 April 2011[/tpl]
Seal was positively received by critics. The singles "Crazy", "Future Love Paradise", and his own rendition of "Killer" performed well on the charts. In particular, "Crazy" became an international hit in 1991, reaching number two in the UK Singles Chart and number seven on the Billboard Hot 100 in the US.[tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]BillboardURLbyName|artist=seal|chart=all[/tpl] |title=Seal: Single Chart History |work=Billboard |date= |accessdate=26 April 2011[/tpl] Seal stole the show at the 1992 Brit Awards held at the Hammersmith Odeon, London, with the first hat-trick of wins in the history of the event. He won in three categories: Best British Male, Best British Video ("Killer"), and Best British Album (Seal).
In April 1992 Seal performed with the surviving members of the rock band Queen at The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert held at Wembley Stadium.The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert: Who Wants To Live Forever Ultimate Queen. Retrieved 28 November 2011 Seal performed on his own singing the 1986 hit "Who Wants to Live Forever" and joined the rest of the acts for the all star finale singing "We Are the Champions."
In 1992 Seal appeared on the Red Hot Organization's compilation CD Red Hot + Dance, contributing an exclusive track "Crazy (If I Was Trev Mix)." The album, featuring George Michael and Madonna among others, raised money and awareness in support of the AIDS epidemic by donating all proceeds to AIDS charities.

===Seal II (1994)===

After regrouping with Trevor Horn, Seal's second album, also self-titled, was released in 1994. A success, the album featured the singles "Prayer for the Dying" and "Newborn Friend", later receiving a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year. "Prayer for the Dying" became a minor pop hit in the U.S., peaking at #21 on the Billboard charts. A third single, "Kiss from a Rose", performed modestly when released but was later featured to much wider popularity when it was remixed for the soundtrack to Batman Forever. "Kiss from a Rose" won a Grammy Award for Record of the Year and Grammy Award for Song of the Year in 1996, becoming Seal's best performing single on the US market (it topped the Billboard Hot 100 in late August 1995) and hit number four in the UK.Roberts, David (2006).

===Human Being===

In 1998 Seal released Human Being. The album was the product of a turbulent time in his life, including a split and later reconciliation with producer Horn as well as Seal's parting with ZTT Records and his signing with Warner Bros. Records in 1997. The record was panned upon its release. It received Gold record certification by the RIAA just two months after its release date.RIAA.com Human Being Gold certification date 22 January 1999. Retrieved 12 July 2007 The album provided three singles, "Human Beings", "Latest Craze", and "Lost My Faith".

===Togetherland===

In 2001 fans awaited the arrival of a new album, announced as Togetherland. After a protracted post-production period the album was cancelled. The official word was that Seal simply did not think it made the grade, although this conflicts with other reports that said the album was turned down by the label because producers felt the album would not be commercially successful. Even so, one single was released from the album. "This Could Be Heaven" was released in the US and featured on The Family Man soundtrack. Since December 2006, Seal has indicated that he has plans to excerpt cuts from Togetherland and make them available for streaming download.
Meanwhile, Seal co-wrote and provided vocals for the hit single "My Vision" from Jakatta in 2002. He also recorded a successful duet with French icon Mylène Farmer called "Les Mots" during that same period.

===Seal IV===

In 2003 Seal released his fourth album, which was again self-titled, except for Australia, where it was released under the title Seal IV. Although it never achieved the sales figures of either of his first two albums, this release brought him back into the public eye in the United States and continental Europe. Singles from the album included "Waiting For You," "Get It Together," and "Love's Divine;" this last was released in 2004, and was a big hit in several European countries.

===Greatest hits album: Best 1991-2004===

In 2004 a greatest hits album entitled Seal: Best 1991–2004 was released, including a cover of the Bacharach / David classic "Walk on By" and a cover of Echo & the Bunnymen's song "Lips Like Sugar". An edition of the album was available which included an extra CD with acoustic versions of some of Seal's hits.

===Live in Paris===

Also in 2004, Seal performed shows at the Olympia Theatre in Paris, France. The 6 July 2004 show was recorded and released about one year after as CD/DVD package, simply titled Live in Paris.

===One Night to Remember===

In June 2005 Seal recorded a special concert which was subsequently released in 2006, entitled One Night to Remember, as CD/DVD combination. The DVD includes a special "the making of" documentary in addition to the live performance. Recorded in a historic steel mill, the Altes Kesselhaus ("old boiler house"), in Düsseldorf, Germany, this performance includes a special version of Brahms' Lullaby which Seal sings in German and then in English for the exclusive audience. Unlike earlier recordings in which Seal is accompanied by his band, a full orchestra and choir of 52 musicians accompanies the singer.

 "Ramzan Kadyrov is linked to a litany of horrific human rights abuses. It's inappropriate for stars to get paid to party with him. It bolsters his image and legitimizes a brutal leader and his regime. And getting paid to be part of such a lavish show in Chechnya trivializes the suffering of countless victims of human rights abuses there."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/seal-chechnya-human-rights-247508|title=Seal's Chechen Leader Birthday Bash Performance Questioned By Human Rights Group|publisher=hollywoodreporter.com | first=Kim|last=Masters|date=12 October 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2048798/Hilary-Swank-apologises-attending-Chechen-president-Ramzan-Kadyrovs-birthday.html|title='I deeply regret attending': Hilary Swank goes into damage control after turning up at birthday party for Chechen president|publisher=dailymail.co.uk | location=London|first=Mike|last=Larkin|date=14 October 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/oct/13/hilary-swank-regrets-chechen-party|title=Hilary Swank 'regrets' partying with Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov|publisher=guardian.co.uk | location=London|first=Miriam|last=Elder|date=13 October 2011[/tpl]
