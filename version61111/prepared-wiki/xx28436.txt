Catherine Wheel were an English alternative rock band from Great Yarmouth. The band was active from 1990 to 2000, experiencing fluctuating levels of commercial success, and embarking on many lengthy tours.

==Biography==

Catherine Wheel formed in 1990, comprising singer/guitarist Rob Dickinson (cousin of Iron Maiden's Bruce Dickinson), guitarist Brian Futter, bassist Dave Hawes, and drummer Neil Sims. Hawes had previously played in a Joy Division-influenced band called Eternal. They took their moniker from the firework known as the Catherine wheel, which in turn had taken its name from the medieval torture device of the same name. The band was sometimes included in the shoegazing scene, characterized by bands that made extensive use of guitar feedback and droning washes of noise, as well as their continuous interaction with extensive amounts of effects pedals on the stage floor. However, Catherine Wheel had a more song oriented style than their peers.[tpl]cite news| url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2008-07-24/entertainment/17171099_1_catherine-wheel-rob-dickinson-band | work=SFGate.com | title=Looking up at last | date=2008-07-24 | accessdate=2011-08-25 | first1=Delfín | last1=Vigil[/tpl] Their sound was influenced by Pink Floyd, The House of Love and Talk Talk.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/04/arts/reviews-music-hostile-psychedelia-from-the-charlatans.html | work=NY Times | title=Reviews/Music; Hostile Psychedelia From the Charlatans | date=1992-05-04 | accessdate=2012-02-11 | first1=Jon | last1=Parales[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://www.bostonphoenix.com/alt1/archive/music/reviews/09-05-96/CATHERINE_WHEEL.html | work=Boston Phoenix | title=Shooting for pop's Olympus | date=1996-09-05 | accessdate=2011-11-23 | first1=Ted | last1=Drozdowski[/tpl] 
The band performed a Peel session in early 1991 while still unsigned; two 12" vinyl EPs were released on the Norwich based Wilde Club Records, named after the regular weekly Wilde Club gigs run by Barry Newman at Norwich Arts Centre.  They signed to major-label Fontana Records after being courted by both Creation Records and the Brian Eno-run label Opal Records. The band's debut album, 1991/92's Ferment, made an immediate impression on the music press and introduced Catherine Wheel's second-biggest U.S. hit, "Black Metallic," as well as moderate hit "I Want to Touch You".Notalot.com The album features re-recorded versions of some of the Wilde Club-issued EPs.
The more aggressive Chrome followed in 1993, produced by Gil Norton. With this album, the band began to shed its original shoegazing tag, while still making skillful use of atmospherics, such as on the song "Fripp." In a 2007 interview, Rob Dickinson said that members of Death Cab for Cutie and Interpol told him that without this album, their bands "wouldn't exist."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.thestar.com/artsentertainment/article/176393|authorlink=Ben Rayner|last= Rayner|first= Ben|title=Behind the Wheel: Catherine Wheel's Rob Dickinson finds there is still air in the tires|newspaper=Toronto Star|accessdate=5 March 2007|date=1 February 2007[/tpl]
1995's Happy Days saw the band delving further into metallic hard rock, which alienated a portion of their fanbase, even as it increased their exposure in the United States during the post-grunge era.Kellerman, Andy - "Happy Days" review from Allmusic.com; URL accessed 17 February 2006  The single "Waydown," and especially its plane-crash themed video, received heavy play in the U.S. A more sedate strain of rock known as Britpop was taking over in the UK, causing C.W. to continue to have greater success abroad than at home.
The B-sides and outtakes collection, Like Cats and Dogs, came out the following year, revealing a quieter, more contemplative side of the band, spanning the previous five years. This carried over into Adam and Eve in 1997, wherein the band scaled back the sonic force of their sound from its Happy Days levels, with clean playing on some songs that [tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl] featured extensive use of keyboards and acoustic guitars. Alternately, songs like "Satellite" and "Here Comes the Fat Controller" were lush and orchestral in scope.
In 2000, Catherine Wheel re-emerged with a new record label, a new bassist (Ben Ellis); a modified name (The Catherine Wheel); and a new album, Wishville. After mixed reviews, record company turmoil[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.chartattack.com/news/27748/the-wheels-are-falling-off-the-catherine-wheels-momentum | date=11 July 2000 | title=The Wheels Are Falling Off The Catherine Wheel's Momentum | publisher=Chart | accessdate=10 October 2009[/tpl] and lacklustre sales, the band went on a still-continuing hiatus.
In March 2010, Ferment was re-released, containing bonus tracks and extensive sleeve notes. 
The song 'Texture' was featured in the episode 'model behaviour' in the first season of the American drama series Blue Bloods, which aired in the US in 2010 and in the UK in 2011. The song is played as detective Danny Reagan discovers a suicide in a bath.
