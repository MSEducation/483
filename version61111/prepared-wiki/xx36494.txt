[[Lycian Way]]

CATEGORIES: Hiking trails in Turkey

The Lycian Way is a long-distance footpath in Turkey around part of the coast of ancient Lycia. It is approximately 510 km long and stretches from Ölüdeniz, near Fethiye, to Hisarcandir, about 20 kilometers from Antalya.  It is waymarked with red and white stripes, the Grande Randonnee convention.
The Sunday Times has listed it as one of the world's top ten walks.
It takes its name from the ancient civilisation, which once ruled the area. The route is graded medium to hard; it is not level walking, but has many ascents and descents as it approaches and veers away from the sea. It is easier at the start near Fethiye and gets more difficult as it progresses. It is recommended that you walk the route in spring or autumn; February–May or September–November. Summer in Lycia is hot, although you could walk short, shady sections. The route is mainly over footpaths and mule trails; mostly limestone and often hard and stony underfoot.
