==Background/Production==

Originally intended to be an all-sound film, the picture was shot silent and was distributed with a music and special effects soundtrack, with no dialogue, due to technical issues with the sound synchronization equipment.

==Preservation==

Both picture and sound elements for the film no longer exist, so the film is considered to be a lost film.
