The Dead Files is an American paranormal television series that premiered on September 23, 2011, on the Travel Channel. The program features psychic medium Amy Allan and former NYPD homicide detective Steve DiSchiavi as they investigate locations that are reported to be haunted. The show initially airs new episodes on Fridays at 10:00 pm EST.

==Summary==

Partners Amy Allan and Steve DiSchiavi investigate purportedly haunted locations to provide proof of paranormal activity. The partners each explore the case individually and then meet at the end of the episode to compare their findings with one another as well as to the occupant of the location.
Criteria:
Each episode begins with Amy's initial walkthrough of the investigation site. Amy's assistant, Matt (her former husband), visits the location prior to her arrival and removes anything that might distract or influence Amy during her "channeling" session. (Items such as family pictures, trinkets, or personal effects.) In her walkthrough, Amy appears to communicate with ghosts and spirits and gather information to be used throughout the course of the episode. This walkthrough is intercut with footage of Steve gathering facts by researching the history of the location and interviewing witness who claim to have experienced paranormal phenomena. Amy will occasionally collaborate with a sketch artist to describe the entities she claims to have channeled during her walkthrough. In the episode's climax, Amy and Steve collectively meet with their client for the reveal of evidence.
