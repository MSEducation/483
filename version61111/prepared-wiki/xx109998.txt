==History==

The clan built and controlled Kasugayama Castle and the surrounding fief, in what is now Niigata Prefecture. Nagao Kagetora, adopted by Uesugi Norimasa, became lord of the castle in 1548, taking the name Uesugi Kenshin and effectively changing the ruling clan of Kasugayama from Nagao to Uesugi. Those members of his family who retained the Nagao name became retainers to the Uesugi family.
