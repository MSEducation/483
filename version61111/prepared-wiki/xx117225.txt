==Publication history==

The 1952 television series Adventures of Superman co-starred actor Jack Larson, who appeared regularly as Jimmy Olsen.  Largely because of the popularity of Larson and his portrayal of the character, National Comics Publications (DC Comics) decided to create a regular title featuring Jimmy as the leading character.Look, Up in the Sky: The Amazing Story of Superman (2006)  Curt Swan was the main artist on the series for its first decade.[tpl]cite book|last = Daniels|first = Les|authorlink = Les Daniels|title = DC Comics : Sixty Years of the World's Favorite Comic Book Heroes|chapter= The Superman Family Strength in Numbers|publisher = Bulfinch Press|date = 1995|page = 118|isbn = 0821220764|quote= Jimmy Olsen got its start in September-October 1954 at the height of Superman's television run, and the art job was assigned to Curt Swan.  For Swan, his ten-year stint on Jimmy Olsen was 'like being introduced to the Superman Family'.[/tpl]
Many of the issues include Jimmy undergoing a transformation of some form.  Some of these include:

In issue #57, he marries Supergirl (Kara Zor-El/Linda Lee Danvers) after she loses both her powers and memories of being Supergirl, only for her to recover her powers and memories after their marriage; once she lets him know that she is Supergirl, he is perfectly happy with it.Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen #57 (October 1961) at the Grand Comics Database[tpl]cite comic|writer= Siegel, Jerry|penciller= Swan, Curt|inker= Klein, George|story= Jimmy Olsen Marries Supergirl!|title= Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen|issue= 57|date= October 1961[/tpl] She was also the anonymous "Miss X" whom Jimmy kissed in issue #44 to break the spell that turned him into a werewolf. 
When Jack Kirby began working at DC in 1970, he insisted on this title since it was the lowest selling in the publishing line and without assigned talent at the time so he wouldn't cost someone their job.Evanier, Mark. "Afterword." Jack Kirby's Fourth World Omnibus: Volume 1, New York: DC Comics, 2007.McAvennie, Michael "1970s" in Dolan, p. 141: "Since no ongoing creative team had been slated to Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen, "King of Comics" Jack Kirby made the title his DC launch point, and the writer/artist's indelible energy and ideas permeated every panel and word balloon of the comic." During his run, Kirby introduced many memorable characters, notably the Fourth World's New Gods, Darkseid, Project Cadmus and Transilvane.[tpl]cite book |authorlink= Paul Levitz|last=Levitz|first= Paul|chapter= The Bronze Age 1970-1984|title= 75 Years of DC Comics The Art of Modern Mythmaking|publisher= Taschen America|year=2010|ISBN= 9783836519816|page= 447|quote= Kirby began introducing new elements to the DC Universe, building toward the introduction of a trio of new titles based on a complex mythology he called the Fourth World.[/tpl] He also reintroduced the Newsboy Legion and the Guardian. The faces of the Superman and Jimmy Olsen figures drawn by Kirby were redrawn by Al Plastino or Murphy Anderson. Comedian Don Rickles guest starred in a two-part story by Kirby in issues #139 and #141.McAvennie "1970s" in Dolan, p. 146: "In one of Jack Kirby's strangest tales, Jimmy Olsen met real-world funnyman Don Rickles' costumed likeness, 'Goody' Rickles."[tpl]cite comic| writer= Kirby, Jack| penciller= Kirby, Jack| inker= Colletta, Vince| story= The Guardian Fights Again!!!| title= Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen| issue= 139| date= July 1971[/tpl][tpl]cite comic| writer= Kirby, Jack| penciller= Kirby, Jack| inker= Colletta, Vince| story= Will The Real Don Rickles Panic?!?| title= Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen| issue= 141| date= September 1971[/tpl] Kirby left the series with issue #148 (April 1972).

In 1958, a second title was introduced, Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane, which revolves around another supporting character in a similar fashion. Both titles ended in 1974 by merging into Superman Family. The new series would continue the numbering from Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen.McAvennie "1970s" in Dolan, p. 159 "DC's 100-page Super Spectaculars were proving popular, so DC said goodbye to Supergirl, Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen, Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane, and housed the characters together in Superman Family.  Continuing the numbering from where Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen ended, the series featured classic reprints with new tales in the lead spot." 
A Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen Special one-shot was published in December 2008, following on from the "Atlas" storyline, and leading into Superman: New Krypton.

==Proposed TV series==

In 1959, the producers of the action/adventure series Adventures of Superman were hit by a snag as to how revive the now-canceled series after series star George Reeves had died that summer from a gunshot wound. Jack Larson, who played Jimmy in the series, was approached with the idea of continuing the franchise as a spin-off for two new seasons of 26 episodes each to begin airing in 1960. Titled Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen, it would focus on a more serious angle of Olsen's rising career as a reporter and journalist with Larson reprising his role. In place of Reeves, stock footage of Superman flying and a look-alike stunt double to play the Man of Steel. Disgusted at the thought of the producers trying to cash in and make money over the death of Reeves, Larson rejected the proposal, and the project went unmade.[tpl]cite magazine|last = Mangels|first = Andy|authorlink = Andy Mangels|title = Superman: The Man of Screen|magazine = Wizard Superman Tribute Edition|issue = 1|page = 45|date = April 1993|quote= A Jimmy Olsen show was talked about, with footage mixed in from the previous Superman shows, but Jack Larson refused to even consider the project, calling it a 'sick case of necrophilia.'[/tpl]
