Skype was released as a simple computer-to-computer, or computer-to-telephone program. Support for paid services such as SkypeOut, SkypeIn, and voice mail allows the company to generate its revenue as well as making local and international telephone calls easier to perform via the user's computer, sometimes cheaper than other companies' rates for similar services.
eBay acquired Skype Technologies S.A. in September 2005 and in April 2009 announced plans to spin it off in a 2010 IPO.[tpl]cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123974180039718079.html|title=EBay to Unload Skype In IPO, Citing Poor Fit|last=Fowler|first=Geoffrey|date=6 April 2009|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=12 January 2010[/tpl] It was acquired by Silver Lake Partners in 2009.

As of 2010, Skype was available in 27 languages and has 660 million worldwide users, an average of over 100 million active each month,Retrieved 10 May 2011 and has faced challenges to its intellectual property and political concerns by governments wishing to control their telecommunications systems.

==History==

Skype was founded in 2003 by Janus Friis from Denmark and Niklas Zennström from Sweden,[tpl]cite web|url=http://about.skype.com/|title=About Skype: What is Skype?|accessdate=28 July 2010[/tpl] having its headquarters in Luxembourg with offices in Tallinn, Tartu, Stockholm, London, Prague,[tpl]cite web | url=http://share.skype.com/sites/en/2006/12/skype_is_expanding_engineering.html | title=Skype is expanding engineering to Prague | first=Jaanus | last=Kase | publisher=Skype Blogs | accessdate=5 December 2006[/tpl] and Redmond, Washington.
The Skype software was originally developed by Estonians Ahti Heinla, Priit Kasesalu and Jaan Tallinn, who together with Janus Friis and Niklas Zennström were also behind the peer-to-peer file sharing software Kazaa.[tpl]cite web | url=http://emagazine.credit-suisse.com/app/article/index.cfm?fuseaction=OpenArticle&aoid=163167&coid=7805&lang=EN | title=Skype — A Baltic Success Story | publisher=credit-suisse.com | accessdate=24 February 2008[/tpl] In April 2003, Skype.com and Skype.net domain names were registered. In August 2003, the first public beta version was released.
One of the initial names for the project was "Sky peer-to-peer", which was then abbreviated to "Skyper". However, some of the domain names associated with "Skyper" were already taken.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.eplanetventures.com/en/news/releases/pr_013006_1.html | title=The World's Hottest VC? [/tpl] Dropping the final "r" left the current title "Skype", for which domain names were available.
In September 2005, SkypeOut was banned in China.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.infoworld.com/t/business/china-bans-skype-911 | title=China bans Skype | author=Jack McCarthy | publisher=InfoWorld | accessdate=7 June 2011[/tpl] In October of the same year, eBay purchased Skype[tpl]cite web | url=http://investor.ebay.com/ReleaseDetail.cfm?ReleaseID=176402&FYear= | title=eBay Completes Acquisition of Skype | publisher=eBay | accessdate=17 June 2006[/tpl] for $2.6 billion.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/122516/ebay_buys_skype_for_26_billion.html |title=EBay Buys Skype for $2.6 Billion |publisher=PCWorld |date=12 September 2005 |accessdate=11 May 2011[/tpl] (In 2011, the Ars Technica estimated the purchase price at $3.1 billion, not $2.6 billion.)"A Microsoft purchase would not be the first time Skype has been bought out; after being started in 2003, it was bought by eBay in 2005 for $3.1 billion. eBay then sold the majority of its stake in 2009 to a private investment group for $1.2 billion less than it paid." http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2011/05/wsj-microsoft-to-buy-skype-for-7bn-rest-of-world-for-real.ars In December 2005, videotelephony was introduced.[tpl]cite web | url=http://about.skype.com/2005/12/skype_launches_next_generation.html | title=Skype Launches Next Generation Free Internet and Video Calling for Everyone | publisher=Skype | accessdate=17 June 2006[/tpl]
In April 2006, the number of registered users reached 100 million. In October, Skype 2.0 for Mac was released, the first full release of Skype with video for Macintosh, and in December, Skype announced a new pricing structure, with connection fees for all SkypeOut calls. Skype 3.0 for Windows was released.
In 2006, a now-discontinued feature called "Skypecasting" was introduced. It allowed recordings of Skype voice over IP voice calls and teleconferences to be used as podcasts. Skypecasting remained in beta until it was discontinued. Skypecasts hosted public conference calls for up to 100 people at a time. Unlike ordinary Skype p2p conference calls, Skypecasts supported moderation features suitable for panel discussions, lectures, and town hall forums. Skype operated a directory of public Skypecasts. Skypecasts was discontinued from 1 September 2008.[tpl]cite web | url = http://share.skype.com/sites/en/2008/08/goodnight_skypecasts.html | title=Goodnight Skypecasts — Skype Blogs |publisher=Share.skype.com |date=August 2008 | accessdate=31 March 2009[/tpl]
Throughout 2007, updates (3.1, 3.2 and 3.5) added new features including Skype Find, Skype Prime, Send Money (which allowed users to send money via PayPal from one Skype user to another), video in mood, inclusion of video content in chat, call transfer to another person or a group, and auto-redial. Skype 2.7.0.49 (beta) for Mac OS X released adding availability of contacts in the Mac Address Book to the Skype contact list, auto redial, contact groups, public chat creation, and an in-window volume slider in the call window. During several days in August, Skype users were unable to connect to full Skype network in many countries[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/17/business/17ebay.html?_r=1&oref=slogin | title=Error in Skype’s Software Shuts Down Phone Service | publisher=NY Times | accessdate=17 August 2007 | first=Brad | last=Stone | date=17 August 2007[/tpl] because of a Skype system-wide crash which was the result of exceptional number of logins after a Windows patch reboot ("Patch Tuesday").[tpl]cite news | url = http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/article2292536.ece | title = Skype blames outage on user reboot | work=The Times | location=London | first=Jonathan | last=Richards | date=20 August 2007 | accessdate=23 May 2010[/tpl] In November, there was controversy when it was announced that users allocated certain London 020 numbers (specifically those beginning '7870') would lose them, after negotiations with the provider of this batch of numbers broke down.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/11/22/skype_down_again/|title=Skype faces 020 7870 cut-off|date=22 November 2007|accessdate=26 February 2012|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071123143234/http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/11/22/skype_down_again/|archivedate=23 November 2007[/tpl]
By early 2008, the tumultuous ownership relations between the founders and eBay had resulted in significant leadership churn, with a succession of Skype presidents including Niklas Zennström, Rajiv Dutta, Alex Kazim, Niklas Zennström (again), and Henry Gomez, all holding that title at various points between 2005 and 2007. The business had failed to meet certain earn-out targets, growth was decelerating, product development had slowed significantly, and in October 2007 eBay took a $1.4 billion 'impairment' on the value of Skype, admitting it had overpaid, and now valuing the company at about $2.7 billion.[tpl]cite web | url = http://corporatetool.blogspot.com/2007/10/ebays-skype-writedown.html/ | title = ebays-skype-writedown | date=2 October 2007 | accessdate=2 October 2007 [/tpl]
In October 2008, analysis revealed TOM-skype — the Chinese version of Skype run by TOM Online — sends content of text messages and encryption keys to monitoring servers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nartv.org/mirror/breachingtrust.pdf |title="Breaching Trust, An analysis of surveillance and security practices on China’s TOM-Skype platform", Information Warfare Monitor, 2 October 2008 |format=PDF |date=|accessdate=10 October 2010[/tpl]

===Two original founders depart and new CEO appointed===

For the six months after the departure of Niklas and Janus, Michael van Swaaij led the company as Interim CEO, until the appointment of Josh Silverman in February 2008.[tpl]cite web | url =http://about.skype.com/2008/02/ebay_inc_appoints_new_ceos_of.html/ | title = eBay Inc. Appoints New CEOs of Skype and Shopping.com | date=25 February 2008 | accessdate=25 February 2008 [/tpl] Silverman was "widely viewed as bringing in stability to Skype after a tumultuous phase that followed the exit of the two Skype co-founders."[tpl]cite web | url =http://gigaom.com/2010/10/07/ex-skype-ceo-josh-silverman-joins-greylock-as-eir/ | title = Ex-Skype CEO Josh Silverman Joins Greylock as EIR | date=7 October 2010 | accessdate=7 October 2010[/tpl] Under Silverman's 2.5 year tenure, the company focused its product efforts around video calling, ubiquity (gaining high penetration on smartphones, PCs, TVs, and consumer-electronic devices), building tailored offerings for enterprise customers, and diversifying revenue through subscriptions, premium accounts and advertising.
In advancing this strategy, Skype released many new products, substantially revamping its flagship Windows software (3.8 ->4.0), and its Macintosh and Linux software; while introducing new software products for smartphones, and consumer electronics. In 2009, Skype 4.0 was released, featuring full-screen high-quality video calling.[tpl]cite news|author=Last Updated: 2:39PM GMT 6 February 2009 |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/scienceandtechnology/technology/technologynews/4525013/New-Skype-4.0-software-adds-full-screen-video-calls.html |title=New Skype 4.0 software adds full-screen video calls |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=6 February 2009 |accessdate=31 March 2009 | location=London[/tpl] the Linux client was updated, and an iPhone application was launched which topped the charts with over 1M downloads in its first two days.[tpl]cite web | url =http://techcrunch.com/2009/04/02/skype-iphone-app-downloaded-one-million-times-in-first-two-days/ | title = Skype for iPhone tops 1M downloads in two days | date=3 April 2009 | accessdate=3 April 2009 [/tpl] Skype also announced the launch of its software for the Android platform.[tpl]cite web | url =http://about.skype.com/2009/01/skype_launches_on_android_plat.html/ | title = Skype Launches on Android Platform and more than 100 Java-Enabled Mobile Phones | date=8 January 2009| accessdate=8 January 2009 [/tpl] Rounding out its ubiquity push, in 2010 Skype announced deep integration of Skype software into the IP-connected TVs from Panasonic, Samsung and Sony.[tpl]cite web | url =http://blogs.skype.com/en/2010/01/skype_on_your_tv.html/ | title = Get Skype on your TV | date=5 January 2010 | accessdate=5 January 2010 [/tpl]
During this period Skype also discontinued lesser-used services such as support for the "Skype Me" presence indicator, which meant that a user was interested in receiving Skype calls from a non-contact. Skype also discontinued its SkypeCast service without explanation and added internal monthly and daily usage caps on their SkypeOut subscriptions, which had been advertised as "unlimited". Skype also discontinued its "dragonfly" feature, a community-generated yellow-pages product, and other features which were deemed to be under-performing or a distraction to management. Many users and observers had commented on the high rate of dropped calls and the difficulty reconnecting dropped calls. Updates including versions for the Sony PSP hand-held gaming system, version 2.0 for Linux with support for video-conferencing.
As part of its efforts to diversify revenues, Skype launched in April 2008 Skype for SIP, a service aimed at business users. At that time around 35 per cent of Skype's users were business users.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123776338990608661.html|title=Skype Targets Businesses to Ring Up New Revenue|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|last=Fowler|first=Geoffrey A.|date=23 March 2009|accessdate=23 March 2009|postscript=[/tpl] In targeted premium products to consumers, Skype launched new monthly premium subscriptions products in May 2010.[tpl]cite web | url =http://downloadsquad.switched.com/2010/05/05/skype-to-launch-monthly-subscriptions-and-group-video-chat/ | title = Skype to launch monthly subscriptions and group video chat | date=5 May 2010 | accessdate=5 May 2010 [/tpl]
Marketing efforts were also re-vamped, with a particular focus on innovative partnerships with TV broadcasters to integrate Skype into their programming. The Oprah Winfrey Show began using Skype regularly to host video calls between Oprah and her viewers at home, culminating in a show dedicated exclusively to the wonders of Skype ("where the Skype are You", aired first in May 2009).[tpl]cite news | url =http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2009/05/21/skype-gets-the-oprah-treatment/ | title = Skype Gets the Oprah Treatment | date=21 May 2009 | accessdate=21 May 2009 | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Geoffrey A. | last=Fowler[/tpl] Skype also became commonly used by network news stations around the world, as a cost-effective replacement for sending satellite trucks, and enabling fast response from citizen journalists. Skype was also integrated into scripted TV programming, such as Californication; and in the seventh season of the U.S. syndicated version of the British game show Who Wants To Be a Millionaire in a new Ask the Expert video chat lifeline.
These efforts led to dramatically accelerating growth of Skype's Connected Users and Paying Users in 2008 and 2009.[tpl]cite web | url =http://www.businessinsider.com/chart-of-the-day-skype-is-a-real-live-growth-company-2010-8/ | title = Skype is a real live growth company | date=9 August 2010| accessdate=9 August 2010[/tpl] By 2009 Skype was adding about 380,000 new users each day;[tpl]cite web | url =http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/159279/skype_growing_by_380000_users_a_day.html/ | title = Skype Growing by 380,000 Users a Day | date=10 February 2009 | accessdate=10 February 2009[/tpl] and by 2010, Telegeography estimated that Skype accounted for 25 per cent of the world's international calling minutes. According to their research, the overall international calling market grew a tepid 5 to 6 per cent annually in 2010. "Skype, however, has seen a huge uptick in growth, particularly in the last two years."[tpl]cite web | url =http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/report_finds_skype_now_accounts_for_about_25_of_in.php/ | title = Report Finds Skype Now Accounts for About 25% of International Call Minutes | date=6 January 2011 | accessdate=6 January 2011 [/tpl]

===eBay sells 70%===

Building on the revitalization which had begun in 2008, eBay announced, in April 2009, plans to spin off Skype through an initial public offering in 2010.[tpl]clarify|date=December 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://news.ebay.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=377199 | title = eBay Inc.

If successful, this may have caused a shutdown of Skype in its current form, and made an IPO challenging to execute.[tpl]cite web|title=Skype in danger of being shut down | url=http://www.neowin.net/news/main/09/08/01/skype-in-danger-of-being-shut-down[/tpl] In September, eBay announced the sale of 65 per cent of Skype to a consortium of Index Ventures and Silver Lake Partners.

In January 2010, Josh Silverman was recognized for his accomplishments in revitalizing Skype by being named First Runner Up in the TechCrunch "Crunchies" award for "Best CEO", beaten only by Mark Pincus of Zynga.[tpl]cite web | url =http://techcrunch.com/2010/01/08/crunchies-winner/ | title = Congratulations Crunchies Winners! | date=8 January 2010 | accessdate=8 January 2010[/tpl] In May 2010, Skype 5.0 beta was released, with a capacity to support group video calls involving up to four participants. Also in May, Skype released an updated client for the Apple iPhone that allowed Skype calls to be made over a 3G network. Originally, a 3G call subscription plan was to be instituted in 2011, but Skype eventually dropped the plan.[tpl]cite news|last=Horsey|first=Julian|title=Skype iPhone App Update: With Multitasking & Drops 3G Fee|url=http://www.geeky-gadgets.com/skype-iphone-app-update-with-multitasking-drops-3g-fee-22-07-2010/|accessdate=5 August 2010|newspaper=Geeky Gadgets|date=22 July 2010[/tpl]
In June 2010, following the rapid departure of Daniel Berg, the Chief Technology Officer, and then Chief Development Officer Madhu Yarlagadda, Mark Gillett, an operating executive at Silver Lake Partners, assumed the role of Chief Development Officer following a period of several months working closely with Joshua Silverman to drive the transformation of the business, and the acceleration of cross platform and mobile product delivery.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl]

In its 2008 Annual Report, eBay admitted to an on-going dispute between it and Joltid Ltd. over the licensing of its peer-to-peer "Global Index" technology in its application. It announced that it terminated a standstill agreement, allowing either company to sue. On 1 April 2009, eBay filed with a UK court to settle the legal dispute. A few days later, eBay announced the planning of a public stock offering in 2010 to spin off Skype as a separate, publicly owned company. Some media outlets characterized the proposed sale and ongoing provision of Skype as being under threat because of the concurrent dispute.
On 1 September 2009, a group of investors led by Silver Lake bought 65% of Skype for $1.91 billion. This prompted Joltid to countersue eBay on 17 September 2009.[ref]

===China 2005===

Skype was one of many companies (others include AOL, Microsoft, Yahoo, Cisco) which cooperate with the Chinese government in implementing a system of Internet censorship in mainland China. Critics of such policies argue that it is wrong for companies to profit from censorship and restrictions on freedom of the press and freedom of speech. Human rights advocates such as Human Rights Watch and media groups such as Reporters Without Borders speculate that if companies stopped contributing to the authorities' censorship efforts, the government could be forced to change.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/04/20/skype_china_censorship_row | title=Skype uses peer-pressure defense to explain China text censorship | publisher=The Register | accessdate=18 June 2006[/tpl]
Niklas Zennström, then chief executive of Skype, told reporters that its joint venture partner in China was operated in compliance with domestic law. "TOM Online had implemented a text filter, which is what everyone else in that market is doing," said Mr Zennström. "Those are the regulations," he said. "I may like or not like the laws and regulations to operate businesses in the UK or Germany or the US, but if I do business there I choose to comply with those laws and regulations. I can try to lobby to change them, but I need to comply with them. China in that way is not different."[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/875630d4-cef9-11da-925d-0000779e2340.html | title=Skype says texts are censored by China | publisher=Financial Times | work=FT.com |date=18 April 2006[/tpl]
