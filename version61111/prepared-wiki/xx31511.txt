==History==

Initiated and led by Purdue University president James Henry Smart,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bigten.org/trads/big10-trads.html |title=BIG TEN CONFERENCE Official Athletic Site - Traditions |publisher=Bigten.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07[/tpl]  the presidents of University of Chicago, University of Illinois, University of Minnesota, University of Wisconsin, Northwestern University, Purdue University and Lake Forest College met in Chicago on January 11, 1895 to discuss the regulation and control of intercollegiate athletics. The eligibility of student-athletes was one of the main topics of discussion.[tpl]cite web | title = Big Ten History | publisher = Big Ten Conference | url = http://bigten.cstv.com/trads/big10-trads.html | accessdate = 2007-01-14| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070113080920/http://bigten.cstv.com/trads/big10-trads.html| archivedate= 13 January 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] The Intercollegiate Conference of Faculty Representatives was founded at a second meeting on February 8, 1896.[tpl]cite book|title=From The Inside: A Half Century of Michigan Athletics|first=Don|last=Canham|publisher=Olympia Sports Press|year=1996|isbn=0-9654263-0-0|page=281[/tpl] Lake Forest was not at the 1896 meeting that established the conference and was replaced by the University of Michigan. At the time, the organization was more commonly known as the Western Conference, consisting of Purdue, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois, Chicago, and Northwestern.
The first reference to the conference as the Big Nine was in 1899 after Iowa and Indiana had joined. Nebraska first petitioned to join the league in 1900 and again in 1911,[tpl]cite web|author=By STEVEN M.

The conference was again known as the Big Nine after the University of Chicago decided to de-emphasize varsity athletics just after World War II. Chicago discontinued its football program in 1939[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7Q8mAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Df0FAAAAIBAJ&dq=chicago%20big%20ten%20conference%20football&pg=3870%2C351905|title=Chicago gives up Football as major sport|date=December 22, 1939|publisher=Gettysburg Times|accessdate=25 November 2013[/tpl] and withdrew from the conference in 1946 after struggling to gain victories in many conference matchups. It was believed that one of several schools, notably Pittsburgh, Nebraska, Michigan State, Marquette, Notre Dame, and Iowa State would replace Chicago at the time.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PwMNAAAAIBAJ&sjid=v2kDAAAAIBAJ&pg=2580,3858021&dq=chicago+big+ten+conference&hl=en|title=Chicago U. Withdraws From Big Ten|accessdate=2009-10-17[/tpl] On May 20, 1949, Michigan State ended the speculation by joining and the conference was again known as the Big Ten. The Big Ten's membership would remain unchanged for the next 40 years.
The conference’s official name throughout this period remained the Intercollegiate Conference of Faculty Representatives. It did not formally adopt the name Big Ten until 1987, when it was incorporated as a not-for-profit corporation. In 1990, the Big Ten universities voted to expand the conference to 11 teams, and extended an invitation to Pennsylvania State University, which accepted it.[tpl]cite web|url=http://bigten.cstv.com/sports/wchamp25/spec-rel/091106aaa.html|title=An Ingenious Inception: Penn State Joins the Big Ten Conference|accessdate=2007-02-09| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070328195006/http://bigten.cstv.com/sports/wchamp25/spec-rel/091106aaa.html| archivedate= 28 March 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] When Penn State joined in 1990, it was decided that the conference would continue to be called the Big Ten, but its logo was modified to reflect the change; the number 11 was disguised in the negative space of the traditionally blue "Big Ten" lettering.
Missouri had shown interest in Big Ten membership after Penn State joined.[tpl]cite news | title = Missouri Interested In Jumping To The Big Ten | url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NewsLibrary&p_multi=DSNB&d_place=DSNB&p_theme=newslibrary2&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0F3608419978C745&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM| accessdate = 2010-06-14 | date=January 16, 1993[/tpl]
Around 1993, the league explored adding Kansas, Missouri, and Rutgers, or other potential schools, to create a 14-team league with two divisions.[tpl]cite news | title = Kansas, Big 10 a good fit? | url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1993-12-10/sports/9312100144_1_commissioner-jim-delany-big-southwest-missouri | accessdate = 2009-11-10 | work=Chicago Tribune | first=Ed | last=Sherman | date=1993-12-10[/tpl] These talks died when the Big 8 Conference merged with former Southwest Conference members to create the Big 12.
Following the addition of previously independent Penn State, efforts were made to encourage the University of Notre Dame, the last remaining non-service academy independent, to join the league. Early in the 20th century, Notre Dame briefly considered official entry into the Big Ten but chose to maintain its independence instead.[tpl]cite news | title = Notre Dame shuns Big Ten, fears losing `distinctiveness' | publisher = National Catholic Reporter | date=1999-02-19 | author=Pamela Schaeffer | url = http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1141/is_16_35/ai_80680415 | accessdate = 2007-01-14[/tpl] However, in 1999, both Notre Dame and the Big Ten entered into private negotiations concerning a possible membership that would include Notre Dame. Although the Notre Dame faculty senate endorsed the idea with a near unanimous vote, the ND board of trustees decided against joining the conference and Notre Dame ultimately withdrew from negotiations. http://www.mndaily.com/daily/1999/02/08/sports/irish/
In December 2009 Big Ten Conference commissioner Jim Delany announced that the league was looking to expand in what would later be part of a nationwide trend as part of the 2010–13 NCAA conference realignment.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/columns/story?columnist=schlabach_mark&id=5268212 |title=Expansion 101: What's at stake? |first=Mark |last=Schlabach |authorlink=Mark Schlabach |publisher=ESPN.com |date=June 9, 2010 |accessdate=June 11, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100612152453/http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/columns/story?columnist=schlabach_mark&id=5268212| archivedate= 12 June 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] On June 11, 2010 the University of Nebraska applied for membership in the Big Ten and was unanimously approved as the conference's 12th school, which became effective July 1, 2011.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bigten.org/genrel/061110aab.html|title=University of Nebraska Approved to Join Big Ten Conference by Council of Presidents/Chancellors|publisher=Big Ten Conference|date=2010-06-11[/tpl] The conference retained the name "Big Ten".
On September 1, Delany revealed the conference's divisional split and announced the new division names on December 13, 2010: Legends and Leaders.[tpl]cite web|title=Big Ten sets new divisions; splits up Illinois-NU|last=Ryan|first=Shannon|url=http://www.chicagobreakingsports.com/2010/09/big-ten-divisions-to-be-revealed-on-6-pm-tv-show.html|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=1 September 2010|accessdate=2 November 2010[/tpl] The new "Legends" and "Leaders" names were not met with enthusiasm.

On November 19, 2012, the University of Maryland's Board of Regents voted to withdraw from the ACC and to join the Big Ten as its 13th member effective on July 1, 2014.[tpl]cite news|last=Prewitt|first=Alex|title=Maryland moving to Big Ten|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/terrapins-insider/wp/2012/11/19/maryland-approves-move-to-big-ten-reports-say/|accessdate=2012-11-19|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=November 19, 2012[/tpl]  The Big Ten's Council of Presidents approved the move later that day.[tpl]cite news|last=Barker|first=Jeff|last2=Korman|first2=Chris|title=Maryland's application for Big Ten admission approved|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/college/bal-maryland-to-seek-admission-into-big-ten-conference-1119,0,7212065.story|accessdate=2012-11-19|newspaper=The Baltimore Sun|date=November 19, 2012[/tpl]  One day later, Rutgers University of the Big East also accepted an offer for membership from the Big Ten as its 14th member school.[tpl]cite web|title=Rutgers University To Join The Big Ten Conference|url=http://www.bigten.org/genrel/112012aaf.html|accessdate=20 November 2012[/tpl]
On April 28, 2013, the Big Ten presidents and chancellors unanimously approved a divisional realignment that will take effect when Maryland and Rutgers join in 2014.[tpl]cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/9220734/big-ten-schools-ok-realignment-9-game-schedule |title=Big Ten's divisional overhaul OK'd |first=Adam |last=Rittenberg |publisher=ESPN.com |date=April 28, 2013 |accessdate=April 28, 2013[/tpl] Under the new plan, the "Leaders" and "Legends" divisions will be replaced with geographic divisions. The West Division will include all member schools in the Central Time Zone plus Purdue, while the East Division will include the other seven schools. The final issue in determining the new divisions was which of the two Indiana schools would be sent to the West; Purdue was chosen because its West Lafayette campus is geographically west of Indiana's home city of Bloomington.[tpl]cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/9191768/big-ten-conference-realign-teams-replace-division-names-east-west-sources-say |title=Sources: Big Ten to realign divisions |first1=Brett |last1=McMurphy |first2=Adam |last2=Rittenberg |publisher=ESPN.com |date=April 19, 2013 |accessdate=April 19, 2013[/tpl] In the new divisional alignment, the only protected cross-divisional rivalry game in football will be Indiana–Purdue.
On June 3, 2013, the Big Ten announced the sponsorship of men's and women's lacrosse. The addition of women's lacrosse was possible with the addition of Maryland and Rutgers to the conference, joining existing programs at Northwestern, Michigan, Ohio State, and Penn State. To sponsor men's lacrosse, Johns Hopkins University opted to join the conference as its first affiliate member beginning in 2014. Johns Hopkins had previously been independent in men's lacrosse for 130 years, claiming 44 national championships.[tpl]cite web|title=Johns Hopkins men's lacrosse team to join Big Ten Conference|url=http://hub.jhu.edu/2013/06/03/johns-hopkins-lacrosse-big-ten|work=hub.jhu.edu|publisher=The Hub|accessdate=3 June 2013[/tpl]
In 2012, the Conference announced it will be moving its headquarters from its current location in Park Ridge, Illinois to neighboring Rosemont by the end of 2013.  The new office building is situated within the Rosemont Financial District, right alongside Interstate 294.  The move into the building was finalized on October 14, 2013.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20131013/news/710139913/ |title=Big Ten Conference moves into Rosemont headquarters |publisher=DailyHerald.com |date=2013-10-13 |accessdate=2014-03-28[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20120716/business/707169849/ |title=Big Ten relocating headquarters to Rosemont |publisher=DailyHerald.com |date=2012-07-17 |accessdate=2014-03-28[/tpl]http://www.ratioarchitects.com/assets/uploads/Big_Ten_Headquarters.pdf

==Commissioners==

The office of the commissioner of athletics was created in 1922 "to study athletic problems of the various member universities and assist in enforcing the eligibility rules which govern Big Ten athletics."

==Academics & Committee on Institutional Cooperation==

The Big Ten Conference is known for its academics as well as its athletics. Prior to the addition of Nebraska on July 1, 2011, it was the only Division I conference to have all its members in the Association of American Universities (AAU).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aau.edu/about/article.aspx?id=5476 |title=Association of American Universities |publisher=Aau.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07[/tpl] Nebraska was removed from the AAU in April 2011, due to the AAU no longer allowing Nebraska to include their Medical Center in the AAU formula and the decreased weight given to agricultural research. Commissioner Jim Delany stated that Nebraska's removal from the AAU would have no bearing upon their Big Ten membership. However, Nebraska does lead the NCAA with a record of 291 Academic All-Americans (followed by Notre Dame with 221).[tpl]cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=6480763&campaign=rss&source=NCFHeadlines |title=Jim Delany: Nebraska the Packers of Big Ten - ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2011-05-05 |accessdate=2012-11-07[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.huskers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=100&ATCLID=3943 |title=CoSIDA Academic All-Americans - Huskers.com - Nebraska Athletics Official Web Site |publisher=Huskers.com |date=2012-06-21 |accessdate=2012-11-07[/tpl] All three future Big Ten members—all-sports members Maryland and Rutgers, plus men's lacrosse affiliate Johns Hopkins—are also AAU members. Currently no Division I conference has all its members in the AAU, but a Division III conference, University Athletic Association, is composed of entirely AAU members.
The Big Ten also runs the Committee on Institutional Cooperation along with the University of Chicago, which allows students at participating institutions to take distance courses at other participating institutions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cic.net/Home/Projects/SharedCourses.aspx |title=Sharing Access to Courses |publisher=Cic.net |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07[/tpl] Students at participating schools are also allowed "in-house" viewing privileges at other participating schools' libraries.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cic.net/Home/Projects/Library/ReciprocalBorrowing.aspx |title=Reciprocal Library Borrowing - Introduction |publisher=Cic.net |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07[/tpl] They also employ collective purchasing, which has saved member institutions $19 million to date.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cic.net/Home/Projects/PurchasingLicensing.aspx |title=Purchasing and Licensing |publisher=Cic.net |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07[/tpl]

===Big Ten Conference football rivalry games===

===Bowl games===

Since 1946, the Big Ten champion has had a tie-in with the Rose Bowl game. Michigan appeared in the first bowl game, the 1902 Rose Bowl. After that, the Big Ten did not allow their schools to participate in bowl games, until the agreement struck with the Pacific Coast Conference for the 1947 Rose Bowl. From 1946 through 1971, the Big Ten did not allow the same team to represent the conference in consecutive years in the Rose Bowl with an exception made after the 1961 season in which Minnesota played in the 1962 Rose Bowl after playing in the 1961 Rose Bowl due to Ohio State declining the bid because of Ohio State faculty concerns about academics. Due to their "Rose Bowl or bust" policy, the 1972, 1973 and 1974 Michigan squads did not play in bowl games despite posting 10 wins in each season.
It was not until the 1975 season that the Big Ten allowed teams to play in bowl games other than the Rose Bowl. Michigan, which had been shut out of the postseason the previous three years, was the first beneficiary of the new rule when it played in the Orange Bowl vs. Oklahoma. Due to the pre-1975 rules, Big Ten teams such as Michigan and Ohio State have lower numbers of all-time bowl appearances than powerhouse teams from the Big 12 Conference (previously Big Eight and Southwest Conferences) and Southeastern Conference, which always placed multiple teams in bowl games every year.
Starting in the 2014-2015 season, a new slate of bowl game selections will include several new bowl games.[tpl]cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/bigten/post/_/id/79872/b1g-to-share-spot-in-gator-music-city-bowls|title=B1G to share Gator, Music City bowl tie-ins - July 18, 2013, |accessdate=2013-12-08[/tpl]
† The Big Ten, along with the SEC, will be eligible to face the ACC representative in the Orange Bowl at least three out of the eight seasons that it does not host a semifinal for the Playoff over a 12-year span. Notre Dame will be chosen the other two years if eligible.
‡ The Big Ten and ACC will switch between the Music City and Gator bowls on alternating years.
^ The Big Ten and Big 12 will switch between the Heart of Dallas and Armed Forces bowls on alternating years.

====Bowl selection procedures====

Although the pick order usually corresponds to the conference standings, the bowls are not required to make their choices strictly according to the won-lost records; many factors influence bowl selections, especially the likely turnout of the team's fans. Picks are made after BCS selections; the bowl with the #2 pick will have the first pick of the remaining teams in the conference.
The Capital One (first choice) and Outback (second) Bowls can select any eligible team except a team that has two fewer wins or two more losses, in all games, than another eligible team.  If a second conference team is selected for a BCS bowl, the two-win/loss requirement is not applicable for the Outback Bowl. The remaining picks are made in order without restrictions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/big10/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/2011-12/misc_non_event/B1GFootballRelease1128.pdf|title=Big Ten Football weekly release - November 28, 2011, page 7|accessdate=2011-12-05[/tpl]
