The Seawolves ended their regular season 6–5, 5–1 in Big South play to earn it second straight Big South conference title shared with Liberty and Coastal Carolina.

===Recruitment===

In the off-season Hofstra University, Stony Brook’s Long Island rivals, announced that it would cut its football team for future season after 2009 leaving the Seawolves as the sole college football team in the long island area. As NCAA rules state, when a college team is cut, football athletes that transfer to another school don’t need to meet residency requirements to start play. This led to five incoming transfer from Hofstra to begin play at Stony Brook including Miguel Mayonet, and Brock Jackolski for the 2010 season.
