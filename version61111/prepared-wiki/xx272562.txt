Bardon Latrobe Football Club, based at Bardon in Brisbane, Queensland, is one of the largest junior soccer clubs in Brisbane, with over 500 registered players.Bardon Latrobe Junior Soccer Club official website This iteration of the club was formed with the merging in 1970 of the Latrobe Soccer Club and the Bardon Soccer Football Club, two of the oldest clubs in the Brisbane football competition (the two clubs had previously merged for the 1941 season, as 'Latrobe-Bardon Soccer Club').
Although the local records are incomplete, the merged club, through its antecedent Latrobe Football Club (formed in 1916) appears to have had the longest continuous participation of any extant club in the Brisbane football competition. Whilst the Bardon Latrobe club's main focus since the merger has been predominantly on junior boys and girls' football, the club now has senior men's and women's teams playing in the Brisbane competition.
The club, previously known as 'Bardon Latrobe Junior Soccer Club', was officially renamed 'Bardon Latrobe Football Club' in 2014.

==Club history==

===1970 merger===

The contemporary club was originally formed as the 'Bardon Latrobe Soccer Football Club' for the 1970 season, with the merger of the Latrobe Soccer Club, then based at Gregory Park, Milton, and the Bardon Soccer Football Club, based at Bowman Park Bardon (see below). The merged club then played at Bowman Park, fielding both junior and senior teams, where it continues to play to this day.Football Brisbane official website: Bardon Latrobe Junior Soccer Club The reason for the merger is not recorded, but it is likely the two clubs did so to take advantage of their respective strengths in junior and senior football.
During the 1960s, the Bardon club had a reasonably large junior section, but its senior side was struggling and was relegated to the Third Division in 1969. Conversely, the Latrobe club had abandoned junior football in the mid-1960s and, despite winning three senior men's First Division premierships during the same period, had been relegated to the Second Division competition for season 1969.Football Brisbane official website history page: QSF First Division 1968 Points Table However, Latrobe won that Second Division premiership, providing the newly-merged club with promotion to the First Division for the 1970 season.

===Senior football===

The newly merged club played its first season in the senior First Division (then the top tier in Brisbane football), where it finished a creditable fourth out of ten teams.Football Brisbane official website history page: QSF First Division 1970 Points Table The club continued playing in the First Division, but by 1976 was struggling financially as well as competitively. The decision was made to transfer the senior and reserve teams to the Mitchelton Football Club, where it would play the 1977 season as Bardon Latrobe, before being absorbed into the Mitchelton club. The club then decided to focus exclusively on junior football and was renamed the 'Bardon Latrobe Junior Soccer Club'.Mitchelton FC official website: History Despite this, a number of players subsequently elected to return to the Bardon Latrobe club and re-entered the Brisbane senior competition in the late 1970s as 'Bardon Latrobe Juniors', in a low division. The team won a number of premierships and regular promotion, culminating in promotion to Division 1 (the second tier of the newly re-structured Brisbane competition) in 1983, where they finished eighth out of twelve teams.OzFootball website: archive
There are few available records of the senior club after this time, but it is known that the seniors merged with the Valley Soccer club to form the Latrobe Valley club, playing in Brisbane Division 3 from 1992 to 1994,Football Brisbane official website history page: QSF Divisional Points Tables 1992, then reformed as Latrobe Athletic for the 1997 and 1998 seasons in 'Amateur' Division 1 of the Brisbane competition.Football Brisbane official website history page: QSF Divisional Points Tables 1997 After several seasons without a senior side, Bardon Latrobe re-entered the Brisbane senior competition in 2011, playing in the (amateur) Metropolitan League.Football Brisbane official website: Results - 2011

===Junior football===

Since 1971, the junior club has established a tradition of reciprocal tours with the Georges River Junior Soccer Club (Oyster Bay, New South Wales), where each year Under 12 and Under 13 teams from each club travel to compete socially against the other club.Georges River (NSW) Soccer Club: official website
In 2011, the club earned the 'Junior Club of the Year Award', presented by Football Brisbane and based on a range of criteria, including the performance of the teams and quality of club management.Football Brisbane official website

===Club colours===

As noted above, the club plays in a predominantly red strip, similar to the colour of the original Latrobe club's outfit. The reason this colour was selected by Latrobe is not recorded, but it may be a reference to the original name of their home ground, the 'Red Jacket Swamp' (see 'Gregory Park' below).

==Original Bardon Soccer Football Club==

===The club===

The original Bardon club was formed in the late 1920s, fielding junior teams (at that time Under 21), with few senior teams until after World War II. The senior club played as an amateur club, and remained so during its separate existence, typically playing in the second and third tiers of the Brisbane competition. As well as this, the club continued to field junior boys’ teams, but no junior girls or women's teams.

===Beginnings===

There are few known records for the original Bardon club, but anecdotal evidence has it that the club was formed in 1926 (the year after the area was officially renamed 'Bardon' from Upper Paddington),NLA Trove website: Brisbane Courier 30 September 1925 and playing at Bowman Park. The Brisbane Courier reported in early 1926 that the "Soccer Football Association ... leased the grounds in Bowman Park".NLA Trove website: Brisbane Courier 14 April 1926 The club was certainly in existence by 1928, as the Brisbane Courier reported in March that year that it had leased Bowman Park for winter sports for £5 pounds - approximately AUD350 in 2010RBA Inflation Calculator).NLA Trove website: Brisbane Courier 22 March 1928 By the late 1920s, the club was well established, as evidenced by a newspaper report describing its end of season social at the Foresters' Hall, Paddington. The report listed the social committee as Mesdames Lansbury, Watson, Charrington, Thorpe, and Brewer and the secretary Mr M.Rowe.NLA Trove website: Brisbane Courier 11 October 1929
Bardon SFC may have been almost exclusively a junior club during those early years: it does not appear often in newspaper reports from the 1920s and 30s, and those few reports typically refer only to junior teams (at the time, 'junior' included players up to 21 years of age). The first known report of a senior team was in 1936 (see below).

===1930s===

By 1931, the club featured three junior teams: First Grade, Third Grade and Third Grade B Division. A newspaper report early that year noted that "Bardons sic have also been strengthened and should give a better account of themselves."
NLA Trove website: Brisbane Courier 8 April 1931 In 1937, the Rovers fielded a team in each of the 'Junior' Second and Third Grades.NLA Trove website: Courier-Mail 22 June 1937 Despite not being in the top grade, one of the Bardon players, Wally Cansick, was selected for the Queensland Junior team to play New South Wales in that year.NLA Trove website: Courier-Mail 3 August 1937 Cansick was to later play for Grange Thistle Soccer Club and for Queensland at senior level.Grange Thistle Soccer Club official website: History Another player, Alf Jones, played in the Brisbane side against Ipswich in the same year. One of the State selectors at that match, William Harper, was to influence the fortunes of the Latrobe club in the 1960s (see below).NLA Trove website: Courier-Mail 27 August 1937
The earliest known report of a Bardon senior team was when Bardon Rovers nominated for the Third Grade in 1936 (whilst early reports referred to the club as 'Bardon', those in the mid-30s refer to the club as 'Bardon Rovers').NLA Trove website: Courier-Mail 11 March 1936 However, by season 1939, the club had reverted to fielding only junior teams.NLA Trove website: Courier-Mail 16 June 1939 Curiously, a newspaper report in 1939 refers to both 'Bardon' and 'Bardon Rovers' competing in the Stewart Shield (a junior competition) at the same time on the same dayNLA Trove website: Courier-Mail 31 May 1939 (it is possible the teams were the same club, but from different grades). As well as this, a newspaper report in 1941 refers to the club being founded in 1933 by Bill Trinder.NLA Trove website: Courier-Mail 24 April 1941 A newspaper advertisement in early 1939 also referred to the Bardon Rovers: "JUNIOR Soccer. Bardon Rovers require second grade players guernseys and socks free. Meetings Friday nights, Trinder's Boot Factory, Bardon. FO273. E. Jarvis, Secretary."NLA Trove website: Courier-Mail 5 May 1939

===Club colours===

The club played in maroon and white colours (as noted in a newspaper report in 1929) and maintained those colours until the merger with Latrobe in 1970.

==Original Latrobe Football Club==

===The club===

The original Latrobe Football Club was one of the most successful and influential clubs in the Brisbane football competitions, winning nine first grade premierships between the 1920s and 1970, behind only Lions FC (11 premierships between the 1950s and the 2000s) and Dinmore Bush Rats (10 premierships between the 1890s and 1960s), as well as numerous cup competitions (see History of association football in Brisbane, Queensland). The club is most likely named for the nearby Paddington real estate subdivision, the 'Latrobe Estate', carried out in the late 1870s.NLA Trove website: Brisbane Courier - 11 April 1879 This subdivision occurred after the closure of the Paddington Cemetery (now the site of Suncorp Stadium) in 1875, and the creation of Given/Latrobe Terraces through that site. The estate was, presumably, named for the former Lieutenant-Governor of Victoria Charles La Trobe, who died in 1875.

===Beginnings===

Again, there are few known existing records for the original Latrobe club, but anecdotal evidence has it that it was formed in 1916. This is supported by a newspaper report from 1933, which refers to the then Latrobe captain, Edgar Rigby, as having been "connected the club since 1916".NLA Trove website: Brisbane Courier 18 March 1933 However, the Latrobe club does not appear in newspaper reports until 1917,NLA Trove website: Brisbane Courier - 4 June 1917 playing in the Brisbane third grade competition with its home ground recorded as 'Milton' (the precise location of their field is not recorded, but was most likely at Gregory Park - see below). This is likely because the local competition organisers, the Queensland British Football Association, decided early in 1916 "That no competition be held in the Senior, First or Second Grade competitions and that no player of military age be allowed to take part in a lower competition ... but clubs ... should be allowed to play friendly matches."NLA Trove website: Brisbane Courier - 20 March 1916
It has also been suggested that the club is descended from the 'Rag-Tag Football Club', which had also played at Gregory Park from the early 1900s. However, this is unikely, as the latter club was still playing in the Brisbane competition as late as 1918.NLA Trove website: Brisbane Courier - 29 April 1918 Given the number of clubs that were formed and disbanded during the early years of Brisbane football, it is possible that Latrobe may have been formed as a breakaway club from the 'Rag-Tag' club, or from the Milton Club (formed around 1903), but there is no known connection between the Latrobe club and either of these two clubs.
NLA Trove website: Brisbane Courier - 8 June 1903
Latrobe contested the third grade premiership in its inaugural season (1917), playing the final against 'Ellenas' (another Milton-based team) at Gregory Park, but losing 1-0.NLA Trove website: Brisbane Courier - 1 October 1917 By 1919, the club remained in the Third Grade (but in its 'A Division') of the four-division competition.NLA Trove website: Brisbane Courier - 16 May 1919Brisbane Courier - 6 October 1919
A newspaper report in 1941 asserts that Arthur Trinder was one of the club's "foundation members" (see 'Latrobe-Bardon Soccer Club (1941)' below).

===1920s===

After several years in the lower divisions, the club was finally promoted to the first grade in 1924, where it finished fifth out of six teams. The club appeared to be well established by the mid-1920s, as it featured in the Brisbane Courier with a photograph entitled "Among the metropolitan football clubs". The team was listed as R. Patterson, T. Kitson, R. Wilson, H. Gilbert, R. Whitalan, J. Carlton - probably 'Carton' - see below, J. Andersley, L. Rose, A. Chittern, H. Simpson, F. Hollywood (sec. and vice-capt.), F. Hayward (pres.), R. Patterson, D. Speechley, G. Findlay, D. Lord (capt.), J. Morrisey, H. Blackmore, J. Scriven.NLA Trove website: Brisbane Courier 16 November 1925
For season 1925, the club fared little better in the league but, despite this, acquired its first major silverware, winning the Tristram Shield (a 'knockout' competition), defeating the Thistle club 4-1 in the final. The club also won the Charity Cup, where they "outclassed" that season's Premiers, Pineapple Rovers, 5-2 in the semi-final,NLA Trove website: Brisbane Courier 28 September 1925 then defeated Dinmore Wanderers 3-1 in the final at the "Woolloongabba Cricket Ground" (now the Brisbane cricket ground),NLA Trove website: Brisbane Courier 5 October 1925 at that time the headquarters of soccer in Brisbane.
The club lost in the final of the Tristram Shield the following year (to Blackstone Rovers), but then proceeded to win this shield a further six times between 1927 and 1934.SoccerAust website: retrieved 24 August 2013
In the ensuing years, the club climbed the ladder progressively, finishing second in 1928, then finished undefeated premiers in 1929, with a goal difference of 28 over fourteen matches.Football Brisbane website: Retrieved 18 June 2012 That season, the club won all of the available trophies, also including the Challenge Cup and the Tristram Shield.Brisbane Courier 16 September 1929
The 1929 squad comprised the following players: Nixon (goalkeeper); L. Viertel and E. (Edgar) Rigby (fullbacks); Bowen, A.E (Bert) Murray and E. Korotcoff (halfbacks); E. Alexander, Bell, J. (Jim) Carton, H. Gorring and Taylor (forwards). The club clearly had a very strong squad, as its players comprised over half of that season's Brisbane representative squad: Rigby (vice-captain), Murray, Korotcoff, Alexander, Carton, Viertel, Gorring and H. Ross.NLA Trove website: Brisbane Courier - 28 May 1929

===1930s===

Around 1930, the club became known as the Latrobe Soccer Club (rather than 'Football Club'), with the Brisbane Cricket Ground as its home ground. This proved to be the club's most successful period, when it won five premierships in a row (1929 to 1933) and a sixth in 1935.Football Brisbane official website: Competition History
In 1935 the Queensland Soccer Council (QSC) took over the lease of Lang Park as its home ground (and thus leaving the Brisbane Cricket Ground)NLA Trove website: Brisbane Courier Mail - 30 March 1935 and Latrobe became a sub-tenant, using the ground for its home games.NLA Trove website: Brisbane Courier Mail 21 January 1937 However, by 1937, the QSC was considering sub-leasing Lang Park to "another code of football" as it "was not satisfied with the financial returns ... under the sub-lease to the Latrobe-Milton club".NLA Trove website: Brisbane Courier Mail - 21 January 1937 Latrobe in turn responded that "If no action is taken to introduce the Ipswich clubs into the Brisbane competition this season ... the Latrobe-Milton Club cannot accept an increase in rental for Lang Park. Give us competition play with Ipswich and my club will hold the ground as headquarters for the code."NLA Trove website: Brisbane Courier Mail - 29 January 1937 The matter was resolved after much negotiation between the QSC and the tenant clubs, which could explain the QSC's decision to merge the Brisbane and Ipswich associations for the 1937 season, when the Ipswich and Brisbane teams resumed competition together for the first time since 1929.NLA Trove website: Brisbane Courier Mail - 24 February 1937
The Latrobe club returned to Gregory Park after World War II, where it remained until the merger with Bardon in 1970.NLA Trove website: Courier-Mail 23 August 1946

===1940s===

1940 saw the formation of the Queensland Soccer Football Association (QSFA) and problems for the game: the major Ipswich clubs initially decided not to affiliate with the QSFA, as they considered it was "unconstitutional". Those clubs, with the exception of St Helens, ultimately joined the Brisbane competition for that year, after some Ipswich players joined Brisbane clubs to continue their playing careers. Latrobe boasted "four international players", including two former Bundamba players, which suggests that Latrobe (if not other clubs as well) was operating on a semi-professional basis, in order to attract players from relatively distant locations (despite this being 'illegal' under the QSFA rules at that time). A newspaper article in 1940 appears to confirm this by reporting criticism of "certain first division clubs ... which continued to offer inducements to younger players to leave the club ..."NLA Trove website: Brisbane Courier Mail - 26 March 1940 Notwithstanding Latrobe's strong squad, the Corinthians club won the Premiership that season.
For the 1941 season, Latrobe merged with Bardon to form the Latrobe-Bardon Soccer Club, but the merger lasted only one season (see Latrobe-Bardon Soccer Club (1941) below). As noted, the Brisbane competition was suspended from 1942 to 1944 and Latrobe re-entered the Brisbane senior competition in 1946. The club subsequently finished last in season 1947 and was relegated to Division 2.

===1950s===

This decade was a lean period for the club, playing in Division 2 until winning the league in 1961, thus gaining promotion to the First Division for season 1962 (see also '1960s' below).Football Brisbane official website: Men's Competition Results

===1960s===

This decade saw a revival in the club's fortunes, with their return to the top grade in 1962. This was likely as a result of the efforts of William ('Pop') Harper, who had migrated to Australia from the United Kingdom in the early 1900s, and was involved with the game in Brisbane from at least the 1930s as a selector and referee (as noted above). Harper encouraged British and Irish migrants to come to the Latrobe club from the early 1960s with offers of jobs, accommodation and semi-professional football.NLA Trove website: William Harper 1966Wikipedia article Aylesham (United Kingdom) As a result, the team predominantly comprised overseas players during this decade, and won three first grade premierships: 1964, 1966 and 1967 (the last as 'Latrobe-Wests Soccer Club'). Despite this, the club finished last in 1968 and was relegated to the second grade for season 1969.Football Brisbane official website: Mens Competition Archive

==Latrobe-Bardon Soccer Club (1941)==

The Latrobe and Bardon clubs had previously merged for the 1941 season, as the 'Latrobe-Bardon Soccer Club', playing senior matches at Gregory Park, Milton. Newspaper records from the time suggest that the clubs were exclusively 'senior' and 'junior' clubs respectively,NLA Trove website: Brisbane Courier-Mail 4 April 1941 so this merger may have resulted from Bardon's strong performance in junior football (under 21) in 1940, where its first grade team won the premiership and included several Brisbane and Queensland representatives (including H. Jones sic, F. Cansick and S. Cansick (Queensland) and D. Barry).
A newspaper report in early 1941 noted "Latrobe Merge with Junior Premiers ... The amalgamation of Latrobe and Bardon, last year's first grade junior premiers, is the most important of many moves made by senior soccer clubs this season. The club will be known as Latrobe-Bardon, and four of the former Bardon players will play their first senior football against Booval at Booval to-morrow."NLA Trove website: Courier-Mail 4 April 1942 Another newpaper report that year said "TWENTY years ago Arthur Trinder was a foundation member of the Latrobe Club, which has been five times in succession soccer premiers. His brother, Bill, formed the Bardon Club in 1933, and its junior team was undefeated in fixtures last season. Now the Latrobe and Bardon Clubs have combined, and some of last year's Bardon juniors are getting their chance in A grade. They include Alf. Jones, E. Jarvis, F. and W. Cansick, and D. Barry is noteworthy that the dates in this report do not appear to be accurate when compared with other public records. However, this merger did not survive the suspension of football fixtures from 1942 to 1944 (during the war years), as Latrobe re-appeared as a stand-alone club in the 1946 senior competition.NLA Trove website: Courier-Mail 5 April 1946

==Latrobe Ladies Football Club==

The Latrobe club has the distinction of having formed one of the earliest known women’s teams in Australian football history: the Latrobe Ladies’ Football Club, in 1921 (see photograph at right). The club played 'friendly' matches in the newly formed Queensland Ladies Soccer Football Association, which included two other clubs, North Brisbane and South Brisbane. Remarkably, about 10,000 spectators attended at the Brisbane Cricket Ground in late 1921 to watch a ladies' match (between North Brisbane and South Brisbane).NLA Trove website: Cairns Post 26 September 1921 The annual meeting of the association in 1922 expressed the desire to commence regular fixtures during the forthcoming season with "about half a dozen teams",NLA Trove website: Brisbane Courier - 25 February 1922  but there are no known records of the progress of this association after that time.
The Bardon Latrobe club has fielded junior girl's teams for many years, and in 2012 entered a women's team in the Brisbane senior competition.Football Brisbane official website: 'Fixtures & Results'

==Bowman Park==

Bowman Park, home of the Bardon Latrobe club, is located at the junction of Simpsons Road, David Avenue and Bowman Parade and bounded by Ithaca Creek, Bardon.
The first land sales in this area, west of the locality then known as Upper Paddington, were held in 1862, with purchasers including Francis Lyon, who purchased the area now including Bowman Park (which was originally known as the 'Cobbler's Flats', because of the "superabundance of pest weed called cobblers pegs"). Another purchaser was Joshua Jeays (Brisbane Municipal Council alderman, then mayor in 1864), who built a house on his land in 1863 and named it 'Bardon', after Bardon Hill in his native Leicestershire, after which the suburb was officially named in 1925 (the building is now part of the nearby St Joseph's school campus).'Streets of Brisbane' website
A letter to the editor of the Brisbane Courier in 1911, arguing against the conversion of the Paddington Cemetery (now the site of Lang Park) to a sports ground, suggested that:
Another writer in the same year added "I am given to understand that the whole of this beautiful spot can be purchased for £2000 AUD140,000 in 2010RBA Inflation Calculator. This is an opportunity that ought not to be neglected ... Already hundreds of persons from Brisbane visit Bardon flat on holidays and Sundays."NLA Trove website: Brisbane Courier 7 September 1911
The land was subsequently subdivided for residential development in 1915 and an area of 18 acres (approximately 7 hectares) was reserved then named 'Bowman Park' in 1916 (after David Bowman (1860–1916), former MLA for Warrego and Fortitude Valley, leader of Queensland Labor Party from 1907 to 1912, and Home Secretary in the first majority Labor Government in Queensland's history).NLA Trove website: David Bowman biography Early transport to Upper Paddington was by horse omnibus, then electric trams that reached Macgregor Terrace in 1909. The tram service was not extended to Bowman Park until 1937, eleven years after the establishment of the original Bardon soccer club.'Queensland Places' website
The ground is also home to the West Brisbane Cricket Club, which has played there since that club's formation in 1921.West Brisbane Cricket Club official website

==Gregory Park==

Gregory Park, former home of the original Latrobe club, is located at the intersection of Baroona and Haig Roads, Milton, adjoining the present Milton State School (itself established on the site in 1889).Milton State School official website The park is located on what was originally known as the 'Red Jacket Swamp', part of a string of lagoons which stretched from the then suburb of Rosalie (now part of Paddington), through the former Milton Tennis Centre to the Brisbane River. The origin of the name 'Red Jacket Swamp' is not certain - various legends had that it was named for a soldier's lost jacket, a resident bird species, or for the iron salts in the water that stained local boys' clothing a dull red colour.NLA Trove website: Brisbane Courier 20 May 1893 Another report in a 1931 newspaper noted that "According to old residents ... the swamp received its name from a small flower-like weed that flourished in its muddy waters, during certain months of the year the leaves-no larger than a threepenny piece-would change in hue to brick red."NLA Trove website: Brisbane Courier 30 May 1931
In 1898, the Milton school headmaster, Mr Alfred Wall, advised the local M.L.A. Mr Thomas Finney regarding the swamp that "If it was raised 2ft. 6in. or 3ft. mm, it could be converted into a healthy place, and might be grassed over and planted with shade trees. The area would make a very pleasant park and sports ground ...".NLA Trove website: Brisbane Courier 12 November 1898 The swamp was finally drained and filled in the early 1900s, reserved as public space and named the Rosalie Recreation Reserve. The reserve became the home of the Milton Rangers Football Club around 1903 (as noted above) and the Milton Cricket Club, which celebrated the opening of its new concrete wicket in November 1906.NLA Trove website: Brisbane Courier 24 November 1926 The reserve was subsequently renamed 'Gregory Park' in late 1905, to honour Sir Augustus Gregory, Queensland's Surveyor-General from 1859 to 1879, who had died in June 1905. Gregory had been a nearby resident and had agitated for the reclamation works at the Red Jacket Swamp.NLA Trove website: Brisbane Courier 11 October 1930
The earliest known record of the use of goal nets in Brisbane was at Gregory Park, for the opening game of the 1907 season between the Milton Football Club and Ipswich club Dinmore Bush Rats (which Dinmore won 4-1).NLA Trove website: Brisbane Courier - 29 April 1907 Other soccer clubs, including 'St Ellena's', 'Mallina', 'Rag-Tag' and 'Gregory Rovers' (and possibly 'Fernberg'), were also reported as playing at Milton in the early 1900s.NLA Trove website: Brisbane Courier - 30 June 1913 Most of these clubs do not appear in the public records after World War I.
