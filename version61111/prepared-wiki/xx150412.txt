[[Dwarf pufferfish]]

CATEGORIES: Carinotetraodon, Fishkeeping, Animals described in 1941

The dwarf pufferfish, also known as the Malabar pufferfish, pea pufferfish or pygmy pufferfish, Carinotetraodon travancoricus is a small, freshwater pufferfish endemic to the River Pamba in Kerala, Southwest India. Maximum size is 22 mm (less than one inch), making it one of the smallest pufferfish in the world.[tpl]cite book |author=Klaus Ebert |year=2001 |title=The Puffers of Fresh and Brackish Water |publisher=Aqualog |isbn=3-931702-60-X |pages=19, 46–49[/tpl] Although closely related to marine pufferfish, they are not found in brackish or salt water, and reports to the contrary may be based on misidentification.Schäfer F.

==Description==

Sexing of juveniles is impossible because these fish "choose" their sex as they mature. Once one puffer begins becoming a male he excretes hormones to prevent the other puffers from becoming male. However, if two fish start to mature into males at the same time one will become the dominant male.There is also a dorsal crest, but it lacks special colouration when not erected. Both crests are displayed during courtship while the male circles the female. They also will have more yellow colouration. 
Both sexes are primarily yellow with dark green to black iridescent patches on the flanks and dorsal surface, but as with other members of the genus, sexual dimorphism is apparent in mature fish, with males being more brightly coloured than females. Males can also have a dark stripe down the  center of their pale belly and iridescent "eye wrinkle" patterns that females do not have. Females are more rounded, tend to be a bit larger than males, and may or may not show more smallish spots between their larger dark markings.

==Reproduction==

Often dwarf pufferfish are plant-spawners, laying eggs in plants, including java moss in aquariums. Eggs have been seen to hatch after five days at [tpl]convert|27|C|F[/tpl], with fry initially feeding on infusoria, brine shrimp when they're a week old, and finally regular-sized food when possible.Ralph, Chris (2003). Practical Fishkeeping: Pufferfish, p. 61. ISBN 1-86054-233-6 Dwarf pufferfish have also been known to scatter their eggs on the substrate hidden within vegetation. The eggs are fertilized externally. They do not guard their eggs or fry.
After the eggs hatch, take out the fry; it is not recommended that you keep the adults and the fry together. A small tank of about ten gallons is acceptable.[tpl]cite web|url=http://filaman.ifm-geomar.de/Reproduction/FishReproSummary.cfm?ID=25293&GenusName=Carinotetraodon&SpeciesName=travancoricus&fc=448&StockCode=20036|title=Reproduction Summary: Carinotetraodon travancoricus|author=Froese, R. and D.

==Conservation==

Dwarf pufferfish are not used as food but are traded as aquarium fish. It has been classified as "vulnerable" on the IUCN Red List due to changes in habitat and overharvesting for the aquarium trade. 

==Diet==

The diet of dwarf pufferfish in the wild has not been reported, but other members of the genus feed on zooplankton and various benthic crustaceans and molluscs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://filaman.ifm-geomar.de/TrophicEco/FoodItemsList.cfm?vstockcode=19922&genus=Carinotetraodon&species=lorteti&CFID=2205913&CFTOKEN=31807211|title=Food Items Reported for Carinotetraodon lorteti |author=Froese, R. and D. Pauly. Editors.|publisher=FishBase|accessdate=2007-03-07[/tpl] Food items of specimens maintained in aquaria appears to be similar.  In fact, the dwarf puffer is one of the few aquarium fish to regularly eat small live snails and can be useful in controlling snail populations (larger snails do not interest them).

==Dwarf pufferfish in aquaria==

Dwarf pufferfish have become quite popular as aquarium fish thanks to their attractive colours, small size, and relative ease of maintenance. Like all pufferfish, they can be aggressive, especially towards creatures smaller than themselves, and it is commonly recommended to keep them in a dedicated "species only" tank. A female to male ratio of 2 to 1 is sometimes recommended to reduce aggression in captive fish.
Despite what the fish stores may indicate, flake fish food is not a recommended diet for Dwarf Puffers, and many fish will refuse to take this food. If you are persistent, you may be able to feed them dried worms, and they will eat live (and frozen) bloodworms with relish. Puffers are notoriously messy eaters, it is therefore important not to overfeed, and to employ a good filtration system.
They may also eat small shrimp, or can be kept with them as some individuals may or may not eat shrimp kept in the same tank. Red ramshorn snails, Live & frozen bloodworms, brine shrimp, and triops are good foods for Dwarf Puffers.
When this fish is first introduced into your tank you will notice it travels around with its tail curved. This is normal and is a sign of defence. As the puffer ages and becomes used to its environment then this tail curling will disappear other than when sleeping or napping, or when examining an object while keeping it in clear sight directly in front of the fish.
Known to be fearless and aggressive, they can and will take on fish larger than themselves. Very intelligent, dwarf puffers have been known to recognize their owners, and beg for food. Dwarf puffers will provide hours of entertainment to their owner as they relentlessly hunt for snails. Keeping a large group of 5-6 puffers can help defuse aggression between individuals.
