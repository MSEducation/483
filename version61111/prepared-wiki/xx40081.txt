[[Assisted suicide]]

CATEGORIES: Disability rights, Euthanasia, Medical ethics, Suicide methods, Assisted suicide

Assisted suicide is suicide committed by someone with assistance from others, typically to end suffering from a severe physical illness.http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/assisted%20suicide It is often confused with euthanasia (sometimes called "mercy killing").  Euthanasia is the killing of another in order to relieve dire suffering, whereas assisted suicide is a practice in which an individual provides a competent patient with assistance, but where the individual brings about their own death, such as when a physician provides a prescription for a lethal dose of medication, upon the patient's request, which the patient intends to use to end his or her own life.http://depts.washington.edu/bioethx/topics/pad.html
Discussion of assisted suicide centers on legal, religious, and moral conceptions of suicide and a personal "right to die". Legally speaking, the practice may be legal, illegal, or undecided, depending on the culture or jurisdiction.

==Reasons for seeking==

The most important reasons for requesting assistance with suicide, among patients who received prescriptions for lethal medications, were a desire to control the circumstances of death, a desire to die at home, the belief that continuing to live was pointless, and being ready to die. Depression and other psychiatric disorders, lack of social support, and concern about being a financial drain were, according to nurses, relatively unimportant.[ref]Pearlman, Robert.

==Legality==

Euthanasia is legal in Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Assisted suicide where the patient has to take the final action themselves (unlike euthanasia) is legal in Switzerland.  There are assisted dying laws, for terminally ill mentally competent adults only, in the US states of Oregon, Washington and Vermont.

==Legality by country==

===Australia===

Assisted suicide is currently illegal throughout Australia, but was for a time legal in the Northern Territory under the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995.

===Belgium===

The "Euthanasia Act" legalized euthanasia in Belgium in 2002,http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/cgi/article_body.pl?language=nl&pub_date=2002-06-22&numac=2002009590&caller=summaryhttp://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/cgi/article_body.pl?language=fr&pub_date=2002-06-22&numac=2002009590&caller=summary but it didn't cover assisted suicide.[tpl]cite journal |author=Adams M, Nys H |title=Comparative reflections on the Belgian Euthanasia Act 2002 |journal=Med Law Rev |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=353–76 |year=2003 |pmid=16733879 |doi=10.1093/medlaw/11.3.353[/tpl]
In 2006, Belgium legalized partial euthanasia with certain regulations.[tpl]clarify|date=February 2011[/tpl]

===Canada===

Suicide is not a crime in Canada, but physician-assisted suicide is considered illegal.[tpl]cite book | last = Whiting | first = Raymond | title = A Natural Right to Die: Twenty-Three Centuries of Debate | year = 2002 | location = Westport, Connecticut | isbn = 0-313-31474-8[/tpl]
The Criminal Code of Canada states in section 241(b) that
  
 Every one who ….(b) aids or abets a person to commit suicide, whether suicide ensues or not, is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding fourteen years"[tpl]Cite book  | first = Eike-Henner W. | last = Kluge | editor-last = Prado | editor-first = C.G. | contribution = Assisted Suicide, Ethics and the Law: The Implication of Autonomy and Respect for Persons, Equality and Justice, and Beneficence | title = Assisted Suicide: Canadian Perspectives  | year = 2000  | pages = 83  | place = Ottawa, Canada | publisher = University of Ottawa Press[/tpl]
The reason behind its illegality owes to preventing people from 'assisting in suicide' those that are not mentally capable of making the decision and because of the "value that society places on human life" which "in the eyes of the law makers, might easily be eroded if assistance in committing suicide were to be decriminalized."
In 1993, the Supreme Court of Canada heard a case (Rodriguez v. British Columbia (Attorney General)) in which Sue Rodriguez, a terminally ill woman, challenged the prohibition of assisted suicide as contrary to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. In a 5 to 4 decision, the Court upheld the provision in the Criminal Code of Canada.
On June 15, 2012, the British Columbia Supreme Court struck down the prohibition against physician-assisted suicide, calling the current law discriminatory, disproportionate and overbroad. Justice Lynn Smith suspended her ruling for a period of one year in order to give Parliament time to draft legislation with her ruling in mind.http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/06/15/b-c-supreme-court-strikes-down-assisted-suicide-ban-as-unconstitutional/ Within a month, the federal government announced it would appeal that ruling.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2012/07/13/pol-cp-federal-appeal-assisted-suicide.html | work=CBC News[/tpl] On October 25, 2012, the federal government filed its 54-page legal argument, arguing inter alia that the purpose of the current legislation is "to protect the vulnerable, who might be induced in moments of weakness to commit suicide", that "it is a reflection of the state’s policy that the inherent value of all human life should not be depreciated by allowing one person to take another’s life", and that the B.C. Supreme Court had no right to attempt to overrule the Supreme Court of Canada’s ruling in the 1993 Rodriguez case.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/assisted-suicide-too-risky-federal-government-argues-in-appeal-against-bc-decision/article4673820/ | location=Toronto | work=The Globe and Mail | title=Assisted suicide too risky, federal government argues in appeal against B.C. decision | date=25 October 2012[/tpl] On December 10, 2012, the British Columbia Court of Appeal announced that it had scheduled a hearing for the appeal in March, 2013.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/story/2012/12/10/bc-right-to-die-appeal-intervenors-named.html | work=CBC News[/tpl]                                                                Suicide was considered a criminal offence in Canada until 1972, after which it was removed from the Criminal Code.

===China===

An article in People's Daily reported that "Nine people from Xi'an City in China made news when they 'jointly wrote to local media asking for euthanasia, or mercy killings'".[tpl]harvnb|McDougall|Gorman|2008|p=91[/tpl] These people had uremia, a disease due to the failure of the kidneys, and expressed their "unbearable suffering and unwillingness to burden their families any more".[tpl]harvnb|McDougall|Gorman|2008|p=90[/tpl] The article stated because it is illegal for doctors to help their patients die, all that could be done for them was to ask the doctors to ease their pain.

===Colombia===

Despite its strict Roman Catholic history,  in May 1997 Colombian courts allowed for the euthanasia of sick patients who requested to end their lives. This ruling came about owing to the efforts of a group that strongly opposed euthanasia. When one of its members brought a lawsuit to the Colombian Supreme Court against it, the court issued a 6 to 3 decision that "spelled out the rights of a terminally ill person to engage in voluntary euthanasia."
Though physician-assisted suicide is legal, the country has no way to document or set rules and regulations for doctors and patients that want to end their lives. Though it is opposed on religious grounds by many Colombians, many patients have still been able to find doctors to assist them in ending their lives.

===Denmark===

Denmark has no laws permitting assisted suicide.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.finalexit.org/assisted_suicide_world_laws_page2.html |publisher=Euthanasia Research & Guidance Organization |title=World Laws on Assisted Suicide |deadurl=no |accessdate=10 April 2014[/tpl]
Assisted suicide is illegal and punishable as manslaughter by up to 3 years.[tpl]fact|date=March 2014[/tpl]

===France===

The controversy over legalising euthanasia and physician assisted suicide is not as big as in the United States because of the country's "well developed hospice care programme".[tpl]harvnb|McDougall|Gorman|2008|p=84[/tpl] However, in 2000 the controversy over the uncontroversial topic was ignited with Vincent Humbert.  After a car crash that left him "unable to 'walk, see, speak, smell or taste'", he used the movement of his right thumb to write a book, I Ask the Right to Die (Je vous demande le droit de mourir) in which he voiced his desire to "die legally".  After his appeal was denied, his mother assisted in killing him by injecting him with an overdose of barbiturates that put him into a coma, killing him 2 days later. Though his mother was arrested for aiding in her son's death and later acquitted, the case did jumpstart a new legislation which states that when medicine serves "no other purpose than the artificial support of life" it can be "suspended or not undertaken".[tpl]harvnb|McDougall|Gorman|2008|p=86[/tpl]
In 2013 President Francois Hollande said that France should hold a national debate on the issue and stated his intention to introduce a bill to parliament before the end of the year. Opinion polls in France show that the majority of the public are in favour of an assisted suicide law,[tpl]cite news|last=Heneghan|first=Tom|title=Francois Hollande Pledges To Legalize Voluntary Euthanasia In France|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/01/francois-hollande-legalize-euthanasia-france_n_3529748.html|publisher=Huffington Post|date=1 July 2013[/tpl] however France's national ethics committee has advised against any change in the law.http://www.thelocal.fr/20130701/french-ethics-council-rejects-swiss-style-euthanasia

===Germany===

Killing somebody in accordance with his demands is always illegal under the German criminal code (Paragraph 216, "Killing at the request of the victim; mercy killing").
Assisting with suicide by, for example, providing poison or a weapon, is generally legal. Since suicide itself is legal, assistance or encouragement is not punishable by the usual legal mechanisms dealing with complicity and incitement (German criminal law follows the idea of "accessories of complicity" which states that "the motives of a person who incites another person to commit suicide, or who assists in its commission, are irrelevant").[ref]
</ref> Nor is assisting with suicide explicitly outlawed by the criminal code. There can however be legal repercussions under certain conditions for a number of reasons. Aside from laws regulating firearms, the trade and handling of controlled substances and the like (e.g. when acquiring poison for the suicidal person), this concerns three points:

====Free vs. manipulated will====

If the suicidal person is not acting out of his own free will, then assistance is punishable by any of a number of homicide offences that the criminal code provides for, as having "acted through another person" (§25, section 1 of the German criminal code, usually called "mittelbare Täterschaft"). Action out of free will is not ruled out by the decision to end one's life in itself; it can be assumed as long as a suicidal person "decides on his own fate up to the end … and is in control of the situation."
Free will cannot be assumed, however, if someone is manipulated or deceived. A classic textbook example for this, in German law, is the so-called Sirius case on which the Federal Court of Justice ruled in 1983: The accused had convinced an acquaintance that she would be re-incarnated into a better life if she killed herself. She unsuccessfully attempted suicide, leading the accused to be charged with, and eventually convicted of attempted murder.http://www.ejura-examensexpress.de/online-kurs/entsch_show_neu.php?Alp=1&dok_id=2885 (The accused had also convinced the acquaintance that he hailed from the star Sirius, hence the name of the case).
Apart from manipulation, the criminal code states three conditions under which a person is not acting under his own free will:
  | first = Gabriele
  | last = Wolfslast
  | first2 =
  | last2 =
  | editor-last = Birnbacher
  | editor-first = Dieter

  }}
[/ref]
Under these circumstances, even if colloquially speaking one might say a person is acting of his own free will, a conviction of murder is possible.

====Neglected duty to rescue====

German criminal law obliges everybody to come to the rescue of others in an emergency, within certain limits (§323c of the German criminal code, "Omission to effect an easy rescue"). This is also known as a duty to rescue in English. Under this rule, the party assisting in the suicide can be convicted if, in finding the suicidal person in a state of unconsciousness, he does not do everything in his power to revive him. In other words, if someone assists a person in committing suicide, leaves, but comes back and finds the person unconscious, he must try to revive him.
This reasoning is disputed by legal scholars, citing that a life-threatening condition that is part, so to speak, of a suicide underway, is not an emergency. For those who would rely on that defence, the Federal Court of Justice has considered it an emergency in the past.

====Homicide by omission====

German law puts certain people in the position of a warrantor (Garantenstellung) for the well-being of another, e.g. parents, spouses, doctors and police officers. Such people might find themselves legally bound to do what they can to prevent a suicide; if they do not, they are guilty of homicide by omission.

===Iceland===

Assisted suicide is illegal.  “At the current time, there are no initiatives in Iceland that seek the legalization of euthanasia or assisted suicide. The discussion on euthanasia has never received any interest in Iceland, and both lay people and health care professionals seem to have little interest in the topic. A few articles have appeared in newspapers but gained little attention.”http://www.alzheimer-europe.org/Policy-in-Practice2/Country-comparisons/Healthcare-and-decision-making-in-dementia/Iceland

===Luxembourg===

After failing to get royal assent for legalizing euthanasia and assisted suicide, in December 2008 Luxembourg's parliament amended the country's constitution to take this power away from the monarch, the Grand Duke of Luxembourg.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/dec/12/luxembourg-monarchy |work=The Guardian |location=London |title=Luxembourg strips monarch of legislative role |date=2008-12-12 |deadurl=no |accessdate=9 July 2013[/tpl] Euthanasia and assisted suicide were legalized in the country in April, 2009.http://www.tehrantimes.com/Index_view.asp?code=191410

===The Netherlands===

Physician-assisted suicide is legal under the same conditions as euthanasia.

===New Zealand===

Assisted suicide is illegal in New Zealand. Under Section 179 of the Crimes Act 1961, it is illegal to 'aid and abet suicide.'

===South Africa===

South Africa is struggling with the debate over legalizing euthanasia. Owing to the under-developed health care system that pervades the majority of the country, Willem Landman, "a member of the South African Law Commission, at a symposium on euthanasia at the World Congress of Family Doctors" stated that many South African doctors would be willing to perform acts of euthanasia when it became legalized in the country.[tpl]harvnb|McDougall|Gorman|2008|p=80[/tpl] He feels that because of the lack of doctors in the country, "legalizing euthanasia in South Africa would be premature and difficult to put into practice …".

===Switzerland===

Though it is illegal to assist a patient in dying in some circumstances, there are others where there is no offence committed.[tpl]cite journal| last=Schwarzenegger|first=Christian|author2=Summers, Sarah J.| date=2005-02-03| title=Hearing with the Select Committee on the Assisted Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill| journal=House of Lords Hearings|publisher=University of Zürich Faculty of Law |location=Zürich|url=http://www.rwi.uzh.ch/lehreforschung/alphabetisch/schwarzenegger/publikationen/assisted-suicide-Switzerland.pdf [/tpl] (PDF) The relevant provision of the Swiss Criminal Code[tpl]cite journal |date=1989-06-23| title=Inciting and assisting someone to commit suicide (Verleitung und Beihilfe zum Selbstmord) |journal=Swiss Criminal Code| pages=Article 115 |publisher=Süisse| language=German |location=Zürich[/tpl] refers to "a person who, for selfish reasons, incites someone to commit suicide or who assists that person in doing so will, if the suicide was carried out or attempted, be sentenced to a term of imprisonment (Zuchthaus) of up to 5 years or a term of imprisonment (Gefängnis)."
A person brought to court on a charge could presumably avoid conviction by proving that they were "motivated by the good intentions of bringing about a requested death for the purposes of relieving "suffering" rather than for "selfish" reasons.[ref]
</ref> In order to avoid conviction, the person has to prove that the deceased knew what he or she was doing, had capacity to make the decision, and had made an "earnest" request, meaning he/she asked for death several times. The person helping also has to avoid actually doing the act that leads to death, lest they be convicted under Article 114: Killing on request (Tötung auf Verlangen) -
A person who, for decent reasons, especially compassion, kills a person on the basis of his or her serious and insistent request, will be sentenced to a term of imprisonment (Gefängnis). For instance, it should be the suicide subject who actually presses the syringe or takes the pill, after the helper had prepared the setup.Prof. Dr. Christian Schwarzenegger and Sarah Summers of the University of Zurich's Faculty of Law, "Hearing with the Select Committee on the Assisted Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill," House of Lords, Zurich, 3 February 2005 http://www.rwi.uzh.ch/lehreforschung/alphabetisch/schwarzenegger/publikationen/assisted-suicide-Switzerland.pdf This way the country can criminalise certain controversial acts, which many of its people would oppose, while legalising a narrow range of assistive acts for some of those seeking help to end their lives.
In July 2009, British conductor Sir Edward Downes and his wife Joan died together at a suicide clinic outside Zürich "under circumstances of their own choosing". Sir Edward was not terminally ill, but his wife was diagnosed with rapidly developing cancer.[tpl]cite web |url=http://criminalbrief.com/?p=7887 |title=YOUthanasia |last=Lundin |first=Leigh |date=2009-08-02 |publisher=Criminal Brief |deadurl=no |accessdate=9 July 2013[/tpl]
In March 2010, the PBS FRONTLINE TV program in the United States showed a documentary called "The Suicide Tourist" which told the story of Professor Craig Ewert, his family, and Dignitas, and their decision to commit assisted suicide using Sodium Pentobarbital in Switzerland after he was diagnosed and suffering with ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease)."The Suicide Tourist", PBS FRONTLINE, March 2, 2010.
In May 2011, Zurich held a referendum that asked voters whether (i) assisted suicide should be prohibited outright; and (ii) whether Dignitas and other assisted suicide providers should not admit overseas users. Zurich voters heavily rejected both bans, despite anti-euthanasia lobbying from two Swiss social conservative political parties, the Evangelical People's Party of Switzerland and Federal Democratic Union. The outright ban proposal was rejected by eighty four percent of voters, while seventy eight percent voted to keep services open should overseas users require them."Swiss vote backs assisted suicide: BBC News: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13405376
In June 2011, The BBC televised the assisted suicide of Peter Smedley, a canning factory owner, who was suffering from motor neurone disease. The programme - Sir Terry Pratchett's Choosing To Die - told the story of Peter's journey to the end where he used The Dignitas Clinic, a euthanasia clinic in Switzerland, to assist him in carrying out the taking of his own life.
The programme shows Peter eating chocolates to counter the unpalatable taste of the liquid he drinks to end his own life.  Moments after drinking the liquid, Peter begged for water, gasped for breath and became red,[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2002603/BBC-Dignitas-millionaire-He-felt-needed-says-widow.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=He felt he needed to go, says widow of BBC Dignitas millionaire | date=11 June 2011[/tpl] he then fell into a deep sleep where he snored heavily while holding his wife's hand.  Minutes later, Peter stopped breathing and his heart stopped beating.

===United States===

Assisted suicide is legal in the three American states of Oregon (via the Oregon Death with Dignity Act),http://egov.oregon.gov/DHS/ph/pas/ors.shtml Washington (by Washington Death with Dignity Act), and Vermont by the Patient Choice and Control at End of Life Act. In Montana (through the 2009 trial court ruling Baxter v. Montana), the court found no public policy against assisting suicide, so consent may be raised as a defense at trial. Oregon and Washington specify some restrictions.
For instance, Oregon requires a physician to prescribe medication but it must be self-administered. For the patient to be eligible, the patient must be diagnosed by the attending physician as well as a consulting physician with a terminal illness that will cause the death of the individual within 6 months.The patient must be at least 18 years of age, a resident of Oregon and be deemed capable of making their own decisions. It is required the patient orally request at least twice and contribute a written request. The physician must notify the patient of alternatives; such as palliative care, hospice and pain management. Lastly the physician is to request but not require the patient to notify their next of kin that they are requesting a prescription for a lethal dose of medication. Assuming all guidelines are met and the patient is deemed competent and completely sure they wish to end their life, the physician will give the patient the lethal dose prescription to self-administer. "State-by-State Guide to Physician-Assisted Suicide." Euthanasia - ProCon.org. N.p., 13 Dec. 2013. Web. 27 Mar. 2014. .
Since the Oregon Death with Dignity Act was passed in 1994, a total of 1,050 people have had DWDA prescriptions written and 673 patients have died from ingesting medications prescribed under the DWDA.http://euthanasia.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000132 Oregon Health Authority. Oregon Public Health Division, 14 Jan 2013. Web. 4 Dec 2013.http://public.health.oregon.gov/ProviderPartnerResources/EvaluationResearch/DeathwithDignityAct/Documents/year15.pdf
Washington's rules and restrictions are similar, if not exactly the same, as Oregon's. Not only does the patient have to meet the above criteria, they also have to be examined by not one, but two doctors licensed in their state of residence. Both doctors must come to the same conclusion about the patient's prognosis. If one doctor does not see the patient fit for the prescription, then the patient must undergo psychological inspection to tell whether or not the patient is in fact capable and mentally fit to make the decision of assisted suicide or not.
In May 2013, Vermont became the fourth state in the union to legalize assisted suicide. Vermont’s House of Representatives voted 75-65 to approve the bill, Patient Choice and Control at End of Life Act. This bill states that the qualifying patient must be at least 18, a Vermont resident and suffering from an incurable and irreversible disease, with less than six months to live. Also, two physicians, including the prescribing doctor must make the medical determination.Sullivan, Nora. "Vermont Legislature Passes Assisted Suicide Bill." Charlotte Lozier Institute RSS. Charlotte Lozier Institute, 15 May 2013. Web. 04 Dec. 2013.
In January 2014, New Mexico inched closer to being the fifth state in the USA to legalize assisted suicide via a court ruling.https://newmexico.tylerhost.net/ServeDocument.ashx?SID=0730da82-c2ce-4331-9d34-98fe74190124&RID=001664dd-e045-4d6c-b5ce-1294189b0a7a “This court cannot envision a right more fundamental, more private or more integral to the liberty, safety and happiness of a New Mexican than the right of a competent, terminally ill patient to choose aid in dying,” wrote Judge Nan G. Nash of the Second District Court in Albuquerque. The NM attorney general’s office said it was studying the decision and whether to appeal to the State Supreme Court.

==Published Research==

A study approved by the Dutch Ministry of Health, the Dutch Ministry of Justice, and the Royal Dutch Medical Association reviewed the efficacy in 111 cases of physician-aided dying (PAD).[tpl]cite doi|10.1056/NEJM200002243420805[/tpl] This showed that 32% of cases had complications. These included 12% with time to death longer than expected (45 min – 14 days), 9% with problems administering the required drugs, 9% with a physical symptom (e.g. nausea, vomiting, myoclonus) and 2% waking from coma. In 18% of cases the doctors provided euthanasia because of problems or failures with PAD.
The Portland (Oregon) Veterans Affairs Medical Center and the Department of Psychiatry at the Oregon Health and Science University set out to assess the prevalence of depression in 58 patients who had chosen PAD.[tpl]cite pmid|18842645[/tpl] Of 15 patients who went to receive PAD, three (20%) had a clinical depression. All patients who participated in the study were determined in advance to be mentally competent. The authors conclude that the "...current practice of the (Oregon) Death with Dignity Act may fail to protect some patients whose choices are influenced by depression from receiving a prescription for a lethal drug".
In a Dutch study of patients with severe and persistent symptoms requiring sedation, the researchers found that only 9% of patients received a palliative care consultation prior to being sedated.[tpl]cite pmid|18344245[/tpl]

===Attitude of Healthcare professionals===

A 1997 anonymous mail study directed by David A. Asch MD, MBA and Michael L. DeKay, Ph.D,[tpl]harvnb|Asch|DeKay|1997[/tpl] sent out surveys to 1,560 United States critical care nurses, and 73% responded about their feelings involving euthanasia and physician assisted suicide. The survey investigated the reasons why some critical care nurses were denouncers of the practice, while others were supporters of it. One explanation for why some critical care nurses have sympathetic tendencies towards euthanasia is because "some...see euthanasia as a legitimate response to end human suffering".[tpl]harvnb|Asch|DeKay|1997|p=891[/tpl] However, Asch and DeKay cited additional factors that influence health care professionals' attitudes towards euthanasia including religion, religiosity, and age.
In the UK, an extensive survey of 3733 medical physicians in 2009 was sponsored by the National Council for Palliative Care, Age Concern, Help the Hospices, Macmillan Cancer Support, the Motor Neurone Disease Association, the MS Society and Sue Ryder Care. It showed that the proportion against a change in the law was 66% against euthanasia and 65% against assisted dying. Opposition to euthanasia and PAS was highest amongst Palliative Care and Care of the Elderly specialists, while more than 90% of palliative care specialists are against a change in the law.[tpl]cite journal |author=Seale C |title=Legalisation of euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide: survey of doctors' attitudes |journal=Palliat Med |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=205–12 |date=April 2009 |pmid=19318460 |doi=10.1177/0269216308102041[/tpl]
In another UK study, by Glasgow University's Institute of Law & Ethics in Medicine, a postal survey of UK medical practitioners and pharmacists, 54% were in favour of a change in the law to allow physician-assisted suicide to take place in specific circumstances, with only 36% against. 60% of the 1000 practitioners who responded had treated a patient who was considering suicide, 12% personally knew another health professional who had assisted a patient to kill themselves and 4% had themselves provided the means (such as drugs or information about lethal acts) to assist a patient to kill themselves. One finding of the second study was that most medical practitioners found physician-assisted suicide preferable to voluntary euthanasia (43% in comparison to 19%), especially in view of the findings of a first study by the University which showed the public's preference for voluntary euthanasia. There was little by way of differences in the percentages of hospital physicians, medical GPs, surgeons or psychiatrists favouring a change in the law - approximately 48% were in favour. This was in stark contrast to the percentage of pharmacists in favour (72%) and anaesthetists (56%). Pharmacists were twice as likely as medical GPs to endorse the view that "if a patient has decided to end their own life then doctors should be allowed in law to assist". (McLean, S., 1997, "Sometimes a Small Victory", Institute of Law and Ethics in Medicine, University of Glasgow.)
Evidence shows that physicians already assist people to die illegally in the UK. In a 2009 survey of 8857 physicians, the proportion of UK deaths involving voluntary euthanasia (i.e. at the patient's request) was 0.21% (CI: 0–0.52), and involuntary euthanasia (i.e. without the patient's request) was 0.30% (0–0.60).[tpl]cite journal |author=Seale C |title=End-of-life decisions in the UK involving medical practitioners |journal=Palliat Med |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=198–204 |date=April 2009 |pmid=19318459 |doi=10.1177/0269216308102042[/tpl]

===Factors that influence physicians' attitudes towards physician-assisted death===

Religion, religiosity, age, gender, previous experience with physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia, and work environment are all factors which influence health professionals' attitudes towards physician-assisted death.
Data on the practice of aid in dying can also be found from the reports produced in the jurisdictions where it is legal. For example, the Oregon Health Authority publishes annual reportshttp://public.health.oregon.gov/providerpartnerresources/evaluationresearch/deathwithdignityact/pages/ar-index.aspx detailing the enactment of the Oregon Death with Dignity Act.

==Opposition==

==="Slippery slope" argument===

There are many health care professionals, especially those concerned with bioethics, who are opposed to PAS due to the detrimental effects that the procedure can have with regard to vulnerable populations. This argument is known as the "slippery slope".A More Perfect Death, NYT Op-Ed http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/07/opinion/07douthat.html This argument encompasses the apprehension that once PAS is initiated for the terminally ill it will progress to other vulnerable communities, namely the disabled, and may begin to be used by those who feel less worthy based on their demographic or socioeconomic status. In addition, vulnerable populations are more at risk of untimely deaths because, "patients might be subjected to PAD without their genuine consent".[tpl]cite journal |author=Mayo DJ, Gunderson M |title=Vitalism revitalized.... Vulnerable populations, prejudice, and physician-assisted death |jstor=3528084 |journal=Hastings Cent Rep |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=14–21 |year=2002 |pmid=12362519 |doi=10.2307/3528084[/tpl] However, recent studies claim that the available evidence suggests that the legalization of physician-assisted suicide might actually decrease the prevalence of involuntary euthanasia.[tpl]Cite journal  | last1 = Ryan | first1 = CJ. | title = Pulling up the runaway: the effect of new evidence on euthanasia's slippery slope | journal = J Med Ethics | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 341–4 |date=Oct 1998 | doi =  10.1136/jme.24.5.341| pmid = 9800591  | pmc = 1377611 [/tpl]

===Prejudices against the disabled===

Also, prejudices against disabled people may be enacted with regards to end-of-life care. For example, 'do not resuscitate' orders are more frequently issued for those who become hospitalized and previously suffer from severe disabilities.Vitalism Revitalized...page 16. In addition, many people who suffer from lifelong disabilities suffer from "burn out",Vitalism Revitalized...page 18. which is a general feeling of depression and sadness that comes as a result of years of intolerance and prejudice. Naturally, those individuals suffering from "burn out" are more likely to want to refuse treatment and end their fight for life prematurely.

===Conflict of interest===

Some physicians and healthcare practitioners feel there may be a conflict of interest when it comes to abiding with legislation and patient requests for aid in dying. This is based upon a particular interpretation of the Hippocratic Oath stating that physicians should give no deadly medicine.[tpl]cite journal|last=Randall|first=Fiona|author2=Robin Downie|journal=Clinical Medicine|date=August 1, 2010|volume=10|pages=323–325|doi=10.7861/clinmedicine.10-4-323[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Jonathan S.|author2=Fihn, Stephan D.|author3= Boyko, Edward J.|author4= Jonsen, Albert R.|author5= Wood, Robert W.|title=Attitudes toward Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia among Physicians in Washington State|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=14 July 1994|volume=331|issue=2|pages=89–94|doi=10.1056/NEJM199407143310206[/tpl]
However, the translation and interpretation of the oath continues to be debated and change, and not all physicians swear the oath.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7654432.stm | work=BBC News | title=A guide to the Hippocratic Oath | date=26 October 2008[/tpl]

==Organizations opposed to assisted suicide==

===Care Not Killing===

Care Not Killing are a group based in the United Kingdom that combines a number of organisations opposed to assisted suicide under a common banner.Cassidy J., Lobby Watch: Care Not Killing BMJ 2010;341:c7284 http://www.bmj.com/content/341/bmj.c7284

===Euthanasia Prevention Coalition===

Founded in 1998, the Euthanasia Prevention Coalition is a Canadian organisation opposed to euthanasia and assisted suicide.

===United States Conference of Catholic Bishops===

The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has stated its opposition to assisted suicide.United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (2011). "To Live Each Day with Dignity: A Statement on Physician-Assisted Suicide". Retrieved March 10, 2014.

==Improvements in end-of-life decision making==

Currently only a small fraction of patients (about 15%) have clear directions in the form of a living will or a health care proxy in place to advise family members or physicians of their end-of-life wishes.[tpl]cite journal |author=Hayden LA |title=Helping Patients with End-Of-Life Decisions |jstor=3472224 |journal=The American Journal of Nursing |volume=99 |issue=4 |pages=24BB–24EE |year=1999 |doi=10.2307/3472224[/tpl] This leads to uncomfortable questions if the patient suddenly no longer has the ability to speak for themselves when answers are needed to important medical questions. Even if a patient has selected a proxy they may, "be guilt-ridden, wondering whether they acted too hastily or if their decision was inconsistent with the patient's desires"."Helping Patients with End-Of-Life Decisions" p. 2401.
In order to preempt some of the difficulties that are associated with end-of-life care many medical schools and nursing programs now stress the importance of early discussions with the patient about their wishes and planning for the future.  Unfortunately, since the views concerning physician assisted suicide are so polarized, many doctors are reluctant to discuss withholding and withdrawing life-sustaining treatment. In fact, in a recent study of 58 physicians, 19 admitted that they did not feel comfortable discussing end-of-life care with their patients."Helping Patients with End-Of-Life Decisions" p. 2402.
In an effort to change the apprehension that is associated with end-of-life care new techniques are being explored to ensure more doctor to patient communication including:
In short, there are two major ways in which the physicians can more easily be made aware of the wishes of their patients. The first simply involves participation in the informed consent process, or "engaging competent patients in comprehensive discussions of treatment options and likely outcomes"."Treatment decision-making at the end of life..." p. 6. The second of these methods involves advance care planning which ensures that patients tell their doctors exactly what they wish to be done in case a medical emergency arises in which they are not able to speak for themselves.
