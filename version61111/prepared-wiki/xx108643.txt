Disk Utility is an Apple Mac OS X operating system utility for performing disk and disk volume-related tasks.
The functions supported by Disk Utility include:"Disk Utility 10.5 Help: Testing and repairing a disk or volume". Apple Inc.
Disk Utility functions may also be accessed from the Mac OS X command line with the diskutil and hdiutil commands.
Disk Utility was updated with Mac OS X v10.3. Prior to v10.3, the functionality of Disk Utility was spread across two applications: Disk Copy and Disk Utility. Disk Copy was used for creating and mounting disk image files, and Disk Utility was used for formatting, partitioning, verifying and repairing file structures. The ability to "zero" all data on a disk was not added until Mac OS X 10.2.3"Mac OS X: About the Mac OS X 10.2.3 Update". Apple Inc.
Further changes introduced in 10.4.3 allowed Disk Utility to be used to verify the file structure of the current boot drive. However, as Apple notes in their public knowledge base,"Using Disk Utility in Mac OS X 10.4.3 or later to verify or repair disks". Apple Inc. doing so can sometimes yield false error messages.
Mac OS X v10.5 Leopard added the ability to create, resize, and delete disk partitions without erasing them, a feature known as live partitioning.
In versions of the Mac OS prior to Mac OS X, similar functionality to the verification features of Disk Utility could be found in the Disk First Aid application. Another application called Drive Setup was used for drive formatting and partitioning, and the application Disk Copy was used for working with disk images.
