Jan van Krieken van Huessen (Deventer, 17 August 1942) is an independent Dutch fine artist who lives and works in Huissen. Time, Alchemy and Zen are important themes converging in the choice for a glacial erratic (stone) in the pond of his garden as the source of inspiration for his work.
From 1959 to 1964 Jan van Krieken studied Fine Arts, Illustration and Graphics at the Academy of Art and Design in Arnhem. Among his teachers were expressionist and MATERIESCHILDER Fred Sieger and ZERO artist Henk Peeters. After graduation Van Krieken developed as a fine artist. From 1979 to 2001 he was a teacher at the Arnhem Academy of Art and Design with students such as Krin Rinsema, Bernadien Wels, Djana Mileta, Tim Hinterding and Marion Bauhuis. As a freelance journalist Jan van Krieken reviewed art exhibitions for the Arnhemse Courant (1970–2000) and as an Expressive Therapist he was involved with the Psychiatric Department of the University Medical Center St Radboud in Nijmegen for over thirty years.
Jan van Krieken is a member of the Society of Fine Artists and his work is represented in numerous Art Lending Foundations, communal, provincial and private collections. Jan is a member of the Art Advisory Commission of the Municipality of Lingewaard.
Because of the existence of another artist by the name of Jan van Krieken, Jan now signs his work with Jan van Krieken Van Huessen (since November 4, 2001; the opening of their joint exhibition with the title “What’s In A Name?”).
