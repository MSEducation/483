He chaired an education reform panel for Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, and some of his proposals are being considered currently. In the 1990s, he served as advisor and chief of staff to former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan. In 2009 his book, The Secret of TSL: The Revolutionary Discovery That Raises School Performance[tpl]cite book| url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003IWYG5W| title=The Secret of TSL: The Revolutionary Discovery That Raises School Performance| first=William G| last=Ouchi[/tpl] was published which explores the revolutionary potential of reducing total student load, the number of students a teacher interacts with on a daily basis over the course of a semester.[tpl]cite web| url=http://books.simonandschuster.com/9781439121580| title=The Secret of TSL| author=William Ouchi| publisher=Simon and Schuster[/tpl] Ouchi's premise has the potential to change school systems across the country as local principals control more of their own budgets to make creative hiring decisions aimed at reducing to eighty the total number of students each teacher interacts with on a given day.
