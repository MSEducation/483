[[Intrusion prevention system]]

CATEGORIES: Computer network security, Computer security, System administration

Intrusion prevention systems (IPS), also known as intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS), are network security appliances that monitor network and/or system activities for malicious activity. The main functions of intrusion prevention systems are to identify malicious activity, log information about this activity, attempt to block/stop it, and report it.
Intrusion prevention systems are considered extensions of intrusion detection systems because they both monitor network traffic and/or system activities for malicious activity. The main differences are, unlike intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems are placed in-line and are able to actively prevent/block intrusions that are detected.[tpl]cite book|author=Robert C.

==Classifications==

Intrusion prevention systems can be classified into four different types:[tpl]cite book|author=John R. Vacca|title=Managing Information Security|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=uwKkb-kpmksC&pg=PA137|accessdate=29 June 2010|year=2010|publisher=Syngress|isbn=978-1-59749-533-2|pages=137–[/tpl]

==Detection methods==

The majority of intrusion prevention systems utilize one of three detection methods: signature-based, statistical anomaly-based, and stateful protocol analysis.[tpl]cite book|author1=Michael E.
