Kwashiorkor is a severe form of malnutrition, caused by a deficiency in dietary protein. The extreme lack of protein causes an osmotic imbalance in the gastro-intestinal system causing swelling of the gut diagnosed as an edema or retention of water.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(00)94666-X |title=Kwashiorkor |year=1935 |last1=Williams |first1=Cicely |journal=The Lancet |volume=226 |issue=5855 |pages=1151[/tpl]
Extreme fluid retention observed in individuals suffering from kwashiorkor is a direct result of irregularities of the lymphatic system and capillary exchange. The lymphatic system serves three major purposes: fluid recovery, immunity, and lipid absorption. Victims of kwashiorkor commonly exhibit a reduced ability to recover fluids, immune system failure, and low lipid absorption, all of which result from severe undernourishment. Fluid recovery in the lymphatic system is accomplished by re-absorption of water and proteins which are returned to the blood. Compromised fluid recovery results in the characteristic belly distension observed in highly malnourished children.The British Medical Journal , Vol. 2, No. 4673 (Jul. 29, 1950), p. 284 [tpl]DOI|10.1136/bmj.2.4673.267[/tpl]
Capillary exchange between the lymphatic system and the bloodstream is stunted due to the inability of the body to effectively overcome the hydrostatic pressure gradient. Proteins, mainly albumin, are responsible for creating the colloid osmotic pressure (COP) observed in the blood and tissue fluids. The difference in the COP of the blood and tissue is called the oncotic pressure. The oncotic pressure is in direct opposition with the hydrostatic pressure and tends to draw water back into the capillary by osmosis. However, due to the lack of proteins, no substantial pressure gradient can be established to draw fluids from the tissue back into the blood stream. This results in the pooling of fluids, causing the swelling and distention of the abdomen.[tpl]cite book |last=Saladin |first=Kenneth |title=Anatomy and Physiology |edition=6th |location=New York |publisher=McGraw Hill |year=2012 |pages=766–767, 809–811 |isbn=978-0-07-337825-1 [/tpl]
The low protein intake leads to some specific signs: edema of the hands and feet, irritability, anorexia, a desquamative rash, hair discolouration, and a large fatty liver. The typical swollen abdomen is due to two causes: ascites because of hypoalbuminemia (low oncotic pressure), and enlarged fatty liver.[tpl]cite journal|last=Tierney|first=Emily P.|coauthors=Sage, Robert J.; Shwayder, Tor|title=Kwashiorkor from a severe dietary restriction in an 8-month infant in suburban Detroit, Michigan: case report and review of the literature|journal=International Journal of Dermatology|date=1 May 2010|volume=49|issue=5|pages=500–506|doi=10.1111/j.1365-4632.2010.04253.x|pmid=20534082[/tpl]
Ignorance of nutrition can be a cause. Latham, director of the Program in International Nutrition at Cornell University, along with Keith Rosenberg cited a case where parents who fed their child cassava failed to recognize malnutrition because of the edema caused by the syndrome and insisted the child was well-nourished despite the lack of dietary protein.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2009[/tpl]
Protein should be supplied only for anabolic purposes. The catabolic needs should be satisfied with carbohydrate and fat. Protein catabolism involves the urea cycle, which is located in the liver and can easily overwhelm the capacity of an already damaged organ. The resulting liver failure can be fatal.  This means in patients suffering from kwashiorkor, protein must be introduced back into the diet gradually. Clinical solutions include weaning the affected with milk products and increasing the intake of proteinaceous material to daily recommended amounts.
