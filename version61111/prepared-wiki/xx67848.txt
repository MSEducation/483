Bharata ([tpl]lang-sa|भरत[/tpl]) was an ancient Indian theatrologist and musicologist who authored the  Natya Shastra, a theoretical treatise on ancient Indian dramaturgy and histrionics, especially Sanskrit theatre. It is dated to between 1st-century BC to 3rd-century CE.[tpl]cite web |title=Natyashastra (Indian drama treatise) |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/64008/Bharata |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=[/tpl]
Indian dance and music find their root in the Natyashastra. Besides propounding the theory of three types of acting Bharata has discussed in detail classical Indian vocal/instrumental music and dance since they are integral to Sanskrit drama. Bharata classified Sanskrit theatrical forms (Natya/Rupaka) into ten types; what is known to the west as drama is but one among these, namely, Nataka.
Bharata also outlines a set of rasas or moods/emotions which were to be influential in defining the nature of Indian dance, music, and theater.
The Natyashastra comprises 36 chapters and it is possible that it was a creation of more than one scholar. Bharata is considered as the father of Indian theatrical art forms.
