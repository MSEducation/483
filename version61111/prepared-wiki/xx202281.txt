==Today==

Boundary is a long extended village, with a Public House at each end. The earliest reference to the Greyhound Inn was in the 1857 trade directory when the landlady was Elizabeth Cooper. At the other end of the village towards Ashby was the Red Lion. It got its licence in 1870 and in September 1871 was bought by Brunt & Bucknall of Woodville, together with the 4 cottages adjoining, from Edward and Hannah Moore. The first landlord was John Thornley and he was still there in 1899. The Red Lion was finally demolished in the early 1960s by Frank Jones of Woodville, The Greyhound was also bought by Brunt & Bucknall, but the date of acquisition is not known. This establishment is still serving all though it has recently been refurbished.
