Centripetal force (from Latin centrum "center" and petere "to seek"[tpl]cite book |title=A new universal etymological, technological and pronouncing dictionary of the English language: embracing all terms used in art, science, and literature, Volume 1 |first1=John |last1=Craig |publisher=Harvard University |year=1849 |page=291 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0nxBAAAAYAAJ[/tpl], Extract of page 291) is a force that makes a body follow a curved path: its direction is always orthogonal to the velocity of the body, toward the fixed point of the instantaneous center of curvature of the path. Centripetal force is generally the cause of circular motion. 
In simple terms, centripetal force is defined as a force which keeps a body moving with a uniform speed along a circular path and is directed along the radius towards the centre.[tpl]cite book |title=Engineering Mechanics: Dynamics |author=Russelkl C Hibbeler |url=http://books.google.com/?id=tOFRjXB-XvMC&pg=PA131 |page=131 |chapter=Equations of Motion: Normal and tangential coordinates |isbn=0-13-607791-9 |year=2009 |edition=12 |publisher=Prentice Hall[/tpl][ref][tpl]cite book |title=Physics for scientists and engineers |page=129 |author= Paul Allen Tipler, Gene Mosca |url=http://books.google.com/?id=2HRFckqcBNoC&pg=PA129 |isbn=0-7167-8339-8 |edition=5th |publisher=Macmillan |year=2003 [/tpl]
[/ref] The mathematical description was derived in 1659 by Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens. Isaac Newton's description was: "A centripetal force is that by which bodies are drawn or impelled, or in any way tend, towards a point as to a centre."[tpl]cite book|last=Newton|first=Isaac|title=The principia : mathematical principles of natural philosophy|year=2010|publisher=Snowball Pub.|location=S.l.|isbn=978-1-60796-240-3|pages=10[/tpl]

==Formula==

The magnitude of the centripetal force on an object of mass m moving at tangential speed v along a path with radius of curvature r is:[ref]
</ref>
The direction of the force is toward the center of the circle in which the object is moving, or the osculating circle, the circle that best fits the local path of the object, if the path is not circular.[ref]

</ref>
The speed in the formula is squared, so twice the speed needs four times the force. The inverse relationship with the radius of curvature shows that half the radial distance requires twice the force. This force is also sometimes written in terms of the angular velocity Ï‰ of the object about the center of the circle:
Expressed using the period for one revolution of the circle, T, the equation becomes:
In particle accelerators, velocity can be very high (close to the speed of light in vacuum) so the same rest mass now exerts greater inertia (relativistic mass) thereby requiring greater force for the same centripetal acceleration, so the equation becomes:
Where the Lorentz factor is defined as:

==Sources of centripetal force==

For a satellite in orbit around a planet, the centripetal force is supplied by gravity. Some sources, including Newton, refer to the entire force as a centripetal force, even for eccentric orbits, for which gravity is not aligned with the direction to the center of curvature.[ref]

</ref>
The centripetal force acts from the center of mass of the rotating object, on an object a distance "r" from its center; If both objects are rotating they will affect each other; for circular orbits, the center of mass is the center of the circular orbits. For non-circular orbits or trajectories, only the component of force directed orthogonally to the path (toward the center of the osculating circle) is termed centripetal; the remaining component acts to speed up or slow down the satellite in its orbit.[ref]

For an object swinging around on the end of a rope in a horizontal plane, the centripetal force on the object is supplied by the tension of the rope. For a spinning object, internal tensile stress provides the centripetal forces that make the parts of the object trace out circular motions.
The rope example is an example involving a 'pull' force. The centripetal force can also be supplied as a 'push' force such as in the case where the normal reaction of a wall supplies the centripetal force for a wall of death rider.
Another example of centripetal force arises in the helix which is traced out when a charged particle moves in a uniform magnetic field in the absence of other external forces. In this case, the magnetic force is the centripetal force which acts towards the helix axis.

==Analysis of several cases==

Below are three examples of increasing complexity, with derivations of the formulas governing velocity and acceleration.

===Uniform circular motion===

Uniform circular motion refers to the case of constant rate of rotation. Here are two approaches to describing this case.

====Calculus derivation====

</ref>
Assume uniform circular motion, which requires three things.
The negative shows that the acceleration is pointed towards the center of the circle (opposite the radius), hence it is called "centripetal" (i.e. "center-seeking"). While objects naturally follow a straight path (due to inertia), this centripetal acceleration describes the circular motion path caused by a centripetal force.
