[[Millennium Link]]

CATEGORIES: Canals in Scotland

The Millennium Link is one of the biggest engineering projects ever undertaken by British Waterways. The Union Canal and the Forth & Clyde Canal were joined by a flight of locks. The Millennium Link project replaced the lock with an ingenious and unique boat lift, the Falkirk Wheel.
The project launch was in October 1994, and it received a grant of £ 32 million from the Millennium Commission; the total cost of the project was £ 78 million.
Work started in 1998.
