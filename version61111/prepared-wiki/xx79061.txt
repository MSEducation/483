[[Beardfish]]

CATEGORIES: Polymixiiformes, Fish of Hawaii

The beardfishes consist of a single extant genus (Polymixia) in a small family (Polymixiidae) of deep-sea marine ray-finned fish named for their pair of long hyoid barbels.  At present they are classified in their own order Polymixiiformes,[tpl]FishBase order | order = Polymixiiformes | month = February | year = 2006[/tpl] but as Nelson says, "few groups have been shifted back and forth as frequently as this one".[tpl]cite book | author = Joseph S. Nelson | title = Fishes of the World | publisher = John Wiley & Sons | isbn = 0-471-54713-1[/tpl] For instance, they have previously been classified as belonging to the Beryciformes.  They are of little economic importance.[tpl]cite book |editor=Paxton, J.R. & Eschmeyer, W.N.|author= Paxton, John R.|year=1998|title=Encyclopedia of Fishes|publisher= Academic Press|location=San Diego|pages= 161|isbn= 0-12-547665-5[/tpl]
They are found in tropical and subtropical waters of the Atlantic, Indian and western Pacific Ocean. They are bottom-dwelling fish, found down to about [tpl]convert|800|m|ft[/tpl] depth. Most are relatively small fish, although one species is over [tpl]convert|40|cm|in[/tpl] in length.
