==History==

Predecessor side Sportverein Oberrad was formed in 1905 out of the union of the clubs [tpl]lang|de|Viktoria Oberrad[/tpl], [tpl]lang|de|Kickers Oberrad[/tpl] and [tpl]lang|de|Sportclub Hellas[/tpl]. In 1933 this club merged with [tpl]lang|de|Ballspielclub Oberrad[/tpl] to form [tpl]lang|de|Spielvereinigung 05 Frankfurt-Oberrad[/tpl]
By the end of the 1930s the club had advanced to play in the second division Bezirksliga. The destruction during World War II of the city quarter where the team was based led to the collapse of the club in 1943. It was re-established after the war in 1945 as [tpl]lang|de|SG Oberrad[/tpl] before re-claiming its original name a year later.
The football team is an elevator club moving frequently between fourth and fifth division play. The club made its first appearance in the [tpl]lang|de|Landesliga Süd[/tpl] in the 1978–79 season but was immediately relegated. They returned in 1983 and stayed up for a half dozen seasons before being sent down again in 1989. Obberrad then had a pair of three season long turns in the Landesliga in 1993–96 and 1999–2002.
The club has played as a mid-to-lower table side in Landesliga competition with their best result being a 6th place finish in 1993–94. Oberrad again earned promotion to the Landesliga Hessen-Süd (IV) after a successful 2005 campaign in the Bezirksoberliga Frankfurt (V) that saw the club finish in second place.In 2011-12, the club is in its seventh consecutive season in the Verbandsliga, having finished in all but one in the lower half of the table.
