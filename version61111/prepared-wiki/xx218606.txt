[[Minister of Everything]]

CATEGORIES: Political terminology

A Minister of Everything, sometimes also called Minister for Everything, refers to a Minister who wields great and wide-reaching power in the government, usually as the head of a powerful and influential ministry (often a "super ministry" combining two or more portfolios), but also can influence government machinery outside his direct control. The title is unofficial, and often assigned by the media or other political figures. Ministers who are seen as holding the title are often regarded as the second most powerful person in the government after the head of government, and often (but not always) this position is cemented by holding the official title of Deputy Prime Minister/Deputy Premier/Deputy First Minister etc. The term can also be used as a criticism of heads of government who take a more hands on approach in governing and give ministers less independence,http://www.stuff.co.nz/4202425a6220.html or a head of government who hold additional powerful cabinet portfolios.
