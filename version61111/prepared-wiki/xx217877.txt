[[Indochinese serow]]

The Indochinese serow (Capricornis milneedwardsii maritimus) is a vulnerable goat-anteope, a subspecies of the Chinese Serow, native to Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam.
In Cambodia the Indochinese serow is restricted to the forests of the karstic mountain areas in Mondulkiri Province. The main threat in Cambodia comes from logging, hunting as well as landmines and other ordnance left by the conflict.David M.
