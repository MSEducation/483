==Caveat emptor==

Each volume of Dick's Picks has its own "caveat emptor" label, advising the listener of the sound quality of the recording.  The one for Volume 21 reads:
"DP 21 was mastered from the original digital tapes, our earliest foray into the digital domain to date.  The master tapes are Beta PCM cassettes, with stereo digital audio recorded on the video track.  We've aimed to make this release sound as good as possible, and we feel we've succeeded.  Hopefully you will agree.  Enjoy."
