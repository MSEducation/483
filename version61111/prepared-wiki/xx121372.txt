Indigo Prime is the umbrella name for a series of stories written by John Smith for 2000 AD about an agency - existing out of time and whose members are dead - who police the multiverse of parallel realities.

==Characters==

==Plot==

Indigo Prime itself is an extra-dimensional agency dedicated to the maintenance and repair of breaks and distortions across the multiverse.  However, they're not above making a few 'alterations' for any rich clientele that approach them (although it appears that this is never at the expense of the harmony of the multiverse itself).  Their base of operations exists outside the multiverse and time itself in a hypothetical 'nullzone', which every event in time and space throughout the multiverse transects.
All Indigo Prime agents are chosen, upon their death, based on the presence of a certain gene (the "Rembrant IndexTM") that occurs in one in twelve million people across the multiverse; given a new body, and then trained in a range of abilities reminiscent of 'super powers' to assist them in their job.  Each agent also specializes in a role - known job descriptions are: Sceneshifters (who manipulate the physical world), Seamsters (who deal with time) and Imagineers (who can influence minds and dreams).
