[[Product binning]]

CATEGORIES: Semiconductor device fabrication

In semiconductor device fabrication, product binning is the categorizing of finished products based on their thermal and frequency characteristics.[tpl]cite web|author=Published on 10th June 2010 by Paul Goodhead |url=http://www.bit-tech.net/hardware/cpus/2010/06/10/how-to-make-a-cpu-from-sand-to-shelf/4 |title=How to Make a CPU - Testing, Packaging and Binning |publisher=bit-tech.net |date=2010-06-10 |accessdate=2013-02-24[/tpl]

==Definition==

Semiconductor manufacturing is an imprecise process, sometimes achieving as low as 30% yield.The RV770 Story: Documenting ATI's Road to Success, by Anand Lal Shimpi on 12/2/2008, AnandTech Defects in manufacturing are not always fatal, however; in many cases it is possible to salvage part of a failed batch of integrated circuits by modifying performance characteristics. For example, by reducing the clock frequency or disabling non-critical parts that are defective, the parts can be sold at a lower price, fulfilling the needs of lower-end market segments.
This practice occurs throughout the semiconductor industry on products such as CPUs, RAM and GPUs.

==Speed Bump==

A speed bump, in computer terms, is a slight increase in frequency (e.g., 1.8 GHz to 1.9 GHz) or a slight increase in functionality (e.g. Nvidia GeForce GTX260 to GTX260 Core 216). Some time after the initial release of a product, manufacturers may choose to increase the clock frequency of an integrated circuit for a variety of reasons, ranging from improved yields to more conservative speed ratings (e.g., actual power consumption lower than TDP).

==Testing==

In order to undergo binning, manufactured products require testing.

Each piece can be tested to determine its highest stable clock frequency and accompanying voltage and temperature while running.

==Marketing==

Binning allows large variances in performance to be condensed into a smaller number of marketed designations. This ensures coherency in the marketplace, with tiers of performance clearly delineated. The immediate consequence of this practice is that, for liability reasons, products sold under a certain designation must meet that designation at a minimum. Individual products may still exceed advertised performance.

==Overclocking==

As manufacturers only require meeting the minimum advertised specifications, the potential for overclocking of a product is not typically tested during the binning process.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.legitreviews.com/article/1777/9/ |title=Corsair Vengeance 8GB DDR3 Low Voltage 1600MHz Review - Final Thoughts and Conclusion |publisher=Legit Reviews |date=2011-12-05 |accessdate=2013-02-24[/tpl] Therefore, it should not be assumed that higher-rated products will overclock better than lower-rated ones.
