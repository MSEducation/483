The Milwaukee Police Department is the police department organized under the city of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The department has a  contingent of about 1,300 sworn officers when at full strength. Edward A. Flynn is the current chief of police.

==History==

MPD was founded in 1855. At the time when Milwaukee had an extremely high crime rate, fueled by local gangs, mobs, thieves and robbers. Milwaukee was originally served by the Milwaukee County Sheriff's office, which became increasingly unable to provide adequate enforcement to the growing city. With burgeoning crime rates, citizens enacted an ordinance creating the Milwaukee Police Department.City of Milwaukee "History of the Milwaukee Police Department" http://www.ci.mil.wi.us/History779.htm
Milwaukee's first chief of police was William Beck, a former NYPD detective, and its first policemen were Fred Keppler, John Hardy, George Fische, James Rice, L.G. Ryan and David Coughlin. As the department expanded, patrolmen were supplemented by "roundsmen", who would lead the patrolmen out to their beats at the beginning of the evening shift, and supervise them during the shift. A roundsman earned $5 more a month than a patrolman.Maralyn A. Wellauer-Lenius, Milwaukee Police Department. Mt. Pleasant, SC: Arcadia Publishing, 2008, p. 16.
The office of police chief, like the department in general, was subject to political forces for most of its history; for example, in 1878 new Mayor John Black  appointed fellow Democrat Daniel Kennedy as chief, and Kennedy promptly fired 25 Republican patrolmen (as part of the spoils system then prevalent).Wellauer-Lenius, p. 10.
In 1924, Judson W. Minor became Department's first African-American officer and in 1975 Ada Wright became the first female MPD officer. On November 15, 1996 Arthur Jones became the first African-American chief. A lawsuit filed after his term found that Jones discriminated against officers based on their race, giving African-American officers promotions before white officers.http://www.city.milwaukee.gov/router.asp?docid=13123 "City of Milwaukee History Page"  The first female captain in the Milwaukee Police Department was Nannette Hegerty, who also became the first female chief of police in 2004. She retired in November 2007.http://www.city.milwaukee.gov/History779.htm "Milwaukee Police Department History Page"

===1917 Bombing===

On November 24, 1917, a large black powder bomb,Balousek, Marv, and Kirsch, J. Allen, 50 Wisconsin Crimes of the Century, Badger Books Inc. (1997), ISBN 1-878569-47-3, ISBN 978-1-878569-47-9, p. 113 wrapped as a package, was discovered by Maude L. Richter, a social worker, next to an evangelical church in the third ward.The Indianapolis Star, "Bomb Mystery Baffles Police", November 26, 1917  She dragged the package into the church basement and notified the church janitor, Sam Mazzone.The Indianapolis Star, "Bomb Mystery Baffles Police", November 26, 1917 Mazzone brought the bomb to the central police station at Oneida and Broadway and turned it over to police.http://www.city.milwaukee.gov/MemorialPage1670.htm "Milwaukee Police Department Officer Memorial Page" The station keeper was showing it to the shift commander, Lieutenant Flood, right before a scheduled inspection, when it exploded. Nine members of the department were killed in the blast, along with a female civilian.  It was suspected at the time that the bomb had been placed outside the church by anarchists, particularly the Galleanist faction led by adherents of Luigi Galleani.  At the time, the bomber's identity was not uncovered.  Many years later, interviews with surviving Galleanist members revealed that Mario Buda, chief bombmaker for the Galleanists may have constructed the Milwaukee bomb.Watson, Bruce, Sacco and Vanzetti: The Men, the Murders, and the Judgment of Mankind, Viking Press (2007), ISBN 0-670-06353-3, ISBN 978-0-670-06353-6, p. 15Avrich, Paul, Sacco and Vanzetti: The Anarchist Background, Princeton: Princeton University Press (1991)Avrich, Paul, Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America, Princeton: Princeton University Press (1996)Dell’Arti, Giorgio, La Storia di Mario Buda, Io Donna, 26 gennaio 2002, http://www.memoteca.it/upload/dl/E-Book/Mario_Buda.pdf At the time, the bombing was the most fatal single event in national law enforcement history,Deadliest Days in Law Enforcement History, National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund (November 24, 1917) http://www.nleomf.org/facts/enforcement/deadliest.html only surpassed later by the World Trade Center terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 when 72 law enforcement officers representing eight different agencies were killed. Those responsible for the 1917 bombing never were apprehended, but days later, eleven alleged Italian anarchists went to trial on unrelated charges involving a fracas that had occurred two months before. The specter of the larger, uncharged crime of the bombing haunted the proceedings and assured convictions of all eleven. In 1918 Clarence Darrow led an appeal that gained freedom for most of the convicted.Strang, Dean A.

==Structure==

The Milwaukee Police Department is composed of numerous bureaus, divisions and sections. Each area has specific responsibilities which are essential to the management and administration of the department.

===Ranks and insignia===

These Bureau, Divisions and Sections include:

===Office of the Chief===

===Office of the Assistant Chief of Police===

===Patrol Bureau===

===Planning & operations===

===Criminal Investigation Bureau===

===Administration Bureau===

==Misconduct==

===Daniel Bell===

In 1958, Officer Thomas Grady shot Daniel Bell in the back, killing him. Investigations at the time cleared Grady of any wrongdoing. In 1978, Grady's partner indicated that the officer had planted a knife on Bell's body to falsely indicate he had been armed. Grady plead guilty to reckless homicide and perjury.Gina Barton, "In 25 years, no charges recommended in Milwaukee inquests", Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, October 6, 2012. Milwaukee city officials, unwilling to pay the sum awarded to the Bell family, appealed and repeatedly refused the family’s offers to settle for smaller sums. In September 1984, the U.S. Court of Appeals in Chicago awarded $1.6 million, twice the amount the family had offered to settle for earlier.White, Sylvia Bell, and Jody LePage. Sister: An African American Life in Search of Justice, Madison, Wisconsin: University of Wisconsin Press (2013).

===Wendy O. Williams===

In January 1981 Milwaukee police officers arrested and allegedly severely beat Wendy O. Williams, singer of the punk group The Plasmatics, for simulating sex on stage. Charged with battery to an officer and obscene conduct, she was later cleared.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2008[/tpl]

===Lawrencia "Bambi" Bembenek===

On May 28, 1981, police officer Lawrencia Bembenek murdered her husband's ex-wife.

===Return of victim to Jeffrey Dahmer===

In the early morning hours of May 27, 1991, 14-year-old Konerak Sinthasomphone (the younger brother of a boy Dahmer had molested) was discovered on the street, wandering nude. Reports of the boy's injuries varied. Jeffrey Dahmer, who had drugged and raped the boy, told police that they had an argument while drinking, and that Sinthasomphone was his 19-year-old lover. Against the teenager's protests, police turned him over to Dahmer. The officers later reported smelling a strange odor, which was eventually found to be bodies in the back of his room. Later that night Dahmer killed and dismembered Sinthasomphone, keeping his skull as a souvenir. Dahmer went on to kill four more people."Officers Tell Jury of Letting Dahmer Keep Boy," New York Times, February 13, 1992.
John Balcerzak and Joseph Gabrish, the two police officers who returned Sinthasomphone to Dahmer, were fired from the Milwaukee Police Department after their actions were widely publicized, including an audiotape of the officers making homophobic statements to their dispatcher and laughing about having reunited the "lovers." The two officers appealed their termination, and were reinstated with back pay. Balcerzak would go on to be elected president of the Milwaukee Police Association in May 2005. Gabrish is now chief of police for the town of Trenton, Wisconsin, 30 miles north of Milwaukee.http://trentonpolicewi.com/About%20Us/History/history-index.html[tpl]dead link|date=October 2012[/tpl]http://www.townoftrenton.info/police_dept/police_dept.htm

===Chicago shootings===

In 1994, two Milwaukee police officers, Gabriel Bedoya and John Koch, went on a shooting spree in the city of Chicago. They fired shots at random into buildings on the Gold Coast of Chicago, including the residence of Cardinal Joseph Bernardin. When denied entry to a nightclub, Bedoya shot the bouncer at close range in the head and the two fled back to Milwaukee.The People of the State of Illinois v. Gabriel Bedoya

===Frank Jude Jr.===

In October, 2004, Frank Jude Jr. attended a party held by police officer Andrew Spengler. Following allegations that Jude had taken an officer's badge, at least three officers confronted and beat Jude outside of Spengler's home. Officers Daniel Masarik, Andrew Spengler and Jon Bartlett were arrested and charged with the beating. All three were later fired from the Milwaukee Police Department, as were several other involved officers. The officers disciplined were both on- and off-duty the night of the beating. Masarik, Spengler and Bartlett were later found not guilty in state court. In July 2007, these three officers and another officer, Ryan Packard, went on trial in federal court on charges of violating the civil rights of Frank Jude Jr. and his friend, Levelle Harris. Spengler, Masarik and Bartlett were found guilty; Packard was found not guilty. The officers were sentenced on November 29, 2007. Bartlett received 17 years, Masarik and Spengler both received 15 years. The officers' attorneys have said the officers will appeal the sentences.3 ex-officers guilty", Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, July 26, 2007."Ex-officers in Jude beating case get sentences of up to 17 years", Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, November 29, 2007.

===Alfonzo Glover===

In March 2005, press reports recount that Officer Alfonzo Glover shot Wilbert Prado eight times after an off-duty traffic altercation. Officer Glover was charged criminally, but killed himself before he could be brought to court.

===Glenn Kelly===

On July 7, 2006 at Miller Park, baseball fan Glenn Kelly fell or was pushed down by two Milwaukee police officers (accounts vary) outside an elevator. Kelly was not under detention at that time, but his daughter in law and son were for disorderly conduct and public intoxication, and he had attempted to get into the elevator with them, contrary to police and park policy (since they were under arrest). Eventually, the brawl ended when Kelly fell to the ground, cracking his head open on the concrete floor. Kelly was briefly unconscious but awoke and refused medical treatment.  Later that day he lapsed into unconsciousness and was declared brain dead.  He died July 12, 2006 when he was taken off life support. A deputy district attorney decided not to charge the officers, clearing them of any wrongdoing. Kelly's family filed notice of a pending lawsuit against the City of Milwaukee,"Family of man who died after being shoved by officers files notice," Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, November 7, 2006. but nothing seems to have come of it.

===Derek Williams===

In July 2011,  Derek Williams, a robbery suspect, was arrested by Officer Richard M. Ticcioni and Officer Patrick Coe. After a struggle, he was handcuffed and paced in the back of a police car. He complained he was having trouble breathing and requested an ambulance. The officers ignored his  request and Williams died. The death was ruled a homicide because an altercation with police caused the sickle cell crisis which led to his death. The officers had been cleared by an internal investigation conducted when a preliminary report ruled the death accidental. When authorities changed the cause of death to homicide, the police department promised a second investigation.Gina Barton, "Medical Examiner revises suspect's death ruling to homicide," Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, September 22, 2012. Retrieved December 19, 2012. The Federal Bureau of Investigation launched a civil rights inquiry looking into the possibility of a "pattern and practice" of abuse.John Diedrich and Gina Barton, "FBI launches civil rights inquiry into death in custody," Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, October 10, 2012.

===Ladmarald Cates===

===Accidental shooting===

In November 2011, Officer Michael Edwards was in a shopping mall when his handgun discharged, injuring a little girl nearby. Edwards pled guilty to a reduced charge of disorderly conduct. He had not placed his weapon in a holster, but instead had it in his pocket and it fired when he reached into his pocket for money.Viviana Buzo, "Cop Guilty of Accidental Gun Discharge in Southridge," Greendale Patch, October 18, 2012.

===Beating of handcuffed suspects===

In May 2012, Officer Richard Schoen, a veteran of nine years' service was fired when footage from his car's camera showed him beating a woman handcuffed in the back of his car.Brandon Cruz, "Milwaukee police release video showing conduct of fired officer," Fox6now.com, May 25, 2012. Later in the year the city's Fire and Police Commission forced the department to rehire the officer.

===Strip searches===

In March 2012, press reports indicated that at least eight police officers were under investigation for conducting strip searches in public on people they had arrested. The officers were ordered to desk duty and have retained lawyers.Gitte Laasby and John Diedrich, "Strip-search complaints against Milwaukee police continue to surface," Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, March 27, 2012.Gitte Laaasby, "Milwaukee police get more complaints of cavity searches, chief says," Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, April 11, 2012. In October 2012, Officer Michael Vagnini and three other officers were brought before a court. Vagnini was charged with 25 counts of sexual assault and other crimes. He faced up to 25 years in jail if convicted. Officer Jeffrey Dollhop stands accused two counts of official misconduct and one count each of conducting an illegal strip search and an illegal cavity search. The two remaining officers, Jacob Knight and Brian Kozelek, face a single count of official misconduct.Gina Barton and John Diedrich, "4 Milwaukee police officers charged in strip-search case," Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, October 9, 2012. In October 2013,  Officers Dollhopf and Kozelek agreed to plead no contest in exchange for a sentence of fines and community service.Milwaukee cops take plea deal in strip-search case, by the Associated Press, 21 October 2013, Wislawjournal.coom In late December 2013, Officer Vagnini was sentenced to a little over two years in jail.
