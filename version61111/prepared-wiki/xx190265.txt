==Biography==

Miroslav Šustek was born on January 4, 1947 in Žilina, Slovakia. He has spent the majority of his life in his hometown. Having become partially disabled at a young age, Šustek devoted his life to writing, his stories initially heavily influenced by classics of the macabre, horror and ghost story genres, later adding elements of humour and parody to the mix.Šustek, Miroslav.

==Writing career==

Despite having written more than a thousand short stories in more than forty years of continuous writing, none of them were published until 2000, when Šustek met the future publishers of the Hlboký hrob online horror magazine. Two of his stories published in Hlboký hrob were later included in the Neželané dedičstvo po neobľúbenom strýkovi (An Unwanted Inheritance Left By An Unpopular Uncle) anthology in 2006.[tpl]cite web | url=http://mastodont.sk/vydavatelstvo/autori/#sustek | title=Miroslav Šustek at hlbokyhrob.sk (in Slovak) | accessdate=2008-04-29[/tpl] Šustek's debut short story collection was subsequently published in 2007.
