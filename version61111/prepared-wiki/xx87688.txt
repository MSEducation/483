==History==

Permanent station buildings were erected at the station in 1886, with timber stairs leading to Boundary Road and Mount Alexander Road.[tpl]cite book|author=Jon Saul and Wendy Moore|title=Down the line to Upfield|publisher=Coburg Public Transport Group|date=May 1990[/tpl]
In 1891 the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Railways recommended the construction of a spur line from Flemington Bridge to Pascoe Vale station to relieve crowding on the Essendon line at peak times, as well as providing a shorter alternative route to the city, following the route of what is now CityLink. The committee estimated the single track line would cost £93,000 to build, but recommended that only £30,000 be spent with the remainder to be made up by donated land. However the proposal was not taken up by government.
The current station building with an asbestos cement roof was provided in 1944, at the same time the stairs were replaced by asphalted ramps.
During CityLink construction in 1997, a crossover was provided near the Mount Alexander Road bridge to allow Upfield line trains to terminate[tpl]cite web|first=Andrew|last=Waugh|url=http://www.vrhistory.com/Locations/T1997.PDF|title=VR History by Andrew Waugh - Upfield Line|publisher=VR History.com|accessdate=2009-02-24[/tpl] with passengers shuttled by bus to Newmarket to continue their journey. This was to allow construction of the elevated road between Flemington and North Melbourne.
