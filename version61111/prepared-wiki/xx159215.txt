[tpl]nihongo|Net idol|ネットアイドル|Netto aidoru[/tpl] is a Japanese term that is someone who achieves celebrity status through the internet.  Unlike an Internet celebrity, a net idol is more focused on Japanese pop culture.[tpl]Fact|date=October 2008[/tpl]

==History==

Net idols emerged as an off-shoot of Japanese idols in the late 1990s. The first "cyber idol" or "virtual idol" was Kyoko Date in 1997. She has a fabricated history, statistics, and her own songs. Meanwhile, gravure idols (グラビアアイドル, gurabia aidoru) such as Yoko Matsugane, Rio Natsume and Eiko Koike, net idols themselves, have largely appeared skimpily clad in "cheesecake" photographs.

===Alternative and fetish models===

Most mainstream talents found their start on the Internet. Models like Dita Von Teese, Tila Tequila, and Masuimi Max found their fame especially on alternative and fetish talents.  Dita herself is attributed with having the first model site on the net in 1992. Tila can largely owe her fame to sites like Friendster and Myspace. Masuimi is currently transitioning from the Net to mainstream consciousness through projects like David Lynch's Inland Empire, and hit reality TV shows like Fear Factor.
