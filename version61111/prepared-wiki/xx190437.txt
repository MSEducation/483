The Very Best of Johnny Hates Jazz is Johnny Hates Jazz’s first of two compilation albums.  Released in May 1993, the majority of the album concentrates on songs from the band’s debut album, although the b-sides from several of the major singles on that album, the non-album single, "Turn the Tide," and a few songs from the band’s lesser known second album, Tall Stories, are included on the compilation, as well.
