He wanted to play drums, but his mother advocated for the more portable guitar. Like many young guitarists, Hammond started playing funk and soul and rock music in high school.Interview conducted by Jason Crane, July 2013 He graduated from Christian Brothers High School in 1995.
Hammond then attended California State University Sacramento, where he received a Bachelor’s of Arts degree in Communications in 1999. "I was taking lessons from a really good guitar teacher named Jim Beeler, and he introduced me to Kenny Burrell and Grant Green and Wes Montgomery and Mark Whitfield. It was a step further than what I was already doing." While studying at CSUS, Hammond  started a band called Chile Palmer.

==Hammond On Improvising==

"If you're finding that things are always the same, the chances are that you're really not improvising. I enjoy playing and figuring out what kind of spaces I'm going to get into. The improv guys that I like the most are the ones that can do a lot of different stuff. They can play jazz, free, rhythmic, African, blues, folk songs. I don't want to put out a project where we only play one thing for an hour. I guess my goal is to have a voice and to bring my voice into any style that we're playing so you can always tell that it's me playing. I feel like Vinny Golia has that and Oliver Lake has that. Whatever project they're in, you can tell it's them that's playing. That's a great thing that musicians should be trying to achieve."
