UFO 1 is the debut album by British rock band UFO.
The album was reissued under the name "Unidentified Flying Object" with 4 of the 5 tracks from the band's second album. This reissue incorrectly shows a photo of the band from the 1980s on the cover.
The album was also reissued on the "Flying - The Early Years" compilation, along with all of the band's other pre-Schenker work. It was also given a straight reissue under the name "All The Hits & More - The Early Days" (XXX Media, Germany, 2011), with no additional tracks.
