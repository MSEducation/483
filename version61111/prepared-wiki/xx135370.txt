Air Liberté began operations in April 1988 with a leased MD-83. It mainly operated to destinations in European and Mediterranean holiday resorts, however it had some interncontinental routes. A route to Montreal was inaugurated in 1992,[tpl]cite news |title=OAG Desktop Flight Guide: Worldwide Edition |publisher=Official Airline Guides, |date=August 1992 |page=842[/tpl] and Réunion and the Caribbean were also served by the airline. Unsuccessful routes included one from Toulouse to Dakar and London, which were scrapped in a conflict over slot allocations at Orly. 1996 saw a new route to Nice, and in May the route network of Euralair was taken on. Around 1996, the airline had a fleet of 5 Boeing 737-200 airplanes, 8 McDonnell Douglas MD-83 planes and 5 McDonnell Douglas DC-10 planes.
1996 also brought with it financial distress. The airline lost 1 billion FF ($181 million) that year, and in 1997 British Airways acquired 70% of the shareholding. At this time, British Airways brought Air Liberté together with TAT and inaugurated them under one management. Nouvelair was born out of Air Liberté's subsidiary in Tunisia, Air Liberté Tunisie.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2010[/tpl] On 5 May 2000, BA sold Air Liberté to a partnership between Taitbout Antibes and Swissair.

But in October, Swissair went bankrupt, unable to make all scheduled payments. The French Government then granted a loan of € 30.5 million to the company.
Despite government aid, the airline amounted debts of €120 million and was forced to declare bankruptcy in August 2002. The government then ordered the implementation of a new restructuring plan before the end of the year. Several projects were to be offered or wanted but no result, and the company was liquidated on 17 February 2003. As a result, no other competing international level full-service French airline had appeared, leaving only Air France (now controlled by Air France-KLM) as a de facto monopoly.
