The Coast Fork Willamette River is one of two forks that unite to form the Willamette River in western Oregon in the United States. It is about [tpl]convert|40|mi|km[/tpl] long, draining an area of the mountains at the south end of the Willamette Valley south of Eugene.

==Course==

The Coast Fork Willamette River is formed in southwestern Lane County, in the Calapooya Mountains, by the confluence of Garoutte Creek and the Big River. The river flows north through the mountains, through the Cottage Grove Lake reservoir, to Cottage Grove, where it receives the Row River from the southeast. It continues north past Creswell and joins the Middle Fork from the south, about [tpl]convert|2|mi|km[/tpl] southwest of Eugene, to form the Willamette.
