Jacob Gottschalk (Godtschalk) Henricks Van Der Heggen (c.1670â€“c.1763) was the first person to serve as a Mennonite bishop in America.

==Life==

Gottschalk was born around 1670 in Goch, Germany.  In 1701, he received a letter from the church in Goch, permitting him to migrate to Pennsylvania, where he arrived at Germantown, Pennsylvania in 1702.  On August 10, 1702, he became a preacher to the Mennonite congregation there. 
He died in May 1763, and his grave is unmarked; however, there is a memorial stone at the Towamencin Meeting church yard at Kulpsville, Montgomery County, PennsylvaniaWhite pg. 145 that reads:
 "In memory of Bishop Jacob Gottshall 1670-1763 Born in Goch Germany, ordained a bishop in the Germantown Mennonite Church in 1702 and also served the Skippack and Towamencin congregations. He performed the first baptism and conducted the first communion service in the American church in 1708. The Skippack alms audits were signed by him from 1745-1757. He owned a farm of [tpl]convert|120|acre|km2[/tpl] which included this church site. Undoubtedly, he is buried here but no marker remains, therefore this marker is erected in memory of this energetic leader."
