Since then Burns has been collaborating with other artists and dance projects. In 2007, he worked with Tiësto on the track "In the Dark", for the album Elements of Life.  He collaborated with Tiësto again on the track entitled "Power of You", where Tiësto used the alias Allure.
He has also collaborated with Benny Benassi, on the song "Love and Motion", and American singer Jes Brieden on the song "As We Collide".
He is featured heavily on BT's 2010 album These Hopeful Machines, co-writing the songs "Suddenly", "The Emergency", and "Forget Me".  He provides lead vocals on "Suddenly" and backing vocals on "The Emergency" and "Forget Me".
He also collaborated with Richard Durand on  "Night & Day", and with Armin van Buuren on "This Light Between Us", taken from his album Mirage. Other collaborations include tracks by David Guetta, Matt Darey, Sebastian Ingrosso, and Dirty South.
