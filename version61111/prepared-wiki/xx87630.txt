Lilydale railway station is the terminus of the Lilydale line in Victoria, Australia.

The station has an enclosed waiting area, which also contains former refreshment rooms which are opened by the Victorian Railway Institute on Friday afternoons and evenings.
Stabling facilities are situated at the north-eastern end of the station.
Until it was truncated at Lilydale in 1980, the line continued to Healesville. The line between Yarra Glen and Healesville is now used by the Yarra Valley Tourist Railway. The track from Lilydale to Yarra Glen, including Coldstream and Yering is now disused. The Yarra Valley Tourist railway originally leased the entire line, however they discontinued their lease on the section from Lilydale to Yarra Glen, because of the bad condition of the bridges in that section. However, there are hopes to eventually restore the entire line.
Also branching off at Lilydale was the Warburton line. It opened in 1901, and closed on 1 August 1965. The track was removed in the early 1970s, as was the bridge over the Maroondah Highway. Most of the right-of-way is still intact, and has been turned into the Lilydale to Warburton Rail Trail. The exception to this is the part of the line approximately 800 metres beyond where it branched off at Lilydale. Mount Lilydale Mercy College currently leases this part of the line, which runs through its property. This is the only part of the line that is currently obstructed. Boom barriers replaced hand gates at Maroondah Highway in 1985.VR History by Andrew Waugh
