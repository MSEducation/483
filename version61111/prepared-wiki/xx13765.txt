[[450]]

CATEGORIES: 450

Year 450 (CDL) was a common year starting on Sunday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Valentinianus and Avienus (or, less frequently, year 1203 ''Ab urbe condita''). The denomination 450 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.
