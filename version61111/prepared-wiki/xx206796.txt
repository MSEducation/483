Panopea zelandica, commonly known as the Deepwater Clam or New Zealand geoduc (geoduck), is a large species of marine bivalve mollusc in the family Hiatellidae.[ref]

</ref>  ''Panopea zelandica'' is also sometimes called a King Clam or a Gaper in reference to the shell not being closed at either end.
It can be found around the North, South and Stewart islands and occurs mainly in shallow waters (5â€“25 metres) in sand and mud off sandy ocean beaches.Deepwater (King) Clam fishery summary - New Zealand Ministry of Fisheries. Another geoduc species (Panopea smithae) is found in deeper New Zealand waters.
Like other geoducs P. zelandica burrows downwards in the mud and extends a siphon 30-45 centimetres up to the surface of the substrate.  The siphon contains two tubes.  Water is sucked down one tube, filtered for food and then expelled through the other.
