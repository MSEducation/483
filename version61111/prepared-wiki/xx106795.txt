Hollie Point is an English  needle lace noted for its use in baby clothes in the 18th and 19th century.
It is found in English needleworks such as samplers, stump-work embroideries and tape laces from second half of 17th century, its use in the form known as hollie point dates from early 18th century.
Hollie Point is a flat needlepoint lace with rows of knotted buttonhole stitches worked over stretched threads. Simple designs are created by holes left in otherwise plain cloth work formed by the buttonhole stitches. Noted for its appearance in baby clothes in the 18th and early 19th century, particularly in caps, the shoulder seams of shirts, bibs and detachable sleeves worn over babies swaddling bands.
Early 18th century bonnets tend to be plain but the second half of the century saw the introduction of a band of lace extending from centre front of bonnet to the nape of the neck, sometimes with a circle in the back.  This band was later accompanied by parallel line of pulled-thread embroidery while in early 19th century the circular cap back reappeared. 
Items decorated with hollie point were often made for christenings, it is probable that this type of work was done by ladies of a household or the nanny
