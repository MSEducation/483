==The event==

On 4 March 1997, at 15:30, two pilots of the Regiment from 4020 to Rinas airport and head off towards the south of the country. During their return flight to Italy and decided to land at the Air Base Galattina of Lecce, in southern Italy. They manage to escape radar plane piloted by only 15 meters from sea level and only detected when Italian forces down. The government later demanded the repatriation of two deserters.

==Assumptions on event==

Pilots say they were ordered by the government to strike Mifol Bridge, connecting with Fier Vlore, in order to isolate the insurgency. As they said, not wanting to hit civilians, they fled to Italy. But the fact that the aircraft did not caught the radar, even though a plane is weak and difficult to be piloted at low altitude, suggests that the evacuation plan was parapregatitur Italy and not a plan of the moment as the pilots say.
