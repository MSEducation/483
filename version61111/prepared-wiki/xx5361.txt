Nevertheless he won the final there, running the inside lane, setting a world record time of 47.82 seconds. He missed the 1976 Olympics and a show down with American rival Edwin Moses due to a boycott by African nations including Uganda. 
As a police officer, Akii-Bua was promoted by Ugandan president Idi Amin, and given a house, as a reward for his athletic prowess. When the Amin regime was collapsing, he fled to Kenya with his family, fearful that he would be seen as a collaborator; this was more likely because he was a member of the Langi tribe, many of whom were persecuted by Amin,[tpl]cite news|title=John Akii-Bua, 47 Is Dead; Ugandan Won Olympic Gold|date=25 June 1997|work=The New York Times|page=D20|accessdate=10 December 2011|quote=Amin was purging the Lango tribe, and Akii-Bua was Lango[/tpl] whereas Akii-Bua was cited by Amin as an example of a Langi who was doing well.
