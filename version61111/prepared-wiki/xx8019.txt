[[Monorail]]

CATEGORIES: Monorails, Magnetic propulsion devices, Russian inventions

A monorail is a railway in which the track consists of a single rail, typically elevated and with the trains suspended from it. The term is also used to describe the beam of the system, or the vehicles traveling on such a beam or track. The term originates from joining mono (one) and rail (rail), from as early as 1897,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=monorail |title=Etymology Online entry for monorail |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-11[/tpl] possibly from German engineer Eugen Langen, who called an elevated railway system with wagons suspended the Eugen Langen One-railed Suspension Tramway (Einschieniges Hängebahnsystem Eugen Langen).[tpl]cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/monorail |title=Dictionary.com definitions of monorail |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-11[/tpl]
Colloquially, the term "monorail" is often used to describe any form of elevated rail or people mover.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.monorails.org/tMspages/WhatIs.html |title=Quite often, some of our friends in the press and public make the assumption that any elevated rail or peoplemover is a monorail. |publisher=Monorails.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-11[/tpl]  More accurately, the term refers to the style of track,The term "track" is used here for simplicity. Technically the monorail sits on or is suspended from a guideway containing a singular structure. There is an additional generally accepted rule that the support for the car be narrower than the car.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.monorails.org/tMspages/WhatIs.html |title=Monorail Society, What is a monorail? |publisher=Monorails.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-11[/tpl] not its elevation.

==Differentiation from other transport systems==

Monorails have found applications in airport transfer and medium capacity metros. To differentiate monorails from other transport modes, the Monorail Society says the beam of a monorail is narrower than the vehicle.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.monorails.org/tMspages/WhatIs.html |title=Monorail Society, What is a monorail? |publisher=Monorails.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-11[/tpl]

===Similarities===

Monorails are often elevated, sometimes leading to confusion with other elevated systems such as the Docklands Light Railway, Vancouver SkyTrain and the JFK AirTrain, which run on two rails (see: What is a Monorail?).
Monorail vehicles often appear similar to light rail vehicles, and can be staffed or unstaffed. They can be individual rigid vehicles, articulated single units, or multiple units coupled into trains. Like other advanced rapid transit systems, monorails can be driven by linear induction motors; like conventional railways, vehicle bodies can be connected to the beam via bogies, allowing curves to be negotiated.

===Differences===

Unlike some trams and light rail systems, modern monorails are always separated from other traffic and pedestrians. They are both guided and supported via interaction with the same single beam, in contrast to other guided systems such as rubber-tyred metros, such as the Sapporo Municipal Subway; or guided buses or trams, such as Translohr. Monorails do not use pantographs.
From the passenger's perspective, monorails can have some advantages over trains, buses, and automobiles.  Ten feet or more above the city streets, monorails avoid red lights, intersection turns, and traffic jams.Ryan, Phillip Monorails (All Aboard!)(2010)  Surface-level trains, buses, automobiles, and pedestrians can collide each one with the other, while monorails  can collide only with other vehicles on the same system, with much fewer opportunities for collision.  Unlike subways (and surface level trains with underground tracks near city centers), monorail passengers enjoy sunlight and views.  By watching for familiar landmarks, they can know better when to get off to reach their destinations.Schafer, Mike American Passenger Train (2001)  As with other systems, expensive and noisy ventilation systems are not necessary if the cars have traditional windows that can be opened by passengers. (This also eliminates the weight and bulk of ventilation systems.)  Monorails can be quieter than diesel buses and trains.  They obtain electricity from the track structure, eliminating costly and unsightly overhead power lines and poles.  Compared to the elevated train systems of New York, Chicago and elsewhere, the monotrack casts a narrow shadow.Dorin, Patrick C. American Passenger Trains: WWII to Amtrak(2009)  See Chicago 'L'

===Maglev===

Under the Monorail Society beam width criterion, some but not all maglev systems are considered monorails, such as the Transrapid and Linimo. Maglevs differ from other monorails in that they do not (normally) physically contact the beam.

==History==

===Early years===

The first monorail was made in Russia in 1820 by Ivan Elmanov. Attempts at creating monorail alternatives to conventional railways have been made since the early part of the 19th century. The earliest patent was taken out by Henry Palmer in the UK in 1821, and the design was employed at Deptford Dockyard in South-East London, and a short line for moving stone from a quarry near Cheshunt, Hertfordshire to the River Lea, the world's first monorail to carry passengers and the first railway in Hertfordshire.[tpl]cite web|title=Finchley Society Annual General Meeting Minutes|author=Finchley Society|url=http://www.finchleysociety.org.uk/Newsletters/1990s/1997/6-97.pdf|date=1997-06-26|accessdate=2009-04-03[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=June 25 - Today in Science History|author=Today in Science History|url=http://www.todayinsci.com/6/6_25.htm|accessdate=2009-04-03[/tpl]
Around 1879 a "one-rail" system was proposed independently by Haddon and by Stringfellow, which used an inverted "/\" rail. It was intended for military use, but was also seen to have civilian use as a "cheap railway." [tpl]cite web|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/1376851?searchTerm=cheap+railway#pstart72945 |title=NLA Australian Newspapers - article display |publisher=Newspapers.nla.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2010-09-11[/tpl]
Early designs used a double-flanged single metal rail alternative to the double rail of conventional railways, both guiding and supporting the monorail car. A surviving suspended version is the Wuppertal monorail. Into the 1900s, Gyro monorails with cars gyroscopically balanced on top of a single rail were tested, but never developed beyond the prototype stage.  The Ewing System, used in the Patiala State Monorail Trainways in Punjab, India, relies on a hybrid model with a load-bearing single rail and an external wheel for balance.  One of the first systems put into practical use was that of French engineer Charles Lartigue, who built a line between Ballybunion and Listowel in Ireland, opened in 1888 and closed in 1924 (due to damage from Ireland's Civil War).  It uses a load-bearing single rail and two lower, external rails for balance, the three carried on triangular supports.
Possibly the first monorail locomotive was a 0-3-0 steam locomotive.

===1900s–1950s===

A highspeed monorail using the Lartigue system was proposed in 1901 between Liverpool and Manchester.[tpl]cite web|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/10566928?searchTerm=monorail#pstart327212 |title=NLA Australian Newspapers - article display |publisher=Newspapers.nla.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2010-09-11[/tpl]
In 1910, the Brennan gyroscopic monorail was considered for use to a coal mine in Alaska.[tpl]cite web|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/5260767?searchTerm=monorail#pstart946719 |title=NLA Australian Newspapers - article display |publisher=Newspapers.nla.gov.au |date=1910-09-05 |accessdate=2010-09-11[/tpl]
The first half of the 20th century saw many further proposed designs that either never left the drawing board or remained short-lived prototypes. One of the first monorails planned in the United States was in New York City in the early 1930s, scrubbed for an elevated train system."America's First Monorail Line Planned For New York." Popular Mechanics, November 1930, p. 71.

===1950s–1980s===

In the later half of the 20th century, monorails had settled on using larger beam or girder-based track, with vehicles supported by one set of wheels and guided by another. In the 1950s, a 40% scale prototype of a system designed for speed of 200 mph on straight stretches and 90 mph on curves was built in Germany."German's Develop Fast Monorail System For High Speed Travel" Popular Mechanics, January 1953, p. 127. There were designs with vehicles supported, suspended or cantilevered from the beams. In the 1950s the ALWEG straddle design emerged, followed by an updated suspended type, the SAFEGE system.  Versions of ALWEG's technology are used by the two largest monorail manufacturers, Hitachi Monorail and Bombardier.
In 1956, the first monorail to operate in the US began test operations in Houston, Texas."First U.S. Monorail Has Trial Run." Popular Mechanics, June 1956, p. 77.  Later during this period,  monorails were installed including at Disneyland in California,[tpl]cite journal|title=Disneyland Adds Submarine and Monorail|journal=Popular Mechanics|date=July 1959|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ttsDAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA77&dq=monorail&pg=PA77#v=onepage&q=monorail&f=false|accessdate=21 December 2010[/tpl] Walt Disney World in Florida, Seattle, and Japan. Monorails were promoted as futuristic technology with exhibition installations and amusement park purchases, as seen by the legacy systems in use today. However, monorails gained little foothold compared to conventional transport systems.
Niche private enterprise uses for monorails emerged, with the emergence of air travel and shopping malls, with shuttle-type systems being built.

===Perceptions of monorail as public transport===

From 1950 to 1980 the monorail concept may have suffered, as with all public transport systems, from competition with the automobile. Monorails in particular may have suffered from the reluctance of public transit authorities to invest in the perceived high cost of un-proven technology when faced with cheaper mature alternatives. There were also many competing monorail technologies, splitting their case further.
This high-cost perception was challenged most, notably in 1963 when the ALWEG consortium proposed to finance the construction of a major system in Los Angeles in return for the right of operation. This was turned down by the city authorities in favour of no system at all, and the later subway system has faced criticism as it has yet to reach the scale of the proposed monorail.
Several monorails initially conceived as transport systems survive on revenues generated from tourism, benefiting from the unique views offered from the largely elevated installations.
