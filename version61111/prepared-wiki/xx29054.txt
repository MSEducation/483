The city itself is not placed exclusively in the Miechowicka Upland, where only central part of the town stands. The rest of the city reaches as far as valleys of Drama, Szarlejka and Brynica to the north, the river Bytomka to the south, while to the east borders the Tarnogórski Hill.

===Geology===

The bedrock of the Miechowicka Upland consists primarily of sandstones and slates. The rocks are punctuated with abundant natural resources of coal and iron ore from the Carboniferous period. In the north part of the upland, in the Bytom basin lays the broad range of the triassic rocks, from sandstones to limestones, with rich ore, zinc and lead reserves. The upper layer comprise clay, sand and gravel.

==History==

Bytom is one of the oldest cities of Upper Silesia, having been known as Bitom in 1136 and received German city rights from prince Władysław in 1254 with its first centrally located market square and was written as Beuthen since 1440. The city benefitted economically from its location on a trade route linking Kraków with Silesia from east to west, and Hungary with Moravia and Greater Poland from north to south. The first Roman Catholic Church of the Virgin Mary was built in 1231. In 1259 Bytom was raided by the Mongols. The Duchy of Opole was split and in 1281 Bitom became a separate duchy, since 1289 under overlordship and administration by the Kingdom of Bohemia, a part of the Holy Roman Empire. Because of destruction by the Mongols German settlers came to repopulate and to rebuild. As part of the HRE it came under control of the Habsburg Monarchy of Austria in 1526. The city became part of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1742 during the Silesian Wars and part of the German Empire in 1871. In the 19th and the first part of the 20th centuries, the city rapidly grew and industrialized. Before 1939, Beuthen, along with Gleiwitz (now Gliwice), was at the southeastern tip of German Silesia. During World War II, the Beuthen Jewish community was liquidated via the first ever Holocaust transport to be exterminated at Auschwitz-Birkenau.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]
In 1945 the city was transferred to Poland as a result of the Potsdam Conference. Its German population was largely expelled by the Polish and Soviet armies, and populated with repatriated Poles from the eastern provinces annexed by the Soviets. Some of the indigenous Silesian population remained.
In the postwar period the city did not experience significant investments. Bytom is now a typical Polish post-industrial city. The majority of its coal mines are now closed, while its steel mills are slowly fading. The city is struggling to transform its economic profile from industry to services. Bytom cooperates[tpl]clarify|date=May 2013[/tpl] with two cities with more or less the same problems: Recklinghausen in Germany, and Butte-Silver Bow, United States. The city has a considerable unemployment rate which is centered in the poorest part of the city, the Bobrek subdivision.

==Economy==

Trade is one of main pillars of the economy of Bytom. Being a city with long traditions of commercial trade, Bytom is well fulfilling its new postindustrial role. In the centre of Bytom, and mainly around Station Street and the Market Square, there is the largest concentration of registered shop owners operating in the county. In the spring of 2010, 60 metres from the Market Square - on a new square between the square of Kościuszko and Jainty, Piekarska and Dzieci Lwowskich streets - a new commercial and entertainment centre called "Agora" opened, built by the Scandinavian company Braaten&Pedersen. Once completed, it was to be purchased for 263 million zloty by the British company First Property Group. Moreover, three other new shopping centres and three hypermarkets operate in Bytom.
In 2007, Bytom and its neighbours created the Upper Silesian Metropolitan Union, the largest urban centre in Poland.
