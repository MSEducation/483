New Chelsea-New Melbourne-Brownsdale-Sibley's Cove-Lead Cove is a designated place in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador, consisting of five unincorporated fishing villages on the Trinity Bay side of the northern tip of the Bay de Verde Peninsula. All of these communities are underlain by Precambrian bedrock of the Big Head Formation, chiefly gray to green arkose and siltstone.http://www.nr.gov.nl.ca/mines&en/geosurvey/maps/nl/html_nf/images/88-01.pdf Soils are stony loam podzols and are mapped as Turk's Cove series except at Lead Cove which lies on the less well drained Old Perlican series.http://sis.agr.gc.ca/cansis/publications/surveys/nf/nf3/nf3_report.pdf

==Brownsdale==

Tradition has it that John Brown, who had migrated from Old Perlican around 1820, was the first settler in Brownsdale.  He had established a sawmill there and was Brownsdale's first merchant. The original name of Brownsdale, Trinity Bay was Lance Cove South; the name was changed around 1910 to provide distinction from the other two Lance Coves on the island.
Brownsdale's first school was built in 1856 to accommodate twenty pupils.  The village's first church was Wesleyan, constructed in 1870; the current church, the United Church of Brownsdale, was built in 1892.  In 1958 a new high school was built and named for Newfoundland poet E.J. Pratt.

==Lead Cove==

Lead Cove may take its name from the lead-grey rock that surrounds the shallow cove. Tradition also tells that Lead Cove may have received its name from one of its earliest settler, Abraham Button, who felt that he had been "led" to this site from Old Perlican in his search for a place to settle.

==Sibley's Cove==

Sibley's Cove is usually considered to include Torquay (pronounced tarquay), a cluster of houses on the East End of the cove. It is believed that the cove was probably named after a migrating fisherman.

==New Melbourne==

This small village was originally called ''Russells Cove, and circa 1864 housed some 16 families. 
Prior to 1871, the community had been renamed New Melbourne.Seary, E. R., Lynch, S. & Kirwin, W. J. (1998) Family names of the island of Newfoundland, 3rd. Ed., p.71. McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP, ISBN 0-7735-1782-0. Retrieved July 2011
