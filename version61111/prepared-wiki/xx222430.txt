==Reception==

The series received very negative reviews from Anime News Network. John Jakala said that the first instalment of the series was okay, but the second was even more amateur. He referred to a car panel as it looked like something an elementary school child would draw in the margins of his math notebook.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/raijin-comics-no.2 |title=Raijin Comics #2 - Review - Anime News Network |publisher=Anime News Network |work=Raijin Comic Issue 2 |date=2003-01-07 |author=John Jakala |accessdate=2008-10-18 [/tpl] He also noted that he does not want to pay for work of such unprofessional quality.
