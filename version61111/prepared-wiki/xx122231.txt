The operation began on June 15, 1993.  It was suspended on June 19, 1996, and was terminated on October 2, 1996.

==Background==

The operation replaced naval blockades Operation Maritime Guard (of NATO; begun by the U.S. in November 1992) and Sharp Fence (of the WEU).[tpl]Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=lMfuht7crW4C&pg=PA174&dq=blockade+%22operation+sharp+guard%22&lr=lang_en&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&num=100&as_brr=3&ei=z0oNTL6sB43MMomoyesE&cd=11#v=onepage&q=sharp%20guard&f=false |title=America's Global Advantage: US Hegemony and International Cooperation|author=Carla Norrlof|publisher=Cambridge University Press|ISBN=0-521-74938-7|year=2010 |accessdate=June 7, 2010[/tpl]  It put them under a single chain of command and control (the "Adriatic Military Committee", over which the NATO and WEU Councils exerted joint control), to address what their respective Councils viewed as wasteful duplication of effort.[tpl]Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-rZZW2xuaysC&pg=PA146&dq=blockade+%22operation+sharp+guard%22&lr=lang_en&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&num=100&as_brr=3&ei=z0oNTL6sB43MMomoyesE&cd=8#v=onepage&q=%22operation%20sharp%20guard%22&f=false |title=Challenges for the new peacekeepers|author=Trevor Findlay|publisher=Oxford University Press|ISBN=0-19-829199-X|year=1996 |accessdate=June 7, 2010[/tpl][tpl]Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=djyivTHeZYYC&pg=PA214&dq=blockade+%22operation+sharp+guard%22&lr=lang_en&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&num=100&as_brr=3&ei=z0oNTL6sB43MMomoyesE&cd=10#v=onepage&q=%22operation%20sharp%20guard%22&f=false |title=The elusive quest for European security: from EDC to CFSP|author=Simon Duke|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|ISBN=0-312-22402-8|year=2000 |accessdate=June 7, 2010[/tpl]  Some maintain that despite the nominal official joint command and control of the operation, in reality it was NATO staff that ran the operation.[tpl]Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=UhT4G7aXK9oC&pg=PA58&dq=blockade+%22operation+sharp+guard%22&lr=lang_en&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&num=100&as_brr=3&ei=z0oNTL6sB43MMomoyesE&cd=9#v=onepage&q=%22operation%20sharp%20guard%22&f=false |title=NATO's 'peace-enforcement' tasks and 'policy communities,' 1990-1999|author=Giovanna Bono|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|ISBN=0-7546-0944-8 |year= 2003|accessdate=June 7, 2010[/tpl][tpl]Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=KxuQSfPJeEoC&pg=PA170&dq=%22operation+sharp+guard%22&lr=lang_en&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&num=100&as_brr=3&ei=t34OTKSGKYayNs_ovKEI&client=firefox-a&cd=50#v=onepage&q=%22operation%20sharp%20guard%22&f=false |title=German foreign policy since unification: theories and case studies|author=Volker Rittberger|publisher=Manchester University Press|ISBN=0-7190-6040-0 |year=2001 |accessdate=June 8, 2010[/tpl]

==Blockade==

Fourteen nations contributed ships and patrol aircraft to the operation. At any given time, 22 ships and 8 aircraft were enforcing the blockade, with ships from Standing Naval Force Atlantic and Standing Naval Force Mediterranean establishing a rotating duty. (Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, the U.K., and the U.S.), and eight maritime patrol aircraft, were involved in searching for and stopping blockade runners.[tpl]Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3pQpZm_V3N8C&pg=PA65&dq=%22operation+sharp+guard%22&lr=lang_en&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&num=100&as_brr=3&ei=t34OTKSGKYayNs_ovKEI&client=firefox-a&cd=33#v=onepage&q=%22operation%20sharp%20guard%22&f=false |title=Putting teeth in the tiger: improving the effectiveness of arms embargoes|authors=Michael Brzoska, George A.

The operational area was divided into a series of "sea boxes", each the responsibility of a single warship.  Each boarding team was composed of a "guard team" to board and wrest control of the target ship, and a "search team", to conduct the search.
The ships were authorized to board, inspect, and seize both ships seeking to break the blockade and their cargo.[tpl]Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=L1i6EyQTTgkC&pg=PA229&dq=%22operation+sharp+guard%22&lr=lang_en&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&num=100&as_brr=3&ei=t34OTKSGKYayNs_ovKEI&client=firefox-a&cd=35#v=onepage&q=%22operation%20sharp%20guard%22&f=false |title=UN peacekeeping, American politics, and the uncivil wars of the 1990s|author=William J.

It marked the first time since its founding in 1949 that NATO was involved in combat operations.

===Lido II Incident===

The issue of differing views among nations in the coalition as to the use of force authorized by rules of engagement arose in April 1994.Stacey A. Poe, "Rules of Engagement: Complexities of Coalition Interaction in Military Operations Other than War", Faculty of the Nava War College, February 13, 1995  Faced with the Maltese tanker Lido II making its way towards Montenegrin port with 45,000 tons of fuel oil, a U.S. cruiser asked the NATO commander (a British Commodore) for guidance, and received authorization to use "disabling fire" to stop the tanker, if necessary.  He received confirmation that he should follow the British Commodore's guidance from his own higher authority.  Under U.S. Navy standards, "disabling fire" means firing rounds into the ship's engineering space. The U.S. cruiser was about to pass the order along to the Dutch Kortenaer class frigate HMNLS Van Kinsberger. However, the fact that the Dutch definition of "disabling fire" involves launching rounds into the bridge of the target ship, with an increased risk of loss of life, became important.  The ship was eventually stopped on May 1 and boarded by helicopter from HMNLS Van Kinsberger without firing a shot. Three Yugoslav Navy Končar class corvettes challenged the NATO operation and one of them tried to ram the British frigate HMS Chatham as it was assisting Van Kinsberger. The corvettes eventually fled following the reaction of the British warship, supported by Italian Tornado aircraft which scrambled from an airbase at Gioia Del Colle. The Lido II had to undergo repairs before being diverted to Italy, since the crew had sabotaged the ship's engine room. The leaking was contained by an engineer party from HMS Chatham. Seven Yugoslav stowaways were found on board."NATO and WEU ships encounter Yugoslav Navy while preventing violation of UN embargo".

===Statistics===

The "NATO and WEU forces challenged more than 73,000 ships, boarded and inspected almost 6,000 at sea, and diverted 1,500 suspect ships to ports for further inspection."  Of those, nearly a dozen vessels were found to be blockade runners, some carrying arms in violation of UN Security Council resolutions.  NATO officials said no ships were able to run the blockade successfully, and that the maritime blockade had a major effect in preventing escalation of the conflict.[tpl]Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kxExXlBYgcEC&pg=PA267&dq=%22operation+sharp+guard%22&lr=lang_en&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&num=100&as_brr=3&ei=t34OTKSGKYayNs_ovKEI&client=firefox-a&cd=9#v=onepage&q=%22operation%20sharp%20guard%22&f=false |title=The United Nations and the development of collective security: the delegation by the UN Security Council of its chapter VII powers|author=Danesh Sarooshi|publisher=Oxford University Press|ISBN=0-19-829934-6 |year=2000 |accessdate=June 8, 2010[/tpl]

===Suspension===

The blockade was suspended following a UN decision to end the arms embargo, and NATO's Southern Command said that: "NATO and WEU ships will no longer challenge, board or divert ships in the Adriatic".  The Independent warned at the time that "In theory, there could now be a massive influx of arms to Bosnia, Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), although senior military and diplomatic sources yesterday said that they thought this would be unlikely."
