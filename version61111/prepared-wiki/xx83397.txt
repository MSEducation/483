Sher Bahadur Deuba ([tpl]lang-ne|शेरबहादुर देउवा[/tpl] born June 13, 1946) is a Nepalese politician who was Prime Minister of Nepal from 1995 to 1997, from 2001 to 2002, and from 2004 to 2005. He is the second senior most leader of the Nepali Congress. He has twice been elected as the leader of parliamentary party of the Nepali Congress, thus enabling him to be elected twice as the Prime Minister of Nepal.
He was elected as Prime Minister for the second time when he succeeded Girija Prasad Koirala, who resigned in July 2001. A coup d'etat by King Gyanendra removed Deuba in October 2002.
After two other governments, much political protest for his restoration especially in capital Kathmandu, Gyanendra restored Deuba to the position of Prime Minister in 2004.
He was removed on February 1, 2005 by King Gyanendra, who dissolved the government for three years and seized direct power.
He was sentenced to two years in prison in July 2005 under corruption charges, but was subsequently released on February 13, 2006, after the anti-corruption body that sentenced him was outlawed. An official from Deuba's Nepali Congress Democratic Party, Dip Kumar Upadhaya, told the Associated Press that the former premier's release was "a victory for democracy and a humiliating defeat for the royal regime". http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/4711120.stm

==Political career==

He has been elected as a Member of Parliament three times, representing Dadeldhura District.
Following street protests against the UML government of Man Mohan Adhikari, he was declared the Parliamentary Leader of Nepali Congress in 1994.
In the election held to select the Parliamentary Leader for Nepali Congress following the resignation of Girija Prasad Koirala in 2001, he defeated Sushil Koirala by a huge margin. This victory established him as a powerful leader, especially because his rival was supported by Girija Prasad Koirala, the president of Nepali Congress.
However, in 2009, he lost the election for the position of the Leader of the Parliamentary Party of the Nepali Congress to Ram Chandra Paudel. The main reason of his loss had been attributed to his support to Party leader Girija Prasad Koirala who wants his daughter, an unpopular leader, Sujata Koirala to lead the party.
