It began with the Soviet invasion of Finland on 30 November 1939 (three months after the outbreak of World War II), and ended with the Moscow Peace Treaty on 13 March 1940. The League of Nations deemed the attack illegal and expelled the Soviet Union from the League on 14 December 1939.[tpl]cite web|title=League of Nations' expulsion of the U.S.S.R.|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/policy/1939/391214a.html|date=14 December 1939|publisher=League of Nations|accessdate=24 July 2009[/tpl]
The Soviet Union sought principally to claim parts of Finnish territory, demanding – amongst other concessions – that Finland cede substantial border territories in exchange for land elsewhere, claiming security reasons, primarily the protection of Leningrad, which was only 40 km from the Finnish border.Trotter (2002), p. 15Edwards (2006), pp. 28–29[tpl]qn|date=August 2013[/tpl] Finland refused and the Soviet Union invaded Finland. At this time the Soviet Union established a Communist puppet government for Finland, and intended to conquer all of Finland according to some sources.[tpl]cite book |editor1-last=Clemmesen |editor1-first=Michael H. |editor2-last=Faulkner |editor2-first=Marcus |title=Northern European Overture to War, 1939–1941: From Memel to Barbarossa| year=2013 |publisher=Brill |page=76 |isbn=978-90-04-24908-0[/tpl][tpl]cite book |editor1-last=Zeiler |editor1-first=Thomas W. |editor2-last=DuBois |editor2-first=Daniel M. |title=A Companion to World War II|series=Wiley Blackwell Companions to World History |volume=11 | year=2012 |page=210 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1-4051-9681-9[/tpl]Reiter (2009), p. 124 Other sources argue that there is no documentary evidence to support this and that there are arguments against the idea of a full Soviet conquest.Chubaryan (2000), p. xviTrotter (2002), p. 17
The Soviets possessed more than three times as many soldiers as the Finns, thirty times as many aircraft, and a hundred times as many tanks. The Red Army, however, had been crippled by Soviet leader Joseph Stalin's Great Purge of 1937.Bullock (1993), p. 489 With more than 30,000 of its officers executed or imprisoned, including most of those of the highest ranks, the Red Army in 1939 had many inexperienced senior and mid-level officers.Glanz (1998), p. 58Ries (1988), p. 56 Because of these factors, and high morale in the Finnish forces, Finland repelled Soviet attacks for several months, much longer than the Soviets expected.Ries (1988), pp. 79–80
However, after reorganization and adoption of different tactics, the renewed Soviet offensive overcame Finnish defenses at the borders. Finland then agreed to cede the territory originally demanded by the Soviet Union; the Soviets, having lost far more troops than anticipated, accepted this offer.
Hostilities ceased in March 1940 with the signing of the Moscow Peace Treaty. Finland ceded territory representing 11% of its land area and 30% of its economy to the Soviet Union.Edwards (2006), p. 18 Soviet losses were heavy, and the country's international reputation suffered.Edwards (2006), pp. 272–273 While the Soviet Union did not conquer all Finland, Soviet gains somewhat exceeded their pre-war demands. They gained substantial territory along Lake Ladoga, providing a buffer for Leningrad, and territory in northern Finland.VanDyke (1997), p. 44[tpl]qn|date=July 2012[/tpl] Finland retained its sovereignty and enhanced its international reputation.
The end of the war cancelled the Franco-British plan to send troops to Finland through northern Scandinavia. One of the operation's major goals had been to take control of northern Sweden's iron ore and cut its deliveries to Germany.Trotter (2002), p. 239 For this reason it was also a major factor in the launching of Operation Weserübung, Nazi Germany's invasion of Denmark and Norway.
