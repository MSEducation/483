Aalborg Søfarts- og Marinemuseum is a marine museum located on the wharf of Aalborg, Denmark. Inaugurated on 24 May 1992, in the presence of Her Majesty the Queen, the museum's collections have since been expanded considerably, including with an extensive collection of ship radios and navigation instruments, showing the development of such tools. The museum has over the years evolved to become one of Aalborg and North Jutland's most important attractions that is visited annually by thousands of tourists from home and abroad.
