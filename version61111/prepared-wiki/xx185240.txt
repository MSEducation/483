No Name Harbor is a natural harbor on Key Biscayne, Florida. It is located within the boundaries of Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park. In the 19th century, the site served as a food-rich rookery for herons, egrets, and other species of wildlife.[tpl]cite web|author=Key Biscayne Heritage Trail|url=http://www.key-biscayne.com/heritagetrail1/capefl1/nonamehbr.html|title=No Name Harbor|accessdate=2007-01-03[/tpl] Originally, the site was privately owned prior to the creation of the state park.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.key-biscayne.com/kb/capeflorida/nonameharborcapeflorida.shtml|title=Key Biscayne's Cape Florida No Name Harbor|accessdate=2007-01-03[/tpl] Several development plans indicated the land was slated for the construction of condominiums and residential homes. The surrounding land was cleared for development in the 1950s, and charts identified the body of water as "No Name Harbor". The plans failed, and the harbor's name was retained.
