For many years, various Baskin Robbins ice cream parlors prominently displayed this section of the statement in framed signs. ("There is hardly anything in the world that someone cannot make a little worse and sell a little cheaper, and the people who consider price alone are that man's lawful prey.")

</ref> The signs listed Ruskin as the author of the statement, but the signs gave no  information on where or when Ruskin was supposed to have written, published, or spoken the statement. Due to the statement's widespread use as a promotional slogan, and despite questions of Ruskin's authorship, it is likely that many people who are otherwise unfamiliar with Ruskin now associate him with this statement.
