He got his first break in film/TV when he was approached by a NYU film student and asked to act and be one of the executive producers in an independent film called "High's and Low's" directed by Justin Bartha (who played Riley Poole in National Treasure franchise), Failure to Launch and Gigli. Then, Darrell went on to play a role of a boxer in a TV pilot called The Contender directed by Hugh Wilson and produced by Tim Reid that, however, wasn't picked up as a series.
Darrell landed his first break on the hit TV series The King Of Queens as a party crasher, then followed up with a guest appearance on the hit TV series JAG. 
After finishing the work on JAG, he wrote, produced, directed and starred in his own film called One More Chance through his production company he founded in 2005, AES Media Enterprises Corp. in New York City, which was one of the finalists at the Gotham Short Film Festival and that gave him, afterwards, a recurring role as School Officer Turner in the hit HBO series The Wire (see Season 3 and 4) and many other offers.
