[[R18 certificate]]

CATEGORIES: British Board of Film Classification, United Kingdom pornography law

The R18 certificate represents a film or video classification given by the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC). It is intended to provide a classification for works that are within British obscenity laws, but exceed what the BBFC considers acceptable for its 18 certificate. In practice, this means hardcore pornography.
Under the terms of the 1984 Video Recordings Act all non-exempt videos sold or distributed within the UK must be given a certificate by the BBFC. The distibutor must decide whether a video is exempt.BBFC FAQ - What does the 'E' symbol mean, and it is an official category? Uncertificated recordings are not illegal, regardless of content (except where the content is actually illegal itself), but supply (i.e. sale, rental, loan or gift) of them is. The R18 certificate is the most restrictive of the certificates, and videos given this certificate may only be shown in licensed cinemas,bbfc - the official website of the bbfc. classification for entertainment, movies and video games or sold direct to the buyer in person in licensed sex shops, and are not allowed to be sold by mail order or other remote means such as by telephone or over the Internet.House of Commons - Culture, Media and Sport - Minutes of Evidence Hansard, paragraph 25." According to the BBFC there are currently around 250 such licensed shops.Knowing it when you see it:
The BBFC specifies in detail what kinds of acts are permitted to be depicted in works receiving an R18 certificate, and which are not. In particular, it prohibits:http://www.bbfc.co.uk/classification/guidelines/r18/
R18 does allow for the depiction of most sex acts, including vaginal sexual intercourse, oral sex, masturbation, and anal sex, between any combination of men and women, and some allowance may be made for moderate consensual BDSM.
As of 2008, the broadcasting of R18 material is prohibited, even on encrypted digital channels. Most cuts made by the BBFC are in the R18 category (e.g., 13.6% of R18 videos were cut in 2011, compared with 7.5% for 18, and 0.5% or less for other categories).http://www.bbfc.co.uk/classification/statistics/http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php/site/printable/7320/

==History of the R18 certificate==

The R18 classification was created in 1982 in response to the recommendations in 1979 of the Home Office Committee on Obscenity and Film Censorship chaired by Sir Bernard Williams. Originally it was only used for films featuring simulated sex only, but the BBFC found itself forced to award R18 certificates to hardcore films in 2000 after a series of legal appeals and a judicial review of those appeals.
The introduction of the R18 certificate for hardcore films is widely seen by observers as a reaction to more liberal attitudes in British society to pornography, the de facto legalisation of the import of hardcore pornography (but not its sale) across the EU because of customs law harmonisation, and the widespread availability of unregulated pornography over the Internet.

==Material prohibited in R18 certificate works==

Although consensual sex acts between adults can be shown in explicit detail in R18 pornographic works, the following is prohibited:
The acts include those deemed likely to contravene the Obscene Publications Act 1959. Depiction of urolagnia, fisting and various hardcore BDSM acts were deemed legal in January 2012 in R v Peacock; it is unclear as to whether the BBFC will revise its guidelines, but they announced that they are discussing what to do next.http://www.eyeforfilm.co.uk/feature.php?id=950

==Recent developments==

The BBFC has previously granted 18 certificates for movies containing short scenes of unsimulated sex, such as Catherine Breillat's Romance (in 1999), Virginie Despentes's Baise Moi (in 2000) and Patrice Ch√©reau's Intimacy (in 2001).
In October 2004, the BBFC granted an 18 certificate for Michael Winterbottom's movie 9 Songs, which features a number of explicit scenes of unsimulated sex. However, the DVD extras for this film were given an R18 certificate.
In late 2004 a group of video distributors appealed to the Video Appeals Committee (VAC) against the BBFC's decision to award R18 certificates to 9 films that the distributors wished to be reclassified as 18. A press release issued by the BBFC on 20 July 2005 announced that the VAC had dismissed that appeal.BBFC press release 20 July 2005
As of 2006, the BBFC rated the film Destricted an 18 certificate.BBFC press release 4 July 2006 In 2008 the hardcore version of Tinto Brass' Caligula was passed uncut for DVD with an 18.http://www.bbfc.co.uk/CVF021525
