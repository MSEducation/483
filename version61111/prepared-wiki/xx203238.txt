Agias or Hagias ([tpl]lang-el|[tpl]lang|grc|Ἀγίας[/tpl][/tpl]) was an ancient Greek poet, whose name was formerly written Augias through a mistake of the first editor of the Excerpta of Proclus.[tpl]Citation  | last = Schmitz  | first = Leonhard  | author-link =   | contribution = Agias (2)  | editor-last = Smith  | editor-first = William  | title = Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology  | volume = 1  | pages = 71  | publisher = Little, Brown and Company  | place = Boston  | year = 1867  | contribution-url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0080.html [/tpl]  This misreading was corrected by Friedrich Thiersch,Friedrich Thiersch, Acta Philol. Monac. ii. p. 584 from the Codex Monacensis, which in one passage has "Agias", and in another "Hagias".  The name itself does not occur in early Greek writers, unless it be supposed that the "Egias" or "Hegias" ([tpl]lang|grc|Ἡγίας[/tpl]) in Clement of AlexandriaClement of Alexandria, Stromata vi. p. 622 and Pausanias,Pausanias, Description of Greece i. 2. § 1 are only different forms of the same name.
Agias was a native of Troezen, and the time at which he wrote appears to have been about the year 740 BC.  His poem was celebrated in antiquity, under the name of Nostoi ([tpl]lang|grc|Νόστοι[/tpl]), i.e. the history of the return of the Achaean heroes from Troy, and consisted of five books.  The poem began with the cause of the misfortunes which befell the Achaeans on their way home and after their arrival, that is, with the outrage committed upon Cassandra and the Palladium; and the whole poem filled up the space which was left between the work of the poet Arctinus and the Odyssey.  The ancients themselves appear to have been uncertain about the author of this poem, for they refer to it simply by the name of Nostoi, and when they mention the author, they only call him "the writer of the Nostoi" ([tpl]lang|grc|ὁ τοὺς Νόστους γράψας[/tpl]).Athenaeus, vii. p. 281Pausanias, Description of Greece x. 28. § 4, 29. § 2, 30. § 2Bibliotheca ii. 1. § 5Scholiast, on the Odyssey iv. 12Scholiast, ad Aristoph. Equit. 1332Lucian, De Saltat. 46  Hence some writers attributed the Nostoi to Homer,Suda, s.v. [tpl]lang|grc|νόστοι[/tpl]Anthol. Planud. iv. 30 while others call its author a Colophonian.Eustathius of Thessalonica, on the Odyssey xvi. 118  Similar poems, and with the same title, were written by other poets also, such as Eumelus of Corinth,Scholiast, ad Pind. Ol. xiii. 31 Anticleides of Athens,Athenaeus iv. p. 157, ix. p. 466 Cleidemus,Athenaeus xiii. p. 609 and Lysimachus of Alexandria.Athenaeus iv. p. 158Scholiast, on Apollonius of Rhodes i. 558  Where the Nostoi'' is mentioned without a name, it was generally understood to have been the work of this Agias.
