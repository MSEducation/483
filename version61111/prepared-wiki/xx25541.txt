The Aeron chair is an office chair produced by Herman Miller, and designed in 1994 by Don Chadwick and Bill Stumpf. Its design has a spot in the Museum of Modern Art's permanent collection.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?criteria=O%3AAD%3AE%3A7392&page_number=1&template_id=1&sort_order=1|title=Aeron Chair in the MoMA Collection|accessdate=2009-02-10[/tpl]
Almost two-thirds of the Aeron Chair is made out of recycled materials, and almost the entire chair -around a 94%- is recyclable.
It is generally considered to be the best chair in the world by computer professionals, and possession or use of Aeron chairs is often seen as a mark of status or success.  The frantic buying of them following by their second hand resales during the dotcom bubble was viewed as a barometer of the economic conditions of that time.

==Name==

The chair was named after Aeron (Celtic mythology) as well as referring to aeration and aeronautics.
