Dr. Warren Eugene Amling (December 29, 1924 â€“ November 1, 2001) was an American football and basketball player, playing for the Ohio State Buckeyes from 1944 to 1946.   He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1984.
In 1945 Amling was a unanimous All-America selection at guard on the Buckeye football team and finished seventh in the vote for the Heisman Trophy.  In 1946 he was elected the team captain and volunteered to move to tackle, a position where the team was thinner.  At this new position he was again named an All American by the Sporting News and the Football Writers Association of America.  Amling was inducted into the Ohio State Varsity O Hall of Fame in 1981 and the College Football Hall of Fame in 1984, and was selected to the Ohio State Football All-Century Team (at guard) in 2000.  
Amling was also a starter for the Ohio State basketball team.  He is the only member of the College Football Hall of Fame to start in an NCAA Final Four game. 
Amling graduated from Ohio State in 1947 and turned down a chance to play for the New York Giants, choosing instead to practice veterinary medicine in London, Ohio. He served as a member of the board of directors of Wittenberg University in the late 1970s.
