The Excalibur Hotel and Casino is a hotel and casino located on the Las Vegas Strip in Paradise, Nevada, in the United States.  It is owned and operated by MGM Resorts International.
Excalibur, named for the mythical sword of King Arthur, uses the Arthurian theme in several ways.  Its facade is a stylized image of a castle.  Until 2007, a wizard-like figure representing Merlin looked out from a high turret (since replaced by a figure advertising Dick's Last Resort).
Excalibur is situated at the Tropicana - Las Vegas Boulevard intersection. The hotel is linked by overhead pedestrian bridges to neighboring casinos to the north (New York-New York, across Tropicana Avenue) and to the east (Tropicana, across the Strip). There is a free tram that connects Excalibur to its sister MGM Resorts International properties to the south, Luxor and Mandalay Bay.

==History==

The land on which the Excalibur sits was originally the proposed site of the Xanadu Resort envisioned in the 1970s.  The 1730 room Asian-tropical themed resort would have been the first mega resort in Las Vegas.  The project was never built when the developers could not secure a deal with the county on the sewer infrastructure such a large project would have required.Paradise Misplaced: Cost Approach to Value
Excalibur opened on June 19, 1990 and was originally built by Circus Circus Enterprises, which was purchased in 2005 by MGM Resorts International.  When it opened, Excalibur was the largest hotel in the world with over 4,000 rooms and covering over 70 acres.[ref]

Excalibur was originally designed in line with the "theme resort" strategy popular among some casino operators during the 1990s which included the traditional Las Vegas gaming experience coupled with family-oriented elements.[tpl]cite news|title=Company News; 30,000 Jam New Las Vegas Casino|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/20/business/company-news-30000-jam-new-las-vegas-casino.html?scp=1&sq=%2230%2C000+jam+new+las+vegas+casino%22&st=nyt|accessdate=10 November 2010|newspaper=The New York Times|date=20 June 1990[/tpl] However, since 2006 most of the medieval themed statues and scenery have been removed as part of a four-year renovation and modernization project. As of 2010, few of the themed wall murals still remained as Excalibur was updated to include more modern and understated elements, including contemporary furniture and flat-screen plasma TVs in 2,000 renovated guest rooms.[tpl]cite news|last=Padgett|first=Sonya|title=Comfort is Key: The Feel of Luxury|url=http://www.lvrj.com/living/16489586.html|accessdate=10 November 2010|newspaper=Las Vegas Review-Journal|date=11 March 2008[/tpl]
