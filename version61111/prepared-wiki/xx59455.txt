==History==

Al-Ruways stood on the site of the Crusader town of Careblier.Khalidi, 1992, p.28. In 1266, a Crusader vanguard returning from a raid in Tiberias to Acre was ambushed by Mamluk forces based in Safad in Careblier.Bronstein, 2005, p.46. Based on tradition, the people of the village professed to have blood relations with Husam ad-Din Abu al-Hija. Hussam ad-Din was a high-ranking officer in the Ayyubid army of Saladin.Benvenisti, 2000, p.195.
In the late nineteenth century, al-Ruways was situated on open ground with olive groves to the north of the village. Its population of 400 was entirely Muslim.Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP, Vol. I, p.271. Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 28 Under the British Mandate of Palestine in the early twentieth century, al-Ruways was one of the smallest villages in the District of Acre, with a population of 217 in 1931, and consisting of two quarters. The village had a mosque, its children attended school in nearby al-Damun. The villagers drinking water came from domestic wells, and they primarily grew wheat, corn, sesame, watermelons, and olives. In Sami Hadawi's population survey, al-Ruways had a population of 330 in 1945.Hadawi, 1970, p.41.
On July 18, 1948, two days after Nazareth was occupied by Israel's Seventh Brigade in Operation Dekel, some units advanced into the Western Galilee and captured a number of Arab villages, one of which was al-Ruways. The inhabitants fled after bombardment and the fall of major neighboring towns (Shefa-'Amr and Nazareth).Khalidi, 1992, p.29.Morris, 2004, pp.421-423. According to Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi, "the site is deserted. The debris of old wells and cement roofs is strewn of over the site, which is otherwise covered by a forest of eucalyptus trees and cactus."
