==Song information==

The song was considered controversial, as it dealt with the subject matter of masturbation. It was also included on the Parents Music Resource Center's "Filthy Fifteen" list, due to its sexual lyrics;  this led to the creation of the Parental Advisory sticker.  (Other songs on the "Filthy Fifteen" list included tracks by Madonna, Prince, and AC/DC.) In an interview on The Howard Stern Show, Lauper stated that she recorded the vocals of the song while nude.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/people/archive/peoplearchive.php/Cyndi_Lauper/biography/|title=Cyndi Lauper Biography|work=Monsters and Critics[/tpl]
Lauper said she wanted little kids to think the song was about dancing, and to understand the real meaning as they got older. She never directly stated in the song what the meaning of the song was, so it could receive airplay.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2009[/tpl]
The single has been released in over 32 variations across the world, the most common being a two track 7" vinyl single (with varying covers) and a two track 12" vinyl single (also with varying covers).
Lauper recorded a slow ballad version of the song for her album The Body Acoustic.
Lauper stated at a concert during her 2013 She's So Unusual anniversary tour that she recorded the song topless in a dark room and tickled herself under her arms which is why there is her laughter on the track.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Kca1UkrkiQ|title=Cyndi Lauper Speaks In 2013 Concert[/tpl]

==Music video==

An accompanying music video aired heavily on MTV and featured Lauper as a quirky sexual liberator leading the brainwashed masses to their own liberation. (This was done in metaphor showing teenagers as fast-food consuming zombies.) There were many double entendres indicating the song's true meaning, including a magazine that Lauper is staring at titled "Beefcake" and other sexual meanings such as the "self-service" sign and three gas pumps with the signs Good, Better and Nirvana in the cartoon part of the video, the vibrating motorcycle, the "masterbingo" part of the video with "Uncle Siggy" Sigmund Freud as host, and Lauper wearing blackout glasses with a white cane in several scenes of the video.  In fact, the video doesn't go as far as the lyrics, as the magazine referenced in the song ("...in the pages of a Blueboy magazine") was a popular gay erotica magazine of the time, whereas the magazine Lauper holds represents the tamer — and somewhat closeted — erotica of an earlier era. Nor did the lyrical reference come out of the blue: Lauper has stated that finding a copy of Blueboy lying around in the recording studio provided the impetus for writing "She Bop."[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2009[/tpl]
