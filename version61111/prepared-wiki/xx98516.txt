One form of money belt is a belt with a pouch attached to the front which is worn under a shirt to protect valuables from thieves and/or pickpockets.[tpl]cite web|url=http://studenttravel.about.com/od/mattersofmoney/qt/moneybelt.htm|publisher=studenttravel.about.com|title=Money Belts Hide Cash, Traveler's Checks and Papers|first=Kathleen | last=Crislip| accessdate=2014-01-27[/tpl] Another form appears to be an ordinary belt when worn, but contains one or more hidden pockets on the inside, often closed with a zipper. Money belts are often worn by tourists as a precaution against theft.

A significant problem is that scammers, pickpockets, beggars, and the like, know that the presence of a money belt brings a high likelihood of the bearer being a tourist, and therefore a high value target, bringing more attention upon the wearer than desirable.
