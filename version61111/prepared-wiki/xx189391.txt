Necessary Response is an electronic musical project created by Daniel Graves. According to Graves, the songs were produced from tracks which did not fit into the format of his other project, Aesthetic Perfection.
Beginning in early 2005, a forum thread on side-line.com even featured a short debate on the identity of band members spurred by fan interest in the band. Previously, Machineries of Joy Vol. 3, a compilation from industrial/EBM label Out of Line, was released containing the track "Forever." At the time, there were no online sources which could provide information on the band. Fans on the side-line.com forum expressed interest in the artist, but no one could initially provide information on the identity of the person or persons involved with the project.

As a result, Graves was able to temporarily keep his identity a secret. Shortly before announcing the release date of the debut album, Graves added his own name and location to the bands' MySpace page and publicly admitted to being the artist behind the project.
On March 16, 2007 (coincidentally Graves' birthday) Blood Spills Not Far From the Wound was released, and in February 2008, Necessary Response toured the U.S. promoting the album and supporting synthpop act De/Vision.
On April 22, 2009, Daniel Graves posted a blog entry on the Necessary Response MySpace page effectively ending the project in order to focus on Aesthetic Perfection. That same year, Necessary Response performed their final concert at the Kinetik Festival in Montreal.http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=5605322&blogId=484770815
On September 13, 2012, Daniel Graves posted on the official Aesthetic Perfection Facebook page that "I wish there was a way to telepathically project, to everyone, that Necessary Response is dead, buried, and will not return... ever."https://www.facebook.com/aestheticperfection/posts/10151396979836521
