==History==

The club was originally founded in the 1927/28 season, but disbanded in 1934. Midleton RFC was reformed on 4 March 1967.
After a number of decades in the Junior leagues, Midleton attained Senior status after a superb 97/98 campaign.
The club has successfully kept its Senior status ever since and have won promotion from Division 2B to Division 2A.
A significant revamp of club facilities in the mid-2000s, a thriving Mini's section and strong ties with the local community has seen the club go from strength to strength in recent years.http://www.irishrugby.ie/news/13120.php
