Parker Morse Bohn III (born July 13, 1963) is a left-handed American professional bowler and has been a member of the Professional Bowlers Association since 1984. He currently ranks sixth all-time with 33 career PBA titles, and has earned over $2.7 million in PBA events—good for fourth on the all-time list. Bohn also won the $150,000 winner-take-all prize in the 2008 Motel 6 Roll to Riches event, but the earnings in this event do not count toward PBA career totals. Through the end of the 2011-12 season, he has thrown 88 career perfect 300 games in PBA competition, including one of the PBA's 22 nationally-televised 300 games at the 1998 ABC (USBC) Masters in Reno, Nevada.Exempt player bios at www.pba.com
Bohn's best career stretch was from 1997 through 2001-02, during which he won 18 titles overall and at least one title each season. His best single season came in 1999, when he won five titles and earned PBA Player of the Year honors.  The '99 season featured a streak in which Parker won eight consecutive televised matches.  His 1999 single-season average of 228.03 ranks third all-time (topped only by Norm Duke's 228.47 in 2006-07 and Walter Ray Williams' 228.34 in 2007-08).  He would also be named Player of the Year in the 2001-02 season, a year highlighted by his first major championship title (2001 ABC Masters).  Bohn is a four-time winner of the PBA's Steve Nagy Sportsmanship award. He is a member of both the PBA and USBC Halls of Fame.  Bohn won his second major championship at age 49 by winning the PBA World Championship in January 2013.
Highly active in promoting youth bowling, Bohn has established an annual Parker Bohn III Youth Scholarship Tournament. Since its inception in 1999, the tournament has awarded over $33,000 to junior bowlers in the form of college scholarships.

==Personal==

Bohn was born in Jackson Township, New Jersey. He currently lives in New Jersey with his wife, Leslie, and three children, Justin, Brandon, and Sydney.  He has two adult sons, Parker IV and Evan, from his first marriage.  He is the brother-in-law of fellow PBA bowler, Doug Kent (Doug's wife Chrissie and Parker's wife Leslie are sisters).  Parker Bohn (the first), PBIII's grandfather, was a five-time stock car (Modifieds and Sportsmen) racing champion at Wall (NJ) Stadium near his home at the Jersey Shore.

==In the media==

Besides making regular appearances on ABC-TV, CBS-TV and ESPN during his years on the PBA tour, Bohn has authored a book (with text by Dan Herbst) called Bowling: How to Master the Game (Universe Publishing).
A bowling arcade game also bears his name: Parker Bohn III Pro Bowler. The full-motion video game features audio voice-over by Parker himself.
Bohn appeared in the movie Kingpin with Woody Harrelson for a brief scene. He also appeared as Frank Cache in episode 10 of the Japanese television drama Golden Bowl, bowling against Shu Akutagawa (played by Takeshi Kaneshiro.) He even bowled right-handed, deliberately throwing the game to show his disdain for his opponent.
He is one of the professional opponents in the "PBA® Bowling Challenge" game for Android and iOS devices.
