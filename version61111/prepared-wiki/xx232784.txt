[[Hexagonal pyramid]]

CATEGORIES: Pyramids and bipyramids, Self-dual polyhedra, Prismatoid polyhedra

In geometry, a hexagonal pyramid is a  pyramid with a hexagonal base upon which are erected six triangular faces that meet at a point (the apex). Like any pyramid, it is self-dual.
A right hexagonal pyramid with a regular hexagon base has C6v symmetry.
A right regular pyramid is one which has a regular polygon as its base and whose apex is "above" the center of the base, so that the apex, the center of the base and any other vertex form a right triangle.
