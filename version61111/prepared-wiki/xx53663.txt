Publius Terentius Varro Atacinus ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|v|æ|r|oʊ[/tpl]; 82 BC – c. 35 BC) was a Roman poet, more polished in his style than the more famous and learned Varro Reatinus, his contemporary, and therefore more widely read by the Augustan writers.Charles Thomas Cruttwell, History of Roman Literature 1877: Book II, part I Note III He was born in the province of Gallia Narbonensis, the southern part of Gaul with its capital at Narbonne, on the river Atax (now the Aude), for his cognomen Atacinus indicates his birthplace.
Only fragments of his works survive. His first known works are Bellum Sequanicum, a poem on Julius Caesar's campaign against Ariovistus, and some satires; these should not be confused with the Menippean Satires of the other Varro, of which some 600 fragments survive.  He translated the Alexandrian poet Apollonius Rhodius' Argonautica into Latin.  
Of Varro's fragments, the  epigram on "The Tombs of the Great" is well-known; whether or not it is truly Varro's it has the terse and skeptical Roman note, the equivalent of a haiku:
