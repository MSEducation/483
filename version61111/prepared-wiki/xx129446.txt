==History==

Westland Center was developed by J.L. Hudson Corporation. It was designed by Victor Gruen Associates and  Louis G. Redstone Associates.[tpl]cite book |author=McElroy, Martin C.

Westland Center played a role in local history. During the early 1960s, the city of Livonia planned to annex the part of Nankin Township in which the mall was to be built. The shopping center eventually opened in 1965, joining Northland and Eastland malls in other Detroit Metro cities. In reaction to Livonia's annexation attempts, the people of Nankin Township voted to incorporate the remainder of the township as a city on May 16, 1966, known as the City of Westland, naming it after the mall.
During its opening, the mall's anchors were a four-story Hudson's department store, a Kresge store, and a Kroger supermarket. Kroger was closed and demolished to make way for a J.C. Penney department store in 1976. As the department store was built by A. Alfred Taubman, he went on with his company to build the other Taubman malls. In the early 1980s, MainStreet joined the mall and remained there until Kohl's converted from that store in 1988. A year later, Kresge closed its store and was replaced with smaller stores. Sears added a store to the mall in 1997, the first Sears to open in Metro Detroit in over 20 years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DTNB&s_site=detnews&f_site=detnews&f_sitename=Detroit+News%2C+The+%28MI%29&p_multi=DTNB&p_theme=gannett&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0F7500B88332150E&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Retail: Battling for shoppers: Metro Detroit's older malls fight for customers, survival: Competition, changing needs drive evolution in shopping|date=19 September 1999|work=The Detroit News|accessdate=16 April 2010[/tpl] In 2001, Hudson's was converted to Marshall Field's, which in turn became Macy's in 2006.
