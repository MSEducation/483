The Hume Highway/Hume Freeway/Hume Motorway is one of Australia's major inter-city highways, running for [tpl]convert|807|km|mi[/tpl] between Melbourne and Sydney.[tpl]Cite report |first1=Emma|last1=Dixon|first2=Cassandra|last2= Hay|other=Reviewed and approved by Hugh Swinbourne|date=2009-09-06|title=Hume Highway Holbrook Bypass Environmental Assessment|url=http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/roadprojects/projects/south_western_region/hume_hway_dup/holbrook_bypass/public_information.html|publisher=NSW Roads and Traffic Authority |page=1|chapter=Chapter 1.

The road is called the Hume Freeway in Victoria, the Hume Motorway between [tpl]NSWcity|Prestons[/tpl] and [tpl]NSWcity|Berrima[/tpl], New South Wales, and the Hume Highway elsewhere in New South Wales. It is part of the Auslink National Network and is a vital link for road freight to transport goods to and from the two cities as well as serving Albury-Wodonga and Canberra.
The main alternative route between Sydney and Melbourne is the Princes Highway/Princes Freeway/Princes Motorway route (A1/M1) which follows the coast for most of its length. Other inland alternate routes include the  Olympic Highway route (A41) between Albury and Sydney via Cowra and Bathurst, and also the Federal Highway / Monaro Highway route (M23/A23/B23) via Canberra which links with the Hume Highway near Goulburn and the Princes Highway in East Gippsland.
In Victoria from 2013, the National Highway shield will be replaced (over time), with a standard alphanumeric state route number.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]

==History==

The coast of New South Wales from the Queensland border to the Victorian border is separated from the inland by an escarpment, forming the eastern edge of the Great Dividing Range. There are few easy routes up this escarpment. To climb from the coast to the tablelands the Hume Highway uses the Bargo Ramp, a geological feature which provides one of the few easy crossings of the escarpment.
In the first twenty years of European settlement at Sydney (established 1788), exploration southwest of Sydney was slow. This area was heavily wooded at the time, especially the "Bargo brush", which was regarded as almost impenetrable.  In 1798 explorers (Wilson, Price, Hacking, and Collins) reached the Moss Vale and Marulan districts, but this was not followed up.  Any settlement would have to await the construction of an adequate access track, which would have been beyond the colony's resources at the time, and would have served little purpose as a source of supplies for Sydney, due to the time taken to reach Sydney. In 1804, Charles Throsby penetrated through the Bargo brush to the country on the tablelands near Moss Vale and Sutton Forest.  On another expedition in 1818, he reached Lake Bathurst and the "Goulburn Plains".[tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.abs.gov.au/Ausstats/abs@.nsf/0/4e782ee652d0db0aca2569de001fb2dd?OpenDocument | title=Official Year Book of the Commonwealth of Australia 1931 | publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics www.abs.gov.au | accessdate=2006-04-28 [/tpl]  Many of the early explorers would most likely have used aboriginal guides, but they do not appear to have given them credit.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl]
After Charles Throsby's 1818 journey towards present day Goulburn, followed by Hamilton Hume and William Hovell's overland journey from Appin (near Campbelltown) to Port Phillip and return in 1824, development of the Southern Tablelands for agriculture was rapid.  The present route of the Hume Highway is much the same as that used by the pioneers.
The route taken by the Hume Highway to climb from the coast to the Southern Tablelands and thence across the Great Divide is situated between the parallel river gorge systems of the Wollondilly and Shoalhaven Rivers. This country consists generally of a gently sloping plateau which is deeply dissected by the Nepean River and its tributaries. The route of the Highway, by using four high-level bridges to cross these gorges, avoids the Razorback Range, and has minimal earthworks. The climb from the western side of the Nepean River at Menangle up to Mittagong is fairly sustained, a fact that is hard to appreciate at high speed on the modern freeway.  The highway climbs non-stop over a distance of 16 km from the Pheasant's Nest bridge over the Nepean River to Yerrinbool, before dropping slightly before the final climb to reach the tablelands at Aylmerton.

===Early road construction===

Governor Lachlan Macquarie ordered the construction of a road, which became known as the Great South Road (the basis of the northern end of the Hume Highway) in 1819 from Picton to the Goulburn Plains and he travelled to Goulburn in 1820, but it is unlikely that even a primitive road was finished at that time.
The Great South Road was rebuilt and completely re-routed between Yanderra and Goulburn by Surveyor-General Thomas Mitchell in 1833.  The Main Roads Management Act of June 1858 declared the Great Southern Road, from near Sydney through Goulburn and Gundagai to Albury, as one of the three main roads in the colony.  However, its southern reaches were described as only a 'scarcely formed bullock track' as late as 1858.  The road was improved in the mid-1860s with some sections near Gundagai "metalled" and all creeks bridged between Adelong Creek (approximately 10 kilometres south of Gundagai) and Albury.[tpl]Cite web|url = http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/index.cgi?action=heritage.show&id=4309569 | title = 	Hillas Creek Bridge| work = Heritage and conservation register| publisher = Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales | year = 2004 | accessdate = 2008-03-16 [/tpl]
Mitchell's route, except for the bypasses at Mittagong, Berrima and Marulan (dual carriageways were completed in 1986) is still largely followed by the current highway.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2008[/tpl] Mitchell intended to straighten the route north of Yanderra, but was not granted funding, although his proposed route through Pheasants Nest has similarities to the freeway route opened in 1980.[tpl]Cite book| last=Lay | first=Max | title =History of Australian Roads | publisher = Australian Road Research Board  |year=1984 | isbn = 0-86910-164-1 [/tpl] Mitchell's work on the Great South Road is best preserved at Towrang Creek (10 kilometres north of Goulburn), where his stone arch culvert still stands, although it was superseded in 1965 by a concrete box culvert which in turn was superseded by the current route of the highway when it was duplicated in 1972.
In 1914 the NSW section of the highway was declared a main road. Until it was named the Hume Highway in 1928 it was known as the "Great South Road" in NSW and "Sydney Road" in Victoria.  It was named after Hamilton Hume, who with William Hovell were the first Europeans to traverse an overland route between Sydney and Port Phillip, in what later became Victoria.

==Route==

At its Sydney end, the Hume Highway begins at Parramatta Road, in Summer Hill. This route is numbered as A22. The first 35 km of the highway was known as Liverpool Road until August 1928, when it was renamed as part of the Hume or Great Southern Highway, as part of the creation of the NSW highway system. Sections of the highway through Sydney's suburbs continue to be also known by its former names of Liverpool Road, Sydney Road and Copeland Street (through Liverpool).
The main Hume Highway effectively commences at the junction of the M5 South Western Motorway and the Westlink M7 at Casula. Heading eastbound, the M5 provides access to Sydney Airport and the CBD; while the M7 provides access to Newcastle and Brisbane bypassing the Sydney CBD. Both of these routes are tolled.
Other than sections within the urban areas of Sydney and Melbourne, the Hume Highway is dual carriageway or freeway standard for its full length in Victoria and New South Wales.
Although the full length of the Hume Highway is dual carriageway (with at-grade intersections and restricted entry from adjoining land), there are considerable lengths of the highway which are of full freeway standard. Most of these sections are bypasses of the larger towns on the route, where the need to deviate the route to construct the bypass made it practical to deny access from adjoining land and thus provide full freeway conditions. In addition to these bypasses the sections between Casula (in southwestern Sydney) and Berrima (built 1973–92), and Broadford to Wallan (1976), which both were constructed as major deviations, are also of full freeway standard. The entire section in Victoria is categorised as a freeway by government roads authority VicRoads, although there a few intersections along the route that are not yet grade-separated. The speed limit on the full length of the highway is [tpl]convert|110|kph|mph|disp=5|abbr=on[/tpl].
As the Hume Freeway approaches Melbourne at the suburb of Craigieburn, 27 km north of the city centre, the Craigieburn Bypass now diverts the Hume Freeway (and the M31 designation) to the east of the former route, to terminate at the Western Ring Road/Metropolitan Ring Road (M80). This bypass was opened in two stages, in December 2004 and December 2005.
At its Melbourne end, the original alignment of the Melbourne–Sydney route followed Royal Parade northward from where it begins at its intersection with Elizabeth Street and Flemington Road. Royal Parade becomes Sydney Road at Brunswick Road and then became the Hume Highway itself at Campbellfield. This ceased to be the designated route of the Hume Highway in 1992, with the completion of Stage 1 of the Western Ring Road, at which point the designation of the southbound highway was truncated. The former highway south from the Western Ring Road to Elizabeth street is route is now numbered as State Route 55 and is now officially called Sydney Road (Hume Highway).

===Recent New South Wales upgrading===

Between February 2009 and March 2012, both carriageways were widened between Brooks Road and Narellan Road. This work was undertaken in 3 stages. The first stage, widening to 4 lanes each way between Brooks Road and St Andrews Road St Andrews was completed in 2010. The second stage, widening to 4 lanes each way between St Andrews Road and Raby Road commenced in 2009 and was completed in mid-2011. The final stage, widening to 3 lanes each way between Raby Road and Narellan Road, commenced in September 2010 and was completed in March 2012.F5 Freeway widening – RTA Construction of a pedestrian bridge over the highway to link Claymore and Woodbine was also completed. This section of the highway, opened as part of the two stages opened in October 1973 and December 1974, was originally designed for widening of the carriageways to three lanes.
Work commenced in 2010 on a [tpl]convert|9.5|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] bypass of Holbrook. The bypass was opened to traffic on 7 August 2013 after being postponed due to wet weather.[tpl]cite web|title=Holbrook bypass opens to traffic|url=http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/newsevents/news/2013/130806-holbrook-bypass-opens-to-traffic-tomorrow.html|work=Roads and Maritime Services|publisher=NSW Government|accessdate=6 August 2013|date=6 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Four lanes at last as bypass opens|url=http://au.prime7.yahoo.com/v1/news/a/-/local/18411793/four-lanes-at-last-as-bypass-opens-video/|work=Prime7|publisher=Yahoo!7|accessdate=8 August 2013|date=8 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Lambert|first=Olivia|title=Lawrence adds dash to Holbrook bypass opening|url=http://www.bordermail.com.au/story/1691704/lawrence-adds-dash-to-holbrook-bypass-opening-video-photos/?cs=11|accessdate=8 August 2013|newspaper=The Border Mail|date=8 August 2013[/tpl] The opening of the bypass resulted in dual carriageway (much to freeway standard) over the full length of the Hume Highway.

===Current Victorian Upgrade Projects===

VicRoads has undertaken a planning study for the upgrading of the Hume Freeway by removal of direct access from adjoining properties and grade-separation of the intersections between Kalkallo and Beveridge. These intersections have the highest accident rate of the Hume Freeway in Victoria.[tpl]Cite web|url = http://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/NR/rdonlyres/A245C58C-88F0-4D1D-B3E4-277DEBC17159/0/HumeKalkalloLandUseBusinessandAgricultureupdate.pdf| title =Hume Kalkallo Land Use Business and Agriculture|publisher = VicRoads |  accessdate = 2008-06-08 |format=PDF[/tpl] The study, completed in March 2009, intended to amend council planning schemes so as to reserve space for the upgrade, but no timetable has been set for the project.[tpl]Cite web|url = http://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/Home/RoadsAndProjects/RoadProjects/NothernSuburbs/HumeHighwayAccessRestoration+ProjectKalkallo.htm| title =Hume Highway, Kalkallo to Beveridge – Access restoration planning |publisher = VicRoads |  accessdate = 2009-06-08 [/tpl]
In addition a 4-level interchange between the Hume Freeway and the Outer Metropolitan Ring Road is proposed for construction after 2020.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/Home/RoadsAndProjects/RoadProjects/PlanningStudies/OuterMetropolitanRingPlanningStudy.htm| title =Outer Metropolitan Ring Road planning study|publisher = VicRoads |  accessdate = 2009-06-24[/tpl][tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/NR/rdonlyres/26785B2E-3762-4BCE-A89E-77FB9AF343C6/0/FigureS1maponly.jpg| title =Map of recommended option for Outer Metropolitan Ring Road |publisher = VicRoads |  accessdate = 2009-06-24 |format=jpg[/tpl]

===Landscapes===

Heading north from Melbourne, the road passes through the hills of the Great Dividing Range, some of which is covered with box eucalypt forest but of which much is cleared for farmland, before levelling out near Seymour to cross flat, mostly cleared farming country to Wodonga and the Victoria-New South Wales border. Victoria's landscape differs to that of the typical 'true Australian Outback', but a dry summer can leave the ground parched. Mount Buffalo can be seen in the distance to the east as the highway comes down off the Warby Range near Glenrowan, and a museum commemorating Ned Kelly is located nearby. At Wangaratta the highway passes close to the Rutherglen and Milawa wine-producing areas.
Continuing north, the Murray River, the south bank of which is the Victoria-New South Wales border, is crossed on the bypass of Albury-Wodonga. From Albury, the highway skirts Lake Hume and continues across undulating country generally north-east towards Holbrook and then Tarcutta. Just north of Tarcutta the highway encounters the first of several ranges which form outliers of the Great Dividing Range, and which are crossed as the highway climbs the slopes to the tablelands west of Yass. From here the highway runs eastward, to Goulburn where it again turns northeast. Most of the New South Wales countryside from Albury to Marulan has been developed for wool production, with Yass and Goulburn in particular noted for their fine wool.

===Fixed speed camera locations===

In April 2007, 'point-to-point' fixed speed-camera sites were installed, in the median strip along the Craigieburn Bypass section and northward to Seymour, in Victoria, at roughly 15–20 km intervals. These measure both instantaneous (flash photography) speed and its speciality in the point-to-point versions (between two or more sites and then the average speed is measured to the fixed speed limit, comparing how long it takes a vehicle to reach one point from another). There are five sites, with two cameras (radar version) at each, totalling ten altogether.[tpl]Cite web|url = http://www.camerassavelives.vic.gov.au/home/cameras/camera+systems/hume+freeway+point-to-point/ | title = Point-To-Point Speed Cameras - Hume Fwy | work = Speed & Red Light Cameras | publisher = Cameras Save Lives - Department of Justice (Victorian Government) non-VicRoads | year = 2012 | accessdate = 2013-11-27 [/tpl]

In Sydney: next to Ashfield Primary School, near Culdees Road Burwood, Willee St Enfield, Stacey St Bankstown, Brennan St Yagoona, and Knight St Lansvale.

===Former route allocations===

The Hume Highway has many former route allocations including former National Route 31.National Routes, Ozroads, Retrieved on 1 June 2013.[tpl]Self-published source|date=October 2013[/tpl] Where and when the former route numbers were implemented are stated below.

==Exits and major intersections==

===Sources===

Hume Highway on Google Maps.

==Towns==

In New South Wales, all towns on the Hume Highway have been bypassed. From Sydney, southwards to Victorian border, the bypassed towns include Campbelltown, Camden, Picton, Mittagong, Berrima, Marulan, Goulburn, Gunning, Yass, Bowning, Bookham, Jugiong, Coolac, Gundagai, Tarcutta, Holbrook, Woomargama and Albury.
In Victoria, all towns have been bypassed. They are, in order from the NSW border, Wodonga, Chiltern, Wangaratta, Benalla, Euroa, Violet Town, Seymour, Broadford and Craigieburn.

===Camden===

Camden lies 60 km south west of Sydney on the Nepean River, and the town dates from 1840. It retains a rural character with many historic buildings of interest remaining. There is an aviation museum at nearby Narellan. Urban sprawl has made Camden part of the Sydney metropolitan area.
The old route (pre-mid-1980s) of the Hume Highway runs straight west from the Cross Roads at Prestons, 4 km south of Liverpool to Carnes Hill, where it joins the route of the Cowpasture Road. It then runs southwest to Camden (the section of the former highway from the Cross Roads to Camden is now called Camden Valley Way).
Camden has been bypassed by the Hume Highway twice. The first bypass was opened in 1973, via the Macarthur Bridge, and runs from Narellan to Benkennie (South Camden). This bypass was in turn bypassed in December 1980 when the section of what was then called the South Western Freeway (route F5) from Campbelltown to Yerrinbool was opened. This linked the freeway sections from the Cross Roads to Campbelltown Rd at St Andrews (opened August 1973) and St Andrews-Camden Road (opened December 1974) to its north with the section from Yerrinbool to Aylmerton (opened May 1977) to its south.
From Camden south to Aylmerton the former highway is now named Remembrance Drive. It climbs southwards from Camden through the Razorback Ridge to Picton, then begins to climb through Tahmoor and Bargo to reach the Southern Tablelands and rejoin the present route of the Hume Highway at Aylmerton, 6 km north of Mittagong. The designation Hume Highway and national route 31 were transferred from what are now Camden Valley Way and Remembrance Drive to the freeway route in the mid-1980s and the former highway route from the Cross Roads to Aylmerton is now state route 89.
An alternative route to the highway runs from Aylmerton through Mittagong and Bowral to join the Illawarra Highway at Moss Vale and then follows the Illawarra Highway through Sutton Forest to rejoin the Hume Highway at Hoddles Crossroads (named after Surveyor Robert Hoddle who also laid out the Melbourne CBD).

===Mittagong===

Mittagong lies 110 km south-west of Sydney, just off the Hume Highway at the edge of the Southern Tablelands. It is notable for being the location of Australia's first ironworks.  Mittagong's streets are lined with various species of deciduous trees and it has a busy town centre.
Until August 1992 when the Mittagong bypass was opened, the town was dominated by trucks and in winter it was also busy with skiers' traffic on the way to the Australian Alps.  Today the Hume Highway bypasses Mittagong and all the towns of the Southern Tablelands.  In the late 1990s, engineers detected subsidence under part of the bypass where it runs along a steep slope near the Nattai River. This was caused by features of the local geology, and mining activity at the adjacent Mount Alexandra coalmine from the 1950s to the 1970s.[tpl]Cite web| year=2001 | url=http://www.dotars.gov.au/dept/media/2001/d4_2001.aspx | title=Media release: Plan to Bridge the Hume Highway at Mittagong | publisher=Department of Transport and Regional Services www.dotars.gov.au | accessdate=2006-04-26   [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] The problem was remedied by closing one carriageway at a time and building a pair of 'land bridges' across the unstable section of the slope.

===Moss Vale===

Moss Vale has several beautiful old and attractive buildings and Leighton Gardens, in the centre of the main street, is a pleasant park.  It is best during spring when its flowers are in blossom or in autumn when the leaves of its exotic deciduous trees are changing colour.
Sutton Forest is surrounded by farms, vineyards and is home to elegant country homes and estates.  It comprises a church, and inn, a couple of restaurants and one or two specialty shops.

===Berrima===

Berrima has flourished since it was bypassed in March 1989, with tourists finding it an easy day trip from either Sydney or Canberra to enjoy the town square and the Georgian architecture of this historic town.

===Marulan===

The Marulan bypass was opened in 1986. The southern part of Governor Lachlan Macquarie's road of 1819 ran from Sutton Forest roughly along existing minor roads through what is now Penrose State Forest to Canyonleigh, Brayton, Carrick and Towrang, where it joined the current route to Goulburn. Branching from this route (now part of the Illawarra Highway) just west of Sutton Forest, a road, now known as Old Argyle Road, developed in the 1820s.  It ran to Bungonia, via Wingello, Tallong, and the southern outskirts of Marulan.
When Thomas Mitchell rerouted the Great South Road in the 1830s, he decided to bring these two roads together to meet at old Marulan, with roads proceeding west to Goulburn and south to Bungonia.  When the railway reached Marulan in 1868, the town migrated 3 km north to the railway station.  Nevertheless, the old cemetery remains at the Bungonia Road intersection.  A quarry is about to be developed near the intersection, so an interchange is to be built. It is at this point that the highway climbs the Marulan Ramp, which is part of the divide between the Shoalhaven and Wollondilly River systems.

===Towrang Stockade===

Towrang Creek was the site of a major stockade for chain-bound convicts and others involved in the construction of the Great South Road. The stockade was located on the western side of the Highway and was used from around 1836 to 1842. The stockade became the principal penal establishment in the southern district and was noted for its harsh discipline. There were usually at least 250 convicts stationed there. They slept on bare boards with a blanket apiece, 10 men to a box or cell. One of the two official floggers was later found murdered[ref]
</ref>
The stockade used to be accessible by a stile, but this has been taken down to discourage use of the once daunting intersection of the Highway with Towrang Road. There are the remains of the powder magazine next to the Wollondilly River, three graves on the north bank of Towrang Creek, and the remains of a weir on Towrang Creek built for the stockade.  Aboriginal stone tools have also been found on the banks of Towrang Creek, indicating that this was a route well-travelled long before Hamilton Hume came this way in 1824.
There is also a rest area on the eastern side of the highway, where a well-preserved bridge dating from 1839 (possibly designed by David Lennox) and a 1960s concrete box culvert can be viewed.

===Goulburn===

Goulburn is the first city along the Hume Highway from Sydney. It is the centre of a rich agricultural area specialising in fine wool production. From this area comes some of the world's finest wool. Goulburn was bypassed on 5 December 1992 and the main street (Auburn Street) is quieter, but still busy during Saturday morning shopping.  Picturesque Belmore Park is located midway along Auburn Street. A number of architecturally and historically significant buildings are located near Belmore Park, including the courthouse, the post office and the railway station. Also in central Goulburn are two cathedrals, both of architectural note. A number of old houses and hotels are located near the railway station on Sloane Street.

===Gunning===

Gunning's 19th century main street was built very wide, for the time of horse and bullock-drawn wagons.  This served the town well when the main highway between Sydney and Melbourne carried cars and trucks through the town, which ceased when the bypass was completed on 5 April 1993. It is now much quieter, and the town has been able to resume a more rural pace of life and to develop something of an industry in providing bed and breakfast accommodation. The recently built Gunning Wind Farm is located beside the highway, with its wind turbines providing a distinctive landmark.

===Yass===

Yass has an historic main street, with well-preserved 19th century verandah-post pubs (mostly converted to other uses).  It is popular with tourists, some from Canberra and others taking a break from the Hume Highway. Hamilton Hume's farm Cooma Cottage is located east of Yass, close to the intersection of the former routes of the Hume and Barton Highways. He lived there until his death in 1873.  The Yass Bypass opened on 25 July 1994.

===Bookham===

Bookham is situated  29 km west of Yass.  The Hume Highway once passed through the village, but now bypasses it. The bypass was completed in two stages, the south stage opening on 18 February 1998 and the north stage opened on 11 July 2001.

===Coolac===

The 11 kilometre section at Coolac was the last two lane section of highway between Sydney and Gundagai until it was bypassed with a dual carriageway on 14 August 2009,[tpl]Cite web| title = Coolac Bypass | work = | publisher = Roads and Traffic Authority | date = | url = http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/constructionmaintenance/majorconstructionprojectsregional/southwest/coolac/index.html | accessdate = 2009-08-25[/tpl] after a delay due to indigenous heritage issues, the construction contract was awarded to Abigroup Contractors Pty Ltd in February 2007.[tpl]Cite news| title =More delays to highway bypass | publisher =Australian Broadcasting Corporation | date =14 February 2006 | url =http://www.abc.net.au/news/australia/nsw/riverina/200602/s1569224.htm | accessdate =2007-03-05 [/tpl][tpl]cite press release | title =Contract awarded to construct Coolac bypass | publisher =Australian Government | date =1 March 2007 | url =http://www.ministers.dotars.gov.au/jl/releases/2007/March/L022_2007.htm | accessdate =2007-03-05  [/tpl]

===Gundagai===

At Snake Gully, adjacent to the highway north of Gundagai is the "Dog on the Tuckerbox". A statue (with souvenir shop next door) was erected five miles (eight kilometres) from Gundagai. Snake Gully serves as a way station for many highway travellers.
Gundagai was bypassed on 25 March 1977 with the completion of the first Sheahan Bridge over the Murrumbidgee River. This bridge was the second longest road bridge in New South Wales (the Sydney Harbour Bridge being the longest), until the completion of the duplicate Sheahan Bridge on 17 May 2009,Sheahan Bridge duplication – NSW RTA, accessed 2009-06-13 which is now the longest road bridge in New South Wales (1 m longer than the Sydney Harbour Bridge). The original Sheahan Bridge was only 1 lane in each direction.
The Prince Alfred Bridge, on the old route of the highway across the Murrumbidgee floodplain, is of major engineering interest, as it is one of Australia's longest timber trestle bridges, as is the adjacent 1903 railway bridge.  Gundagai was originally located on the river flats directly beside the Murrumbidgee River, but a disastrous flood in 1852 destroyed the town and drowned 89 people. The town was then relocated to its present position. A grade-separated interchange was completed at the intersection of the Highway and West Street in December 2006.Hume Highway West Street Interchange Gundagai – NSW RTA, accessed 2009-06-13

===Tumblong===

The route of the highway between Tumblong and Tarcutta is the third route of the highway in this location. The original route led west from Tumblong along the Murrumbidgee River, before turning south over difficult country, crossing what is now the Sturt Highway and rejoining the current route of the highway as Lower Tarcutta Road. This was replaced in December 1938 by the first Tumblong deviation, to the east of the current route. The main features of this section of the highway were a deep, narrow cutting and the reinforced concrete bowstring arch bridge over Hillas Creek. This bridge has been preserved as it is one of only two bridges in New South Wales built to this design, and is visible on the western side of the highway close to the interchange with the Snowy Mountains Highway. The second and current deviation opened to traffic on 21 November 1983.
38 km southwest of Gundagai is the interchange with the Sturt Highway, which leads to Wagga Wagga, Mildura and Adelaide.

===Tarcutta===

Tarcutta is located almost exactly halfway between Sydney and Melbourne and has been a popular stopover and change-over point for truck drivers making their way between the two cities. There is a memorial to truck drivers who have died on the local stretch of the Hume Highway.
With improvements to the Hume Highway which have reduced travelling time between Sydney and Melbourne to about nine hours driving time in good conditions, the town's importance to the average motorist has diminished. It was near Tarcutta that the final section of the Hume Highway was sealed in 1940.
Construction began on a 7 km bypass of Tarcutta in 2010. The bypass, which passes west of the town, was opened to traffic on 15 November 2011.[tpl]Cite web| title = Tarcutta bypass | work = | publisher = Roads and Maritime Services | date = 2011-12-01 | url = http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/roadprojects/projects/south_western_region/hume_hway_dup/tarcutta_bypass/index.html | accessdate = 2011-12-08[/tpl]

===Holbrook===

Holbrook was called Germanton until anti-German sentiment during World War 1 led to the town and the shire being renamed in honour of the wartime submarine captain, Lt Holbrook who was awarded the Victoria Cross. From 1995, a feature of the town has been a partial reconstruction of HMAS Otway, an Oberon class submarine. This landmark was in recognition of the town's namesake's connections with submarines. In Holbrook is the only set of traffic signals (for pedestrians) that were remaining on the Hume Highway between the Sydney Orbital and Melbourne's Western Ring Road. The bypass was official opened by Prime Minister, Julia Gillard and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, Anthony Albanese on 23 June 2013, however the bypass did not open until 7 August 2013.[tpl]cite news|last=Myers|first=Fiona|title=PM opens Holbrook bypass|url=http://www.weeklytimesnow.com.au/article/2013/06/26/574723_national-news.html|accessdate=27 June 2013|newspaper=The Weekly Times|date=26 June 2013[/tpl]

===Table Top===

Table Top is about 16 km north of Albury. It has a population of approximately 4510 people.

===Albury-Wodonga===

Albury's history is linked with the two famous Australian explorers, Hamilton Hume and William Hovell, as the city's location sprung from their crossing of the Murray River. Albury, commonly associated with its Victorian twin, Wodonga, is one of the few rural Australian cities to experience a boom, mainly from industrialisation in recent times.
The Albury bypass, built by Abigroup,Albury Wodonga Hume Freeway project opened on 6 March 2007, having been first proposed in 1964. Following a series of announcements and changes of plans through the 1990s, when Albury residents failed to agree on whether an 'internal' or 'external' bypass route was more appropriate, the 'internal bypass' option was chosen, with approval being granted in 2004 and construction commencing in January 2005. The route is parallel to and on the eastern side of the Sydney–Melbourne railway, beginning at the railway overpass 10 km north of Albury. After crossing the Murray River, the bypass route crosses the railway to rejoin the previous highway at the southern end of the Lincoln Causeway, connecting to the Wodonga bypass. The Albury bypass includes a freeway standard connection to the Murray Valley Highway at Bandiana, east of Wodonga.

===Wangaratta===

Wangaratta is, after Wodonga, the largest centre in northeast Victoria (population 17,000). It is at the junction of the Hume and Ovens Highways (the 'Great Alpine Road'). Hume and Hovell passed through this area on their 1824 expedition and the town was founded in 1837 when the surrounding area was opened for farming. The town was bypassed in 1994.
The attractions around town include Merriwa Park, a sunken garden adjacent to the King River, Airworld at Wangaratta Airport, and old goldfield areas of nearby Beechworth and Chiltern.

===Benalla===

Benalla is a large town located just off the Hume Freeway between Melbourne and Wangaratta. Founded in 1848, growth was slow until a goldrush in the 1850s. It had many associations with the Kelly gang and the courthouse was the venue for a number of their trials. It also has a memorial to the Australian war hero Sir Edward 'Weary' Dunlop, an Australian doctor who acted as a leader to allied troops on the Thailand-Burma Railway in World War II. Its population estimate in 2011 was 10,332 http://localstats.qpzm.com.au/population/vic/northern-victoria/shepparton-central-north/benalla.

===Euroa===

Euroa is famous for a Ned Kelly bank robbery. The town is located on the Seven Creeks and has pretty gardens and a number of attractive 19th century buildings. Its estimated 2011 population was 3,167 http://localstats.qpzm.com.au/population/vic/northern-victoria/shepparton-central-north/euroa.

===Seymour===

The Hume Highway bypass of Seymour opened in December 1982.  Seymour remains on the Goulburn Valley Highway. The town is in the rich Goulburn Valley which supports the local vineyards. The large Puckapunyal military base is located west of Seymour. Once the centre of the bushranging area of Victoria, it has a museum which displays many period relics of that era. It was until the 1970s a major railway maintenance centre, and part of the railway workshops now houses a railway museum. The museum's collection of rolling stock, including State carriages used by governors and monarchs, is extensive.

===Kalkallo===

Construction of the Donnybrook Road interchange, immediately to the north of the Craigieburn Bypass, replaced the dangerous"Fix for deadly" – Star News Group – article, 22 May 2007 at-grade intersection with (C723) at Kalkallo an overpass and entry/exit ramps in both directions, at a cost of $32 million. Works commenced in December 2007 and completion occurred in March 2009, 3 months ahead of schedule.[tpl]Cite web|url = http://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/Home/RoadsAndProjects/RoadProjects/NothernSuburbs/Donnybrook+Road+Interchange.htm| title =Donnybrook Road Interchange Project|publisher = VicRoads |  accessdate = 2009-06-08 [/tpl]

===Craigieburn===

Prior to the opening of the Craigieburn Bypass in 2005, the Hume Highway skirted Craigieburn (the town centre was bypassed in the 1950s). The section of the Highway from Craigieburn to Campbellfield (on Melbourne's outskirts) was a significant bottleneck, with 12 sets of traffic signals in 17 km section of road.  The Craigieburn Bypass now links directly to the Western Ring Road/Metropolitan Ring Road. By 2013, the Hume Highway (Sydney Rd)section from Fawkner to Campbellfield was again becoming a bottleneck due to poor traffic signal coordination.
There was some opposition for the bypass by several local governments in the northern suburbs of Melbourne, including the City of Darebin and the City of Moreland, as well as local environmental groups. Their alternative proposal was rejected by the state government.BATCHELOR SLAMS COUNCILS OVER FLAWED RUSSELL REPORT – Media release, accessed 2009-06-13
A pedestrian and cyclist cement path – the Galada Tamboore Pathway – runs the length of the bypass and connects with the Metropolitan Ring Road path, from where it is possible to connect to the Merri Creek Trail, Western Ring Road Trail, the City of Whittlesea Public Gardens and Edgars Road.
The Craigieburn Bypass is shown in the 1969 Melbourne Transportation Plan as part of the F2 Freeway corridor, which extended south along Merri Creek, Hoddle St, Barkly St in St. Kilda, south through Elwood and Brighton, then east along South Road, connecting to the Dingley Freeway corridor.
