===Criticism===

The 2007 World Cup organizers were criticised early on for being over-commercialized and, in particular, the generally smaller crowds have been blamed on the ICC's security restrictions on things such as outside food, signs, replica kits and musical instruments, despite Caribbean cricketing customs,[tpl]cite web | url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/wc2007/content/story/288564.html | title=A public relations disaster | author=Tim de Lisle | publisher=Cricinfo | date=3 April 2007 | accessdate=24 May 2007[/tpl] as well as the authorities being accused of "running and cricketing traditions out of town, then sanitising it out of existence".[tpl]cite news | url=http://sport.guardian.co.uk/cricketworldcup2007/story/0,,2050381,00.html | title=Weep for the ghosts of calypsos past in this lifeless forum | author=Mike Selvey |work=The Guardian |location=London | date=5 April 2007 | accessdate=24 May 2007 [/tpl] Sir Viv Richards echoed the concerns.[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/other_international/west_indies/6531839.stm | title=Richards attacks Cup organisation |publisher=BBC | date=5 April 2007 | accessdate=24 May 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070506212209/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/other_international/west_indies/6531839.stm| archivedate= 6 May 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] The ICC were also condemned for high prices for tickets and concessions, which were considered unaffordable for the local population in many of the locations.[tpl]cite web | url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/wc2007/content/current/story/288885.html | title=Crushing the essence of the Caribbean | publisher=Cricinfo | date=5 April 2007 | accessdate=24 May 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070519181714/http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/wc2007/content/current/story/288885.html| archivedate= 19 May 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] ICC CEO, Malcolm Speed, said that the ICC recognised the problem but said it was the local organizers' fault.[tpl]cite web|url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/quote/content/current/page/156062.html|title=Quote ... unquote|publisher=Cricinfo|year=2007|accessdate=30 April 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070516213353/http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/quote/content/current/page/156062.html| archivedate= 16 May 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] However, the later matches had more crowds as the tournament progressed with the local organizers easing restrictions.[tpl]cite web | url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/wc2007/content/story/288990.html | title=Barbados determined to restore local flavour | publisher=Cricinfo | date=5 April 2007 | accessdate=24 May 2007[/tpl] Although they did not meet the target of US$42m, the revenue from ticket sales was double the ticket sales revenue from the last world cup and recorded the highest ticketing revenue for a Cricket World Cup with more than $32 million in ticket revenue.[tpl]cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/wc2007/content/current/story/290706.html|title=Ticket sales double of previous World Cup – Dehring|publisher=Cricinfo|date=16 April 2007|accessdate=30 April 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070418124554/http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/wc2007/content/current/story/290706.html| archivedate= 18 April 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
The World Cup was also criticised by the BCCI for its format because India failed to move on from the group stage after losing two matches after playing just 3 matches. The BCCI later claimed it would see to it that the ICC will alter its World Cup format for the 2011 Cricket World Cup.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/wc2007/2007/mar/27bindra.htm |title=Former BCCI chief blames format for India's exit |publisher=Rediff.com |date=2004-12-31 |accessdate=2013-08-16[/tpl] The elimination of India and Pakistan also caused a large exodus of subcontinental fans from the Caribbean, and removed the prospect of an India vs Pakistan Super Eights match, generally considered one of the most revenue generating and electric matches in the tournament.
The tournament was also criticised as being too long. At 6 weeks, it was the same length as the 2003 World Cup, but longer than the 5-week 1999 World Cup and the 4-week 1996 World Cup. The famous West Indian fast bowler Michael Holding also criticised the qualification process for the 2007 World Cup. Holding expressed doubts over the benefit to less established teams of turning up and being heavily defeated.[tpl]cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/wc2007/content/current/story/281062.html|title=Holding slams World Cup minnows|date=20 February 2007|accessdate=9 April 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070301202239/http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/wc2007/content/current/story/281062.html| archivedate= 1 March 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] However, former Scotland captain George Salmond claims that the opportunity to play one-day cricket against the bigger teams is invaluable for smaller teams such as his own, and questioned the validity of Holding's statements.[tpl]cite web|url=http://cricket.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1659807.cms |title=ICC associates hit back at Holding for his remarks |publisher=Cricket.indiatimes.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16[/tpl] The majority of the experts and players participating in the tournament backed up the smaller teams taking part in the World Cup.[tpl]cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/wc2007/content/current/story/285508.html|title=Bermuda have 'wonderful experience' in huge loss|publisher=Cricinfo|date=16 March 2007|accessdate=9 April 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070319225306/http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/wc2007/content/current/story/285508.html| archivedate= 19 March 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] This was further backed up with Ireland and Bangladesh making the Super 8s and being competitive and sportsmanlike throughout the tournament.[tpl]cite web|last=Fitzgerald|first=James|title=Ireland ranked tenth in LG ICC ODI Championship|url=http://www.icc-cricket.com/icc-odi/content/story/291931.html|publisher=International Cricket Council[tpl]![/tpl]ICC|accessdate=11 March 2014|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070428122434/http://www.icc-cricket.com/icc-odi/content/story/291931.html|archivedate=28 April 2007|date=22 April 2007[/tpl]
Further criticism was generated by the confusion at the end of the final match, during which the umpires suspended play due to bad light and while official announcements and the scoreboard declared Australia the winners and the Australian team celebrated, while the umpires incorrectly insisted that the game was only suspended not completed, and that 3 overs remained to be played. And so in farcical light conditions, Sri Lanka batted out the 3 overs following a gentleman's agreement between the two captains.[tpl]cite web|url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/wc2007/content/current/story/292772.html|title=Awesome Australia but awful organising|publisher=Cricinfo|date=28 April 2007|accessdate=30 April 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070501040007/http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/wc2007/content/current/story/292772.html| archivedate= 1 May 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] The umpires and ICC apologised for the unnecessary situation and cited it as an unnecessary fundamental error due to the pressure of the situation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/wc2007/content/current/story/292851.html|title=Speed apologises for light chaos|publisher=Cricinfo|date=28 April 2007|accessdate=30 April 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070502005031/http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/wc2007/content/current/story/292851.html| archivedate= 2 May 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] In June the ICC announced that the officials involved – onfield umpires Steve Bucknor and Aleem Dar, reserve umpires Rudi Koertzen and Billy Bowden, and match referee Jeff Crowe – would all be suspended from the 2007 Twenty20 World Championship.[tpl]cite web|url=http://content-nz.cricinfo.com/twenty20wc/content/current/story/299277.html|title=World Cup officials banned by ICC|publisher=Cricinfo|date=22 June 2007|accessdate=24 June 2007[/tpl]

===Preparation problems===

A number of preparation problems surfaced before the start of the World Cup. Some of the venues were not complete by the opening ceremony on 11 March 2007.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20070311/sports/sports12.html | title=Some Cup venues still not ready | date=11 March 2007 | accessdate=9 April 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070505102707/http://www.jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20070311/sports/sports12.html| archivedate= 5 May 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] At Sabina Park, seats had to be removed at the newly constructed north-stand due to safety concerns.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.indiaenews.com/america/20070311/42427.htm | title=A week before the opening Cricket World Cup game, chinks appear at Sabina Park | date=11 March 2007 | accessdate=9 April 2007[/tpl] At Trelawny Stadium in Jamaica, ground staff were unable to gain admission to the ground during the warm up matches due to accreditation problems.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2007/03/11/scath111.xml | title=Hosts hope calm is not followed by a storm | author=Mike Atherton |work=The Sunday Telegraph |location=London | date=12 March 2007 | accessdate=9 April 2007 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070320025708/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2007/03/11/scath111.xml| archivedate= 20 March 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Additionally, South Africa and Australia both expressed concerns over practice facilities.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/03/04/sports/CB-SPT-CRK-World-Cup-Roundup.php | title=Warmup matches start amid last minute preparations | date=4 March 2007 | accessdate=9 April 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070427104732/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/03/04/sports/CB-SPT-CRK-World-Cup-Roundup.php| archivedate= 27 April 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
