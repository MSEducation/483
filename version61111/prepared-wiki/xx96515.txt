[[Sigeberht of Wessex]]

Sigeberht (Sigeberht means roughly 'Magnificent Victory') was the King of Wessex from 756 to 757.
Sigeberht succeeded his distant relative Cuthred, but was then accused of acting unjustly.  He was removed from power by a council of nobles, but given control of Hampshire.  There, he was accused of murder, driven out and ultimately killed.  It is possible that this happened under the influence of Ã†thelbald of Mercia.  His brother Cyneheard was also driven out, but returned in 786 to kill Sigeberht's successor Cynewulf.
