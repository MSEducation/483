"Twist of Fate" is a late 1983 hit from Olivia Newton-John that headed the soundtrack for the film, Two of a Kind, starring Newton-John and John Travolta. It was written by Peter Beckett & Stephen Kipner[tpl]cite book|author=Joel Whitburn|title=Top Pop Annual|publisher=Record Research, Menomonee Falls, Wis.|date=1995[/tpl] and produced by David Foster for the film.  It reached number four in Australia and Canada, while peaking at number five on the U.S. pop chart in January 1984, becoming one of Newton-John's last big hits. The track was her last Top-10 to date. Billboard ranked it as number 42 on its listing of the top 100 singles of 1984.
Due to its louder synthesizer-rock-oriented sound, "Twist of Fate" did not make the Billboard Adult Contemporary singles chart.  However, its flip side, "Take A Chance," a duet with John Travolta, did reach the AC chart and became a sizeable hit there, peaking at number three.
