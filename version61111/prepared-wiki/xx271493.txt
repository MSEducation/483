A parliamentary by-election was held in Bahrain on 24 September 2011 following the withdrawal of 18 members of the largest political party in parliament, al Wefaq, in protest at governmental actions during the Bahraini uprising. Security forces closed Pearl Roundabout and attacked protestors in the village of Sanabis. The second round of elections were held on October 1, 2011

==Background==

The lower house of parliament has the authority to pass legislation proposed by the sovereign or the governing cabinet, as well as monitoring authority. The upper, unelected Consultative Council has the power to block legislation from the lower house. The minority Sunni Al-Khalifa dynasty has ruled the majority Shia country since 1783. The Bahraini uprising started in early 2011, with massive protests, occupation of the Pearl Roundabout, arrests and other responses by police, destruction of the Pearl Roundabout, and entry of the Peninsula Shield Force to Bahrain. MPs from Al Wefaq, the largest party in parliament, resigned their seats in protest against the government's responses.

==Arrests, protests and responses==

On Friday 23 September, dozens of people were arrested and some were badly beaten.  Nabeel Rajab of the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights reported that 38 women were detained for a 45-day period.
On the election day, 24 September, hundreds to thousands of protestors gathered in the village of Sanabis with the intention of marching to the Pearl Roundabout, which had been physically occupied by protestors during the Bahraini uprising and whose monument had been destroyed by the authorities in response. Security forces used tear gas, stun grenades and rubber bullets against the protestors.
Graffiti near a voting station stated "Down with Hamad" and "The people want to bring down the regime".

==Turnout==

Turnout was 17.4 percent for the 14 contested districts due to a boycott by Al Wefaq and the rest of the opposition.[tpl]cite news | first=Andrew | last=Hammond | title=UPDATE 1-Fewer than 1 in 5 vote in Bahrain by-elections | url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/25/bahrain-vote-results-idUSL5E7KP13G20110925 | agency=Reuters | date=25 September 2011 [/tpl]  The government however publicized a turnout figure of 51 percent, which was calculated over all 40 electoral districts, including districts where there was no contest in 2011.  For the 22 uncontested districts whose MP did not withdraw from parliament, the government used turnout figures from the 2010 election.  For districts among these 22 that were uncontested in 2010, the government assumed 100 percent turnout.  For the four uncontested districts whose MP withdrew from parliament, the government also assumed 100 percent turnout.[tpl]cite news | first=Mohammed | last=Al A'ali | title=Thousands defy threats and flock to the polls | url=http://www.gulf-daily-news.com/NewsDetails.aspx?storyid=314082 | newspaper=Gulf Daily News | date=25 September 2011 [/tpl]

==Results==

All of the new winners were independent candidates, unofficially regarded as being pro-Al Khalifa, as they did not heed to the Opposition boycott of the polls. Three women were among the new winners.
Four seats were won uncontested., five seats were won after voting in the first round of  the elections, while the remaining nine required a second round of polls to decide the winner (which took place on October 1, 2011).
