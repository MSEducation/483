Nigeria [tpl]IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Nigeria.ogg|n|aɪ|ˈ|dʒ|ɪər|i|ə[/tpl], officially the Federal Republic of Nigeria, is a federal constitutional republic comprising 36 states and its Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. The country is located in West Africa and shares land borders with the Republic of Benin in the west, Chad and Cameroon in the east, and Niger in the north. Its coast in the south lies on the Gulf of Guinea on the Atlantic Ocean.
Long the site of numerous kingdoms and empires, the modern state of Nigeria has its origins in the British colonization of the region during the late nineteenth to early twentieth centuries, emerging from the combination of two neighboring British protectorates: (the Southern Nigeria Protectorate and Northern Nigeria Protectorate). The British set up administrative and legal structures while retaining traditional chiefdoms. Nigeria became independent in 1960, but plunged into civil war several years later. It has since alternated between democratically-elected civilian governments and military dictatorships, with its 2011 presidential elections being viewed as the first to be conducted reasonably free and fair.
Nigeria is often referred to as the "the Giant of Africa", due to its large population and economy.Nigeria: Giant of Africa, by Peter Holmes 1987  With around 174 million inhabitants, Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa and the seventh most populous country in the world.[tpl]cite journal|last=Library of Congress – Federal Research Division|title= Country profile: Nigeria|date=July 2008|year=2008|page=9|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Nigeria.pdf|accessdate=28 December 2011[/tpl] The country is inhabited by over 500 ethnic groups, of which the three largest are the Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba.
Nigeria is roughly divided in half between Christians, who mostly live in the Southern and central parts of the country, and Muslims, concentrated mostly in the North and South-West. A minority of the population practice traditional and native religions, such as the Igbo and Yoruba religions.

It is also listed among the "Next Eleven" economies to become among the biggest in the world. Nigeria is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, the African Union, OPEC, and the United Nations among other International organizations.

==Etymology==

The name Nigeria was taken from the Niger River running through the country. This name was coined by Flora Shaw,[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl] who later married Baron Lugard, a British colonial administrator, in the late 19th century.

==History==

===Prehistory===

The Nok people of central Nigeria produced the earliest terracotta sculptures found in the country.[tpl]Cite book|last=Kleiner|first= Fred S.|coauthors=Christin J.

Hausa kingdoms and the Kanem-Bornu Empire prospered as trade posts between North and West Africa.
Also in the North west, at the beginning of the 19th century under Usman dan Fodio, the Fulani led the centralised Fulani Empire, which continued until 1903 when the Fulani population and land were divided into various European colonies.

Yoruba mythology states that Ile-Ife is the source of the human race and that it pre-dates any other civilisation. The oldest signs of human settlement dates back to the 9th century. Ifẹ produced terracotta and bronze figures, and Ọyọ once extended from western Nigeria to Togo. The Kingdom of Benin is located in southwestern Nigeria. Benin's power lasted between the 15th and 19th century. Their dominance reached as far as the city of Eko (an Edo name later changed to Lagos by the Portuguese) and further.[tpl]cite web|last=Metz|first=Helen Chapin|title=Nigeria: A Country Study – The Slave Trade|publisher=Library of Congress Country Studies|year=1991|url=http://countrystudies.us/nigeria/7.htm|accessdate=28 May 2011[/tpl]
The Kingdom of Nri of the Igbo people started in the 10th century and continued until it lost its sovereignty to the British in 1911. It is one of the oldest kingdoms in Nigeria.[tpl]cite book|title=Africa and the Americas: culture, politics, and history : a multidisciplinary encyclopedia, Volume 2|first=Richard M.|last= Juang|page=597|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2008|isbn=1-85109-441-5|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wFrAOqfhuGYC&pg=PA597[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=Africa from the seventh to the eleventh century|first=Ivan|last=Hrbek|page=254|publisher=James Currey Publishers|year=1992|isbn=0-85255-093-6|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qDFcD0BuekQC&pg=PA254[/tpl] Nri was ruled by the Eze Nri, and the city of Nri is considered to be the foundation of Igbo culture.

The people traded overland with traders from North Africa for centuries. In the 16th century, Spanish and Portuguese explorers were the first Europeans to begin trade in Nigeria, in the port they named Lagos and in Calabar. The Europeans traded goods with the peoples of the coast. Soon they also negotiated for a portion of the existing African slave trade.
Traditionally, peoples captured in war were made slaves by the conquerors. Usually they were taken back to the conquerors' territory, put to work and sometimes acculturated and eventually absorbed into the other culture. When the Europeans entered the trade, they transported slaves mostly to the Americas to work as labourers. There, slavery became a racial caste to which people of African descent were confined, particularly in what became the United States.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2012[/tpl] The demands of the slave trade produced a greater market in slaves than had existed before. Nigerian ethnic groups were transported to the Americas and the Caribbean as part of the African diaspora of slavery.
According to the Encyclopedia of African History, "It is estimated that by the 1890s the largest slave population of the world, about 2 million people, was concentrated in the territories of the Sokoto Caliphate. The use of slave labor was extensive, especially in agriculture."Kevin Shillington (2005). Encyclopedia of African History. Michigan University Press. p. 1401. ISBN 1-57958-455-1

===Colonization===

The slave trade was joined by Great Britain and France. The colonial era is considered to date from 1800, when, with rising anti-slavery sentiment at home, Great Britain abolished its international slave trade in 1807 together with the United States. Following the Napoleonic Wars, Great Britain established the West Africa Squadron in an attempt to halt the international traffic in slaves.[tpl]cite news|title=10 things about British slavery|publisher=BBC News|date=3 August 2005|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4742049.stm|accessdate=28 May 2011[/tpl] It stopped ships of other nations that were leaving the African coast with slaves; sometimes it would take the freed slaves to Sierra Leone, its colony in West Africa, rather than return the people to the risk of renewed slavery in other coastal states.
In 1885, British claims to a West African sphere of influence received recognition from other European nations. The following year, it chartered the Royal Niger Company under the leadership of Sir George Taubman Goldie. In 1900 the company's territory came under the control of the British government, which moved to consolidate its hold over the area of modern Nigeria. On 1 January 1901, Nigeria became a British protectorate, part of the British Empire, the foremost world power at the time. The independent kingdoms of what later became Nigeria fought many wars against the British Empire in the late 19th and early 20th centuries trying to regain independence. By war, the British conquered Benin in 1897, and in the Anglo-Aro War from 1901—1902 defeated other opponents. The restraint or complete destruction of these states opened up the Niger area to British rule.
In 1914, the British formally united the Niger area as the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria. Administratively, Nigeria remained divided into the northern and southern provinces and Lagos Colony. The people of the South, with more interaction with the British and other Europeans due to the coastal economy, adopted Western education and developed a modern economy more rapidly than in the north. Many of its elite's sons went to Great Britain for education. The regional differences continue to be expressed in Nigeria's political life as well. For instance, northern Nigeria did not outlaw slavery until 1936.[tpl]cite web|title=The end of slavery|work=The Story of Africa|publisher=BBC News|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/specials/1624_story_of_africa/page56.shtml|accessdate=28 May 2011[/tpl]
Following World War II, in response to the growth of Nigerian nationalism and demands for independence, successive constitutions legislated by the British government moved Nigeria toward self-government on a representative and increasingly federal basis. By the middle of the 20th century, the great wave for independence was sweeping across Africa. Nigeria became independent in 1960.

===Independence (1960)===

On 1 October 1960, Nigeria gained its independence from the United Kingdom. Nigeria's government was a coalition of conservative parties: the Nigerian People's Congress (NPC), a party dominated by Northerners and those of the Islamic faith; and the Igbo and Christian-dominated National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons (NCNC) led by Nnamdi Azikiwe, who became Nigeria's maiden Governor-General in 1960. Forming the opposition was the comparatively liberal Action Group (AG), which was largely dominated by the Yoruba and led by Obafemi Awolowo.[tpl]cite journal|title=Nigerian Political Parties: Their Role in Modernizing the Political System, 1920–1966|author=Udofia, O. E. |journal=Journal of Black Studies|volume=11|issue=4 |year=1981|pages=435–447|doi=10.1177/002193478101100404 |jstor=2784073[/tpl] The cultural and political differences among Nigeria's dominant ethnic groups: the Hausa ('Northerners'), Igbo ('Easterners') and Yoruba ('Westerners'), were sharp.
An imbalance was created in the polity by the result of the 1961 plebiscite. Southern Cameroon opted to join the Republic of Cameroon while northern Cameroon chose to remain in Nigeria. The northern part of the country was now far larger than the southern part. The nation parted with its British legacy in 1963 by declaring itself a Federal Republic, with Azikiwe as its first president. When elections were held in 1965, the Nigerian National Democratic Party came to power in Nigeria's Western Region.

===Civil war (1967-1970)===

The disequilibrium and perceived corruption of the electoral and political process led in 1966 to several back-to-back military coups. The first was in January and led by a collection of young leftists under Major Emmanuel Ifeajuna and Chukwuma Kaduna Nzeogwu. It was partially successful; the coup plotters murdered Prime Minister Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, Premier Ahmadu Bello of the Northern Region and Premier Ladoke Akintola of the Western Region. Despite this, they could not set up a central government. President Nwafor Orizu was then pressured to hand over government to the Nigeria Army, under the command of General JTU Aguyi-Ironsi.
The coup was counter-acted by another successful plot, supported primarily by Northern military officers and Northerners who favoured the NPC, it was engineered by Northern officers, which allowed Lt Colonel Yakubu Gowon to become head of state. This sequence of events led to an increase in ethnic tension and violence. The Northern coup, motivated by ethnic and religious reasons, resulted in the deaths of many military officers and civilians, especially those of Igbo descent.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2010[/tpl]
The violence against the Igbo increased their desire for autonomy. By May 1967, the Eastern Region voted to declare independence as a state called the Republic of Biafra, under the leadership of Lt Colonel Emeka Ojukwu.[tpl]cite news|last=Murray| first=Senan|title=Reopening Nigeria's civil war wounds|publisher=BBC News|date=30 May 2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/6657259.stm|accessdate=28 May 2011[/tpl] The Nigerian Civil War began as the Nigerian (Western and Northern) side attacked Biafra (South-eastern) on 6 July 1967 at Garkem. The 30 month war, with a long siege of Biafra and its isolation from trade and supplies, ended in January 1970."Background Paper on Nigeria and Biafra, Declassified Documents reference System.

France, Egypt, Soviet Union, Britain and others were deeply involved in the civil war behind the scenes. Britain and the Soviet Union were the main military backers of the Nigerian government while France and others helped the Biafrans. Nigeria also used Egyptian pilots for their air force.The Biafra War and the Age of PestilenceShadows : Airlift and Airwar in Biafra and Nigeria 1967–1970, by Michael I. Draper

===Military juntas===

During the oil boom of the 1970s, Nigeria joined OPEC, and the huge revenue generated made the economy richer, although the military administration did nothing to improve the standard of living of the population, or to help the small and medium businesses, or even invest in the infrastructure. As oil revenues fuelled the rise of federal subventions to states, the federal government became the centre of political struggle and the threshold of power in the country. As oil production and revenue rose, the Nigerian government created a dangerous situation as it became increasingly dependent on oil revenues and the international commodity markets for budgetary and economic concerns; it did not build economic stability. That spelled doom to federalism in Nigeria.Watts, Michael (1987) State, Oil and Agriculture in Nigeria, Institute of International Studies, University of California,, ISBN 0877251665.
Beginning in 1979, Nigerians participated in a brief return to democracy when Olusegun Obasanjo transferred power to the civilian regime of Shehu Shagari. The Shagari government became viewed as corrupt and incompetent by virtually all sectors of Nigerian society. The military coup of Muhammadu Buhari shortly after the regime's fraudulent re-election in 1984 was generally viewed as a positive development by most of the population."Nigeria, Military Faces Daunting Challenges", AP Press International, 3 March 1984. Retrieved 22 February 2007. Buhari promised major reforms, but his government fared little better than its predecessor. His regime was overthrown by another military coup in 1985."Nigeria stays calms as leader toppled in bloodless coup", The Globe and Mail, 28 August 1985. Retrieved 22 February 2007
The new head of state, Ibrahim Babangida, declared himself president and commander in chief of the armed forces and the ruling Supreme Military Council. He set 1990 as the official deadline for a return to democratic governance. Babangida's tenure was marked by a flurry of political activity: he instituted the International Monetary Fund's Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) to aid in the repayment of the country's crushing international debt, which most federal revenue was dedicated to servicing. He enrolled Nigeria in the Organisation of the Islamic Conference, which aggravated religious tensions in the country.Holman, Michael (24 February 1986) "Nigeria, Politics; Religious Differences Intensify", Financial Times,
After Babangida survived an abortive coup, he pushed back the promised return to democracy to 1992. Free and fair elections were finally held on 12 June 1993, showing a presidential victory for Moshood Kashimawo Olawale Abiola. Babangida chose to annul the elections, leading to mass civilian violent protests which effectively shut down the country for weeks. This forced Babangida to keep his promise to relinquish office to a civilian-run government, but not before appointing Ernest Shonekan as head of the interim government.Bilski, Andrew, "Broken Promises", Maclean, 6 September 1993 Babangida's regime has been considered the most corrupt, and responsible for creating a culture of corruption in Nigeria.Diamond, Larry; Kirk-Greene, Anthony; Oyeleye Oyediran (1997) Transition without End: Nigerian Politics and Civil Society Under Babangida, Vantage Publishers, ISBN 9782458546
Shonekan's caretaker regime was overwhelmed in late 1993 by the military coup of General Sani Abacha. Abacha oversaw brutal rule using violence on a wide scale to suppress the continuing civilian unrest. He shifted money to offshore accounts in various western European banks and voided coup plots by bribing army generals. Several hundred million dollars in accounts traced to him were discovered in 1999."Nigerian Lawyer: Abacha accounts apparently in Switzerland, Luxembourg, France, and Germany", AP press, 10 January 2000. The regime came to an end in 1998 when the dictator was found dead amid questionable circumstances. His successor, General Abdulsalami Abubakar, adopted a new constitution on 5 May 1999, which provided for multiparty elections. On 29 May 1999 Abubakar transferred power to the winner of the elections, Obasanjo, who had since retired from the military."Abdusalam Abubakar." Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Web. 26 October 2012.

===Democratization (1999-)===

Nigeria regained democracy in 1999 when it elected Olusegun Obasanjo, the former military head of state, as the new President of Nigeria ending almost 33 years of military rule (from 1966 until 1999) excluding the short-lived second republic (between 1979 and 1983) by military dictators who seized power in coups d'état and counter-coups during the Nigerian military juntas of 1966–1979 and 1983–1998.
Although the elections which brought Obasanjo to power in 1999 and again in 2003 were condemned as unfree and unfair, Nigeria has shown marked improvements in attempts to tackle government corruption and to hasten development.
Ethnic violence over the oil producing Niger Delta region and inadequate infrastructures are some of the issues in the country. Umaru Yar'Adua of the People's Democratic Party (PDP) came into power in the general election of 2007 – an election that was witnessed and condemned by the international community as being severely flawed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eueom-ng.org/Files/final_report.pdf|format=PDF|title= Final Report |publisher= EU Election Observation Mission Nigeria 2007|accessdate=24 January 2008 [/tpl]

==Government and politics==

Nigeria is a Federal Republic modelled after the United States,Charles Mwalimu. The Nigerian Legal System: Public Law. Peter Lang. 2005. Page 6. with executive power exercised by the president and with overtones of the Westminster System model[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl] in the composition and management of the upper and lower houses of the bicameral legislature. The president of Nigeria is Goodluck Jonathan, who succeeded Umaru Musa Yar'Adua to the office in 2010. The president presides as both Head of State and head of the national executive and is elected by popular vote to a maximum of two four-year terms.
The president's power is checked by a Senate and a House of Representatives, which are combined in a bicameral body called the National Assembly. The Senate is a 109-seat body with three members from each state and one from the capital region of Abuja; members are elected by popular vote to four-year terms. The House contains 360 seats and the number of seats per state is determined by population.[tpl]cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ni.html |title=Nigeria |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency (United States) |work=The World Factbook[/tpl]
Ethnocentrism, tribalism, religious persecution, and prebendalism have played a visible role in Nigerian politics both prior and subsequent to independence in 1960. Kin-selective altruism has made its way into Nigerian politics and has spurned (spurred?) various attempts by tribalists to concentrate Federal power to a particular region of their interests.Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi, who served briefly as Nigeria's second president, devoted his government to combating this phenomenon with Decree 33, which banned 81 political parties and 26 tribal and cultural organizations in the name of national unity. See Osaghae, The Crippled Giant: Nigeria Since Independence, Indiana University Press, 1998, p. 57. ISBN 0-253-21197-2. Nationalism has also led to active secessionist movements such as MASSOB, Nationalist movements such as Oodua Peoples Congress, Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta and a civil war. Nigeria's three largest ethnic groups (Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba) have maintained historical preeminence in Nigerian politics; competition amongst these three groups has fuelled corruption and graft.Rashid, Khadijat K. (September 2003) "Ethnicity and Sub-Nationalism in Nigeria: Movement for a Mid-West State/Ethnic Politics in Kenya and Nigeria/Federalism and Ethnic Conflict in Nigeria", African Studies Review, 46(2).
Because of the above issues, Nigeria's political parties are pan-national and irreligious in character (though this does not preclude the continuing preeminence of the dominant ethnicities).[tpl]cite web |last=Lancia |first=Nicole |url=http://www12.georgetown.edu/students/organizations/nscs/capitalscholar/lancia2.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120208073259/http://www12.georgetown.edu/students/organizations/nscs/capitalscholar/lancia2.html |archivedate=2012-02-08 |title=Ethnic Politics in Nigeria: The Realities of Regionalism |publisher=Georgetown University |accessdate=28 May 2011[/tpl] The major political parties at present include the ruling People's Democratic Party of Nigeria which maintains 223 seats in the House and 76 in the Senate (61.9% and 69.7% respectively); the opposition All Nigeria People's Party has 96 House seats and 27 in the Senate (26.6% and 24.7%). There are also about twenty other minor opposition parties registered. The immediate past president, Olusegun Obasanjo, acknowledged fraud and other electoral "lapses" but said the result reflected opinion polls. In a national television address he added that if Nigerians did not like the victory of his handpicked successor they would have an opportunity to vote again in four years.[tpl]cite news|last=McGreal |first=Chris |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,,2064068,00.html |title=Ruling party named winner in disputed Nigerian election |work=The Guardian   |date= 24 April 2007|accessdate=21 November 2008 | location=London[/tpl]
Like in many other African societies, prebendalism and extremely excessive corruption continue to constitute major challenges to Nigeria, as vote rigging and other means of coercion are practised by all major parties to remain competitive. In 1983, it was adjudged by the policy institute at Kuru that only the 1959 and 1979 elections witnessed minimal rigging.Ibrahim, Jibrin (2006) "Legislation and the Electoral Process: The Third Term Agenda and the Future of Nigerian Democracy". Paper for Centre for Democracy and Development (CDD) Nigeria Roundtable.

===Law===

There are three distinct systems of law in Nigeria:
The country has a judicial branch, the highest court of which is the Supreme Court of Nigeria.

===Foreign relations===

Upon gaining independence in 1960, Nigeria made African unity the centrepiece of its foreign policy and played a leading role in the fight against the apartheid government in South Africa.Young, Andrew (20 July 2006) "Collins Edomaruse, how Obasanjo cut UK, US to size", This Day (Nigeria). One notable exception to the African focus of Nigeria's foreign policy was the close relationship the country enjoyed with Israel throughout the 1960s, with the latter country sponsoring and overseeing the construction of Nigeria's parliament buildings.Burkett, Elinor (2009) Golda, HarperCollins, ISBN 0061873950, p. 202.
Nigeria's foreign policy was soon tested in the 1970s after the country emerged united from its own civil war and quickly committed itself to the movements against white minority governments in the Southern Africa sub-region. Nigeria backed the African National Congress (ANC) by taking a committed tough line with regard to the South African government and their military actions in southern Africa. Nigeria was also a founding member of the Organisation for African Unity (now the African Union), and has tremendous influence in West Africa and Africa on the whole. Nigeria has additionally founded regional cooperative efforts in West Africa, functioning as standard-bearer for the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and ECOMOG, economic and military organisations respectively.
With this African-centred stance, Nigeria readily sent troops to the Congo at the behest of the United Nations shortly after independence (and has maintained membership since that time); Nigeria also supported several Pan African and pro-self government causes in the 1970s, including garnering support for Angola's MPLA, SWAPO in Namibia, and aiding opposition the governments of Portuguese Mozambique, and Rhodesia.
Nigeria retains membership in the Non-Aligned Movement, and in late November 2006 organised an Africa-South America Summit in Abuja to promote what some attendees termed "South-South" linkages on a variety of fronts.[tpl]cite web|title=ASAS – Africa-South America Summit|publisher=African Union|date=30 November 2006|url= http://www.africa-union.org/root/au/Conferences/Past/2006/November/SummitASA/summit.htm|accessdate=29 May 2011[/tpl] Nigeria is also a member of the International Criminal Court, and the Commonwealth of Nations, from which it was temporarily expelled in 1995 under the Abacha regime.
Nigeria has remained a key player in the international oil industry since the 1970s, and maintains membership in Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) which it joined in July 1971. Its status as a major petroleum producer figures prominently in its sometimes vicissitudinous international relations with both developed countries, notably the United States and more recently China and developing countries, notably Ghana, Jamaica and Kenya.[tpl]cite journal|author=Timothy, Shaw |title=The State of Nigeria: Oil Prices Power Bases and Foreign Policy|journal= Canadian Journal of African Studies|volume=18|issue=2|year= 1984|pages= 393–405|jstor=484337|doi=10.2307/484337[/tpl]
Millions of Nigerians have emigrated at times of economic hardship to Europe, North America and Australia among others. It is estimated that over a million Nigerians have emigrated to the United States and constitute the Nigerian American populace. Of such Diasporic communities include the "Egbe Omo Yoruba" society.[tpl]cite web|title=Egbe Omo Yoruba, National Association of Yoruba descendants in North America|publisher=yorubanation.org|date=19 May 2007|url= http://www.yorubanation.org|accessdate=29 May 2011[/tpl]

===Military===

The Nigerian Military are charged with protecting The Federal Republic of Nigeria, promoting Nigeria's global security interests, and supporting peacekeeping efforts especially in West Africa.
The Nigerian Military consist of an army, a navy and an air force. The military in Nigeria have played a major role in the country's history since independence. Various juntas have seized control of the country and ruled it through most of its history. Its last period of rule ended in 1999 following the sudden death of former dictator Sani Abacha in 1998, with his successor, Abdulsalam Abubakar, handing over power to the democratically elected government of Olusegun Obasanjo in 1999.
Taking advantage of its role as Africa's most populated country, Nigeria has repositioned its military as an African peacekeeping force. Since 1995, the Nigerian military through ECOMOG mandates have been deployed as peacekeepers in Liberia (1997), Ivory Coast (1997–1999), Sierra Leone 1997–1999,O'Loughlin, Ed (11 March 1998) "Nigerians outshine the British brass", The Independent (London) and presently in Sudan's Darfur region under an African Union mandate.

==Geography==

Nigeria is located in western Africa on the Gulf of Guinea and has a total area of [tpl]convert|923768|km2|mi2|0|abbr=on[/tpl],[tpl]cite web|title=Rank Order – Area|work= The World Factbook|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2147rank.html|accessdate=29 May 2011[/tpl] making it the world's 32nd-largest country (after Tanzania). It is comparable in size to Venezuela, and is about twice the size of California. It shares a [tpl]convert|4047|km|mi|0|abbr-on[/tpl] border with Benin (773 km), Niger (1497 km), Chad (87 km), Cameroon (1690 km), and has a coastline of at least 853 km.[tpl]cite web|title=Africa :: Nigeria|work=The World Factbook|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|date=17 May 2011|url= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ni.html|accessdate=29 May 2011[/tpl] *Note that coastlines, and borders based on rivers or natural features, are fractals, the length of which is imprecise and depends on the measurement convention adopted. Nigeria lies between latitudes 4° and 14°N, and longitudes 2° and 15°E.
The highest point in Nigeria is Chappal Waddi at [tpl]convert|2419|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. The main rivers are the Niger and the Benue River which converge and empty into the Niger Delta, one of the world's largest river deltas and the location of a large area of Central African Mangroves.
Nigeria has a varied landscape. The far south is defined by its tropical rainforest climate, where annual rainfall is [tpl]convert|60|to|80|in|mm|0[/tpl] a year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uni.edu/gai/Nigeria/Background/Standard5.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090414075757/http://www.uni.edu/gai/Nigeria/Background/Standard5.html|archivedate=2009-04-14|title=Regions Used to Interpret the Complexity of Nigeria|accessdate=19 July 2007|work= Geographical Alliance of Iowa|publisher=University of Northern Iowa[/tpl] In the southeast stands the Obudu Plateau. Coastal plains are found in both the southwest and the southeast.[tpl]cite encyclopedia|title=Nigeria|encyclopedia=Encarta|publisher=Microsoft|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761557915/Nigeria.html|accessdate=19 July 2007|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?id=1257036644219803|archivedate=1 November 2009|deadurl=yes[/tpl] This forest zone's most southerly portion is defined as salt water swamp, also known as a mangrove swamp because of the large amount of mangroves in the area. North of this is fresh water swamp, containing different vegetation from the salt water swamp, and north of that is rain forest.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.uni.edu/gai/Nigeria/Background/Standard4.html|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100328172528/http://www.uni.edu/gai/Nigeria/Background/Standard4.html|archivedate= 2010-03-28|title=The Human and Physical Characteristics of Nigeria |accessdate=13 August 2007 |work=Geographical Alliance of Iowa|publisher=University of Northern Iowa[/tpl]
Nigeria's most expansive topographical region is that of the valleys of the Niger and Benue River valleys (which merge into each other and form a "y" shape). To the southwest of the Niger there is "rugged" highland, and to the southeast of the Benue are hills and mountains which forms the Mambilla Plateau, the highest Plateau in Nigeria.This plateau extends to the border with Cameroon, this montane land is part of the Bamenda Highlands in Cameroon.
The area near the border with Cameroon close to the coast is rich rainforest and part of the Cross-Sanaga-Bioko coastal forests ecoregion, an important centre for biodiversity including the drill monkey which is only found in the wild in this area and across the border in Cameroon. It is widely believed that the areas surrounding Calabar, Cross River State, also in this forest, contain the world's largest diversity of butterflies. The area of southern Nigeria between the Niger and the Cross Rivers has seen its forest more or less disappear to be replaced by grassland (see Cross-Niger transition forests).
Everything in between the far south and the far north, is savannah (insignificant tree cover, with grasses and flowers located between trees), and rainfall is between [tpl]convert|20|and|60|in|mm|0[/tpl] per year. The savannah zone's three categories are Guinean forest-savanna mosaic, Sudan savannah, and Sahel savannah.  Guinean forest-savanna mosaic is plains of tall grass which are interrupted by trees.  Sudan savannah is similar but with shorter grasses and shorter trees.  Sahel savannah consists of patches of grass and sand, found in the northeast. In the Sahel region, rain is less than [tpl]convert|20|in|mm|0[/tpl] per year and the Sahara Desert is encroaching. In the dry north-east corner of the country lies Lake Chad, which Nigeria shares with Niger, Chad and Cameroon.

===Environmental issues===

Nigeria's Delta region, home of the large oil industry, experiences serious oil spills and other environmental problems, which has caused conflict.
Waste management including sewage treatment, the linked processes of deforestation and soil degradation, and climate change or global warming are the major environmental problems in Nigeria. Waste management presents problems in a mega city like Lagos and other major Nigerian cities which are linked with economic development, population growth and the inability of municipal councils to manage the resulting rise in industrial and domestic waste. This huge waste management problem is also attributable to unsustainable environmental management lifestyles of Kubwa Community in the Federal Capital Territory, where there are habits of indiscriminate disposal of waste, dumping of waste along or into the canals, sewerage systems that are channels for water flows, etc.Kubwa, Abuja – http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubwa,_Abuja
Haphazard industrial planning, increased urbanisation, poverty and lack of competence of the municipal government are seen as the major reasons for high levels of waste pollution in major Nigerian cities. Some of the 'solutions' have been disastrous to the environment, resulting in untreated waste being dumped in places where it can pollute waterways and groundwater.[tpl]cite journal |first=D.

As of 2005, Nigeria has the highest rate of deforestation in the world according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).[ref]
News.mongabay.com[/ref] In 2005 12.2%, the equivalent of 11,089,000 hectares had been forested in Nigeria. Between 1990 and 2000, Nigeria lost an average of 409,700 hectares of forest every year equal to an average annual deforestation rate of 2.38%. Between 1990 and 2005, in total Nigeria lost 35.7% of its forest cover, or around 6,145,000 hectares.Rainforest analysis at Mongabay.com

===Subdivisions===

Nigeria is divided into thirty-six states and one Federal Capital Territory, which are further sub-divided into 774 Local Government Areas (LGAs). The plethora of states, of which there were only three at independence, reflect the country's tumultuous history and the difficulties of managing such a heterogeneous national entity at all levels of government.  In some contexts, the states are aggregated into six geopolitical zones: North West, North East, North Central, South East, South South, and South West.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2012/11/constitution-amendment-what-the-people-want/ |title=Constitution amendment: What the people want |accessdate=14 December 2012 |date=4 November 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ngrguardiannews.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=106778:constitutional-review-nigeria-needs-broader-representation-&catid=203:youth-speak&Itemid=730 |title=Constitutional review: Nigeria needs broader representation |accessdate=14 December 2012 |date=6 December 2012[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl]
Nigeria has six cities with a population of over 1 million people (from largest to smallest: Lagos, Kano, Ibadan, Kaduna, Port Harcourt, and Benin City). Lagos is the largest city in sub-Saharan Africa, with a population of over 8 million in its urban area alone. However, these figures are regularly disputed in Nigeria.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L29819278.htm |agency=Reuters |title=Nigeria gives census result, avoids risky details |first=Felix |last=Onuah |date=29 December 2006|accessdate=23 November 2008[/tpl]

==Economy==

Nigeria is classified as a mixed economy emerging market, and has already reached lower middle income status according to the World Bank,[tpl]cite web |url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/DATASTATISTICS/Resources/CLASS.XLS |title= World Bank list of economies |date= January 2011 |publisher=http: www.worldbank.org |accessdate=27 May 2011[/tpl] with its abundant supply of natural resources, well-developed financial, legal, communications, transport sectors and stock exchange (the Nigerian Stock Exchange), which is the second largest in Africa. Nigeria is ranked 30th in the world in terms of GDP (PPP) as of 2012. Nigeria is the United States' largest trading partner in sub-Saharan Africa and supplies a fifth of its oil (11% of oil imports). It has the seventh-largest trade surplus with the US of any country worldwide. Nigeria is the 50th-largest export market for US goods and the 14th-largest exporter of goods to the US The United States is the country's largest foreign investor.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2836.htm |title=Nigeria (07/08) |publisher=State.gov |accessdate=21 November 2008[/tpl]

During the oil boom of the 1970s, Nigeria accumulated a significant foreign debt to finance major infrastructural investments. With the fall of oil prices during the 1980s oil glut Nigeria struggled to keep up with its loan payments and eventually defaulted on its principal debt repayments, limiting repayment to the interest portion of the loans. Arrears and penalty interest accumulated on the unpaid principal which increased the size of the debt.
However, after negotiations by the Nigeria authorities, in October 2005 Nigeria and its Paris Club creditors reached an agreement in which Nigeria repurchased its debt at a discount of approximately 60%. Nigeria used part of its oil profits to pay the residual 40%, freeing up at least $1.15 billion annually for poverty reduction programmes. Nigeria made history in April 2006 by becoming the first African Country to completely pay off its debt (estimated $30 billion) owed to the Paris Club.

===Key sectors===

Nigeria is the 12th largest producer of petroleum in the world and the 8th largest exporter, and has the 10th largest proven reserves. (The country joined OPEC in 1971). Petroleum plays a large role in the Nigerian economy, accounting for 40% of GDP and 80% of Government earnings. However, agitation for better resource control in the Niger Delta, its main oil producing region, has led to disruptions in oil production and prevents the country from exporting at 100% capacity.[tpl]cite book |title=Nigeria: The Bradt Travel Guide |first=Lizzie |last=Williams |publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|year=2008 |isbn=1-84162-239-7 |page=26 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=fwuQ71ZbaOcC&pg=PA26 | accessdate=26 December 2008[/tpl] The Niger Delta Nembe Creek Oil field was discovered in 1973 and produces from middle Miocene deltaic sandstone-shale in an anticline structural trap at a depth of 2–4 km.Nelson, P.H.H., Role of Reflection Seismic in Development of Nembe Creek Field, Nigeria, 1980, in Giant Oil and Gas Fields of the Decade: 1968–1978, AAPG Memoir 30, Halbouty, M.T., editor, Tulsa: American Association of Petroleum Geologists, ISBN0891813063, pp. 565–576

===Science and technology===

Four satellites have been launched by the Nigerian government into outer space. The Nigeriasat-1 was the first satellite to be built under the Nigerian government sponsorship. The satellite was launched from Russia on 27 September 2003. Nigeriasat-1 was part of the world-wide Disaster Monitoring Constellation System.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nairaland.com/nigeria/topic-192.0.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110726152137/http://www.nairaland.com/nigeria/topic-192.0.html |archivedate=2011-07-26 |title=Nigeria has a Satellite in Orbit! (NigeriaSat-1) |publisher=Nairaland |date=9 May 2005[/tpl] The primary objectives of the Nigeriasat-1 were: to give early warning signals of environmental disaster; to help detect and control desertification in the northern part of Nigeria; to assist in demographic planning; to establish the relationship between malaria vectors and the environment that breeds malaria and to give early warning signals on future outbreaks of meningitis using remote sensing technology; to provide the technology needed to bring education to all parts of the country through distant learning; and to aid in conflict resolution and border disputes by mapping out state and International borders.
NigeriaSat-2, Nigeria's second satellite, was built as a high-resolution earth satellite by Surrey Space Technology Limited, a United Kingdom-based satellite technology company. It has 2.5-metre resolution panchromatic (very high resolution), 5-metre multispectral (high resolution, NIR red, green and red bands), and 32-metre multispectral (medium resolution, NIR red, green and red bands) antennas, with a ground receiving station in Abuja. The NigeriaSat-2 spacecraft alone was built at a cost of over £35 million.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2011[/tpl]
This satellite was launched into orbit from a military base in China.
NigComSat-1, a Nigerian satellite built in 2004, was Nigeria's third satellite and Africa's first communication satellite. It was launched on 13 May 2007, aboard a Chinese Long March 3B carrier rocket, from the Xichang Satellite Launch Centre in China. The spacecraft was operated by NigComSat and the Nigerian Space Agency, NASRDA. On 11 November 2008, NigComSat-1 failed in orbit after running out of power due to an anomaly in its solar array. It was based on the Chinese DFH-4 satellite bus, and carries a variety of transponders: 4 C-band; 14 Ku-band; 8 Ka-band; and 2 L-band. It was designed to provide coverage to many parts of Africa, and the Ka-band transponders would also cover Italy.
On 10 November 2008 (0900 GMT), the satellite was reportedly switched off for analysis and to avoid a possible collision with other satellites. According to Nigerian Communications Satellite Limited, it was put into "emergency mode operation in order to effect mitigation and repairs".[tpl]cite news|title='Technical problems' shut down Nigerian satellite|agency=AFP|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5g4S4e2LVeoER0jCP79S0gw3tjp7A|date=12 November 2008[/tpl] The satellite eventually failed after losing power on 11 November 2008.
On 24 March 2009, the Nigerian Federal Ministry of Science and Technology, NigComSat Ltd. and CGWIC signed a further contract for the in-orbit delivery of the NigComSat-1R satellite.

The United Nations estimates that the population in 2009 was at 154,729,000, distributed as 51.7% rural and 48.3% urban, and with a population density of 167.5 people per square kilometre. National census results in the past few decades have been disputed. The results of the most recent census were released in December 2006 and gave a population of 140,003,542. The only breakdown available was by gender: males numbered 71,709,859, females numbered 68,293,08. On June 2012, President Goodluck Jonathan said that Nigerians should limit their number of children.Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan urges birth control retrieved 2 July 2012
According to the United Nations, Nigeria has been undergoing explosive population growth and has one of the highest growth and fertility rates in the world. By their projections, Nigeria is one of eight countries expected to account collectively for half of the world's total population increase from 2005–2050.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2005/pop918.doc.htm|title=World Population TO INCREASE BY 2.6 BILLION OVER NEXT 45 YEARS, WITH ALL GROWTH OCCURRING IN LESS DEVELOPED REGIONS|publisher=UN|accessdate=21 November 2008[/tpl] By 2100 the UN estimates that the Nigerian population will be between 505 million and 1.03 billion people (middle estimate: 730 million).[tpl]cite web|url= http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/unpp/Panel_profiles.htm|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110611141930/http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/unpp/Panel_profiles.htm|archivedate= 2011-06-11|title=Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat|publisher= UN|year=2010|accessdate=27 May 2011[/tpl] In 1950, Nigeria had only 33 million people.[tpl]cite web|last=Kent|first=Mary Mederios|coauthors=Carl Haub|title=The Demographic Divide: What It Is and Why It Matters|publisher=Population Reference Bureau|date=December 2005|url=http://www.prb.org/Articles/2005/TheDemographicDivideWhatItIsandWhyItMatters.aspx|accessdate=6 June 2011[/tpl]

Health, health care, and general living conditions in Nigeria are poor. Life expectancy is 52 years (average male/female) and just over half the population has access to potable water and appropriate sanitation; the percentage of children under five has gone up rather than down between 1990 and 2003 and infant mortality is 97.1 deaths per 1000 live births. HIV/AIDS rate in Nigeria is much lower compared to the other African nations such as Kenya or South Africa whose prevalence (percentage) rates are in the double digits. In 2003, the HIV prevalence rate among 20 to 29-year-olds was 5.6%.[ref]

Nigeria suffers from periodic outbreaks of cholera, malaria, and sleeping sickness. It is the only country in Africa to have never eradicated polio, which it periodically exports to other African countries. A 2004 vaccination drive, spearheaded by the W.H.O. to combat polio and malaria, met with some opposition in the north,[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3556777.stm |title=Nigerian state thwarts polio push|publisher=BBC News |date=22 March 2004 |accessdate=7 September 2006[/tpl] but polio was cut 98% between 2009 and 2010.
Education is in a state of neglect. After the 1970s oil boom, tertiary education was improved so that it would reach every subregion of Nigeria. Education is provided free by the government, but the attendance rate for secondary education is only 29% (32% for males, 27% for females). The education system has been described as "dysfunctional" largely because of decaying institutional infrastructure. 68% of the population is literate, and the rate for men (75.7%) is higher than that for women (60.6%).
Nigeria's largest city is Lagos. Lagos has grown from about 300,000 in 1950[ref]

===Ethno-linguistic groups===

Nigeria has more than 250 ethnic groups, with varying languages and customs, creating a country of rich ethnic diversity. The largest ethnic groups are the Hausa, Yoruba, Igbo and Fulani, accounting for more than 70% of the population,[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl] while the Edo, Ijaw, Kanuri, Ibibio, Ebira, Nupe, Gwari, Itsekiri, Jukun, Urhobo, Igala, Idoma and Tiv comprise between 25 and 30%; other minorities make up the remaining 5%."Nigeria" in Geographica: The complete Atlas of the world, Random House, 2002, ISBN 0375720375
The middle belt of Nigeria is known for its diversity of ethnic groups, including the Pyem, Goemai, and Kofyar. The official population count of each of Nigeria's ethnicities has always remained controversial and disputed as members of different ethnic groups believe the census is rigged to give a particular group (usually believed to be northern groups) numerical superiority.[tpl]cite book |title=Growing Apart: Oil, Politics, and Economic Change in Indonesia and Nigeria |first=Peter |last=Lewis |page=132 |publisher=University of Michigan Press |year=2007 |isbn=0-472-06980-2 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=T4-rlVeb1n0C&pg=PA132[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=Federalism and Ethnic Conflict in Nigeria |first=Rotimi T. |last=Suberu |publisher=US Institute of Peace Press |year=2001 |page=154 |isbn=1-929223-28-5 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=WKeUMmDlPkEC&pg=PA154[/tpl]
