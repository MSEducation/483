==Shipwrecks==

Murray Pass, named for the explorer John Murray, between Deal and Erith Islands has long been used by ships to shelter from gales in Bass Strait, but it is a dangerous, partly open, roadstead, and many ships have been wrecked after sudden changes in wind direction and speed.  Others have hit the island either while attempting to shelter or through poor navigation in darkness or bad weather, several with heavy loss of life.
