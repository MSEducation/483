Carlucci was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, the son of Roxanne (née Bacon) and Frank Charles Carlucci, Jr., an insurance broker. His father was of Italian and Swiss descent.http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL0506/S00418.htm He graduated from Wyoming Seminary in 1948 and Princeton University in 1952, where he roomed with Donald Rumsfeld, and attended Harvard Business School for an MBA in 1954-55. He was a Naval officer from 1952-54. He joined the Foreign Service, working for the State Department from 1956 until 1969. In 1961 he participated in a CIA mission to Congo.
According to James Schlesinger, following the assassination of Patrice Lumumba, the new Prime Minister of the Congo, Cyrille Adoula, began a meeting with President John F. Kennedy with the question "Ou est Carlucci?" (Where is Carlucci?), who first responded "Who the hell is Carlucci?'" and then sent Dean Rusk to find him.[ref]

In the year 2000, a film called Lumumba portrayed him as being involved during his service in Congo in the murder of Congolese independence leader Patrice Lumumba. Carlucci furiously denied the charges, and successfully went to court to prevent being named in the film when it was released in the United States.

==Administration==

During the early 1970s, Carlucci became Donald Rumsfeld's protege as Rumsfeld showed him the ropes. In 1969, when President Nixon persuaded Rumsfeld to leave his congressional seat to become director of the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO), the agency created by R. Sargent Shriver to fight President Johnson's War on Poverty, Rumsfeld had Carlucci transferred to OEO from the State Department to head up the Community Action Program. Carlucci was Undersecretary of Health, Education and Welfare when Caspar Weinberger was secretary during the Nixon administration. Carlucci became Ambassador to Portugal, and served in this position from 1974 until 1977. He is still very fondly remembered in Portugal among the winners of the November 25 Coup d'État.Frank Carlucci parecia "um típico mafioso italiano", João Pedro Henriques, 13 de Novembro 2008 Carlucci was Deputy Director of the CIA from 1978–1981, under CIA Director Stansfield Turner.

==Controversy==

===Involvement during The Congo Crisis===

Patrice Lumumba, the first prime minister of independent Congo, was executed in January 1961 during the Congo Crisis. During that time, Carlucci was the second secretary at the US embassy in the Congo and a covert CIA agent. During that time, according to subsequently released of US government documents, President Dwight Eisenhower ordered the CIA to murder Lumumba. Minutes of an August 1960 National Security Council meeting confirm that Eisenhower told CIA chief Allen Dulles to "eliminate" the Congolese leader. The official note taker, Robert H. Johnson, testified to this before the Senate Intelligence Committee in 1975.http://books.google.com/books?id=bTdlU4yGB6YC&pg=PA78&lpg=PA78&dq=August+1960+National+Security+Council+meeting+lumumba&source=bl&ots=-RYcuPCZj2&sig=qYX8MRhhlzDiYovtMiaElqpTZSk&hl=en&ei=bzw5TOnmDYL6lwey3eDUBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CCUQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=August%201960%20National%20Security%20Council%20meeting%20lumumba&f=false[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2000/aug/10/martinkettle | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=President 'ordered murder' of Congo leader | first=Martin | last=Kettle | date=August 10, 2000[/tpl]
During a broadcast on HBO of the film Lumumba, directed by Raoul Peck, Carlucci's name was bleeped and removed from the credits due to the threat of a lawsuit. Carlucci's lawyers threatened Peck and the distribution company, Zeitgeist Films, with legal action if his name was not bleeped out of a scene that shows American Ambassador Clare Timberlake and Carlucci, along with Belgian and Congolese officials, plotting Lumumba's assassination.http://www.wsws.org/articles/2002/mar2002/carl-m15.shtml
