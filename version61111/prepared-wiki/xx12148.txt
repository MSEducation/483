The walrus (Odobenus rosmarus) is a large flippered marine mammal with a discontinuous distribution about the North Pole in the Arctic Ocean and subarctic seas of the Northern Hemisphere. The walrus is the only living species in the Odobenidae family and Odobenus genus. This species is subdivided into three subspecies:[tpl]MSW3 Wozencraft|id = 14001024[/tpl] the Atlantic walrus (O. r. rosmarus) which lives in the Atlantic Ocean, the Pacific walrus (O. r. divergens) which lives in the Pacific Ocean, and O. r. laptevi, which lives in the Laptev Sea of the Arctic Ocean.
Adult walruses are easily recognized by their prominent tusks, whiskers,  and bulkiness. Adult males in the Pacific  can weigh more than [tpl]convert|2000|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl]Walrus: Physical Characteristics. seaworld.org and, among pinnipeds, are exceeded in size only by the two species of elephant seals.[tpl]cite journal|author = Fay, F.H.|year = 1985|url = http://www.science.smith.edu/departments/Biology/VHAYSSEN/msi/default.html|title = Odobenus rosmarus|journal = Mammalian Species|volume = 238|pages = 1–7|doi = 10.2307/3503810|issue = 238|jstor = 3503810[/tpl] Walruses live mostly in shallow waters above the continental shelves, spending significant amounts of their lives on the sea ice looking for benthic bivalve mollusks to eat. Walruses are relatively long-lived, social animals, and they are considered to be a "keystone species" in the Arctic marine regions.
The walrus has played a prominent role in the cultures of many indigenous Arctic peoples, who have hunted the walrus for its meat, fat, skin, tusks, and bone. During the 19th century and the early 20th century, walruses were widely hunted and killed for their blubber, walrus ivory, and meat. The population of walruses dropped rapidly all around the Arctic region. Their population has rebounded somewhat since then, though the populations of Atlantic and Laptev walruses remain fragmented and at low levels compared with the time before human interference.

==Etymology==

The origin of the word walrus is thought by J.R.R. TolkienJ.R.R. Tolkien and the OED, J.R.R. Tolkien and the OED to derive from a Germanic language, and it has been attributed largely to either the Dutch language or Old Norse. Its first part is thought to derive from a word such as Dutch walvis 'whale'. Its second part has also been hypothesized to come from the Old Norse word for 'horse'.Dictionary.com. Dictionary.reference.com. Retrieved 16 September 2011. For example, the Old Norse word hrossvalr means 'horse-whale' and is thought to have been passed in an inverted form to both Dutch and the dialects of northern Germany as walros and Walross.Dansk Etymologisk Ordbog, Niels Age Nielsen, Gyldendal 1966 An alternate theory is that is comes from the Dutch words wal 'shore' and reus 'giant'.Etymology of mammal names. Iberianature.com (29 December 2010). Retrieved 16 September 2011.
The species name rosmarus is Scandinavian. The Norwegian manuscript Konungsskuggsja, thought to date from around AD 1240, refers to the walrus as "rosmhvalr" in Iceland and "rostungr" in Greenland (walruses were by now extinct in Iceland and Norway, while the word evolved on in Greenland). Several place names in Iceland, Greenland and Norway may originate from walrus sites: Hvalfjord, Hvallatrar and Hvalsnes to name some, all being typical walrus breeding grounds.
The archaic English word for walrus—morse—is widely thought to have come from the Slavic languages.morse, n., etymology of The Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd ed. 1989. OED Online. Oxford University Press. Compare морж (morž) in Russian, mursu in Finnish, moršâ in Saami, and morse in French. Olaus Magnus, who depicted the walrus in the Carta Marina in 1539, first referred to the walrus as the ros marus, probably a Latinization of morž, and this was adopted by Linnaeus in his binomial nomenclature.[tpl]cite book|year = 1880|author = Allen, Joel Asaph |title = History of North American pinnipeds, US Geological and Geographical Survey of the Territorie|publisher = Arno Press Inc. (1974 reprint)|url = http://books.google.com/?id=jFspFxseyC8C&printsec=frontcover&q|isbn = 978-0-405-05702-1[/tpl]
The coincidental similarity between morse and the Latin word morsus ("a bite") supposedly contributed to the walrus's reputation as a "terrible monster".
The compound Odobenus comes from odous (Greek for 'tooth') and baino (Greek for 'walk'), based on observations of walruses using their tusks to pull themselves out of the water. The term divergens in Latin means 'turning apart', referring to their tusks.

==Taxonomy and evolution==

The walrus is a mammal in the order Carnivora. It is the sole surviving member of the family Odobenidae, one of three lineages in the suborder Pinnipedia along with true seals (Phocidae) and eared seals (Otariidae). While there has been some debate as to whether all three lineages are monophyletic, i.e. descended from a single ancestor, or diphyletic, recent genetic evidence suggests all three descended from a caniform ancestor most closely related to modern bears.[tpl]cite journal|author = Lento, G.M., Hickson, R.E., Chambers, G.K., Penny, D.|year = 1995| title = Use of spectral analysis to test hypotheses on the origin of pinnipeds | journal = Molecular Biology and Evolution | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 28–52 | pmid = 7877495|doi = 10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a040189 [/tpl] Recent multigene analysis indicates the odobenids and otariids diverged from the phocids about 20–26 million years ago, while the odobenids and the otariids separated 15–20 million years ago.[tpl]cite journal|author = Arnason U|year = 2006|title = Pinniped phylogeny and a new hypothesis for their origin and dispersal|journal = Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|volume = 41|issue = 2|pages = 345–354|doi = 10.1016/j.ympev.2006.05.022|pmid = 16815048|author2 = Gullberg A|author3 = Janke A|last4 = Kullberg|first4 = Morgan|last5 = Lehman|first5 = Niles|last6 = Petrov|first6 = Evgeny A.|last7 = Väinölä|first7 = Risto[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|title=Phylogeny and divergence of the pinnipeds (Carnivora: Mammalia) assessed using a multigene dataset|author=Higdon, Jeff W; Bininda-Emonds, Olaf; Beck, Robin and Ferguson, Steven H|journal=BMC Evol Biol. 2007|volume=7|page=216|doi=10.1186/1471-2148-7-216|pmc=2245807|pmid=17996107|year=2007[/tpl] Odobenidae was once a highly diverse and widespread family, including at least twenty species in the Imagotariinae, Dusignathinae and Odobeninae subfamilies.[tpl]cite journal|author = Kohno, N.|year = 2006|title = A new Miocene Odobenid (Mammalia: Carnivora) from Hokkaido, Japan, and its implications for odobenid phylogeny|journal = Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology|volume = 26|issue = 2|page = 411|doi = 10.1671/0272-4634(2006)26411:ANMOMC2.0.CO;2|issn = 0272-4634[/tpl] The key distinguishing feature was the development of a squirt/suction feeding mechanism; tusks are a later feature specific to Odobeninae, of which the modern walrus is the last remaining (relict) species.
Two subspecies of walrus are widely recognized: the Atlantic walrus, O. r. rosmarus (Linnaeus, 1758) and the Pacific walrus, O. r. divergens (Illiger, 1815). Fixed genetic differences between the Atlantic and Pacific subspecies indicate very restricted gene flow, but relatively recent separation, estimated at 500,000 and 785,000 years ago.[tpl]cite book|editor = Hoelzel, A. R. (Ed.)|year = 2002|title = Marine mammal biology: an evolutionary approach|location = Oxford|publisher = Blackwell Publishing |isbn = 0-632-05232-5[/tpl] These dates coincide with the hypothesis derived from fossils that the walrus evolved from a tropical or subtropical ancestor that became isolated in the Atlantic Ocean and gradually adapted to colder conditions in the Arctic. From there, it presumably recolonized the North Pacific Ocean during high glaciation periods in the Pleistocene via the Central American Seaway.
An isolated population in the Laptev Sea is considered by some authorities, including many Russian biologists and the canonical Mammal Species of the World, to be a third subspecies, O. r. laptevi (Chapskii, 1940), and is managed as such in Russia.[tpl]cite journal|author = Chapskii, K.K. |year=1940|title = Distribution of the walrus in the Laptev and East Siberian seas|journal = Problemy Severa|volume = 6|pages = 80–94[/tpl] Where the subspecies separation is not accepted, whether to consider it a subpopulation of the Atlantic or Pacific subspecies remained under debate[tpl]cite book|author = Born, E.

==Anatomy==

While some outsized Pacific males can weigh as much as [tpl]convert|2000|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl], most weigh between [tpl]convert|800|and|1700|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl]. An occasional male of the Pacific subspecies far exceeds normal dimensions. In 1909, a walrus hide weighing [tpl]convert|500|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl] was collected from an enormous bull in Franz Josef Land, while in August 1910, Jack Woodson shot a [tpl]convert|4.9|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] long walrus, harvesting its [tpl]convert|450|kg|lb|-2|abbr=on[/tpl] hide. Since a walrus's hide usually accounts for about 20% of its body weight, the total body mass of these two giants is estimated to have been at least [tpl]convert|2300|kg|lb|-3|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]cite book | author = Wood, Gerald |url = | title =The Guinness Book of Animal Facts and Feats| year = 1983 | isbn = 978-0-85112-235-9[/tpl] The Atlantic subspecies weighs about 10–20% less than the Pacific subspecies. Male Atlantic Walrus weigh an average of [tpl]convert|900|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl].Walrus: Physical Characteristics. Seaworld.org. Retrieved on 2012-12-19. The Atlantic Walrus also tends to have relatively shorter tusks and somewhat more flattened snout. Females weigh about two-thirds as much as males, with the Atlantic females averaging [tpl]convert|560|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl], sometimes weighing as little as [tpl]convert|400|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl], and the Pacific female averaging [tpl]convert|800|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl].Carling, M. (1999). Odobenus rosmarus walrus. Animal Diversity Web Length typically ranges from [tpl]convert|2.2|to|3.6|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl].Walrus. Odobenus rosmarus . National Geographic[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hww.ca/en/species/mammals/atlantic-walrus.html |title=Hinterland Who's Who – Atlantic walrus |publisher=Hww.ca |accessdate=2012-06-23[/tpl] Newborn walruses are already quite large, averaging [tpl]convert|33|to|85|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl] in weight and [tpl]convert|1|to|1.4|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] in length across both sexes and subspecies. All told, the Walrus is the third largest pinniped species, after the two elephant seals. Walruses maintain such a high body weight because of the blubber stored underneath their skin. This blubber keeps them warm and the fat provides energy to the walrus. 
The walrus's body shape shares features with both sea lions (eared seals: Otariidae) and seals (true seals: Phocidae). As with otariids, it can turn its rear flippers forward and move on all fours; however, its swimming technique is more like that of true seals, relying less on flippers and more on sinuous whole body movements. Also like phocids, it lacks external ears. 
The extraocular muscles of the walrus are well-developed. This and its lack of orbital roof allow it to protrude its eyes and see in both a frontal and dorsal direction. However, vision in this species appears to be more suited for short-range.[tpl]cite book |last=Kastelein |first=Ronlad A. |year=2008 |contribution=Walrus Odobenus rosmarus |page=1214 |title=Encyclopedia of Marine Mammals |editor1-last=Perrin |editor1-first=William F. |editor2-last=Würsig |editor2-first=Bernd |editor3-last=Thewissen |editor3-first=J.G.M. |edition=2nd |isbn=012373553X [/tpl]

===Tusks and dentition===

The most prominent feature of the walrus is its long tusks. These are elongated canines, which are present in both male and female walruses and can reach a length of 1 m (3 ft 3 in) and weigh up to 5.4 kg (12 lb).[tpl]cite book|author = Berta, A. and Sumich, J. L. |year = 1999|title = Marine mammals: evolutionary biology|publisher = Academic Press|location = San Diego, CA|pages = 494 pp.[/tpl] Tusks are slightly longer and thicker among males, which use them for fighting, dominance and display; the strongest males with the largest tusks typically dominate social groups. Tusks are also used to form and maintain holes in the ice and aid the walrus in climbing out of water onto ice.[tpl]cite journal|author = Fay, F. H.|year = 1982|title = Ecology and Biology of the Pacific Walrus, Odobenus rosmarus divergens Illiger|journal = United States Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service[/tpl] Tusks were once thought to be used to dig out prey from the seabed, but analyses of abrasion patterns on the tusks indicate they are dragged through the sediment while the upper edge of the snout is used for digging.[tpl]cite journal|author = Ray, C., McCormick-Ray, J., Berg, P., Epstein, H.E.,|year = 2006|title = Pacific Walrus: Benthic bioturbator of Beringia|journal = Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology|pages = 403–419|doi = 10.1016/j.jembe.2005.12.043|volume = 330[/tpl] While the dentition of walruses is highly variable, they generally have relatively few teeth other than the tusks. The maximal number of teeth is 38 with dentition formula: [tpl]DentalFormula|upper=3.1.4.2|lower=3.1.3.2[/tpl], but over half of the teeth are rudimentary and occur with less than 50% frequency, such that a typical dentition includes only 18 teeth  [tpl]DentalFormula|upper=1.1.3.0|lower=0.1.3.0[/tpl]

===Vibrissae===

Surrounding the tusks is a broad mat of stiff bristles ('mystacial vibrissae'), giving the walrus a characteristic whiskered appearance. There can be 400 to 700 vibrissae in 13 to 15 rows reaching 30 cm (12 in) in length, though in the wild they are often worn to much shorter lengths due to constant use in foraging.[tpl]cite journal|author = Kastelein, R.A., Stevens, S., & Mosterd, P.|year = 1990|title = The sensitivity of the vibrissae of a Pacific Walrus (Odobenus rosmarus divergens). Part 2: Masking|journal = Aquatic Mammals|volume = 16|issue = 2|pages = 78–87[/tpl] The vibrissae are attached to muscles and are supplied with blood and nerves, making them highly sensitive organs capable of differentiating shapes [tpl]convert|3|mm|abbr=on[/tpl] thick and [tpl]convert|2|mm|abbr=on[/tpl] wide.

===Skin===

Aside from the vibrissae, the walrus is sparsely covered with fur and appears bald. Its skin is highly wrinkled and thick, up to [tpl]convert|10|cm|abbr=on[/tpl] around the neck and shoulders of males. The blubber layer beneath is up to [tpl]convert|15|cm|abbr=on[/tpl] thick. Young walruses are deep brown and grow paler and more cinnamon-colored as they age. Old males, in particular, become nearly pink. Because skin blood vessels constrict in cold water, the walrus can appear almost white when swimming. As a secondary sexual characteristic, males also acquire significant nodules, called "bosses", particularly around the neck and shoulders.
The walrus has an air sac under its throat which acts like a floatation bubble and allows it to bob vertically in the water and sleep. The males possess a large baculum (penis bone), up to [tpl]convert|63|cm|abbr=on[/tpl] in length, the largest of any land mammal, both in absolute size and relative to body size.

==Life history==

===Reproduction===

Walruses live to about 20–30 years old in the wild.[tpl]cite journal|author = Fay, F.H. | year = 1960|title = Carnivorous walrus and some arctic zoonoses|url=http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic13-2-111.pdf|journal = Arctic|volume = 13|issue = 2|pages = 111–122[/tpl] Comment The males reach sexual maturity as early as seven years, but do not typically mate until fully developed at around 15 years of age. They rut from January through April, decreasing their food intake dramatically. The females begin ovulating as soon as four to six years old. The females are polyestrous, coming into heat in late summer and also around February, yet the males are fertile only around February; the potential fertility of this second period is unknown. Breeding occurs from January to March, peaking in February. Males aggregate in the water around ice-bound groups of estrous females and engage in competitive vocal displays.[tpl]cite journal|author = Nowicki, S. N.; Stirling, Ian and Sjare, Becky|year = 1997|title = Duration of stereotypes underwater vocal displays by make Atlantic walruses in relation to aerobic dive limit|journal = Marine Mammal Science|volume = 13|issue = 4|pages = 566–575|doi = 10.1111/j.1748-7692.1997.tb00084.x[/tpl] The females join them and copulate in the water.
Gestation lasts 15 to 16 months. The first three to four months are spent with the blastula in suspended development before it implants itself in the placenta. This strategy of delayed implantation, common among pinnipeds, presumably evolved to optimize both the mating season and the birthing season, determined by ecological conditions that promote newborn survival.[tpl]cite journal|author = Sandell, M.|year = 1990|title = The Evolution of Seasonal Delayed Implantation|journal = The Quarterly Review of Biology|volume = 65|issue = 1|pages = 23–42|doi = 10.1086/416583|pmid = 2186428[/tpl] Calves are born during the spring migration, from April to June. They weigh [tpl]convert|45|to|75|kg|abbr=on[/tpl] at birth and are able to swim. The mothers nurse for over a year before weaning, but the young can spend up to five years with the mothers. Because ovulation is suppressed until the calf is weaned, females give birth at most every two years, leaving the walrus with the lowest reproductive rate of any pinniped.[tpl]cite book|editor = Evans, P.G.H. & Raga, J.A.|year = 2001|title = Marine mammals: biology and conservation|location = London & New York|publisher = Springer|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=riDDOeRd9JAC&printsec=frontcover|isbn=0-306-46573-6[/tpl]

===Migration===

The rest of the year (late summer and fall), walruses tend to form massive aggregations of tens of thousands of individuals on rocky beaches or outcrops. The migration between the ice and the beach can be long-distance and dramatic. In late spring and summer, for example, several hundred thousand Pacific walruses migrate from the Bering Sea into the Chukchi Sea through the relatively narrow Bering Strait.

==Ecology==

===Range and habitat===

The majority of the population of the Pacific walrus spends its summers north of the Bering Strait in the Chukchi Sea of the Arctic Ocean along the northern coast of eastern Siberia, around Wrangel Island, in the Beaufort Sea along the north shore of Alaska, and in the waters between those locations. Smaller numbers of males summer in the Gulf of Anadyr on the southern coast of the Siberian Chukchi Peninsula, and in Bristol Bay off the southern coast of Alaska, west of the Alaska Peninsula. In the spring and fall, walruses congregate throughout the Bering Strait, reaching from the western coast of Alaska to the Gulf of Anadyr. They winter over in the Bering Sea along the eastern coast of Siberia south to the northern part of the Kamchatka Peninsula, and along the southern coast of Alaska. A 28,000-year-old fossil walrus was dredged up from the bottom of San Francisco Bay, indicating Pacific walruses ranged that far south during the last ice age.[tpl]cite journal|author = Dyke, A.S.|year = 1999|url=http://arctic.synergiesprairies.ca/arctic/index.php/arctic/article/view/920|title = The Late Wisconsinan and Holocene record of walrus (Odobenus rosmarus) from North America: A review with new data from Arctic and Atlantic Canada|journal = Arctic|volume = 52|issue = 2|pages = 160–181[/tpl] There were roughly 200,000 Pacific walruses according to the most recent (1990) census-based estimate.[tpl]cite journal|author = Gilbert, J.R.|year = 1992|title = Aerial census of Pacific walrus, 1990|journal = USFWS R7/MMM Technical Report 92-1[/tpl][tpl]cite web| last = US Fish and Wildlife Service| title = Stock Assessment Report: Pacific Walrus – Alaska Stock| year = 2002| url = http://alaska.fws.gov/fisheries/mmm/walrus/pdf/Final_%20Pacific_Walrus_SAR.pdf|format=PDF[/tpl]
The much smaller population of Atlantic walruses ranges from the Canadian Arctic, across Greenland, Svalbard, and the western part of Arctic Russia. There are eight hypothetical subpopulations of walruses, based largely on their geographical distribution and movements: five west of Greenland and three east of Greenland.[tpl]cite journal|author = Born, E.

The isolated population of Laptev walruses is confined year-round to the central and western regions of the Laptev Sea, the eastmost regions of the Kara Sea, and the westmost regions of the East Siberian Sea. The current population of these walruses has been estimated to be between 5,000 and 10,000.[tpl]cite web|title = Морж / Odobenus rosmarus|work=Ministry of Natural Resources of the Russian Federation protected species list|url = http://zapoved.ru/species/262/%D0%9C%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B6| accessdate = 4 October 2007[/tpl]
The limited diving abilities of walruses brings them to depend on shallow waters (and the  nearby ice floes) for reaching their food supply.

===Diet===

Walruses prefer shallow shelf regions and forage primarily on the sea floor, often from sea ice platforms. They are not particularly deep divers compared to other pinnipeds; their deepest recorded dives are around 80 m (260 ft). They can remain submerged for as long as half an hour.[tpl]cite journal|author = Schreer, J. F.; Kovacs, Kit M. and O'Hara Hines, R. J.|year = 2001|title = Comparative diving patterns of pinnipeds and seabirds|journal = Ecological Monographs|volume = 71|pages = 137–162|doi = 10.1890/0012-9615(2001)0710137:CDPOPA2.0.CO;2|issn = 0012-9615[/tpl]
The walrus has a diverse and opportunistic diet, feeding on more than 60 genera of marine organisms, including shrimp, crabs, tube worms, soft corals, tunicates, sea cucumbers, various mollusks, and even parts of other pinnipeds.[tpl]cite journal|author = Sheffield G., Fay F. H., Feder H., Kelly B. P.|year = 2001|title = Laboratory digestion of prey and interpretation of walrus stomach contents|journal = Marine Mammal Science|volume = 17| pages = 310–330|doi = 10.1111/j.1748-7692.2001.tb01273.x|issue = 2[/tpl] However, it prefers benthic bivalve mollusks, especially clams, for which it forages by grazing along the sea bottom, searching and identifying prey with its sensitive vibrissae and clearing the murky bottoms with jets of water and active flipper movements.[tpl]cite journal|author = Levermann, N., Galatius, A., Ehlme, G., Rysgaard, S. and Born, E.W.|year = 2003|title = Feeding behaviour of free-ranging walruses with notes on apparent dextrality of flipper use|journal = BMC Ecology|pmid = 14572316|volume = 3|issue = 9|pmc = 270045|url = http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/3/9/|doi = 10.1186/1472-6785-3-9|page = 9[/tpl] The walrus sucks the meat out by sealing its powerful lips to the organism and withdrawing its piston-like tongue rapidly into its mouth, creating a vacuum. The walrus palate is uniquely vaulted, enabling effective suction.
Aside from the large numbers of organisms actually consumed by the walrus, its foraging has a large peripheral impact on benthic communities. It disturbs (bioturbates) the sea floor, releasing nutrients into the water column, encouraging mixing and movement of many organisms and increasing the patchiness of the benthos.
Seal tissue has been observed in fairly significant proportion of walrus stomachs in the Pacific, but the importance of seals in the walrus diet is under debate.[tpl]cite book|author = Lowry, L.F. and Frost, K.J.|year = 1981|chapter = Feeding and Trophic Relationships of Phocid Seals and walruses in the Eastern Bering Sea|title = The Eastern Bering Sea Shelf: Oceanography & Resources vol. 2.|editor = National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)|publisher = University of Washington Press|pages = 813–824[/tpl] There have been isolated observations of walruses preying on seals up to the size of a [tpl]convert|200|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl] bearded seal.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.science.smith.edu/msi/pdf/i0076-3519-238-01-0001.pdf|author=Fay, F.

===Predation===

Due to its great size and tusks, the walrus has only two natural predators: the killer whale (orca) and the polar bear.[tpl]cite web|last=Appliance|first=Mr.|title=Walrus Predators|url=http://www.walrus-world.com/walrus-predators.html[/tpl]  The walrus does not, however, comprise a significant component of either predator's diets. Both the orca and the polar bear are also most likely to prey on walrus calves. The polar bear often hunts the walrus by rushing at beached aggregations and consuming the individuals crushed or wounded in the sudden exodus, typically younger or infirm animals.[tpl]cite journal|author = Ovsyanikov, N.|year = 1992|title = Ursus ubiquitous|journal = BBC Wildlife|volume = 10|issue = 12|pages = 18–26[/tpl] The bears also isolate walruses when they overwinter and are unable to escape a charging bear due to inaccessible diving holes in the ice.[tpl]cite journal|jstor=3872939|title=Interactions between Polar Bears and Overwintering Walruses in the Central Canadian High Arctic|author=Calvert, Wendy  and Stirling, Ian |year=1990|pages=351–356|volume=8|journal=Bears: Their Biology and Management|doi=10.2307/3872939 [/tpl] However, even an injured walrus is a formidable opponent for a polar bear, and direct attacks are rare. Walruses have been known to fatally injure polar bears in battles if the latter follows the other into the water where the bear is at a disadvantage.[tpl]cite web|title=North American Bear Center – Polar Bear Facts|url=http://www.bear.org/website/bear-pages/polar-bear/22-/70-polar-bear-facts.html|publisher=North American Bear Center[/tpl] Polar bear–walrus battles are often extremely protracted and exhausting, and bears have been known to forgo the attack after injuring a walrus. Orcas regularly attack walrus, although walruses are believed to have successfully defended themselves via counterattack against the larger cetacean.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.cascadiaresearch.org/robin/kwinteractionsrev.pdf|title=A review of Killer Whale interactions with other marine mammals: Predation to co-existence|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2907.1991.tb00291.x|year=1991|last1=Jefferson|first1=Thomas A.|last2=Stacey|first2=PAM J.|last3=Baird|first3=Robin W.|journal=Mammal Review|volume=21|issue=4|page=151[/tpl] However, orcas have been observed successfully attacking walruses with few or no injuries.[tpl]cite journal|title=Killer whales (Orcinus orca) hunting for walruses (Odobenus rosmarus divergens) near Retkyn Spit, Chukotka|doi=10.1134/S106235901209004X|year=2012|last1=Kryukova|first1=N.

===Conservation===

In the 18th and 19th centuries, the walrus was heavily exploited by American and European sealers and whalers, leading to the near extirpation of the Atlantic population.[tpl]cite journal|author = Bockstoce, J.R. and Botkin, D.B.|year = 1982|title = The Harvest of Pacific Walruses by the Pelagic Whaling Industry, 1848 to 1914|journal = Arctic and Alpine Research|volume = 14|issue = 3|pages = 183–188|doi = 10.2307/1551150|jstor = 1551150[/tpl] Commercial walrus harvesting is now outlawed throughout its range, although Chukchi, Yupik and Inuit peoples[ref]

Traditional hunters used all parts of the walrus.[tpl]cite web|last = US Fish and Wildlife Service|title = Hunting and Use of Walrus by Alaska Natives|year = 2007|url = http://alaska.fws.gov/fisheries/mmm/mtrp/pdf/factsheet_walrus.pdf|format=PDF[/tpl] The meat, often preserved, is an important winter nutrition source; the flippers are fermented and stored as a delicacy until spring; tusks and bone were historically used for tools, as well as material for handicrafts; the oil was rendered for warmth and light; the tough hide made rope and house and boat coverings; and the intestines and gut linings made waterproof parkas. While some of these uses have faded with access to alternative technologies, walrus meat remains an important part of local diets,[tpl]cite journal|author = Eleanor, E.W., Freeman, M.M.R. and Makus, J.C. |year = 1996|title = Use and preference for Traditional Foods among Belcher Island Inuit|journal = Arctic|volume = 49|issue = 3|pages = 256–264[/tpl] and tusk carving and engraving remain a vital art form.
Walrus hunts are regulated by resource managers in Russia, the United States, Canada, and Denmark, and representatives of the respective hunting communities. An estimated four to seven thousand Pacific walruses are harvested in Alaska and in Russia, including a significant portion (about 42%) of struck and lost animals.[tpl]cite journal|journal = Fish.

The Boone and Crockett Big Game Record book has entries for Atlantic and Pacific walrus.  The recorded largest tusks are just over 30 inches and 37 inches long respectively.Boone and Crockett Club | Wildlife Conservation | Deer Hunting | Elk Hunting | Big Game Hunting | Wildlife Conservation | Deer Hunting | Elk Hunting | Big Game Hunting.

The effects of global climate change are another element of concern. The extent and thickness of the pack ice has reached unusually low levels in several recent years. The walrus relies on this ice while giving birth and aggregating in the reproductive period. Thinner pack ice over the Bering Sea has reduced the amount of resting habitat near optimal feeding grounds. This more widely separates lactating females from their calves, increasing nutritional stress for the young and lower reproductive rates.[tpl]cite news|first = M|last = Kaufman|title = Warming Arctic Is Taking a Toll, Peril to Walrus Young Seen as Result of Melting Ice Shelf|url =http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/14/AR2006041401368.html|work = Washington Post|page = A7|date = 15 April 2006[/tpl] Reduced coastal sea ice has also been implicated in the increase of stampeding deaths crowding the shorelines of the Chukchi Sea between eastern Russia and western Alaska.Revkin, Andrew C..

Currently, two of the three walrus subspecies are listed as "least-concern" by the IUCN, while the third is "data deficient". The Pacific walrus is not listed as "depleted" according to the Marine Mammal Protection Act nor as "threatened" or "endangered" under the Endangered Species Act. The Russian Atlantic and Laptev Sea populations are classified as Category 2 (decreasing) and Category 3 (rare) in the Russian Red Book. Global trade in walrus ivory is restricted according to a CITES Appendix 3 listing.

===Culture===

The walrus plays an important role in the religion and folklore of many Arctic peoples. Skin and bone are used in some ceremonies, and the animal appears frequently in legends. For example, in a Chukchi version of the widespread myth of the Raven, in which Raven recovers the sun and the moon from an evil spirit by seducing his daughter, the angry father throws the daughter from a high cliff and, as she drops into the water, she turns into a walrus – possibly the original walrus. According to various legends, the tusks are formed either by the trails of mucus from the weeping girl or her long braids.[tpl]cite journal|author=Bogoras, W.|year= 1902|title= The Folklore of Northeastern Asia, as Compared with That of Northwestern America|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=4|issue=4|pages=577–683|doi=10.1525/aa.1902.4.4.02a00020|format=free download[/tpl] This myth is possibly related to the Chukchi myth of the old walrus-headed woman who rules the bottom of the sea, who is in turn linked to the Inuit goddess Sedna. Both in Chukotka and Alaska, the aurora borealis is believed to be a special world inhabited by those who died by violence, the changing rays representing deceased souls playing ball with a walrus head.[tpl]cite journal|author=Boas, Franz|year= 1901|title=The Eskimo of Baffin Land and Hudson Bay|journal= Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. History|volume=xv|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=FOkiAQAAMAAJ|issue= Pt. I|page=146[/tpl]
Because of its distinctive appearance, great bulk, and immediately recognizable whiskers and tusks, the walrus also appears in the popular cultures of peoples with little direct experience with the animal, particularly in English children's literature. Perhaps its best-known appearance is in Lewis Carroll's whimsical poem "The Walrus and the Carpenter" that appears in his 1871 book Through the Looking-Glass. In the poem, the eponymous antiheroes use trickery to consume a great number of oysters. Although Carroll accurately portrays the biological walrus's appetite for bivalve mollusks, oysters, primarily nearshore and intertidal inhabitants, in fact comprise an insignificant portion of its diet, even in captivity.
The "walrus" in the cryptic Beatles song I Am the Walrus is a reference to the Lewis Carroll poem.
Another appearance of the walrus in literature is in the story "The White Seal" in Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book, where it is the "old Sea Vitch—the big, ugly, bloated, pimpled, fat-necked, long-tusked walrus of the North Pacific, who has no manners except when he is asleep".Kipling, Rudyard. (1894) The Jungle Book; (1994) Harmondsworth, England:Penguin Popular Classics, p. 84, ISBN 0-14-062104-0
