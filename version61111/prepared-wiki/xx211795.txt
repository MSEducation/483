==History==

American Revolutionary War veteran Sergent Julius Blackburn originally settled in Woodford County, Kentucky at Blackburn's Fort in 1790 after serving with Gist's Virginia Brigade. In 1799, Blackburn relocated to Scott County, Kentucky with his wife Elizabeth (Betsy) Scruggs. The Blackburn's moved into a log cabin and engaged stonemason Thomas Metcalfe to construct their house with stone from Chinn River Kentucky marble quarry in Woodford, County. The older log cabin joins the newer stone section to become a structure known as the Warwick House.[tpl]cite book |last=Saffell|first=W.T.R.|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Records of the Revolutionary War: Containing the Military and Financial Correspondence|publisher=Pudney & Russell|year=1858|location=New York|pages=285|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-jUOAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA285&lpg=PA285&dq=Julius+Blackburn+Revolutionary+War&source=web&ots=d7dk_6f92_&sig=WQFrh5J8jRol-cBpcbewtSPagqA&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result#PPA285,M1|doi=|id=|isbn=[/tpl]
