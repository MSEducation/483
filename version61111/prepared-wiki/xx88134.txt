The Defenders is an American courtroom drama series that ran on CBS from 1961–1965.  It starred E. G. Marshall and Robert Reed as father-and-son defense attorneys who specialized in legally complex cases, with defendants such as neo-Nazis, conscientious objectors, civil rights demonstrators, a schoolteacher fired for being an atheist, an author accused of pornography, and a physician charged in a mercy killing.  It was created by television writer Reginald Rose.
The Museum of Broadcast Communications called it "perhaps the most socially conscious series the medium has ever seen", a show "singularly resonant with New Frontier liberalism."[tpl]cite web| title=The Defenders: U.S. Legal Drama| url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/D/htmlD/defendersth/defendersth.htm| publisher= Museum of Broadcast Communications | author=Mark Alvey | accessdate=2009-09-30| authorlink= Mark Alvey (writer)[/tpl]

==Subject matter==

According to creator Reginald Rose, "the law is the subject of our programs: not crime, not mystery, not the courtroom for its own sake. We were never interested in producing a 'who-done-it' which simply happened to be resolved each week in a flashy courtroom battle of wits." And unlike Perry Mason, which also ran on CBS, victory was "far from certain on The Defenders—as were morality and justice."
Topics featured in the series included abortion, capital punishment, "no-knock" searches, custody rights of adoptive parents, the insanity defense, the "poisoned fruit doctrine", immigration quotas, the Hollywood blacklist, jury nullification, and Cold War visa restrictions.
A 1962 episode entitled "The Benefactor"—in which the father-son legal team defended an abortionist—was the most controversial; all of the series' three regular advertisers refused to sponsor the episode, necessitating a last-minute replacement.
The December 7, 1963 episode, "Climate of Evil" was originally titled, "The Gentle Assassin," but was changed two weeks earlier in the aftermath of the John F. Kennedy assassination. In addition, the January 4, 1964 episode, "Clare Cheval Died in Boston," was originally scheduled for the weekend of the assassination, and subsequently had reference to "President Kennedy" deleted from the episode.

The series was a slight reworking of Rose's 1957 two-part drama, The Defender, from the anthology series Studio One.  In the original program, Ralph Bellamy played the father and William Shatner played his son.  Shatner guest-starred in various roles in the later series, and the original drama later was incorporated into an episode of his series, Boston Legal.  Original music for the series was scored by Frank Lewin and Leonard Rosenman.
A re-envisioned version of the series debuted on the Showtime network in 1997.  Still called The Defenders, it focused on Beau Bridges and Martha Plimpton as the grandchildren of E.G. Marshall's character. They worked as lawyers and carried on the family legacy. However, Marshall died after completion of the second episode ("Choice Of Evils").  Production was halted and the remaining episode, "Taking the First", aired as a movie special in 1998.
The second season of Mad Men contains an episode named "The Benefactor" that featured a brief clip from The Defenders episode of the same name.Episode 3: The Benefactor[tpl]verify credibility|date=November 2011[/tpl] from the AMC TV network website In the Mad Men episode, the Sterling Cooper advertising agency is trying to secure sponsors for The Defenders episode, which contains a plot involving abortion telecast on March 28, 1962, after the regular sponsors pulled out because they claimed the episode (and subject matter) was "too controversial". The episode also offers a fictional backstory for the episode; that it was written for the third season of the series but rejected by the network for the usage of abortion as a plotline. The following season, the writers produced a script which revolved around the theme of cannibalism but the episode was rejected by the director who was assigned to film the episode due to the content. The director's refusal led to the network being forced to film the abortion-centric script, to which an executive assigned to find advertisers for the show proclaims was the plan all along.
