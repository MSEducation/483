[[Wade–Giles table]]

CATEGORIES: Romanization of Chinese, Mandarin words and phrases

This Wade–Giles table is a complete listing of all Wade–Giles syllables used in Standard Chinese. Each syllable in a cell is composed of an initial (columns) and a final (rows). An empty cell indicates that the corresponding syllable does not exist in Standard Chinese.
The below table indicates possible combinations of initials and finals in Standard Chinese, but does not indicate tones, which are equally important to the proper pronunciation of Chinese. Although some initial-final combinations have some syllables using each of the five different tones, most do not. Some utilize only one tone.
Finals are grouped into subsets a, i, u and ü. i, u and ü groupings indicate a combination of those finals with finals from Group a. The following exceptions exist:
Most syllables are a combination of an initial and a final. However, some syllables have no initials. This is shown in Wade–Giles as follows:
|width=200 style="background:#EEEEEE;" | "regular" initial or final
Final is in Group a or is a direct combination of:
|width=200 style="background:#CCCCCC;" | Final of i, u, ü groups is a modified combination of:
|width=200| syllable is direct combination of initial and final (or follows rules for no-initial syllables outlined at the top of the page)
|width=200 style="background:#FFFFCC;" | syllable is modified combination of initial and final
