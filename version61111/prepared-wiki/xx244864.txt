Womersley railway station was a railway station in North Yorkshire, England. It was situated on the Askern Branch Line. It was closed to passenger traffic back in September 1948Body, p154 and has since been demolished, but the railway line through the site is still open and in regular use.

==The site today==

The station house still exists, next to the level crossing. Trains mainly operate to the local power stations of Ferrybridge, Eggborough and Drax (the biggest power station in Europe).  There are many trains, nearly always hauled by Class 66 locomotives of EWS, Freightliner and GB Railfreight. For many years the only time the line saw passenger trains was when there were engineering diversions on the East Coast Main Line, but since May 2010 there has been a regular train service that runs on this line from Bradford Interchange to London Kings Cross, run by open access operator Grand Central.
