==History==

De Poelen was built in 1850.

==Description==

De Poelen is what the Dutch describe as a "grondzeiler" . It is a three-storey smock mill on a single-storey base. There is no stage, the sail reaching almost to the ground. The smock and cap thatched. The mill is winded by tailpole and winch. The sails are Common sails. They have a span of [tpl]convert|19.10|m|ftin[/tpl]. The sails are carried on a cast-iron windshaft, which is bored through to take the striking rod for Patent sails. The windshaft also carries the brake wheel which has 58 cogs. This drives the wallower (35 cogs) at  the top of the upright shaft. At the bottom of the upright shaft, the crown wheel, which has 53 cogs drives a gearwheel with 38 cogs on the axle of the Archimedes' screw. The axle of the screw is [tpl]convert|350|mm|ftin[/tpl] diameter and the screw is [tpl]convert|1.50|m|ftin[/tpl] diameter and [tpl]convert|4.50|m|ftin[/tpl] long. The screw is inclined at 20Â°. Each revolution of the screw lifts [tpl]convert|919|l|impgal[/tpl] of water.
