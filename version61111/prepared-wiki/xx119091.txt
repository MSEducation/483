==History==

The Edinburgh Marathon Festival was founded by Geoff Sims and the first year’s event on June 15, 2003, attracted just 3,000 participants. The course started at Meadowbank Stadium, taking in Princes Street, Holyrood Palace and the Royal Yacht Britannia. Frank McGowan from Glasgow won the men’s race in 2.35 with the slowest man Lloyd Stott taking more than six days to complete the race wearing a deep sea diving suit weighing more than 100 pounds.
In 2007 organisers designed a new route that headed in to East Lothian through Longniddry and Port Seton, finishing in Musselburgh race course. With an elevation drop of 40 metres, the average finish time was almost 12 minutes faster than previous year's and Edinburgh earned its title of UK’s fastest marathon. 
In 2010, the half marathon was introduced for the first time with entry levels jumping to more than 24,000. 
2011 was the first time the Edinburgh Marathon Festival was hosted over two days. As  well as the full marathon, the festival also included a 5K, 10K, two junior races and a half marathon and a team relay race, affectionately named the “Hairy Haggis.”

==Criticism==

The Edinburgh Marathon is often criticised for the complex logistics involved for both runners and spectators, as the course's layout necessitates travel between Edinburgh city centre and East Lothian. Due to road closures and infrequent train services, there are often bottlenecks of traffic and long delays. Although shuttle buses are provided, many runners struggle with the long walk to the pick-up point after their race.
Additionally, whilst the race starts in Edinburgh, less than eight miles of the course lie within the city boundaries, with the remainder being run in East Lothian. The course encompasses less than three miles of the city centre.
