[[Super Akizuki-class destroyer]]

CATEGORIES: Destroyers of the Imperial Japanese Navy, Destroyer classes

The ''Super Akizuki''-class destroyer (超秋月型駆逐艦 or 改秋月型駆逐艦, Chō Akizuki-class or Kai Akizuki-class) were a projected class of destroyer of the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN), developed during the Second World War. The intention was to develop a faster destroyer based on the Akizuki-class. The IJN Technical Department (艦政本部, Kansei-hombu) gave them the project number V7. However, the project was cancelled with none of the proposed ships being completed, because of the continued Japanese defeats.
