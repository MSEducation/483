===Climate===

Hong Kong's climate is subtropical and monsoonal with cool dry winters and hot wet summers. As of 2006, its annual average rainfall is [tpl]convert|2214|mm|in|1|abbr=on[/tpl], though about 80% of the rain falls between May and September. It is occasionally affected by tropical cyclones between May and November, most often from July to September. The mean temperature of Hong Kong ranges from [tpl]convert|16|°C|°F|1[/tpl] in January and February to [tpl]convert|28|°C|°F|1[/tpl] in July and August.Hong Kong Survey & Mapping Office, Lands Department. Hong Kong Guide 2007 map. Notes on Hong Kong, p. 411. ISBN 962-567-174-9.
January and February are more cloudy, with occasional cold fronts followed by dry northerly winds. It is not uncommon for temperatures to drop below [tpl]convert|10|°C|°F[/tpl] in urban areas. Sub-zero temperatures and frost occur at times on high ground and in the New Territories. March and April can be pleasant although there are occasional spells of high humidity. Fog and drizzle are common on high ground which is exposed to the southeast. May to August are hot and humid with occasional showers and thunderstorms. Afternoon temperatures often exceed [tpl]convert|31|°C|°F|1[/tpl] whereas at night, temperatures generally remain around [tpl]convert|26|°C|°F|1[/tpl] with high humidity. In November and December there are pleasant breezes, plenty of sunshine and comfortable temperatures.Climate of Hong Kong Hong Kong Observatory. Retrieved on 1 September 2007.

===Terrain===

Hong Kong's terrain is hilly and mountainous with steep slopes. There are lowlands in the northern part of Hong Kong. A significant amount of land in Hong Kong, especially on the Hong Kong Island and the Kowloon peninsula, is reclaimed.

===Extreme points===

The lowest elevation in Hong Kong is in South China Sea (0 m) while the highest elevation is at Tai Mo Shan (958 m) in Tsuen Wan, the New Territories.

===Principal peaks of Hong Kong===

Victoria Peak, the highest point on Hong Kong Island, at 552 m is the 24th highest peak in Hong Kong.

===Natural resources===

The natural resources of Hong Kong can be divided into three main categories:
Despite its small size, Hong Kong has a relatively large number of mineral occurrences. Some mineral deposits have been exploited commercially. Metalliferous mineral occurrences are grouped into four broad categories: tin-tungsten-molybdenum mineralisation, copper-lead-zinc mineralisation, iron mineralisation and placer deposits of tin and gold. Mesozoic igneous activity is largely responsible for this diversity of mineral deposits and the mineral concentrations have been variably enhanced by hydrothermal activity associated with faulting. Concentrations of non-metalliferous minerals that have been commercially exploited include kaolin clay, feldspar, quartz, beryl and graphite.[tpl]Cite book|author=R.J. Sewell, S.D.G. Campbell, C.J.N.

For many years, granite and volcanic rocks have been quarried locally for road base metal, riprap, armour stone and asphalt, although the main purpose now is for concrete aggregates. At present, there are three quarries operating in Hong Kong. These are principally in granite and are located at Lam Tei, Shek O and Anderson Road. All the quarries are in the process of rehabilitation and have a life expectancy of between two to eight years.
Offshore sand bodies have been dredged for aggregate sand and reclamation fill in Hong Kong as the rate of urban development has increased.[tpl]Cite book|author=J.A. Fyfe, R.Shaw, S.D.G.

Additional natural resources include forest and wildlife.

===Natural hazards===

Tropical cyclones frequent Hong Kong during the summer months between June and August typically. Landslides are common after a rainstorm.
