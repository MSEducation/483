The Muntz Car Company was created in Glendale, California by Earl "Madman" Muntz, a well known local used car dealer and electronics retailer. It was in existence from 1950 to 1954.Flory,  J. "Kelly", Jr. American Cars 1946-1959 (Jefferson, NC:  McFarland & Coy, 2008), p.1016. Muntz was assisted by Frank Kurtis, who had earlier attempted to produce a sports car under the Kurtis Kraft marque (the Kurtis Kraft Sport, which sold just 36 units by 1950).[ref]

In 1951, Kurtis sold the license to manufacture the cars to Muntz, who quickly rebadged them as the "Muntz Jet", extended the body to make it a 4-seater, and exchanged the Ford engine with a larger Cadillac V8. Later, this engine would be replaced with a less expensive Lincoln side-valve V8.Lillywhite, David. The Encyclopedia of Classic Cars. (Thunder Bay Press, 2003)
The car, a sports coupe, was manufactured in Chicago, IL in the 2900 block of N. Sheffield Av. and featured its own unique design, with aluminum body panels and a removable fiberglass top that were manufactured in-house. Other parts (such as the engines) were sourced from other manufacturers. It was capable of 112Â mph, a significant achievement for a road car at the time. It was featured on the cover of the September 1951 issue of Popular Science (with a Jaguar and an MG).
The company managed to produce only about 400 cars during 1951-1954, and due to the high manufacturing cost, Muntz himself estimated that his company lost about $1,000 on each car; this financial drain eventually caused him to close the company.
Because the cars were distinctive in design, well-built and good performers for their time, Muntz Jets today are rare and valuable collector pieces.
