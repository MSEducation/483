Crocodiles (subfamily Crocodylinae) or true crocodiles are large aquatic reptiles that live throughout the tropics in Africa, Asia, the Americas and Australia. Crocodylinae, in which all its members are considered true crocodiles, is classified as a biological subfamily. A broader sense of the term crocodile, Crocodylidae that includes Tomistoma, is not used in this article. The term crocodile here applies only to the species within the subfamily of Crocodylinae. The term is sometimes used even more loosely to include all extant members of the order Crocodilia, which includes  Tomistoma, the alligators and caimans (family Alligatoridae), the gharials (family Gavialidae), and all other living and fossil Crocodylomorpha.
Although they appear to be similar to the untrained eye, crocodiles, alligators and the gharial belong to separate biological families. The gharial having a narrow snout is easier to distinguish, while morphological differences are more difficult to spot in crocodiles and alligators. The most obvious external differences are visible in the head with crocodiles having narrower and longer heads, with a more V-shaped than a U-shaped snout compared to alligators and caimans. Another obvious trait is the upper and lower jaws of the crocodiles are the same width, and teeth in the lower jaw fall along the edge or outside the upper jaw when the mouth is closed; therefore all teeth are visible unlike an alligator; which possesses small depressions in the upper jaw where the lower teeth fit into. Also when the crocodile's mouth is closed, the large fourth tooth in the lower jaw fits into a constriction in the upper jaw. For hard-to-distinguish specimens, the protruding tooth is the most reliable feature to define the family that the species belongs to.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/cnhc/cbd-faq-q1.htm |title=Crocodilian Biology Database - FAQ - What's the difference between a crocodile and an alligator |publisher=Flmnh.ufl.edu |accessdate=5 April 2009[/tpl] Crocodiles have more webbing on the toes of the hind feet and can better tolerate saltwater due to specialized salt glands for filtering out salt, which are present but non-functioning in alligators. Another trait that separates crocodiles from other crocodilians is their much higher levels of aggression.[tpl]cite book | author = Guggisberg, C.A.W. |url =  | title = Crocodiles: Their Natural History, Folklore, and Conservation| year = 1972 | page = 195 | isbn = 0-7153-5272-5 | publisher = David & Charles | location = Newton Abbot[/tpl]
Crocodile size, morphology, behavior and ecology somewhat differs between species. However, they have many similarities in these areas as well. All crocodiles are semiaquatic and tend to congregate in freshwater habitats such as rivers, lakes, wetlands and sometimes in brackish water and saltwater. They are carnivorous animals, feeding mostly on vertebrates such as fish, reptiles, birds and mammals, and sometimes on invertebrates such as molluscs and crustaceans, depending on species and age. All crocodiles are tropical species that unlike alligators, are very sensitive to cold. They first separated from other crocodilians during the Eocene epoch, about 55 million years ago.Buchanan, L.A. 2009. "Kambara taraina sp. nov (Crocodylia, Crocodyloidea), a new Eocene mekosuchine from Queensland, Australia, and a revision of the genus". Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology 29 (2): 473–486. Many species are at the risk of extinction, some being classified as critically endangered.

==Etymology==

The word "crocodile" comes from the Ancient Greek κροκόδιλος (crocodilos), "lizard," used in the phrase ho krokódilos tou potamoú, "the lizard of the (Nile) river". There are several variant Greek forms of the word attested, including the later form κροκόδειλος (crocodeilos)http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/vor?lookup=krokodeilos&lang=greek found cited in many English reference works. In the Koine Greek of Roman times, crocodilos and crocodeilos would have been pronounced identically, and either or both may be the source of the Latinized form crocodīlus used by the ancient Romans. Crocodilos or crocodeilos is a compound of krokè ("pebbles"), and drilos/dreilos ("worm"), although drilos is only attested as a colloquial term for "penis".[tpl]cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/crocodile |title=Crocodile | Define Crocodile at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |accessdate=26 April 2013[/tpl]  It is ascribed to Herodotus, and supposedly describes the basking habits of the Egyptian crocodile.[tpl]cite web|url=http://etymonline.com/index.php?search=crocodile |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=16 March 2010[/tpl]
The form crocodrillus is attested in Medieval Latin. It is not clear whether this is a medieval corruption or derives from alternate Greco-Latin forms (late Greek corcodrillos and corcodrillion are attested). A (further) corrupted form cocodrille is found in Old French and was borrowed into Middle English as cocodril(le). The Modern English form crocodile was adapted directly from the Classical Latin crocodīlus in the 16th century, replacing the earlier form. The use of -y- in the scientific name Crocodylus (and forms derived from it) is a corruption introduced by Laurenti (1768).

==Species==

thumb|left|upright=3|Distribution of crocodiles[tpl]-[/tpl]
A total of 14 extant species have been recognized. Further genetic study is needed for the confirmation of proposed species under the genus Osteolaemus, which is currently monotypic.

==Characteristics==

A crocodile’s physical traits allow it to be a successful predator. Its external morphology is a sign of its aquatic and predatory lifestyle. Its streamlined body enables it to swim swiftly, it also tucks its feet to the side while swimming, which makes it faster by decreasing water resistance. They have webbed feet which, though not used to propel the animal through the water, allow them to make fast turns and sudden moves in the water or initiate swimming. Webbed feet are an advantage in shallower water, where the animal sometimes moves around by walking. Crocodiles have a palatal flap, a rigid tissue at the back of the mouth that blocks the entry of water. The palate has a special path from the nostril to the glottis that bypasses the mouth. The nostrils are closed during submergence.
Like other archosaurs, crocodilians are diapsid, although their post-temporal fenestrae are reduced. The walls of the braincase are bony, but lack supratemporal and postfrontal bones.Grigg, Gordon and Gans, Carl (1993) Morphology And Physiology Of The Crocodylia, in Fauna of Australia Vol 2A Amphibia and Reptilia, chapter 40, pp. 326–336. Australian Government Publishing Service, Canberra. Their tongues are not free, but held in place by a membrane that limits movement; as a result, crocodiles are unable to stick out their tongues.[tpl]cite book | last = Huchzermeyer | first = Fritz | year = 2003 | title = Crocodiles: Biology, Husbandry and Diseases | publisher = CABI Publishing | isbn =978-0-85199-656-1 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=4Arv-IUFnuoC&printsec=frontcover#PPA13,M1 | page = 13 | accessdate = 7 January 2000[/tpl] Crocodiles have smooth skin on their bellies and sides, while their dorsal surfaces are armoured with large osteoderms. The armoured skin has scales and is thick and rugged, providing some protection. They are still able to absorb heat through this armour, as a network of small capillaries allows blood through the scales to absorb heat. Crocodilian scales have pores believed to be sensory in function, analogous to the lateral line in fishes. They are particularly seen on their upper and lower jaws. Another possibility is that they are secretory, as they produce an oily substance which appears to flush mud off.

===Size===

Size greatly varies between species, from the dwarf crocodile to the saltwater crocodile. Species of Osteolaemus grow to an adult size of just [tpl]convert|1.5|to|1.9|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl],http://crocodilian.com/cnhc/csp_otet.htm. Crocodilian Species List.

Retrieved on 2013-04-08. Several other large species can reach over [tpl]convert|5.2|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] long and weigh over [tpl]convert|900|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl]. Crocodilians show pronounced sexual dimorphism, with males growing much larger and more rapidly than females. Despite their large adult sizes, crocodiles start their lives at around [tpl]convert|20|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] long. The largest species of crocodile is the saltwater crocodile, found in eastern India, northern Australia, throughout South-east Asia, and in the surrounding waters.
The largest crocodile ever held in captivity is an estuarine–Siamese hybrid named Yai ([tpl]lang-th|ใหญ่[/tpl], meaning big) (born 10 June 1972) at the Samutprakarn Crocodile Farm and Zoo, Thailand.

The longest crocodile captured alive is Lolong, which was measured at [tpl]convert|6.17|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] and weighed at [tpl]convert|1075|kg|abbr=on[/tpl] by a National Geographic team in Agusan del Sur Province, Philippines.[tpl]cite web|last=Britton|first=Adam|title=Lolong officially the world's largest crocodile in captivity|url=http://crocodilian.blogspot.com/2012/06/lolong-officially-worlds-largest.html|publisher=Crocodilian.com|accessdate=12 July 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Displaced Species|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=824855&publicationSubCategoryId=64|publisher=PhilStar|accessdate=12 July 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=GMA News with Ben Serrano and Paterno Esmaquel|title=NatGeo team confirms Lolong the croc is world's longest|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/237992/nation/natgeo-team-confirms-lolong-the-croc-is-worlds-longest|work=GMA News Online Top Stories|publisher=GMA Network Inc.|accessdate=15 November 2011[/tpl]

===Teeth===

Crocodiles are polyphyodonts and able to replace each of their 80 teeth up to 50 times in their 35 to 75-year lifespan.Solving an alligator mystery may help humans regrow lost teethSpecialized stem cell niche enables repetitive renewal of alligator teeth Next to the full grown tooth there are a small replacement tooth and a odontogenic stem cell in the dental lamina in standby that can be activated if required.Specialized stem cell niche enables repetitive renewal of alligator teeth

==Biology and behavior==

Crocodilians are more closely related to birds and dinosaurs than to most animals classified as reptiles, the three families being included in the group Archosauria ('ruling reptiles'). Despite their prehistoric look, crocodiles are among the more biologically complex reptiles. Unlike other reptiles, a crocodile has a cerebral cortex, a four-chambered heart, and the functional equivalent of a diaphragm, by incorporating muscles used for aquatic locomotion into respiration.[tpl]cite journal|author=Uriona TJ, Farmer CG. |year=2008|title=Recruitment of the diaphragmaticus, ischiopubis and other respiratory muscles to control pitch and roll in the American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|volume=211|pages=1141–1147|pmid=18344489|doi=10.1242/jeb.015339|issue=Pt 7[/tpl] Salt glands are present in the tongues of crocodiles and they have a pore opening on the surface of the tongue, which is a trait that separates them from alligators. Salt glands are dysfunctional in Alligatoridae. Their function appears to be similar to that of salt glands in marine turtles. Crocodiles do not have sweat glands and release heat through their mouths. They often sleep with their mouths open and may pant like a dog.[tpl]cite web | author= Anitai, Stefan | title = 14 Amazing Facts About Crocodiles – Living dinosaurs | url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/14-Amazing-Facts-About-Crocodiles-69931.shtml | publisher= Softpedia | accessdate = 1 April 2008[/tpl] Four species of freshwater crocodile climb trees to bask in areas lacking a shoreline.[tpl]cite journal | url=http://www.herpetologynotes.seh-herpetology.org/Volume7_PDFs/Dinets_HerpetologyNotes_volume7_pages3-7.pdf | title=Climbing behaviour in extant crocodilians | author=Dinets, Vladimir; Britton, Adam; Shirley, Matthew | journal=Herpetology Notes | year=2013 | volume=7 | pages=3–7[/tpl]

===Senses===

Crocodiles have acute senses, an evolutionary advantage that makes them successful predators. The eyes, ears and nostrils are located on top of the head, allowing the crocodile to lie low in the water, almost totally submerged and hidden from prey.

====Vision====

Crocodiles have very good night vision, and are mostly nocturnal hunters. They use the disadvantage of most prey animals' poor nocturnal vision, to their advantage. The light receptors in crocodilians’ eyes include both cones and numerous rods, so it is assumed all crocodilians can see colors.[tpl]cite web|url=http://wikis.evergreen.edu/m2o1112/index.php/Reptiles|title=Reptiles|author=evergreen|accessdate=29 April 2013[/tpl] Crocodiles have vertical-slit shaped pupils, similar to domestic cats. One explanation for the evolution of slit pupils is that they exclude light more effectively than a circular pupil, helping to protect their eyes during daylight.Land, M.F., (2006). Visual optics: the shapes of pupils. Current Biology, 16(5) pp. R167–R168  On the rear wall of the eye is a tapetum lucidum which reflects incoming light back onto the retina, thus utilizing the small amount of light available at night to best advantage. In addition to the protection of the upper and lower eyelids, crocodiles have a nictitating membrane which can be drawn over the eye from the inner corner while the lids are open. The eyeball surface is thus protected under the water while a certain degree of vision is still possible.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/143679/crocodile/38424/Form-and-function|title=Crocodile|author=Encyclopaedia Britannica|accessdate=29 April 2013[/tpl]

====Olfaction====

Crocodilian sense of smell is also very well developed, aiding them to detect prey or animal carcasses that are either on land or in water, from far away. It is possible that crocodiles use olfaction in the egg prior to hatching.
Chemoreception in crocodiles is especially interesting because they hunt both in terrestrial and in aquatic surroundings. Crocodiles have only one olfactory chamber and the vomeronasal organ is absent in the adultsHansen, A., (2007). Olfactory and solitary chemosensory cells: two different chemosensory systems in the nasal cavity of the American alligator, Alligator mississippiensis. BMC Neuroscience, 8:64 [tpl]DOI|10.1186/1471-2202-8-64[/tpl] http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1471-2202-8-64.pdf indicating all olfactory perception is limited to the olfactory system. Behavioral and olfactometer experiments indicate that crocodiles detect both air-borne and water-soluble chemicals and use their olfactory system for hunting. When above water, crocodiles enhance their ability to detect volatile odorants by gular pumping, a rhythmic movement of the floor of the pharynx.[ref]Gans, C. and Clark, B., (1976).

Morphol., 267: 924-939 Unlike turtles, crocodiles close their nostrils when submerged, so olfaction underwater is unlikely. Underwater food detection is presumably gustatory and tactile.Schwenk, K.

J.G.M Thewissen and S. Nummels (Eds). University of California Press, Berkeley. pp. 65-81

====Hearing====

Crocodiles can hear well; their tympanic membranes are concealed by flat flaps that may be raised or lowered by muscles.

====Touch====

Caudal: The upper and lower jaws are covered with sensory pits, visible as small, black speckles on the skin, the crocodilian version of the lateral line organs seen in fish and many amphibians, though arising from a completely different origin. These pigmented nodules encase bundles of nerve fibers innervated beneath by branches of the trigeminal nerve. They respond to the slightest disturbance in surface water, detecting vibrations and small pressure changes as small as a single drop.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/story/2002/05/15/crocodilians020515.html|title=Alligators detect silent ripples when hunting|author=CBCnews|year=2002|accessdate=29 April 2013|work=CBC News[/tpl]  This makes it possible for crocodiles to detect prey, danger and intruders, even in total darkness. These sense organs are known as Domed Pressure Receptors (DPRs).Jackson, K. and Brooks, D.R., (2007). Do crocodiles co-opt their sense of “touch” to “taste”? A possible new type of vertebrate sensory organ. Amphibia-Reptilia 28: 277-285 http://people.whitman.edu/~jacksok/AMRE2447.pdf
Post-Caudal: While alligators and caimans have DPRs only on their jaws, crocodiles have similar organs on almost every scale on their bodies. The function of the DPRs on the jaws is clear; to catch prey, but it is still not clear what is the function of the organs on the rest of the body. The receptors flatten when exposed to increased osmotic pressure, such as that experienced when swimming in sea water hyper-osmotic to the body fluids. When contact between the integument and the surrounding sea water solution is blocked, crocodiles are found to lose their ability to discriminate salinities. It has been proposed that the flattening of the sensory organ in hyper-osmotic sea water is sensed by the animal as “touch”, but interpreted as chemical information about its surroundings. This might be why in alligators they are absent on the rest of the body.[tpl]cite web|url=http://crocodilian.com/cnhc/cbd-gb1.htm |title=Crocodilian Biology Database - Integumentary Sense Organs |publisher=Crocodilian.com |accessdate=26 April 2013[/tpl]

===Hunting and diet===

Crocodiles are ambush predators, waiting for fish or land animals to come close, then rushing out to attack. Crocodiles mostly eat fish, amphibians, crustaceans, molluscs, birds, reptiles, mammals and occasionally cannibalize on smaller crocodiles. What a crocodile eats varies greatly with species, size and age. From the mostly fish-eating species like the slender-snouted and freshwater crocodiles to the larger species like the Nile crocodile and the saltwater crocodile that prey on large mammals, such as buffalo, deer and wild boar, diet shows great diversity. Diet is also greatly affected by size and age of the individual within the same species. All young crocodiles hunt mostly invertebrates and small fish, gradually moving onto larger prey. As cold-blooded predators, they have a very slow metabolism, so they can survive long periods without food. Despite their appearance of being slow, crocodiles have a very fast strike and are top predators in their environment, and various species have been observed attacking and killing other predators such as sharks and big cats.[tpl]cite web|url=http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/reptiles/saltwater-crocodile.html?nav=A-Z |title=Saltwater Crocodile, Saltwater Crocodile Profile, Facts, Information, Photos, Pictures, Sounds, Habitats, Reports, News – National Geographic |publisher=Animals.nationalgeographic.com |accessdate=16 March 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://crocodilian.com/cnhc/csp_cnil.htm |title=Crocodilian Species - Nile Crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus) |publisher=Crocodilian.com |accessdate=26 April 2013[/tpl]
Crocodiles have the most acidic stomach of any vertebrate. They can easily digest bones, hooves and horns. The BBC TVBBC channel 1 program Inside The Perfect Predator, Thursday 25 March 2010 reported that a Nile crocodile that has lurked a long time underwater to catch prey builds up a large oxygen debt. When it has caught and eaten that prey, it closes its right aortic arch and uses its left aortic arch to flush blood loaded with carbon dioxide from its muscles directly to its stomach; the resulting excess acidity in its blood supply makes it much easier for the stomach lining to secrete more stomach acid to quickly dissolve bulks of swallowed prey flesh and bone. Many large crocodilians swallow stones (called gastroliths or stomach stones), which may act as ballast to balance their bodies or assist in crushing food, similar to grit ingested by birds. Herodotus claimed that Nile crocodiles had a symbiotic relationship with certain birds, such as the Egyptian plover, which enter the crocodile's mouth and pick leeches feeding on the crocodile's blood; with no evidence of this interaction actually occurring in any crocodile species, it is most likely mythical or allegorical fiction.[tpl]cite web|author=Adam Britton |url=http://crocodilian.blogspot.com/2009/09/crocodile-myths-1-curious-trochilus.html |title=Croc Blog: Crocodile myths #1 – the curious trochilus |publisher=Crocodilian.blogspot.com |date=6 September 2009 |accessdate=26 April 2013[/tpl]

====Bite====

Since they feed by grabbing and holding onto their prey, they have evolved sharp teeth for piercing and holding onto flesh, and powerful muscles to close the jaws and hold them shut. The teeth are not well-suited to tearing flesh off of large prey items as is the dentition and claws of many mammalian carnivores, the hooked bills and talons of raptorial birds, or the serrated teeth of sharks. However, this is an advantage rather than a disadvantage to the crocodile since the properties of the teeth allow it to hold onto prey with the least possibility of the prey animal to escape. Otherwise combined with the exceptionally high bite force, the flesh would easily cut through; thus creating an escape opportunity for the prey item. The jaws can bite down with immense force, by far the strongest bite of any animal. The bite of a large crocodile's bite is more than [tpl]convert|5000|lbf|N|abbr=on[/tpl], which was measured in a [tpl]convert|5.5|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] Nile crocodile, on the field,National Geographic documentary; "Bite Force", Brady Barr. compared to just [tpl]convert|335|lbf|N|abbr=on[/tpl] for a Rottweiler, [tpl]convert|670|lbf|N|abbr=on[/tpl] for a great white shark, [tpl]convert|800|lbf|N|abbr=on[/tpl] for a hyena, or [tpl]convert|2200|lbf|N|abbr=on[/tpl] for an American alligator.[tpl]cite web|url=http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Which_animal_has_the_strongest_bite_force_a_crocodile_or_a_great_white_shark|title=Which animal has the strongest bite force a crocodile or a great white shark |publisher=Wiki.answers.com |date=17 October 2010 |accessdate=26 April 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Name (required) |url=http://dogfacts.wordpress.com/2008/02/03/national-geographics-dr-brady-barrs-bite-pressure-tests/ |title=National Geographic’s Dr. Brady Barr’s Bite Pressure Tests | Dog Facts |publisher=Dogfacts.wordpress.com |accessdate=26 April 2013[/tpl] A [tpl]convert|5.2|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] long saltwater crocodile has been confirmed as having the strongest bite force ever recorded for an animal in a laboratory setting.

Erickson, also shed light to the larger, extinct species of crocodilians. Since crocodile anatomy has changed only slightly for the last 80 million years, current data on modern crocodilians can be used to estimate the bite force of extinct species. An [tpl]convert|11|to(-)|12|m|ft[/tpl] long Deinosuchus would apply a force of [tpl]convert|23100|lbf|N|abbr=on[/tpl], twice that of the latest, higher bite force estimations of Tyrannosaurus. The extraordinary bite of crocodilians is a result of their anatomy. The space for the jaw muscle in the skull is very large, which is easily visible from the outside as a bulge at each side. The nature of the muscle is so stiff, it is almost as hard as bone to touch, as if it were the continuum of the skull. Another trait is that most of the muscle in a crocodile's jaw is arranged for clamping down. Despite the strong muscles to close the jaw, crocodiles have extremely small and weak muscles to open the jaw. Crocodiles can thus be subdued for study or transport by taping their jaws or holding their jaws shut with large rubber bands cut from automobile inner tubes.

===Locomotion===

Crocodiles are very fast over short distances, even out of water. The land speed record for a crocodile is [tpl]convert|17|km/h|0|abbr=on[/tpl] measured in a galloping Australian freshwater crocodile. Maximum speed varies from species to species. Certain species can indeed gallop, including Cuban crocodiles, New Guinea crocodiles, African dwarf crocodiles, and even small Nile crocodiles. The fastest means by which most species can move is a kind of "belly run", where the body moves in a snake-like fashion, limbs splayed out to either side paddling away frantically while the tail whips to and fro. Crocodiles can reach speeds of [tpl]convert|10|-|11|km/h|0|abbr=on[/tpl] when they "belly run", and often faster if slipping down muddy riverbanks. Another form of locomotion is the "high walk", where the body is raised clear of the ground. Crocodiles may possess a form of homing instinct. In northern Australia, three rogue saltwater crocodiles were relocated [tpl]convert|400|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] by helicopter, but had returned to their original locations within three weeks, based on data obtained from tracking devices attached to the reptiles.[tpl]cite journal|author=Read M. A., Grigg G. C., Irwin S. R., Shanahan D, Franklin C. E.|year=2007|title=Satellite Tracking Reveals Long Distance Coastal Travel and Homing by Translocated Estuarine Crocodiles, Crocodylus porosus|journal= PLoS ONE |volume=2|issue=9|page=e949|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0000949|editor1-last=Lusseau|editor1-first=David[/tpl]

===Longevity===

Measuring crocodile age is unreliable, although several techniques are used to derive a reasonable guess. The most common method is to measure lamellar growth rings in bones and teeth—each ring corresponds to a change in growth rate which typically occurs once a year between dry and wet seasons.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/cnhc/cbd-faq-q3.htm |title=Crocodilian Biology Database, FAQ. "How long do crocodiles live for?" |publisher=Flmnh.ufl.edu |accessdate=26 April 2013[/tpl] Bearing these inaccuracies in mind, it can be safely said that all crocodile species have an average lifespan of at least 30–40 years, and in the case of larger species an average of 60–70 years. The oldest crocodiles appear to be the largest species. C. porosus is estimated to live around 70 years on average, with limited evidence of some individuals exceeding 100 years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://crocodilian.com/cnhc/cbd-faq-q3.htm |title=Crocodilian Biology Database - FAQ - How long do crocodiles live for? |publisher=Crocodilian.com |accessdate=26 April 2013[/tpl]
A male crocodile lived to an estimated age of 110–115 years in a Russian zoo in Yekaterinburg.

===Social behavior and vocalization===

Crocodiles are the most social of reptiles. Even though they do not form social groups, many species congregate in certain section of a rivers, tolerating each other at times of feeding and basking. Most species are not highly territorial, with the exception of the saltwater crocodile; which is a highly territorial and aggressive species. A mature male will not tolerate any other males at any time of the year. Most of the species however, are more flexible. There is a certain form of hierarchy in crocodiles, where the largest and heaviest males are at the top; having access to the best basking site, females and priority during a group feeding of a big kill or carcass. A good example to the hierarchy in crocodiles would be the case of the Nile crocodile. This species clearly displays all of these behaviors. Studies in this area are not thorough, and many species are yet to be studied in greater detail.[tpl]cite web|url=http://crocodilian.com/cnhc/csp_cnil.htm |title=Crocodilian Species List |publisher=Crocodilian.com |accessdate=26 April 2013[/tpl] Mugger crocodiles are also known to show toleration in group feedings and tend to congregate to certain areas. However, males of all species are aggressive towards each other during mating season, to gain access to females.
Crocodiles are also the most vocal of all reptiles, producing a wide variety of sounds during various situations and conditions, depending on species, age, size and sex. Depending on the context, some species can communicate over 20 different messages through vocalizations alone.[tpl]cite web|url=http://crocodilian.com/cnhc/croccomm.html |title=Crocodilian Communication |publisher=Crocodilian.com |accessdate=29 April 2013[/tpl] Some of these vocalizations are made during social communication, especially during territorial displays towards the same sex and courtship with the opposite sex; the common concern being reproduction. Therefore most conspecific vocalization is made during the breeding season, with the exception being year-round territorial behavior in some species and quarrels during feeding. Crocodiles also produce different distress calls and in aggressive displays to their own kind and other animals; notably other predators during interspecific predatory confrontations over carcasses and terrestrial kills.
Specific vocalisations include -
Chirp: When about to hatch, the young make a “peeping” noise, which encourages the female to excavate the nest. The female then gathers the hatchlings in her mouth and transports them to the water, where they remain in a group for several months, protected by the female[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.arkive.org/nile-crocodile/crocodylus-niloticus/|author=Arkive|title=Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus)|accessdate=29 April 2013[/tpl]
Distress call: A high-pitched call mostly used by younger animals that alerts other crocodiles to imminent danger or an animal being attacked.
Threat call: A hissing sound that has also been described as a coughing noise.
Hatching call: Emitted by females when breeding to alert other crocodiles that she has laid eggs in her nest.
Bellowing: Male crocodiles are especially vociferous. Bellowing choruses occur most often in the spring when breeding groups congregate, but can occur at any time of year. To bellow, males noticeably inflate as they raise the tail and head out of water, slowly waving the tail back and forth. They then puff out the throat and with a closed mouth, begin to vibrate air. Just before bellowing, males project an infrasonic signal at about 10 Hz through the water which vibrates the ground and nearby objects. These low-frequency vibrations travel great distances through both air and water to advertise the male's presence and are so powerful they result in the water appearing to 'dance’.[tpl]cite web|url=http://factsanddetails.com/Asian.php?itemid=2435&subcatid=434|author=Hays, J.|title=Crocodiles: Their history, characteristics and behavior.|year=2008|accessdate=31 May 2013[/tpl]

===Reproduction===

Crocodiles reproduce by laying eggs, which are either laid in hole or mound nests, depending on species. A hole nest is usually excavated in sand and a mound nest is usually constructed out of vegetation. Nesting period ranges from a few weeks up to six months. Courtship takes place in a series of behavioral interactions that include a variety of snout rubbing and submissive display that can take a long time. Mating always takes place in water, where the pair can be observed mating several times. Females can build or dig several trial nests which appear incomplete and abandoned later. Egg laying usually takes place at night and about 30–40 minutes.[tpl]cite book|author = K. Richardson, G. Webb and C. Manolis|title = Crocodiles: Inside and Out|year = 2000[/tpl] Females are highly protective of their nests and young. The egg are hard shelled but translucent at the time of egg-laying. Depending on the species crocodile, a number of 7-95 eggs are laid. Crocodile embryos do not have sex chromosomes, and unlike humans, sex is not determined genetically. Sex is determined by temperature, where at [tpl]convert|30|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl] or less most hatchlings are females and at [tpl]convert|31|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl], offspring are of both sexes. A temperature of [tpl]convert|32|to|33|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl] gives mostly males whereas above [tpl]convert|33|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl] in some species continues to give males but in other species resulting in females, which are sometimes called as high-temperature females.[tpl]cite book|author = G. Webb and C. Manolis|title = Crocodiles of Australia|year = 1989[/tpl] Temperature also affects growth and survival rate of the young, which may explain the sexual dimorphism in crocodiles. The average incubation period is around 80 days, and also is dependent on temperature and species that usually ranges from 65 to 95 days.Britton, Adam. Estuarine Crocodile: Crocodylus porosus. ''Crocodilians: Natural History Conservation: Crocodiles, Caimans, Alligators, Gharials.' At the time of hatching, the young start calling within the eggs. They have an egg-tooth at the tip of their snouts, which is developed from the skin, helps them pierce out of the shell. Hearing the calls, the female usually excavates the nest and sometimes takes the unhatched eggs in her mouth, slowly rolling the eggs to help the process. The young is usually carried to the water in the mouth. A group of hatchlings is called a pod or crèche and may be protected for months.

==Relationship with humans==

===Danger to humans===

The larger species of crocodiles are very dangerous to humans, mainly because of their ability to strike before the person can react. The saltwater crocodile and Nile crocodile are the most dangerous, killing hundreds of people each year in parts of Southeast Asia and Africa. The mugger crocodile, American crocodile, American alligator and black caiman are also dangerous to humans.

===Crocodile products===

Crocodiles are protected in many parts of the world, but they also are farmed commercially. Their hides are tanned and used to make leather goods such as shoes and handbags; crocodile meat is also considered a delicacy. The most commonly farmed species are the saltwater and Nile crocodiles, while a hybrid of the saltwater and the rare Siamese crocodile is also bred in Asian farms. Farming has resulted in an increase in the saltwater crocodile population in Australia, as eggs are usually harvested from the wild, so landowners have an incentive to conserve their habitat. Crocodile leather can be made into goods such as wallets, briefcases, purses, handbags, belts, hats, and shoes.
Crocodile meat is consumed in some countries, such as Australia, Ethiopia, Thailand, South Africa, China and also Cuba (in pickled form); it can also be found in specialty restaurants in some parts of the United States. The meat is white and its nutritional composition compares favourably with that of other meats.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2008[/tpl] It tends to have a slightly higher cholesterol level than other meats.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2008[/tpl] Crocodile meat has a delicate flavour; some describe it as a cross between chicken and crab.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2008[/tpl] Cuts of meat include backstrap and tail fillet.
Crocodile oil has been used for various purposes.

==Taxonomy and phylogeny==

Most species are grouped into the genus Crocodylus. The other extant genus, Osteolaemus, is monotypic (as is Mecistops, if recognized).

===Phylogeny===

The cladogram below follows the topology from a 2012 analysis of morphological traits by Christopher A. Brochu and Glenn W. Storrs.[tpl]cite doi|10.1080/02724634.2012.652324[/tpl] Many extinct species of Crocodylus might represent different genera. "Crocodylus" pigotti, for example, was placed in the newly erected genus Brochuchus in 2013.[tpl]Cite doi|10.1080/02724634.2013.743404[/tpl] C. suchus was not included because its morphological codings were identical to those of C. niloticus. However, the authors suggested that the lack of differences was due to limited specimen sampling, and considered the two species to be distinct. This analysis found weak support for the clade Osteolaeminae. Brochu named Osteolaeminae in 2003 as a subfamily of Crocodylidae separate from Crocodylinae, but the group has since been classified within Crocodylinae. It includes the living genus Osteolaemus as well as the extinct species Voay robustus and Rimasuchus lloydi.
 
 

A 2013 analysis by Jack L. Conrad, Kirsten Jenkins, Thomas Lehmann, and others did not support Osteolaeminae as a true clade but rather a paraphyletic group consisting of two smaller clades. They informally called these clades "osteolaemins" and "mecistopins". "Osteolaemins" include  Osteolaemus, Voay, Rimasuchus, and Brochuchus and "mecistopins" include Mecistops and Euthecodon.
