U.S. Postal Service Pro Cycling Team was a United States-based professional road bicycle racing team.  On June 15, 2004, the Discovery Channel signed a deal to become sponsor of the team for the 2004–2007 seasons and its name changed to "Discovery Channel Pro Cycling Team" (UCI Team Code: DSC) From 2005 until 2007, the team was one of the 20 teams that competed in the new UCI ProTour. As part of the sponsorship deal, Armstrong provided on-air appearances for the Discovery Networks TV channels. The deal did not affect the rights of secondary sponsor OLN, now known as NBC Sports Network in the US, to air major cycling events such as the Tour de France, although the two channels are competitors.
The team was directed by Belgian Johan Bruyneel, who also managed U.S. Postal. The chief mechanic was Julien DeVries. The team was co-owned by Tailwind Sports Corp. of San Francisco and Capital Sports & Entertainment of Austin, Texas. On February 10, 2007, Discovery Channel announced that it would not renew its sponsorship of the team at the end of the 2007 season.[tpl]cite news |url=http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/news.php?id=news/2007/feb07/feb10news |title=Discovery Channel to end sponsorship |first=Sue |last=George |date=2007-02-10 |accessdate=2007-02-10 |work=Cyclingnews.com[/tpl] On August 10, 2007 the cycling team announced that it would not search for a new sponsor, but ceased operations and disband at the end of the 2007 season.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.forbes.com/sport/2007/08/10/armstrong-cycling-discovery-lifestyle-sports-cx_pm_0810tour.html|title=Armstrong's Former Team To Disband|publisher=forbes.com|accessdate=2009-01-08|date=2007-08-10[/tpl]

After the 2007 season Johan Bruyneel went to rebuild the shamed and suspended Team Astana for the 2008 season. He brought with him much of Discovery's personnel, such as riders Alberto Contador, Levi Leipheimer, Yaroslav Popovych, Tomas Vaitkus, and coach Sean Yates.
The 2007 U.S. national road champion George Hincapie signed a contract for the 2008 season with the now defunct Team High Road, later known as Team HTC-Columbia, run by the American Bob Stapleton.

==U.S. Postal Service Pro Cycling Team history==

The US Postal Service Pro Cycling Team and later named the US Postal Service Pro Cycling Team presented by Berry Floor operated from 1996 through 2004. The United States Postal Service was the title (primary) sponsor from 1996 through 2004 and the team was nicknamed the "Blue Train". Berry Floor, a Belgian flooring company, was the secondary sponsor, also known as a Presenting Sponsor. Domestically the USPS Pro Cycling Team was presented by Alloc, the American subsidiary of Berry Floor.
Lance Armstrong won six Tours de France (1999–2004) with US Postal, and in 2003 Roberto Heras—at that time a US Postal rider—won the Vuelta a España. Armstrong went on to win a seventh Tour de France in 2005, after the USPS contract and sponsorship ended.
The US Postal Service announced that it would cease sponsorship at the end of the 2004 racing season when its eight-year contract expired. It had previously been under fire for the expenditure from organizations such as Postal Watch, a website critical of the United States Postal Service. Legitimate problems of mismanagement and sloppy accounting were pointed out by the Postal Service itself, via the USPS Office of the Inspector General. Before the expiration of the USPS contract, Armstrong insisted that he would only continue to ride with the USPS team structure. This demand was met on June 15, 2004 when Discovery Networks stepped in and agreed to sponsor the team for the next three years as the Discovery Channel Pro Cycling Team.

===1996 results===

With the help of Thomas Weisel and Eddie Borysewicz, the United States Postal Service begins its reign as title sponsor to what has become the most successful cycling team from the United States. Borysewicz served as the team's directeur sportif and the team raced mainly in domestic events in the United States.

===1997 results===

Thomas Weisel brought in Mark Gorski, the 1984 Olympic Gold Medalist in the Men's 1000 m Sprint (Scratch) event, as team manager. Due in large part to Russian Viatcheslav Ekimov and his key stage wins at Paris–Nice and the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré, the USPS squad got its first invitation to ride in the Tour de France.

===1998 results===

Lance Armstrong joined the US Postal team in late 1997, when returning to professional cycling following his cancer treatments.

===1999 results===

===2000 results===

===2001 results===

In 2001, the U.S. Postal Service Pro Cycling Team was named the USOC Team of the Year. Also, Armstrong was named USOC SportsMan of the Year, which he also won in 1999.

===1988–1989 – Sunkyong (Amateur)===

At the 1984 Summer Olympics, Borysewicz served as the U.S. Olympic Cycling Coach and led American cyclists to an unprecedented nine Olympic medals.
