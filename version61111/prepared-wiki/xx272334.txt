==History==

===16th century===

Ranald MacDonald was granted Smerby Castle from his father James MacDonald, 6th of Dunnyveg.
Angus MacDonald, 8th of Dunnyveg was kept as a prisoner in chains at Smerby Castle in 1598 after James MacDonald was sent to seek his fathers submission to King James V of Scotland. Angus suffered burns after his Kintyre house Askomull was burnt down by his son James and was subsequently captured.A. MacDonald, et al. p.569.
