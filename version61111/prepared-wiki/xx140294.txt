Alejandra and Aeron are Alejandra Salinas (Spanish, born La Rioja 1977) and Aeron Bergman, (American, born Detroit 1971), artists based in Oslo, Norway. They make intermedia art including  sound art and installations, web projects and  video art. Bergman is professor of art at the Oslo National Academy of Art.

==Sound works==

Their 2005 album Be Mine consists of interviews of people talking about love, and the 1999 Children's Record was made by asking people to sing songs they can remember from their childhood. Alejandra and Aeron's early works are among the first experiments with folk and laptop electronic music. This is especially noted in Ruinas Encantadas (winner of an honorary mention in Prix Ars Electronica 2001) and Porto: Folklore Fragments Volume 2. The track Water Jota in 1213442 from the former consists almost entirely of water drop sounds, arranged according to the structure of a folk dance; the artists themselves comment on such concepts that the record "considers the past, while not repeating it."Hannes Leopoldseder, Christine Schöpf, Christian Schrenk. Cyberarts 2001, p. 179. Birkhäuser, 2001. ISBN 3-211-83628-4
In 2002 the duo won an Award of Distinction in Digital Music for their audio installation "Revisionland" from the Prix Ars Electronica in Linz, Austria. They have released 12 critically acclaimed full length audio CDs on labels such as Orthlorng Musork, Fat Cat, Tomlab and their own label, Lucky Kitchen.
