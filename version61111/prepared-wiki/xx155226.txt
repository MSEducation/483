==Plot==

Arrogant and wise-cracking Brice Wayne (William Haines) enrolls with the United States Army at West Point and adjusts to life as a plebe. He tries out for the football team, where he excels.  However, his ego is unrivaled, especially in competition with upperclassman Bob Sperry (Neil Neely).  At the same time, Brice meets a local girl named Betty Channing (Joan Crawford) who cheers for him at football practices.
A year later, Brice is the star football player for West Point.  By this time, both Sperry and Brice are in love with Betty, and while Sperry acts like a gentleman towards Betty, Brice forces a kiss on Betty, only for her to spurn him.  Betty continues to reject Brice's advances.  
Brice decries favoritism by Coach Towers (Raymond G. Moses) to the local paper.  After an altercation with the coach in the locker room, Brice shouts "to hell with the Corps" and quits the team in a huff.  This causes a minor scandal at the school, and when fellow teammate Tex (William Bakewell) tries to reason with him, Brice hits him into lockers.  Immediately regretting his actions, Brice tries to help, but Tex's head is injured.  Brice attempts to resign from West Point out of shame, but reconsiders when he realizes he needs to help him team.
Brice speaks with the superintendent, and decides not to resign his commission.  Brice originally sits on the sidelines of the Army–Navy Game, but with Army down, he is put into service.  He scores a touchdown and wins the game for the Army, and asks for forgiveness from his team.  
As graduation from West Point concludes some years later, he ends in the arms of Betty.
