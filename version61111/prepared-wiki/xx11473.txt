Any unit of length gives a corresponding unit of volume, namely the volume of a cube whose side has the given length.  For example, a cubic centimetre (cm3) would be the volume of a cube whose sides are one centimetre (1 cm) in length.
In the International System of Units (SI), the standard unit of volume is the cubic metre (m3).  The metric system also includes the litre (L) as a unit of volume, where one litre is the volume of a 10-centimetre cube.  Thus
so
Small amounts of liquid are often measured in millilitres, where
Various other traditional units of volume are also in use, including the cubic inch, the cubic foot, the cubic mile, the teaspoon, the tablespoon, the fluid ounce, the fluid dram, the gill, the pint, the quart, the gallon, the minim, the barrel, the cord, the peck, the bushel, and the hogshead.

Volume and capacity are the sometimes distinguished, with capacity being used for how much a container can hold (with contents measured commonly in litres or its derived units), and volume being how much space an object displaces (commonly measured in cubic metres or its derived units).
Volume and capacity are also distinguished in capacity management, where capacity is defined as volume over a specified time period.  However in this context the term volume may be more loosely interpreted to mean quantity.
The density of an object is defined as mass per unit volume. The inverse of density is specific volume which is defined as volume divided by mass. Specific volume is a concept important in thermodynamics where the volume of a working fluid is often an important parameter of a system being studied.
The volumetric flow rate in fluid dynamics is the volume of fluid which passes through a given surface per unit time (for example cubic meters per second s−1).

===Volume ratios for a cone, sphere and cylinder of the same radius and height===

The above formulas can be used to show that the volumes of a cone, sphere and cylinder of the same radius and height are in the ratio 1 : 2 : 3, as follows.
Let the radius be r and the height be h (which is 2r for the sphere), then the volume of cone is
the volume of the sphere is
while the volume of the cylinder is
The discovery of the 2 : 3 ratio of the volumes of the sphere and cylinder is credited to Archimedes.[tpl]cite web |first=Chris |last=Rorres|url = http://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Tomb/Cicero.html|title = Tomb of Archimedes: Sources|publisher = Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences|accessdate = 2007-01-02[/tpl]

==Volume formula derivations==

===Sphere===

The volume of a sphere is the integral of an infinite number of infinitesimally small circular disks of thickness dx.
The calculation for the volume of a sphere with center 0 and radius r is as follows.
The radius of the circular disks, defined such that the x-axis cuts perpendicularly through them, is;
or
where y or z can be taken to represent the radius of a disk at a particular x value.
The volume of the sphere consists of layers of infinitesimally thin spherical shells, and the sphere volume is equal to

===Cone===

The cone is a type of pyramidal shape. The fundamental equation for pyramids, one-third times base times altitude, applies to cones as well. 
However, using calculus, the volume of a cone is the integral of an infinite number of infinitesimally small circular disks of thickness dx.
The calculation for the volume of a cone of height h, whose base is centered at (0,0,0) with radius r, is as follows.
