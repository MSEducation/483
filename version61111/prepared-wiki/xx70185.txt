TaleSpin is a half-hour animated adventure series based in the fictional city of Cape Suzette, that first aired in 1990 as a preview on The Disney Channel and later that year as part of The Disney Afternoon, with characters adapted from Disney's 1967 animated feature The Jungle Book, which was theatrically rereleased in the summer before this show premiered in the fall.[tpl]cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=junglebook90.htm |title=The Jungle Book (re-issue) (1990) |publisher=Box Office Mojo |date=1990-09-04 |accessdate=2013-02-08[/tpl] The name of the show is a play on "tailspin," the rapid descent of an aircraft in a steep spiral. The two words in the show's name, tale and spin, are a way to describe telling a story.[tpl]cite news|title= TaleSpin|work= Entertainment Weekly|date=1990-09-07|url= http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20268084,00.html|accessdate=2010-10-19[/tpl] The show is one of the nine Disney Afternoon shows to use established Disney characters as the main characters, with the others being Darkwing Duck, DuckTales, Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers, Goof Troop, Bonkers, Quack Pack, Aladdin and The Lion King's Timon and Pumbaa.

==Background==

After a preview of TaleSpin aired on The Disney Channel from May 5 to July 15, 1990,The Disney Channel Magazine, Vol. 8, no. 2 (typo in magazine: should be "no. 3"), May/June 1990: pp. 22, 34, 37, 46, 49–53, 57–59.The Disney Channel Magazine, Vol. 8, no. 3 (typo in magazine: should be "no. 4"), July/August 1990: pp. 45–47. the series began its syndicated run in September of the same year. The original concept was embodied in the pilot episode and introductory television movie Plunder & Lightning which was the sole nominee for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming More Than One Hour) in 1991.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000223/1991|title=Primetime Emmy Awards (1991) |publisher= IMDb.com |date=|accessdate=2013-01-24[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title= Disney's 'Tale Spin' Gets Late Nomination for TV Animation Emmy |agency= Associated Press |date=1991-07-25|url= http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1991/Disney-s-Tale-Spin-Gets-Late-Nomination-for-TV-Animation-Emmy/id-23ac628d5d351899898219ee2395c5a0|accessdate=2013-01-24[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/awards/nominees-winners/1991/animation-general |title=Nominees/Winners | Academy of Television Arts & Sciences |publisher=Emmys.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-04[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/shows/disneys-tale-spin-plunder-lightning |title=DISNEY'S TALE SPIN: PLUNDER & LIGHTNING | Academy of Television Arts & Sciences |publisher=Emmys.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-04[/tpl] After its premiere on September 7, 1990,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0304784/|title="TaleSpin" Plunder & Lightning (TV episode 1990) – IMDb|publisher= IMDb.com |date=|accessdate=2013-01-24[/tpl] Plunder & Lightning was re-edited into four half-hour episodes for reruns. The show was often seen either on its own as a half-hour show, or as part of the two-hour syndicated programming block The Disney Afternoon. TaleSpin ended on its 65th episode which aired on August 8, 1991. However, reruns continued to be shown on The Disney Afternoon until September 1994. On October 2, 1995, TaleSpin began reruns on The Disney Channel as part of a two-hour programming block called "Block Party" which aired on weekdays in the late-afternoon/early-evening and which also included Darkwing Duck, DuckTales, and Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers."Block Party: Four Disney Animated Series." The Disney Channel Magazine, Vol. 13, no. 5, October/November 1995: p. 36. Later, the show was aired on Toon Disney, where it was first aired from April 1998 until January 2006 (with a hiatus between 2001 and 2002 due to the September 11 attacks)[tpl]fact|date=March 2013[/tpl], and later from January 2007 until May 2008.
Several of the characters are loosely based on characters from Disney's animated film version of The Jungle Book: in particular Baloo, the hot-shot pilot hero of the series; Louie, the owner of Baloo's favorite bar; and Shere Khan, a business tycoon who appears in many episodes. Despite its strong likeness to and re-use of several characters from the film, TaleSpin has never been intended to be a "spin-off" or a parody of The Jungle Book.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.animationsource.org/talespin/en/custom_questions/Why_The_Jungle_Book/157.html&nump=1338 |title=TaleSpin and The Jungle Book |publisher=Animationsource.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-03[/tpl] There is also a more than passing resemblance to Hayao Miyazaki's film Porco Rosso about a pigheaded man who flies a seaplane and fights air pirates, which the creators of TaleSpin explain by the influence the previous Miyazaki's films had on them, and the possibility of Miyazaki watching TaleSpin at some point.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.animationsource.org/talespin/en/custom_questions/Porco_Rosso_likeliness/232.html&nump=1338 |title=TaleSpin and Porco Rosso |publisher=Animationsource.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-03[/tpl] While the film was released in 1992 (two years after TaleSpin had already aired) Porco Rosso is based on Miyazaki's manga, Hikōtei Jidai, which was first published in 1989.
The series was largely developed by writers Jymn Magon and Mark Zaslove, who were also the supervising producers on the series as well as story editors. There were four production teams, each one headed by a producer/director: Robert Taylor, Larry Latham, Jamie Mitchell, and Ed Ghertner.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.animationsource.org/talespin/en/custom_questions/Production_information/147.html&nump=1338 |title=Four production teams for TaleSpin |publisher=Animationsource.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-03[/tpl]

==Synopsis==

TaleSpin is set in the fictional city of Cape Suzette (a pun on the dish Crêpe Suzette), in a fictional country called Usland. The city lies in a harbor protected by giant cliffs through which only a small opening exists. The opening in the cliffs is guarded by anti-aircraft artillery, preventing flying rabble-rousers or air pirates from entering the city. The characters in the world of TaleSpin are anthropomorphic animals. The time frame of the series is never specifically addressed, but appears to be in the mid-to-late 1930s. The helicopter, television and jet engine are experimental devices, and most architecture is reminiscent of the Art Deco style of that period. In one episode, Baloo comments that "The Great War ended 20 years ago,""Bygones". Original airdate 3 May 1991. suggesting that the series specifically takes place in 1938. Radio is the primary mass medium, and one episode even briefly alludes to the characters having never heard of television."The Incredible Shrinking Molly". Original airdate 8 April 1991.
The series centers on the adventures of bush pilot Baloo the bear, whose air cargo freight business, "Baloo's Air Service," is purchased by Rebecca Cunningham upon his default on delinquent bills with the bank and renamed "Higher for Hire." An orphan boy and former air pirate, the ambitious Kit Cloudkicker, attaches to Baloo and becomes his navigator. He sometimes calls him "Papa Bear." Together, they are the crew of Higher for Hire's only aircraft, a 20-year old modified Conwing L-16 (a fictitious combination of a Fairchild C-82 transport and a Grumman HU-16 amphibian) with the livery of the Canadair CL-215 waterbomber, named the Sea Duck. From there, the series follows the ups and downs of Higher for Hire and its staff, sometimes in the vein of old action-adventure film serials of the 1930s and 1940s and contemporary variations, such as Raiders of the Lost Ark.
Their adventures often involve encounters with a gang of air pirates led by Don Karnage, as well as with representatives of Thembria (a parody of the Stalinist Soviet Union inhabited by anthropomorphic boars), or other, often even stranger obstacles.  In deference to contemporary sensitivities, there is no equivalent of the Nazis in the series, although one story in Disney Adventures Magazine, "The Dogs of War!," had the heroes encounter "the Hausers" (members of the "Houn" nationality), a menacing militaristic nationality of dogs from "Hounsland" who wear uniforms that are clearly based on German ones and the senior commander of the Houn airship (Major Heartworm) speaks in a mock-German accent.Gray, Doug (w), Lavoradori, Alberto (p,i). "The Dogs of War!" Disney Adventures v2 #1 (November 1991), The Walt Disney Company, Story code: KZ 4590
The relationship between Baloo and Rebecca owes something to the screwball comedy films of the 1930s. More precisely, according to Jymn Magon (co-creator of the series), the two characters were fashioned after Sam Malone and Rebecca Howe from the then-popular sitcom Cheers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.animationsource.org/talespin/en/custom_questions/Does_Baloo_have_feelings_for_Rebecca/149.html&nump=1338 |title=Question about the relationship between Baloo & Becky to Jymn Magon |publisher=Animationsource.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-03[/tpl] Famed Uncle Scrooge comic writer and artist Don Rosa wrote episode 6, "It Came from Beneath the Sea Duck," episode 9, "I Only Have Ice for You," and episode 24, "A Touch of Glass."

The comic's cancellation at the end of 1991 terminated several planned stories that would have revealed pieces of background for the main characters.  Issue 7, "The Long Flight Home," explored Kit's past, and how he joined up with the pirates. According to the letter page in #3, a planned story for the comic's annual would have explored the origin of the Iron Vulture. In addition, #4–7 would have letters 'answered' by the characters. A collected edition called Disney's Cartoon Tales featuring TaleSpin came out in 1991 (ISBN 1-56115-269-2). It reprints #4 and 6 from the regular comic book series.
