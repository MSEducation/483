==Submissions==

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has invited the film industries of various countries to submit their best film for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film since 1956. The Foreign Language Film Award Committee oversees the process and reviews all the submitted films. Following this, they vote via secret ballot to determine the five nominees for the award. Below is a list of the films that have been submitted by Bolivia for review by the Academy for the award by year and the respective Academy Awards ceremony.
All films were made primarily in Spanish.
Three of Bolivia's submissions were directed by Juan Carlos Valdivia and two were co-productions with Mexico. Bolivia's first submission, Jonah and the Pink Whale, is an erotic drama set in the 1980s amidst an upper-class Bolivian family, against a backdrop of military politics and drug trafficking. Eleven years later, Valdivia was again in the competition with American Visa, a comedy-thriller about a Bolivian professor trying to get a visa to join his son and work illegally in the United States. Bolivia's most recent submission, Zona Sur, was also directed by Valdivia, but had no Mexican input. Zona Sur centers on a wealthy, white Bolivian divorcee who is living beyond her means in contemporary Bolivia, and her relationship with her three spoiled children and her two Aymara servants.
Sexual Dependency, a co-production with the United States, was Bolivia's second Oscar submission. Set in Santa Cruz, Bolivia and Ithaca, New York, it tells five barely connected stories of teenagers and their early sexual experiences.
