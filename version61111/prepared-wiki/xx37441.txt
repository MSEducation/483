In 1987, the company released Sid Meier's Pirates!, which also began a trend of placing Meier's name in the titles of his games. Meier later explained that the inclusion of his name was because of the dramatic departure in the design of Pirates! compared to the company's earlier titles. Stealey decided that it would improve the company's branding, believing that it would make those who purchased the flight simulators more likely to play this game. Stealey recalled: "We were at dinner at a Software Publishers Association meeting, and Robin Williams was there. And he kept us in stitches for two hours. And he turns to me and says 'Bill, you should put Sid's name on a couple of these boxes, and promote him as the star.' And that's how Sid's name got on Pirates, and Civilization."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2013/06/28/how-sid-meier-became-one-of-the-most-recognizable-names-in-pc-gaming/ |title=How Sid Meier became one of the most recognizable names in gaming | News |publisher=PC Gamer |date=2013-06-28 |accessdate=2013-08-25[/tpl] Meier is not always the main designer on titles that carry his name. For instance, Brian Reynolds has been credited as the primary designer behind Sid Meier's Civilization II, Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri, and Sid Meier's Colonization,Interview with Brian Reynolds from GameSpy"The Sid Meier Legacy: Sid Meier's Colonization" from GameSpot while Jeff Briggs designed Sid Meier's Civilization III, Soren Johnson led Sid Meier's Civilization IV, and Jon Shafer led Sid Meier's Civilization V.
After the release of F-19 Stealth Fighter, Meier decided to focus on developing strategy games. He later said, "Everything I thought was cool about a flight simulator had gone into that game." Inspired by SimCity and Empire!, Meier created Sid Meier's Railroad Tycoon and later the game series for which he is most widely recognized, Sid Meier's Civilization,[tpl]cite book | last=Rouse III | first=Richard | title=Game Design: Theory & Practice Second Edition | publisher=Wordware Publishing | at=pp. 20-39 | year=2005 | isbn=1-55622-912-7 [/tpl] although he designed only the first installment. Meier eventually left MicroProse and in 1996 founded Firaxis Games along with veteran designer and gaming executive Jeff Briggs. Today Firaxis makes strategy games, many of which are follow-ups to Sid Meier's early titles, such as the new Civilization games and Sid Meier's Pirates! (2004). In 1996, he invented a "System for Real-Time Music Composition and Synthesis" used in  C.P.U.

According to PC Gamer, "Though his games are frequently about violent times and places, there is never any blood or gore shown. He designs and creates his games by playing them, over and over, until they are fun." Meier worked with a team on a dinosaur-themed game starting early 2000, but announced in an online development diary in 2001 that the game had been shelved. Despite trying various approaches, including turn-based and real-time gameplay, he said he found no way to make the concept fun enough. In 2005, he said, "We've been nonstop busy making other games over the past several years, so the dinosaur game remains on the shelf. However, I do love the idea of a dinosaur game and would like to revisit it when I have some time."Firaxis Games: Community: Ask Sid from Firaxis' official website In 2010, Meier said he wished he made Tetris as well as Guitar Hero, adding: "I think music games are really cool, and if I had a great idea I'd probably be working on it."[tpl]cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5531995/an-hour-of-sid-meier-brilliance-including-his-surprise-guitar-hero-regret |title=An Hour Of Sid Meier Brilliance, Including His Surprise Guitar Hero Regret |publisher=Kotaku.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-25[/tpl]
