==Guiding philosophy==

While all issues affecting children are important, some affect greater numbers of children in more significant ways. Understanding issues in context is valuable to the donor looking to make the greatest impact with a charitable contribution.
Operation Kids assesses donor-recommended organizations for effectiveness, and then creates an individualized giving plan for donors. Their goal is to maximize efforts so donations will be used efficiently.
