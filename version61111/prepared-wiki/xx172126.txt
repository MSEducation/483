[[Escharotomy]]

CATEGORIES: Plastic surgery

An escharotomy is a surgical procedure used to treat full thickness (third-degree) circumferential burns.  Since full thickness burns are characterized by tough, leathery eschar, an escharotomy is used primarily to combat compartment syndrome.  Following a full thickness burn, as the underlying tissues are rehydrated, they become constricted due to the eschar's loss of elasticity, leading to impaired circulation distal to the wound.
An escharotomy is performed by making an incision through the eschar to expose the fatty tissue below.  Due to the residual pressure, the incision will often widen substantially.

==Overview==

Full-thickness circumferential and near-circumferential skin burns result in the formation of a tough, inelastic mass of burnt tissue (eschar). The eschar, by virtue of this inelasticity, results in the burn-induced compartment syndrome. This is caused by the accumulation of extracellular and extravascular fluid within confined anatomic spaces of the extremities or digits. The excessive fluid causes the intracompartmental pressures to increase, resulting in collapse of the contained vascular and lymphatic structures and, hence, loss of tissue viability. The capillary closure pressure of 30 mm Hg, also measured as the compartment pressure, is accepted as that which requires intervention to prevent tissue death.
The circumferential eschar over the torso can lead to significant compromise of chest wall excursions and can hinder ventilation. Abdominal compartment syndrome with visceral hypoperfusion is associated with severe burns of the abdomen and torso. Similarly, airway patency and venous return may be compromised by circumferential burns involving the neck.
Escharotomy is the surgical division of the nonviable eschar, which allows the cutaneous envelope to become more compliant. Hence, the underlying tissues have an increased available volume to expand into, preventing further tissue injury or functional compromise.

==Indications==

Indications for emergency escharotomy are the presence of a circumferential eschar with one of the following:
Neurovascular integrity should similarly be monitored frequently and in a scheduled manner. Capillary refilling time, Doppler signals, pulse oximetry, and sensation distal to the burned area should be checked every hour.4 Limb deep compartment pressures should be checked initially to establish a baseline. Subsequently, any increase in capillary refill time, decrease in Doppler signal, or change in sensation should lead to rechecking the compartment pressures. Compartment pressures greater than 30 mm Hg should be treated by immediate decompression via escharotomy and fasciotomy, if needed.6 A decision-making algorithm is shown in the image below.[tpl]cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/80583-overview#a03 |title=Medscape: Medscape Access |publisher=Emedicine.medscape.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-26[/tpl]
