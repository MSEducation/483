The Schütte-Lanz D.III was a German fighter prototype during World War I. It participated in the first Idflieg D competition at Adlershof, Germany in January and February 1918. It was a conventional single-bay staggered biplane with N-type interplane struts. Of wooden construction with fabric skinning, the D.III revealed an unspectacular performance and production was never continued.
