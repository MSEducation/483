Johannesburg ([tpl]IPAc-en|dʒ|oʊ|ˈ|h|æ|n|ɪ|s|b|ɜr|ɡ[/tpl]; [tpl]IPA-nl|joˈɦɐnəsbœrx|langaf[/tpl]) also known as Jozi, Joburg, Joni, eGoli or Joeys, abbreviated as JHB, is the largest city in South Africa, by population. Johannesburg is the provincial capital of Gauteng, the wealthiest province in South Africa, having the largest economy of any metropolitan region in Sub-Saharan Africa.http://www.fasken.com/johannesburg/ The city is one of the 50 largest urban agglomerations in the world,[tpl]cite web|author= Th.

While Johannesburg is not one of South Africa's three capital cities, it is the seat of the Constitutional Court, which has the final word on interpretation of South Africa's constitution, and is the provincial capital of Gauteng. The city is the source of a large-scale gold and diamond trade, due to its location on the mineral-rich Witwatersrand range of hills.
Johannesburg is served by two international and one domestic airport. O.R. Tambo International Airport, the largest and busiest airport in Africa and a gateway for international air travel to and from the rest of Southern Africa is to the east of the city and Lanseria International Airport to the west. Rand Airport to the south east only handles general aviation flights, though it has the capacity for large jet aircraft.
According to the 2007 Community Survey, the population of the city of Johannesburg was 4,434,827 and the population of the Greater Johannesburg Metropolitan Area was 7,151,447.Community Survey 2007 A broader definition of the Johannesburg metropolitan area, including Ekurhuleni, the West Rand, Soweto and Lenasia, has a population of 10,267,700.[tpl]cite web|title=johannesburg|url=http://www.looking4.co.za/johannesburg.htm|accessdate=11 April 2011[/tpl] The municipal city's land area of [tpl]convert|1645|km2|abbr=on[/tpl] is very large when compared with that of other cities, resulting in a moderate population density of [tpl]convert|2364|/km2|abbr=on[/tpl].
Johannesburg includes Soweto, which was a separate city from the late 1970s until the 1990s. Originally an acronym for "SOuth-WEstern TOwnships", Soweto originated as a collection of settlements on the outskirts of Johannesburg populated mostly by native African workers in the gold-mining industry. Eventually incorporated into Johannesburg, the apartheid government (in power 1948–1994) separated Soweto from the rest of Johannesburg to make it an entirely black-residents area. The area called Lenasia has always been part of the City of Johannesburg. Lenasia is predominantly populated by those of English-speaking Indian ethnicity.

==Etymology==

Controversy surrounds the origin of the name, as there were any number of people with the name "Johannes" who were involved in the early history of the city. Among them are the principal clerk attached to the office of the surveyor-general, Johannes Rissik, Christiaan Johannes Joubert, member of the Volksraad and the Republic's chief of mining, and Paul Kruger, president of the South African Republic (ZAR). Rissik and Joubert were members of a delegation sent to England to attain mining rights for the area. Joubert had a park in the city named after him and Rissik Street is today a main street where the (historically important and dilapidated)[tpl]cite web|last=Davie|first=Lucille|title=Rissik Street Post Office a sad sight|url=http://www.joburgnews.co.za/nov_2002/nov22_po.stm|publisher=Johannesburg News Agency |accessdate=28 July 2010[/tpl] since burnt out[tpl]cite web |last=Davie |first=Lucille |title=Ironies of the post office|url=http://www.joburg.org.za/content/view/4494/266/ |publisher=City of Johannesburg |accessdate=28 July 2010[/tpl] Post Office and City Hall are located.

==History==

The region surrounding Johannesburg was originally inhabited by San people. By the 13th century, groups of Bantu-speaking people started moving southwards from central Africa and encroached on the indigenous San population. By the mid 18th century, the broader region was largely settled by various Sotho–Tswana communities (one linguistic branch of Bantu-speakers), whose villages, towns, chiefdoms and kingdoms stretched from what is now Botswana in the west, to present day Lesotho in the south, to the present day Pedi areas of the northern Transvaal.
More specifically, the stone-walled ruins of Sotho–Tswana towns and villages are scattered around the parts of the former Transvaal in which Johannesburg is situated. The Sotho–Tswana practised farming, raised cattle, sheep and goats, and extensively mined and smelted copper, iron and tin. Moreover, from the early 1960s until his retirement, Professor Revil Mason, of the University of the Witwatersrand, explored and documented many Late Iron Age archaeological sites throughout the Johannesburg area, dating from between the 12th century and 18th century, and many of these sites contained the ruins of Sotho–Tswana mines and iron smelting furnaces, suggesting that the area was being exploited for its mineral wealth before the arrival of Europeans or the discovery of gold. The most prominent site within Johannesburg is Melville Koppies, which contains an iron smelting furnace.Mason, Revil, Origins of Black People of Johannesburg and the Southern Western Central Transvaal, AD 300-1880, Occasional Paper No. 16 of the Archeological Research Unit, University of the Witwatersrand, 1986.
Many Sotho–Tswana towns and villages in the areas around Johannesburg were destroyed and their people driven away during the wars emanating from Zululand during the late 18th and early 19th centuries (the mfecane or difaqane wars), and as a result, an offshoot of the Zulu kingdom, the Ndebele (often referred to by the name the local Sotho–Tswana gave them, the Matebele), set up a kingdom to the northwest of Johannesburg around modern day Rustenburg.
The Dutch speaking Voortrekkers arrived in the early 19th century, driving away the Matebele with the help of Sotho–Tswana allies, establishing settlements around Rustenburg and Pretoria in the early 1830s, and claiming sovereignty over what would become Johannesburg as part of the South African Republic (known informally as the Transvaal Republic).

===Gold rush===

Gold was discovered in the 1880s and triggered the gold rush.
Gold was initially discovered some [tpl]convert|400|km|0|abbr=off[/tpl] to the east of present-day Johannesburg, in Barberton. Gold prospectors soon discovered that there were even richer gold reefs in the Witwatersrand.
Gold was discovered on the Langlaagte farm in 1886. Within months from the discovery, the first settlement at Ferreira's Camp (today the suburb of Ferreirasdorp) was established as a tent camp, which already reached a population of 3,000 by 1887.[tpl]cite book|author1=Andrew M. Reid |author2=Paul J.

When, in November 1886, a portion of the farm Randjeslaagte had been laid out as a village and named Johannesburg, the government took over Ferreira's camp and had it properly surveyed and named Ferreira's Township.[tpl]cite book|author=Gerald Anton Leyds|title=A History of Johannesburg: The Early Years |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=mukQAQAAIAAJ |accessdate=7 May 2013 |year=1964 |publisher=Nasionale Boekhandel Beperk|pages=(from snippet view)[/tpl]
Like many late 19th century mining towns, Johannesburg was a rough and disorganised place, populated by white miners from other continents, African tribesmen recruited to perform unskilled mine work, African women beer brewers who cooked for and sold beer to the black migrant workers, a very large number of European prostitutes, gangsters, impoverished Afrikaners, tradesmen, and Zulu "AmaWasha", Zulu men who surprisingly dominated laundry work.[tpl]cite book|first=Charles|last=van Onselen|title=New Nineveh and New Babylon[/tpl] As the value of control of the land increased, tensions developed between the Boer government in Pretoria and the British, culminating in the Jameson Raid that ended in fiasco at Doornkop in January 1896 and the Second Boer War (1899–1902) that saw British forces under Lord Roberts occupy the city on 30 May 1900 after a series of battles to the south of its then-limits.
Fighting took place at the Gatsrand Pass (near Zakariyya Park) on 27 May, north of Vanwyksrust – today's Nancefield, Eldorado Park and Naturena – the next day, culminating in a mass infantry attack on what is now the waterworks ridge in Chiawelo and Senaoane on 29 May.http://www.defenceweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_remository&Itemid=401&func=select&id=5/
During the war, many African mineworkers left Johannesburg creating a labour shortage, which the mines ameliorated by bringing in labourers from China, especially southern China. After the war, they were replaced by black workers, but many Chinese stayed on, creating Johannesburg's Chinese community, which during the apartheid era, was not legally classified as "Asian," but as "Coloured."
The population in 1904 was 155,642, of whom 83,363 were Whites.Johannesburg. 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica

===Post-Union history===

Major building developments took place in the 1930s, after South Africa went off the gold standard. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, Hillbrow went high-rise. In the 1950s and early 1960s, the apartheid government constructed the massive agglomeration of townships that became known as Soweto. New freeways encouraged massive suburban sprawl to the north of the city. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, tower blocks (including the Carlton Centre and the Southern Life Centre) filled the skyline of the central business district. The central area of the city underwent something of a decline in the 1980s and 1990s, due to the high crime rate and when property speculators directed large amounts of capital into suburban shopping malls, decentralised office parks, and entertainment centres. Sandton City was opened in 1973, followed by Rosebank Mall in 1976, and Eastgate in 1979.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.amethyst.co.za/JhbGuide/Johannesburg.htm|title=History of Johannesburg|publisher=Amethyst.co.za|date=5 April 2003|accessdate=2 July 2010[/tpl]
On 12 May 2008 a series of riots started in the township of Alexandra, in the north-eastern part of Johannesburg, when locals attacked migrants from Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe, killing two people and injuring 40 others. These riots sparked the xenophobic attacks of 2008.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7396868.stm|title=South African mob kills migrants|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 May 2008|date=12 May 2008[/tpl]

==Geography==

Johannesburg is located in the eastern plateau area of South Africa known as the Highveld, at an elevation of [tpl]convert|1753|m|ft[/tpl]. The former CBD is located on the south side of the prominent ridge called the Witwatersrand (Afrikaans: White Water's Ridge) and the terrain falls to the north and south. By and large the Witwatersrand marks the watershed between the Limpopo and Vaal rivers as the northern part of the city is drained by the Jukskei River while the southern part of the city, including most of the CBD, is drained by the Klip River. The north and west of the city has undulating hills while the eastern parts are flatter.
Johannesburg may not be built on a river or harbour, but its streams contribute to two of southern Africa's mightiest rivers – the Limpopo and the Orange. Most of the springs from which many of these streams emanate are now covered in concrete and canalised, accounting for the fact that the names of early farms in the area often end with "fontein", meaning "spring" in Afrikaans. Braamfontein, Rietfontein, Zevenfontein, Doornfontein, Zandfontein and Randjesfontein are some examples. When the first white settlers reached the area that is now Johannesburg, they noticed the glistening rocks on the ridges, running with trickles of water, fed by the streams – giving the area its name, the Witwatersrand, "the ridge of white waters". Another explanation is that the whiteness comes from the quartzite rock, which has a particular sheen to it after rain.Lucille Davie Water, water everyway www.joburg.org.za, 24 December 2004.

==Climate==

Johannesburg is situated on the highveld plateau, and has a subtropical highland climate (Köppen Cwb). The city enjoys a sunny climate, with the summer months (October to April) characterised by hot days followed by afternoon thundershowers and cool evenings, and the winter months (May to September) by dry, sunny days followed by cold nights.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.safarinow.com/cms/johannesburg-gauteng/irie.aspx|title=Johannesburg & Gauteng Weather and Climate |publisher=Safarinow.com |accessdate=14 April 2013[/tpl] Temperatures in Johannesburg are usually fairly mild due to the city's high elevation, with an average maximum daytime temperature in January of [tpl]convert|25.6|C[/tpl], dropping to an average maximum of around [tpl]convert|16|C[/tpl] in June. Winter is the sunniest time of the year, with mild days and cool nights, dropping to [tpl]convert|4.1|C|1[/tpl] in June and July. The temperature occasionally drops to below freezing at night, causing frost. Snow is a rare occurrence, with snowfall having been experienced in the twentieth century during May 1956, August 1962, June 1964 and September 1981. In the twenty-first century, there has been light sleet in 2006, as well as snow proper on 27 June 2007 (accumulating up to [tpl]convert|10|cm[/tpl] in the southern suburbs)[tpl]cite web |author=SABCnews.com |title=Joburg covered by snow as temperature drops |url=http://www.sabcnews.com/south_africa/general/0,2172,151555,00.html |accessdate=16 July 2007 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070629130254/http://www.sabcnews.com/south_africa/general/0,2172,151555,00.html |archivedate=29 June 2007[/tpl] and 7 August 2012.[tpl]cite news |last=Bauer |first=Nickolaus |title=Snow in the city delights Jo'burg residents |url=http://mg.co.za/article/2012-08-07-snow-in-joburg |newspaper=Mail & Guardian|date=7 August 2012[/tpl]
Regular cold fronts pass over in winter bringing very cold southerly winds but usually clear skies. The annual average rainfall is [tpl]convert|713|mm|1[/tpl], which is mostly concentrated in the summer months. Infrequent showers occur through the course of the winter months. The lowest nighttime minimum temperature ever recorded in Johannesburg is [tpl]convert|-8.2|C|1[/tpl], on 13 June 1979. The lowest daytime maximum temperature recorded is [tpl]convert|1.5|C|1[/tpl], on 19 June 1964.[tpl]cite web|url=http://old.weathersa.co.za/Pressroom/2009/Its_cold_in_Gauteng.jsp |title=Johannesburg temperature records |publisher=South African Weather Service |accessdate=8 April 2012[/tpl]

==Cityscape==

The city is often described as Africa's economic powerhouse, and contentiously as a modern and prosperous African city.[tpl]cite news |last=Smith |first=David |title=Johannesburg rebuked over 'world-class city' advert |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jul/11/johannesburg-world-class-city-advert |accessdate=15 July 2013 |newspaper=The Guardian|date=12 July 2013[/tpl] Due to its many different central districts Johannesburg would fall under the multiple nuclei model in human geography terms. It is the hub of South Africa's commercial, financial, industrial, and mining undertakings. Johannesburg is part of a larger urban region. It is closely linked with several other satellite towns. Randburg and Sandton form part of the northern area. The east and west ridges spread out from central Johannesburg. The Central Business District covers an area of [tpl]convert|6|km2|0|abbr=out[/tpl]. It consists of closely packed skyscrapers such as the Carlton Centre, Marble Towers, Trust Bank Building, Ponte City Apartments, Southern Life Centre and 11 Diagonal Street.

===Architecture===

Johannesburg is home to some of Africa's tallest structures, such as the Sentech Tower, Hillbrow Tower and the Carlton Centre. The Johannesburg city skyline has most of the tallest buildings on the continent and contains most international organisations such as IBM, Absa, BHP Billiton, Willis Group, First National Bank, Nedbank and Standard Bank. Many of the city's older buildings have been pulled down and more modern ones built in their place. North of the CBD is Hillbrow, the most densely populated residential area in southern Africa. Northwest of the CBD is Braamfontein, a secondary CBD housing many offices and business premises.

===Parks and gardens===

Parks and gardens in Johannesburg are maintained by Johannesburg City Parks and Zoo.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.jhbcityparks.com/index.php/whoweare |title=Custodians of Joburg's green heritage |publisher=Johannesburg City Parks |accessdate=29 September 2008[/tpl] City Parks is also responsible for planting the city's many green trees, making Johannesburg one of the 'greenest' cities in the world. It has been estimated that there are six million trees in the city – 1.2 million on pavements and sidewalks, and a further 4.8 million in private gardens.We're living in an urban forest – SouthAfrica.info City Parks continues to invest in planting trees, particularly those previously disadvantaged areas of Johannesburg which were not positive beneficiaries of apartheid Johannesburg's urban planning.
Johannesburg Botanical Garden, located in the suburb of Emmarentia, is a popular recreational park.

===Residential areas===

Johannesburg's residential areas range from luxurious, wooded suburbs, to shanty towns and squatter settlements. Alexandra, a township northeast of the city centre, is home to about 125,000 people. It was established by workers who migrated from rural areas in the late 1930s. Since the 1980s, large numbers of people have moved to Johannesburg in search of work. A lack of housing in the city has forced many to set up squatter settlements on the outskirts of the city. Most of these communities lack electricity and running water, and residents live in makeshift shacks made of scrap metal, board, and other discarded materials. In some settlements, such as Phola Park south of Johannesburg, town planners have attempted to build streets and provide residents with basic needs.
