Clearview High School is a public high school located in Lorain, Ohio.  It is part of the Clearview Local School District, one of five school districts serving the city of Lorain and all of Sheffield Township, Ohio.  Clearview High School houses students in grades 9-12.  Formerly, it was named Clearview Junior-Senior High School and housed students in grades 7-12.  After a remodeling project across the district in the early 2000s, grades 7 and 8 moved to Durling Middle School, just northwest of the high school.
Of the five school districts that reside wholly or partially within the city of Lorain, Clearview High School serves the second largest population of Lorain students, with Lorain High School being the largest. The other local school districts are Amherst, Firelands, Vermilion and Eyria.

==CHS History==

Clearview High School was built in 1923 named Highland.
It was 4-8th grades.  The building consisted of six classrooms,
two bathrooms, auditorium/gymnasium and an office.  At
this time Clearview (Highland) was part of the Sheffield Lake
School District.  In 1927 an addition of six more classrooms
were added.
The Clearview Local School District was formed by a petition of
the Lorain County Board Of Education on April 9, 1928.
In 1930 the name was changed to Clearview High School to reflect
the new school district.  Also that year the auditorium/gymnasium
was remodeled and could seat 555 people. The school doubled in size
by adding home ec, manual training and mechanical drawing rooms.  A year later in 1931, the first graduating class of CHS with eleven graduates received their diploma.
Our football field (Tom Hoch Field) was built in 1937.
In 1940 shop classes and a garage was added.
In 1957 a new gymnasium, junior high wing with nine classrooms, cafeteria, music/band room and offices were added.
In 1961 our science wing was added and in 1968 a new library, arts and classrooms were added. On May 5, 1969 a major arson fire was set in the attic of the old 1923 section.  The fire was contained to only the old section, thanks to the fire department and the fire doors which split the old section from the new sections. The damage included the auditorium, hallways, classrooms, study hall, and the roof fell in.http://www.clearview.k12.oh.us/chs/history/1969_5_5fire.html
The newest and last addition was completed in 2004 thanks to the Ohio School Facilities Commission which the school district received about 23 million dollars.  CHS got 10 million dollars to demolish, renovate and expand.  The old sections built in 1923,1927,1930 and 1940 were demolished and made way for new classrooms.  The rest of the school received a major renovation and a new classroom wing was added behind the old junior high wing. Also, central air conditioning was added. A new auditorium, music and band rooms were built.  The old studyhall became the new weight room and the old PPO office and hallway area formed a new room for the wrestling team to practice. The school was made 9-12 only and junior high was placed at the newly formed Durling Middle School.
In 2008 the Frank and Anne Szalay Gymnasium received some additional Clipper pride by replacing the bleachers with new ones that spell out Clearview on the homeside and Clippers on the visitors side. This was accomplished by fundraising efforts.

==Academics==

Clearview High School offers additional educational options to its students.  Students with high GPAs are eligible to attend Lorain County Community College in the Post-Secondary Enrollment Options Program (PSEO).  Juniors and seniors also may attend the Lorain County JVS in Oberlin.  Students attending LCCC or LCJVS are officially Clearview students.  Many students participating in one of these programs splits their day between the high school site and LCCC/LCJVS.
Clearview High School traditionally sends a vast majority of its students for additional education, whether in college, vocational training or enlistment in the military after commencement.  Seniors participate in the High School Recognition Assembly at Clearview High School before commencement exercises are held at the Lorain Palace Theater.
