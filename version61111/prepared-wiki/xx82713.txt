Major auto racing events are usually named Grands Prix (plural form of Grand Prix), a tradition dating back to the first decade of the 20th Century and the Grand Prix motor racing of the 1920s and 1930s. Formally, for a race to be called a Grand Prix, it should have a race distance of at least 300 km.[tpl]cite web|last=Manishin|first=Glenn B.|title=The Early Years|url=http://f1-grandprix.com/?page_id=272|accessdate=24 October 2011|quote=The minimum race distance was reduced from 500 km (311 miles) to 300 km (186 miles), allowing the Monaco Grand Prix to be re-introduced after a two-year interval in 1950[/tpl] This rule can be said for every Grand Prix which was ever on the Formula 1 calendar with the exception of the Monaco Grand Prix – which has had a race distance of less than 300 km since 1968.
