==Campus Renovations==

In 2006, Montour School District officials announced a plan to remodel the buildings of the existing high school campus and preparation for construction officially began in January 2008.  However, financial issues had brought the project to a temporary halt and parts of the building, including one of the tunnels, half of the 11/12 building including the library and the auditorium and band room in the 9/10 building were sealed off from student access, rendering them unusable since the 2007-08 school year.
In 2007, the board approved approved the project at a cost of $49 million.  However, in May 2008, months after preparation had begun, bids for construction came in somewhere from $5 million over budget.  Conflict ensued between PJ Dick, the construction manager, and Graves & McLean, the architect.  By early 2009, those two firms had been replaced by Burns & Scalo and Apostolou & Associates, respectively.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/10035/1033227-57.stm | work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | title=Montour's tumultuous decade | first=Brian | last=David | date=2010-02-04[/tpl]  On July 16, 2009 Apostolou & Associates held a presentation that revealed construction plans, that would, among other changes, connect the 9th/10th and 11th/12th grade buildings and include a new free-standing administration building.[tpl]dead link|date=June 2010[/tpl]  A memorandum released by Apostolou & Associates laid out a timeline that scheduled groundbreaking in May, 2010 and completion in September 2011.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.montourschools.com/education/components/scrapbook/default.php?sectiondetailid=352&linkid=nav-menu-container-4-17&PHPSESSID=d8b8424f2a48040799fb6433edbd79b8 |title=Montour School District - High School Construction |publisher=Montourschools.com |date=2009-09-11 |accessdate=2010-06-12[/tpl]
As the proposed January 2010 groundbreaking date neared, however, school officials had received new information that essentially deemed it unsafe for students to be present during the renovation.  As a result, acting Superintendent Dr. Boyer proposed closing the campus for the 2010-11 school year and completing the renovation in time for the 2011-2012 school year.  Ultimately this plan was approved by the school board.  Consequently, Montour High School was relocated to the grounds of David E. Williams Middle School for the 2010-11 school year.  The scheduled 14-month renovation of the Hilltop campus began in June 2010. The high school renovation was completed in September 2011 in time for the 2011-12 school year.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/10105/1050724-100.stm | work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | title=Montour moving sixth-graders in with high schoolers | first=Brian | last=David | date=2010-04-15[/tpl]
