They began performing in Tokyo in early 1990 and quickly gained notoriety for their psychedelic live performances.  
In 1995, their debut album "DYNAMITE MASTERS BLUES QUARTET" was released.
In 1997, Toru Matsui (guitar) became a member of the band.
In 1999, they contracted with "PARCO/Colomubia" and made their major label debut.
In 2002, they contracted with "avex trax".
In 2004, they were supposed to start their first America tour in June, but Yoshimura left the band just before embarking, and Mana Nishiura (a.k.a. China, formerly of Shonen Knife  became her replacement behind the kit.
In 2005, they contracted with the American label "Estrus/Touch And Go", and toured in the United States.

==Other works==

===Tompei & Bishop===

The rock band which Tompei (Masuko) and Bishop (Matsui) formed.

===Hydro-Guru===

The garage blues unit which Masuko and Yoshimura formed.

===Masuko's work with Boredoms===

In 2004 Masuko became a member of Boredoms, in which he assumes live tuning and maintenance duties of the seven neck guitar instruments Sevena, which he built to Yamantaka Eye's specifications. Shinji has built two versions of this instrument, the first being made of seven Fender Telecaster guitars connected together, and the second being made of seven custom steel guitars. The instrument is played as a percussion instrument by Eye, who either strikes the individual necks of the instrument with drum sticks or strikes many of them at once with a staff. The instruments are connected to a mixing console and are played through a Marshall guitar amp. Due to the ferocity with which Eye plays the instruments, Masuko can be seen behind the Sevenas constantly replacing and tuning broken strings throughout a Boredoms live performance.
