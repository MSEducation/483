==Amami Islands Homeland Restoration Movements==

The "restoration of Ōshima District of Kagoshima Prefecture" was a slogan of the Amami Islands Homeland Restoration Movements during the United States occupation of the Amami Islands from 1945/6 to 1953. An overwhelming majority of people of Amami, including those in mainland Japan, urged the immediate return of the islands to Japan. The homeland restoration movements except those by leftist minorities tried to differentiate Amami from Okinawa because the U.S. seemingly intended permanent control of Okinawa. They opposed the name "Northern Ryukyu" occasionally labeled by the U.S. occupiers. Instead they used "Ōshima District, Kagoshima Prefecture" as a symbol of national belongingness.Takahashi Takayo 高橋孝代, Esunishiti to aidentiti (エスニシティとアイデンティティ), Kyōkai no jinruigaku 境界性の人類学, pp. 165–248, 2006.
