[[Tetrazene]]

CATEGORIES: Nitrogen hydrides

Tetrazene is a chemical compound with the molecular formula N4H4. In IUPAC nomenclature, derivatives of this compound are known collectively as tetrazenes. The most common of such derivatives is tetrazene explosive (commonly known simply as tetrazene), which is used for sensitization of priming compositions. Tetrazenes are suitable as propellants or gas-generating agents thanks to their high thermal stability and low temperature of explosion.

==Properties==

Tetrazene has been reported to have eleven isomers.[tpl]cite journal | author = Li, L.-C.; Shang, J.; Liu, J.-L.; Wang, X.; Wong, N.-B. | title = A G3B3 study of N4H4 isomers | journal = Journal of Molecular Structure | year = 2007 | volume = 807 | issue = 1–3 | pages = 207–10 | doi = 10.1016/j.theochem.2006.12.009 [/tpl] The most stable of these is the straight-chain 2-tetrazine (NH2-N=N-NH2), having a standard heat of formation at 301.3 kJ/mol. The eleven isomers can be arranged into three groups: straight-chain tetrazenes, four-membered cyclotetrazane, and three-membered cyclotriazanes. Each straight-chain tetrazene isomer possesses one N=N double bond and two N-N single bonds. Tautomerizations do occur between the isomers.

===Synthesis===

Functionalized tetrazenes as energetic compounds have been synthesized by the oxidation of hydrazines.[tpl]cite journal | author = Heppekausen, J.; Klapötke, T.; Sproll, S. | title = Synthesis of functionalized tetrazenes as energetic compounds | journal = J. Org. Chem. | year = 2009 | volume = 74 | issue = 6 | pages = 2460–6 | doi = 10.1021/jo802738c | pmid = 19222166 [/tpl] In all cases the product obtained was a colorless solid. The tetrazenes synthesized via this method show no melting points, but extremely sharp decomposition points. This pattern proves that Tetrazene does not change state but will readily break down to form other nitrogen-containing compounds. The sharp decomposition point of tetrazenes is due to the lack of intermolecular interactions.

===Decomposition===

The decomposition of tetrazene is quite rapid around 90°C. A sample of tetrazene was heated in an oven at 90°C and its rate of thermal decomposition was monitored by infrared and ultraviolet spectroscopy.[tpl] cite web | author = Bird, R.; Power, A. | publisher = Department of Defence | location = Melbourne, Victoria | title = Thermal Decomposition of Tetrazene at 90°C | year = 1978 | id = MRL-R-710 AR-000-886 | url = http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a056265.pdf | format = pdf [/tpl] The thermal decomposition reaction is autocatalytic and it is likely that the same reaction can occur at even lower temperatures, however at much slower rates.

===Sensitivity to Friction===

Many explosives are considered to be highly sensitive to mechanical stimuli such as impact, friction, stab, heat, static electricity, flame, etc. Since explosive compounds are subject to friction practically every time they are handled, it is of particular interest to be aware of the sensitivity to friction. The sensitivity of tetrazene was determined using a FSKM-PEx friction sensitivity tester.[tpl]cite journal | author = Matyáš, R.; Šelešovský, J.; Musil, T. | title = Sensitivity to friction for Primary Explosives | journal = Journal of Hazardous Materials | year = 2012 | volume = 213–214 | pages = 236–41 | pmid = 22349715 | doi = 10.1016/j.jhazmat.2012.01.085 [/tpl] The probability of ignition of tetrazene is 100 percent likely at 27N of frictional force.

==Uses==

Tetrazene is often used as an explosive or detonator due to its high reactivity and sensitivity.
Instances of occupational rhinitis dermatitis, and asthma, due to prolonged exposure to tetrazene have been reported.[tpl] cite journal | author = Burge, P. S.; Hendy, M.; Hodgson, E. S. | title = Occupational asthma, rhinitis, and dermatitis due to tetrazene in a detonator manufacturer | journal = Thorax | year = 1984 | volume = 39 | issue = 6 | pages = 470-1 | pmid = 6235620 | pmc = 459834 [/tpl] As with all chemicals it is important to handle with caution, especially knowing there is some risk associated with frictional force and tetrazene.
