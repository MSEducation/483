Prats organised exhibitions for leading Iberian artists such Salvador Dalí, Pablo Picasso, Alexander Calder and his good friend Miró. He was also associated with Paul Klee, Max Ernst, Josep Vicenç Foix and Joan Brossa.
Prats together with Josep Lluis Sert and Joaquim Gomis founded the artistic group ADLAN.

When I grab a stone, it is a Miró."[tpl]cite web|title=Joan Miró|url=http://www.nashersculpturecenter.org/object.aspx?ObjectID=111|publisher=Nasher Sculpture Centre|accessdate=8 October 2011[/tpl]
