[[Bounded quantifier]]

CATEGORIES: Quantification, Proof theory, Computability theory

In the study of formal theories in mathematical logic, bounded quantifiers are often added to a language in addition to the standard quantifiers "∀" and "∃".  Bounded quantifiers differ from "∀" and "∃" in that bounded quantifiers restrict the range of the quantified variable. The study of bounded quantifiers is motivated by the fact that determining whether a sentence with only bounded quantifiers is true is often not as difficult as determining whether an arbitrary sentence is true.
Examples of bounded quantifiers in the context of real analysis include "∀x>0", "∃y0" says "for all x where x is larger than 0", "∃y0 ∃y2)"}} says "every positive number is the square of a negative number".

==Bounded quantifiers in arithmetic==

These quantifiers bind the number variable n and contain a numeric term t which may not mention n but which may have other free variables. (By "numeric terms" here we mean terms such as "1 + 1", "2", "2 × 3", "m + 3", etc.)
There are several motivations for these quantifiers.
In general, a relation on natural numbers is definable by a bounded formula if and only if it is computable in the linear-time hierarchy, which is defined similarly to the polynomial hierarchy, but with linear time bounds instead of polynomial. Consequently, all predicates definable by a bounded formula are Kalmár elementary, context-sensitive, and primitive recursive.

==Bounded quantifiers in set theory==

The semantics of these quantifiers is determined by the following rules:
Bounded quantifiers are important in Kripke-Platek set theory and constructive set theory, where only Δ0 separation is included. That is, it includes separation for formulas with only bounded quantifiers, but not separation for other formulas. In KP the motivation is the fact that whether a set x satisfies a bounded quantifier formula only depends on the collection of sets that are close in rank to x (as the powerset operation can only be applied finitely many times to form a term). In constructive set theory, it is motivated on predicative grounds.
