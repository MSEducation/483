State Line Tack, a division of TABcom, LLC,[tpl]cite web|title=Tabcom Brands|url=http://tabcom.com/overview/[/tpl] is an equine products and supplies retailer. Beginning as a single outlet in Plaistow, New Hampshire in 1980, on the state line between New Hampshire and Massachusetts, State Line Tack converted an old barn into a two story retail tack store.  At that time, it offered the largest selection of horse supplies in a single location nationwide, and offered more reasonably priced lines of inventory than most of its competitors.  It grew into a direct mail catalog retailer within a few years after being purchased by mail order pet supply giant Sporting Dog Specialties. In 1996, PetSmart, Inc. acquired Sporting Dog Specialties and its subsidiary State Line Tack for $45 million mostly paid in company stock, and opened more than 160 full-size (about 3,000 square feet) equine departments inside PetSmart stores. The Plaistow store moved to Salem, New Hampshire, expanding to over [tpl]convert|10000|sqft|m2[/tpl].
In 2007, PetSmart put the State Line Tack name and catalog/internet business up for sale, closing all stores and the Fulfillment Center in Brockport, New York.  In 2007, it became a subsidiary of TABcom, LLC and continues to operate as an online retailer.http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=34758
