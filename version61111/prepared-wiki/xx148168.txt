He was also seen playing the part of a blatantly biased referee in the American Wrestling Association during its last year, most famously in a match between The Trooper and Mike Enos. His character states he is in the Trooper's corner and repeatedly helps the trooper during the match, and the bias is discussed by the announcers after the match.[tpl]YouTube|wLy85lizj5o[/tpl][tpl]YouTube|oL0JtLKsCnM[/tpl]  At one of the final AWA shows, AWA Twin Wars '90 on May 5, 1990, Lurtsema teamed with Brad Rheingans and the Trooper and defeated Tully Blanchard and the Destruction Crew.
