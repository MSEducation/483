==Etymology==

The name "Budapest" is the composition of the city names "Buda" and "Pest", since they were united (together with Óbuda) to become a single city in 1873.Peter Meusburger, Heike Jöns: Transformations in Hungary: Essays in Economy and Society, Springer Verlag, 2001 http://books.google.hu/books?id=EXodLH8brNQC&pg=PA291&dq=budapest+unification+1873&hl=en&sa=X&ei=cksEUdq8JaeD4gSU1IC4Bg&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=budapest%20unification%201873&f=false One of the first occurrences of the combined name "Buda-Pest" was in 1831 in the book "Világ" ("World" / "Light"), written by Count István Széchenyi.Bácskai Vera: Széchenyi tervei Pest-Buda felemelésére és szépítésére[tpl]dead link|date=May 2013[/tpl]
The origins of the words "Buda" and "Pest" are obscure. According to chronicles from the Middle Ages the name "Buda" comes from the name of its founder, Bleda (Buda), the brother of the Hunnic ruler Attila. The theory that "Buda" was named after a person is also supported by modern scholars.Kiss Lajos: Földrajzi nevek etimológiai szótára. Budapest: Akadémiai. 1978. 131–132. An alternative explanation suggests that "Buda" derives from the Slavic word "вода, voda" ("water"), a translation of the Latin name "Aquincum", which was the main Roman settlement in the region.Györffy György, Pest-Buda kialakulása: Budapest története a honfoglalástól az Árpád-kor végi székvárossá alakulásig, Budapest, Akadémiai, 1997, 242.
There are also several theories about the origin of the name "Pest". One of the theoriesGudmund Schütte, Ptolemy's Maps of Northern Europe (The Royal Danish Geographical Society: Copenhagen, 1917). p. 101 claims that the word "Pest" comes from the Roman times, since there was a fortress "Contra-Aquincum" in this region which was referred to as "Pession" ("Πέσσιον", iii.7.§2) by Ptolemaios.William Smith (ed.), A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography (London : I.B. Tauris, 2006) of ed. published: London: John Murray, 1872. According to another theory, "Pest" originates from the Slavic word for cave "пещера, peshchera" or from the word for oven "печь, pech'", in reference to a cave where fires burned or to a local limekiln.[tpl]cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=M1JIPAN-eJ4C | title=Placenames of the World | author=Adrian Room | publisher=McFarland | year=2006 | page=70 | isbn=978-0-7864-2248-7[/tpl] In the old-Hungarian language there was a similar word meaning oven/cave and the original old-German name of this region was also "Ofen". Later, the German "Ofen" referred to the Buda side.

==History==

===Early history===

The first settlement on the territory of Budapest was built by Celts before 1 AD. It was later occupied by the Romans. The Roman settlement - Aquincum - became the main city of Lower Pannonia in 106 AD.  At first it was a military settlement and gradually the city raised around it becoming the focal point of the commercial life. Today this area correspond to the Óbuda district within Budapest.[tpl]cite web|url=http://lovelybudapest.com/en/about-budapest/budapest-attractions.html |title=Association of professional tour guides |publisher=Lovely Budapest |accessdate=21 May 2013[/tpl] The Romans constructed roads, amphitheaters, baths and houses with heated floors in this fortified military camp.[tpl]cite book |last=Sugar |first=Peter F. |title=A History of Hungary |url=http://books.google.com/?id=SKwmGQCT0MAC&pg=PR9&dq=The+Romans+roads,+amphitheaters+Aquincum+%C3%93buda |accessdate=3 June 2008 |year=1990  |publisher= Indiana University Press |isbn= 978-0-253-20867-5 |page=5 |chapter=Hungary before the Hungarian Conquest [/tpl] Acquincum is the foremost and best-conserved of the Roman sites in Hungary. The archeological site was turned into a museum with inside and open-air section.
The peace treaty of 829 added Pannonia to Bulgaria due to the victory of Bulgarian army of Omurtag over the Holy Roman Empire of Louis the Pious. Budapest arose out of two Bulgarian military frontiers, fortresses Buda and Pest, situated on the two banks of Danube.B. Dimitrov, Bulgarians- Civilizers of the slavs, p.48 Hungarians led by Árpád settled in the territory at the end of the 9th century,Molnar, A Concise History of Hungary, Chronology pp. 12 and a century later officially founded the Kingdom of Hungary. Research places the probable residence of the Árpáds as an early place of central power near what became Budapest.Molnar, A Concise History of Hungary, p. 14  The Tatar invasion in the 13th century quickly proved that defence is difficult on a plain. King Béla IV of Hungary therefore ordered the construction of reinforced stone walls around the towns and set his own royal palace on the top of the protecting hills of Buda. In 1361 it became the capital of Hungary.
The cultural role of Buda was particularly significant during the reign of King Matthias Corvinus. The Italian Renaissance had a great influence on the city. His library, the Bibliotheca Corviniana, was Europe's greatest collection of historical chronicles and philosophic and scientific works in the 15th century, and second only in size to the Vatican Library.

Sugar, page 88
The Ottomans pillaged Buda in 1526, besieged it in 1529, and finally occupied it in 1541. The Turkish occupation lasted for more than 140 years. The Turks constructed many fine bathing facilities within the city. Some of the baths that the Turks erected during their occupation period are still in function after 500 years (Rudas baths and Király Baths). Under Ottoman rule many Christians became Muslim. By 1547 the number of Christians was down to about a thousand, and by 1647 it had fallen to only about seventy. The unoccupied western part of the country became part of the Habsburg Empire as Royal Hungary.
In 1686, two years after the unsuccessful siege of Buda, a renewed campaign was started to enter the Hungarian capital. This time, the Holy League's army was twice as large, containing over 74,000 men, including German, Croat, Dutch, Hungarian, English, Spanish, Czech, Italian, French, Burgundian, Danish and Swedish soldiers, along with other Europeans as volunteers, artillerymen, and officers, the Christian forces reconquered Buda, and in the next few years, all of the former Hungarian lands, except areas near Timişoara (Temesvár), were taken from the Turks. In the 1699 Treaty of Karlowitz these territorial changes were officially recognized, and in 1718 the entire Kingdom of Hungary was removed from Ottoman rule. The city was destroyed during the battle. Hungary was then incorporated into the Habsburg Empire.

===Contemporary history after Unification===

1867 was the year of Reconciliation that brought about the birth of Austria-Hungary. The 19th century was dominated by the Hungarian struggle for independence and modernization. The national insurrection against the Habsburgs began in the Hungarian capital in 1848 and was defeated a little more than a year later. This made Budapest the twin capital of a dual monarchy. It was this compromise which opened the second great phase of development in the history of Budapest, lasting until World War I. In 1849 the Chain Bridge linking Buda with Pest was opened as the first permanent bridge across the Danube[tpl]cite book|last=Hughes|first=Holly|title=Frommer's 500 Places to Take Your Kids Before They Grow Up|publisher=Wiley Indianapolis Composition Services|chapter=7 Famous Briges|isbn= 0-470-57760-6|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Wd0znOQhqOwC&pg=PA91&dq=chain+bridge+budapest#v=onepage&q=chain%20bridge%20budapest&f=false|date=13 August 2009[/tpl] and in 1873 Buda and Pest were officially merged with the third part, Óbuda (Ancient Buda), thus creating the new metropolis of Budapest. The dynamic Pest grew into the country's administrative, political, economic, trade and cultural hub. Ethnic Hungarians overtook Germans in the second half of the 19th century due to mass migration from the overpopulated rural Transdanubia and Great Hungarian Plain. Between 1851 and 1910 the proportion of Hungarians increased from 35.6% to 85.9%, Hungarian became the dominant language, and German was crowded out. The proportion of Jews peaked in 1900 with 23.6%.Budapest statisztikai évkönyve 1943 (Statistical Yearbook of Budapest, 1943), p. 33, Hungarian Central Statistical OfficeBudapest székes főváros Statisztikai és Közigazgatási Évkönyve 1921–1924 (Statistical Yearbook of Budapest, 1921–1924), p. 38, Hungarian Central Statistical OfficeBudapest statisztikai évkönyve 1944–1946 (Statistical Yearbook of Budapest, 1944–1946), p. 12, Hungarian Central Statistical Office Due to the prosperity and the large Jewish community of the city at the start of the 20th century, Budapest was often called the "Jewish Mecca"Encyclopædia Britannica 1911, Budapest article or "Judapest".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.judapest.org/faq/ |title=History of the word (Jewish-Hungarian Cultural Site) |language=Hungarian |publisher=Judapest.org |accessdate=21 May 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Jüdische Nachrichten |url=http://buecher.hagalil.com/mandelbaum/budapest.htm |title=Karl Pfeifer: Jüdisches Budapest (Jewish Budapest) |language=German |publisher=Buecher.hagalil.com |date=28 November 2004 |accessdate=21 May 2013[/tpl]
In 1918 Austria-Hungary lost the war and collapsed; Hungary declared itself an independent republic (Republic of Hungary). In 1920 the Treaty of Trianon finalized the country's partition, as a result, Hungary lost over two-thirds of its territory, and about two-thirds of its inhabitants under the treaty, including 3.3 million out of 10 million ethnic Hungarians.[tpl]cite book| last=Macartney| first =C.A.| title=Hungary and her successors - The Treaty of Trianon and Its Consequences 1919–1937| publisher=Oxford University Press| year=1937[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title= East on the Danube: Hungary's Tragic Century|publisher=The New York Times | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B07E3D91531F93AA3575BC0A9659C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=2|date=9 August 2003|accessdate=15 March 2008 | first=Richard | last=Bernstein[/tpl]
In 1944, about one year before the end of World War II, Budapest was partly destroyed by British and American air raids (first attack 4 April 1944,Sydney Morning Herald RAF raids Budapest - second heavy attack, RAF Follows US Raid on Budapest, Budapest bombed by RAF - Bid explosions n Railway Yards). 
From 24 December 1944 to 13 February 1945, the city was besieged during the Battle of Budapest. Budapest suffered major damage caused by the attacking Soviet and Romanian troops and the defending German and Hungarian troops. More than 38,000 civilians lost their lives during the conflict. All bridges were destroyed by the Germans. The stone lions that have decorated the Chain Bridge since 1852 survived the devastation of the war. 
Between 20% and 40% of Greater Budapest's 250,000 Jewish inhabitants died through Nazi and Arrow Cross Party genocide during 1944 and early 1945.[tpl]cite web|title=Budapest|publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |  url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&ModuleId=10005264|accessdate=18 July 2007 [/tpl]  The Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg managed to save the lives of tens of thousands of Jews in Budapest by giving them Swedish passports and taking them under his consular protection."Raoul Wallenberg".

In 1949, Hungary was declared a communist People's Republic (People's Republic of Hungary). The new Communist government considered the buildings like the Buda Castle symbols of the former regime, and during the 1950s the palace was gutted and all the interiors were destroyed (also see Stalin era).
On 23 October 1956, there was a large peaceful demonstration in Budapest demanding democratic changes. The demonstrators went to the Budapest radio station and demanded to publish their demands. The regime ordered to shoot into the crowd. Hungarian soldiers gave rifles to the demonstrators who were now able to capture the building. 
This was the beginning of the Hungarian Revolution. The demonstrators demanded to appoint Imre Nagy to be Prime Minister of Hungary. To their surprise, the central committee of the "Hungarian Working People's Party" did so in the same evening.
This uprising was an anti-Soviet revolt that lasted from 23 October until 11 November. After Nagy had declared Hungary leaving the Warsaw Pact and becoming neutral, Soviet tanks and troops entered the country to crush the revolt. Fighting continued until mid November, leaving more than 3000 dead. A monument was erected at the 50-years anniversary of the revolt in 2006, at the edge of the City Park. Its shape is a wedge with a 56 angle degree made in rusted iron that gradually becomes shiny, ending in an intersection to symbolize Hungarian forces that temporarily eradicated the Communist dictatorship.
From the 1960s to the late 1980s Hungary was often satirically referred to as "the happiest barrack" within the Eastern bloc, and much of the wartime damage to the city was finally repaired. Work on Erzsébet Bridge, the last to be rebuilt, was finished in 1964. In the early 1970s, Budapest Metro's East-West M2 line was first opened, followed by the M3 line in 1976. In 1987, Buda Castle and the banks of the Danube were included in the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites. Andrassy Avenue (including the Millennium Underground Railway, Hősök tere, and Városliget) was added to the UNESCO list in 2002. In the 1980s the city's population reached 2.1 million. In recent times a significant decrease in population occurred mainly due to a massive movement to the neighbouring agglomeration in Pest county.
In the last decades of the 20th century the political changes of 1989–90 (Fall of the Iron Curtain) concealed changes in civil society and along the streets of Budapest. The monuments of the dictatorship were taken down from public places, into Memento Park. In the first 20 years of the new democracy, the development of the city was managed by mayor Gábor Demszky.
