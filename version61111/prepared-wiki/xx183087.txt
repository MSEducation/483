The Edmundston–Madawaska Bridge is an international bridge which connects the cities of Edmundston, New Brunswick in Canada and Madawaska, Maine in the United States, across the Saint John River. The bridge consists of four steel through truss spans, each 70.71 metres (232 feet) in length, for a total length of 287.12 metres (942 feet), which carries a two lane open steel grid deck roadway.
The bridge was first constructed in 1920, replacing a cable ferry, and opened in 1921. Its original asphalt and timber deck was replaced with the current steel grid deck in 1961.
Transport Canada estimated the bridge's traffic at 759,803 vehicles annually in 2006.
