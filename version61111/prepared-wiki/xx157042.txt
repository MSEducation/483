==Description==

With a spire height of [tpl]convert|140|m|ft|0[/tpl] and 40 floors, West Tower is Liverpool’s tallest building, the joint 20th tallest in the United Kingdom (third tallest outside of London) and the 83rd tallest in the European Union. The building commands views across the city, over the Mersey to the Wirral and as far as Blackpool on a clear day. The first five floors are the new headquarters for the Beetham Organization and the remaining floors, apart from the 34th, have been divided into luxury apartments and penthouses. 
However, unlike St. John's Beacon, West Tower has no antennas on the roof. Therefore when considering height including antennas, West Tower is the highest building in Liverpool.
The five floors of Beetham’s offices are set back between concrete columns and are fully glazed to provide an "animated façade" at street level.  A glazed lift and stair serving the office are accommodated between raking fins with views to the river. 
The 127 apartments are clad in a fully glazed perimeter curtain wall of random clear and opaque panels and are orientated to provide views of both the city and river. The upper penthouse floors are tiered back to incorporate external terraces behind glazed balustrade screens. 
The 34th floor is home to Britain's highest restaurant, Panoramic.City to boast Britain's highest restaurant, Liverpool Daily Post, accessed 31 May 2007  This floor is completely clad in a clear glass perimeter offering diners views of the city of Liverpool and further afield.
