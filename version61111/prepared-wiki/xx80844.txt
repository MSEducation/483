==History==

In 1971,  Warren Eisenberg and Leonard Feinstein opened up a store in Northern New Jersey called Bed 'n Bath. By 1985, Eisenberg and Feinstein were operating 17 stores in the New York metropolitan area and California. Also in 1985, the first superstore was opened, as an attempt to surge ahead of emerging competitors such as Linens 'n Things, Pacific Linens, and Luxury Linens. In order to properly represent the size increase in its retail stores, the company changed its name to Bed Bath & Beyond.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/bed-bath-beyond-inc-history/ |title=History of Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. |publisher=FundingUniverse |accessdate=October 27, 2013[/tpl]
