[[Sir Tommy]]

CATEGORIES: Solitaire card games

Sir Tommy is a solitaire card game using a deck of 52 playing cards. It is said to be the earliest card building games and belongs to the same family of card building games as Calculation and Strategy. It is also known as Try Again, Old Patience and Numerica.
Cards are dealt one at a time. When an ace turns up, it forms a foundation and is built up to King regardless of suit. Four such foundations should be built. A card that cannot yet be placed on the foundation is placed onto one of four wastepiles; once placed, it cannot be moved. The top cards of each wastepile are available to be placed on the foundations.David Parlett (1980) The Penguin Book of Patience ISBN 0-14046-346-1
The game is won if all cards are emptied from the wastepiles and built on the foundations. It is said that for this to be done successfully, one waste pile should be reserved for Kings and other high cards.
