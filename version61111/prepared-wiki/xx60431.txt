Pikachu is regarded as a major character of the Pokémon franchise and has become an icon of Japanese culture in recent years.
Pikachu evolves from a Pichu when it levels up with high friendship, and evolves into a Raichu with a "Thunder Stone".

==Concept and design==

Developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo, the Pokémon series began in Japan in 1996, and features several species of creatures called "Pokémon" that players, called "trainers", are encouraged to capture, train, and use to battle other players' Pokémon or interact with the game's world.[tpl]cite manual |author = Game Freak |title = Pokémon Red and Blue, Instruction manual |publisher = Nintendo  |date =1998-09-30 |pages=6–7[/tpl][tpl]cite manual |author = Game Freak |title = Pokémon Red and Blue, Instruction manual |publisher = Nintendo  |date =1998-09-30 |page=11[/tpl] Pikachu was one of several different Pokémon designs conceived by Game Freak's character development team and finalized by artist Ken Sugimori.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/interview/irbj/vol1/index2.html |title=2. 一新されたポケモンの世界 |page=2 |work=Nintendo.com |publisher=Nintendo |accessdate=2010-09-10 |author=Staff |language=Japanese[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=91965 |title=Game Freak on Pokémon! |author=Stuart Bishop |publisher=CVG |date=2003-05-30 |accessdate=2008-02-07|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5VSJaR6xT|archivedate=2008-02-08[/tpl] According to series producer Satoshi Tajiri, the name is derived from a combination of two Japanese sounds: pika, a sound an electric spark makes, and chu, a sound a mouse makes.[tpl]cite journal |journal=Time Asia |url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/99/1122/pokemon6.fullinterview2.html |accessdate=September 25, 2009 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100501090040/http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/99/1122/pokemon6.fullinterview2.html |archivedate=2010-05-10 |date=November 22, 1999|volume=154 |issue=20 |page=2 |title=The Ultimate Game Freak[/tpl] Developer Junichi Masuda noted Pikachu's name as one of the most difficult to create, due to an effort to make it appealing to both Japanese and American audiences.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gamepro.com/article/previews/209340/pokemon-platinum-developer-interview-pt-2/ |work=GamePro |title=Pokemon Platinum: Developer Interview! |date=2009-03-23 |accessdate=2009-06-09 |author=Noble, McKinley|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090327224428/http://www.gamepro.com/article/previews/209340/pokemon-platinum-developer-interview-pt-2/|archivedate=2009-03-27[/tpl]
Standing 1 ft 4 in (0.4m) tall, Pikachu are mouse-like creatures, and were the first "Electric-type" Pokémon created, their design intended to revolve around the concept of electricity.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nintendo.co.jp/nom/0007/gfreak/page06.html|title=『ポケットモンスター』スタッフインタビュー|publisher=Nintendo|language=Japanese|accessdate=June 6, 2009[/tpl] They appear as mouse-like creatures that have short, yellow fur with brown markings covering their backs and parts of their lightning bolt shaped tails. They have black-tipped, pointed ears and red circular pouches on their cheeks, which can spark with electricity. In Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, gender differences were introduced; a female Pikachu now has an indent at the end of its tail, giving it a heart-shaped appearance. They attack primarily by projecting electricity from their bodies at their targets. Within the context of the franchise, a Pikachu can transform, or "evolve" into a Raichu when exposed to a "Thunderstone". In later titles an evolutionary predecessor was introduced named "Pichu", which evolves into a Pikachu after establishing a close friendship with its trainer.
Initially both Pikachu and the Pokémon Clefairy were chosen to be lead characters for the franchise merchandising, with the latter as the primary mascot to make the early comic book series more "engaging". However with the production of the animated series, Pikachu was chosen as the primary mascot, in an attempt to appeal to female viewers and their mothers, and under the belief that the creature presented the image of a recognizable intimate pet for children. Its color was also a deciding factor, as yellow is a primary color and easier for children to recognize from a distance, and with consideration to the fact the only other competing yellow mascot at the time was Winnie-the-Pooh.[tpl]cite book |last=Tobin |first=Joseph Jay |year=2004 |title=Pikachu's Global Adventure: The Rise and Fall of Pokémon |publisher=Duke University Press |pages=65–66 |isbn=0-8223-3287-6[/tpl] Though Tajiri acknowledged that the character was relatively popular with both boys and girls, the idea of Pikachu as the mascot was not his own, and stated he felt the human aspect of the series was overlooked by Japanese children who embraced Pikachu by itself more readily.[tpl]cite journal |journal=Time Asia |url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/99/1122/pokemon6.fullinterview2.html |accessdate=September 25, 2009 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100501090040/http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/99/1122/pokemon6.fullinterview1.html |archivedate=2010-05-10 |date=November 22, 1999|volume=154 |issue=20 |page=1 |title=The Ultimate Game Freak[/tpl]

===In the anime===

The Pokémon anime series and films feature the adventures of Ash Ketchum and his Pikachu, traveling through the various regions of the Pokémon universe. They are accompanied by a group of alternating friends, including Misty, Brock, May, Max, Tracey, Dawn, Iris and Cilan.
In the first episode, Ash receives his Pikachu from Professor Oak as his starting Pokémon. New trainers are given a starting Pokémon; in Ash's homeland of Kanto this is often Charmander, Squirtle, or Bulbasaur, but Ash slept in and got Pikachu instead. At first, Pikachu largely ignores Ash's requests, shocking him frequently and refusing to be confined to the conventional method of Pokémon transportation, a Poké Ball. However, Ash puts himself in danger to defend Pikachu from a flock of wild Spearow,[tpl]cite episode |title=Pokémon - I Choose You! |series=Pokémon |credits=Takeshi Shudō (writer) |network=Various |airdate=September 8, 1998 |season=Indigo League|number=1[/tpl] then rushes the electric mouse to a Pokémon Center. Through these demonstrations of respect and unconditional commitment to Pokémon, Pikachu warms up to Ash, and their friendship is formed. However, it still refuses to go into its Poké Ball. Soon after, Pikachu shows great power that sets it apart from Pokémon, and other Pikachu, which causes Team Rocket to constantly attempt to capture it in order to win favor from their boss, Giovanni.[tpl]cite episode |title = Pokémon Emergency! |series = Pokémon |credits = Shinzō Fujita (writer) |network = Various |airdate = September 9, 1998 |season = Indigo League|number = 2[/tpl] Only once had Ash almost released Pikachu, and that was in the episode Pikachu's Goodbye, because Ash thought Pikachu would be happier living in a colony of wild Pikachu, but Pikachu chose him instead.[tpl]cite episode |title = Pikachu's Goodbye |series = Pokémon |credits = Junki Takegami (writer) |network = Various |airdate = November 20, 1998 |season = Indigo League|number = 37[/tpl] Pikachu also has his very own segment in the first two seasons called "Pikachu's Jukebox", which included songs from 2.B.A. Master.
Other wild and trained Pikachu appear throughout the series, often interacting with Ash and his Pikachu.
