==Career==

===1978–1993===

After leaving the university, Neeson returned to Ballymena where he worked in a variety of casual jobs, from a fork-lift operator at Guinness to a truck driver. He also attended teacher training college for two years in Newcastle upon Tyne, before again returning to his hometown. In 1976, Neeson joined the Lyric Players' Theatre in Belfast where he performed for two years. He got his first film experience in 1977, playing Jesus Christ and Evangelist in the religious film Pilgrim's Progress. Neeson moved to Dublin in 1978 after he was offered a part in Ron Hutchinson's Says I, Says He, a drama about The Troubles, at the Project Arts Centre. He acted in several other Project productions and joined the Abbey Theatre (the National Theatre of Ireland).
In 1980, filmmaker John Boorman saw him on stage as Lennie Small in Of Mice and Men and offered him the role of Sir Gawain in the Arthurian film, Excalibur. After Excalibur, Neeson moved to London, where he continued working on stage, in small budget films and in television. He lived with the actress Helen Mirren at this time, whom he met working on Excalibur.[tpl]cite web|title=Neeson Easy: Tall, Dark and Phantom|work=Elle (UK)|last=McHugh|first=Fionnuala|date=September 1988[/tpl] Between 1982 and 1987, Neeson starred in five films; most notably alongside Mel Gibson and Anthony Hopkins in 1984's The Bounty and Robert De Niro and Jeremy Irons in 1986's The Mission. He also guest-starred in the third season of the television series Miami Vice in 1986.
In 1987, Neeson moved to Hollywood to star in high-profile roles. That year, he starred alongside Cher and Dennis Quaid in Suspect in a role that brought him critical acclaim. In 1990, he followed this with a starring role in Darkman. Although the film was successful, Neeson's subsequent years would not bring him the same recognition. In 1993, he joined Ellis Island co-star and future wife Natasha Richardson in the Broadway play Anna Christie. They also worked together in Nell, released the following year. He recited the Van Morrison song "Coney Island" on the 1994 Van Morrison tribute album No Prima Donna: The Songs of Van Morrison. A single was also released with Neeson's version.

===Schindler's List===

Director Steven Spielberg offered Neeson the role of Oskar Schindler in the film about the Holocaust, Schindler's List,[tpl]cite web|title=Liam -Neeson|work=Newsday|last=de Vries|first=Hilary|date=3 July 1993[/tpl] after seeing him in Anna Christie on Broadway.

Neeson read the Keneally book and concluded that his character "enjoyed fookin'[tpl]sic[/tpl] with the Nazis. In Keneally's book, it says he was regarded as a kind of a buffoon by them... if the Nazis were New Yorkers, he was from Arkansas. They don't quite take him seriously, and he used that to full effect."[tpl]cite news | title = Oskar Winner | work = Entertainment Weekly | date = 21 January 1994 | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,300807_2,00.html | accessdate=8 August 2007[/tpl]
His critically acclaimed performance earned him a nomination for a Best Actor Oscar, and helped the film earn Best Picture of 1993. However, the best actor award went to Tom Hanks for his performance in Philadelphia. Neeson also garnered BAFTA and Golden Globes nominations for his work as Oskar Schindler. Soon after these accolades, Neeson became a very in-demand leading actor. He starred in the subsequent period pieces Rob Roy (1995) and Michael Collins (1996), the latter earning him a win for Best Starring Role at the Venice Film Festival and another Golden Globe nomination. He went on to star as Jean Valjean in the 1998 adaptation of Victor Hugo's Les Misérables and in The Haunting (1999) as Dr. David Marrow.

===Star Wars===

In 1999, Neeson starred as Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn in Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace.

A heavy smoker earlier in his career, Neeson quit smoking in 2003, while working on Love Actually, this can be seen because in some scenes he has a toothpick in his mouth, his method for quitting. When he took the role of Hannibal for the 2010 film adaptation of The A-Team, Neeson had reservations about smoking cigars (which is a signature trait of the character) in the film due to being an ex-smoker, but agreed to keep that personality trait of Hannibal intact for the film.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ptcchallenge.com/article-viewer.aspx?id=257 |title=The A Team |publisher=PTC Challenge |date=1 June 2010 |accessdate=1 January 2012[/tpl] In August 2009, Neeson stated on ABC's Good Morning America that he had been naturalised as a United States citizen.[tpl]Cite news| title = Actor Neeson becomes US citizen|publisher=BBC News| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/8223680.stm | date=26 August 2009 | accessdate=5 January 2010[/tpl] Neeson is a fan of Liverpool FC.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1167515/Grieving-Liam-Neeson-looks-downcast-leaves-The-Ivy-alone.html|title=Grieving Liam Neeson looks downcast as he leaves The Ivy alone|date=6 April 2009|work=Daily Mail |location=London |accessdate=22 February 2011[/tpl] In March 2011, he was appointed a Goodwill Ambassador for UNICEF.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/people/people_58133.html |title=Liam Neeson becomes UNICEF's newest Goodwill Ambassador|first=Chris|last=Niles|publisher=UNICEF |date=29 March 2011|accessdate=30 June 2013[/tpl]
In June 2012, reports that Neeson was converting to Islam were denied by his publicist. However, he has expressed an affection for the Islamic calls to prayer that he grew used to while filming Taken 2 in Istanbul: "By the third week, it was like I couldn't live without it. It really became hypnotic and very moving for me in a very special way. Very beautiful."[tpl]cite web|url=http://ukscreen.com/articles/interviews/is-liam-neeson-converting-to-islam/ |title=Is Liam Neeson converting to Islam? |publisher=UKScreen |date=1 October 2012 |accessdate=30 June 2013[/tpl] He has also expressed admiration for the Spiritual Exercises of Saint Ignatius of Loyola.[tpl]cite web|last=Blaney|first=Retta|title=Acting Is a Form of Prayer|publisher=BeliefNet|url=http://www.beliefnet.com/story/133/story_13350_1.html|accessdate=16 July 2007[/tpl]

==Honours and awards==

Neeson was offered the "Freedom of the Town of Ballymena" by Ballymena Borough Council, but because of objections made by members of the Democratic Unionist Party regarding his comments that he had felt like a "second-class citizen" growing up as a Catholic in the town, he declined the award, citing tensions.[tpl]cite news|title=Neeson refuses hometown honour|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/685970.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=20 January 2012|date=21 March 2000[/tpl] Following the controversy, Neeson wrote a letter to the council, stating; "I will always remain very proud of my upbringing in, and association with, the town and my country of birth, which I will continue to promote at every opportunity. Indeed I regard the enduring support over the years from all sections of the community in Ballymena as being more than sufficient recognition for any success which I may have achieved as an actor."Liam Neeson arrives in Ballymena to receive award".
