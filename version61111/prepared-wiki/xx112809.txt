[[Toxic Twins]]

CATEGORIES: Aerosmith, Songwriting teams

The Toxic Twins is a nickname given to lead singer Steven Tyler and lead guitarist Joe Perry of American hard rock band Aerosmith. They were given that name in the 1970s, due to their rampant use of drugs both on and off stage, which was a "toxic" combination that almost ended their careers and their lives.
To this day, they are still commonly referred to by this nickname, despite coming clean and maintaining sobriety for over 20 years. Their camaraderie can be viewed in several of the band's videos, such as The Making of Pump, Big Ones You Can Look At, and You Gotta Move.
An accomplished songwriting duo, the Toxic Twins are often referred to as the "Tyler/Perry" partnership in songwriting and have written over 85 songs together. In 2013, Tyler and Perry were recipients of the ASCAP Founders Award[tpl]cite web|title=Steven Tyler and Joe Perry to Receive ASCAP Founders Award at 30th annual Pop Music Awards|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/steven-tyler-joe-perry-receive-422964|publisher=Hollywood Reporter|date=2013-02-21|accessdate=2013-02-23[/tpl] and were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.[tpl]cite web|title=Steven Tyler and Joe Perry Picked for Songwriters Hall of Fame|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/steven-tyler-and-joe-perry-picked-for-songwriters-hall-of-fame-20130222|publisher=Rolling Stone|date=2013-02-22|accessdate=2013-02-23[/tpl]
