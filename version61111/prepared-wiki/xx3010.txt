Edinburgh has been recognised as the capital of Scotland since at least the 15th century, but political power moved south to London after the Union of the Crowns in 1603 and the Union of Parliaments in 1707. After nearly three centuries of unitary government, a measure of self-government returned in the shape of the devolved Scottish Parliament, which officially opened in Edinburgh in 1999. The city is also home to many national institutions such as the National Museum of Scotland, the National Library of Scotland and the Scottish National Gallery. Edinburgh's relatively buoyant economy, traditionally centred on banking and insurance but now encompassing a wide range of businesses, makes it the biggest financial centre in the UK after London.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.edinburgh-inspiringcapital.com/invest/why_invest_in_edinburgh/global_financial_centre.aspx|title=Edinburgh – A global financial centre |publisher=Edinburgh District Council |accessdate=13 October 2013[/tpl] Many Scottish companies have established their head offices in the city.
Edinburgh is rich in associations with the past and has many historic buildings, including Edinburgh Castle, Holyrood Palace, the churches of St. Giles, Greyfriars and the Canongate, and an extensive Georgian New Town built in the 18th century. Edinburgh's Old Town and New Town are listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.edinburgh.org/about/about-edinburgh/world-heritage-site |title=Edinburgh-World Heritage Site |accessdate=10 February 2013 |publisher=VisitScotland[/tpl] The city has long been known abroad as a centre of education, particularly in the fields of medicine, Scots law, the sciences and engineering. The University of Edinburgh, founded in 1583 and now one of four in the city, was placed 17th in the QS World University Rankings in 2013.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ed.ac.uk/home |title= The University of Edinburgh |accessdate=30 September 2013[/tpl] The city is also famous for the Edinburgh International Festival, which, since its inception in 1947, has grown – largely as a result of the "Fringe" and other associated events – into the biggest annual international arts festival in the world. In 2004 Edinburgh became the world's first UNESCO City of Literature, an accolade awarded in recognition of its literary heritage and lively literary activities in the present.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cityofliterature.com/index.aspx?sec=1&pid=1 |title=City of Literature |publisher=cityofliterature.com |accessdate=27 February 2013[/tpl] The city's historical and cultural attractions, together with an annual calendar of events aimed primarily at the tourist market, have made it the second most popular tourist destination in the United Kingdom, attracting over one million overseas visitors each year .[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-13264345 |title=Edinburgh second in TripAdvisor UK tourism poll |accessdate=16 March 2013 |work=BBC News Online |date=3 May 2011[/tpl]

==Etymology==

"Edin", the root of the city's name, is most likely of Brittonic Celtic origin, from the Cumbric language or a variation of it that would have been spoken by the earliest known people of the area, an Iron Age tribe known to the Romans as the Votadini, and latterly in sub-Roman history as the Gododdin. It appears to derive from the place name Eidyn mentioned in the Old Welsh epic poem Y Gododdin.[tpl]Cite book |title=The Beginnings of Welsh Poetry: Studies |last=Williams |first=Ifor |authorlink=Ifor Williams |year=1972 |publisher=University of Wales Press |isbn=0-7083-0035-9 |page=47[/tpl][tpl]Cite book |title=The British Heroic Age: the Welsh and the Men of the North |last=Chadwick |first=Nora K. |authorlink=Nora Kershaw Chadwick |year=1968 |publisher=University of Wales Press |isbn=0-7083-0465-6 |page=107[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal |last1=Dumville |first1= David |year=1994 |title=The eastern terminus of the Antonine Wall: 12th or 13th century evidence |journal=Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland |volume=124 |issue= |pages=293–98[/tpl]

==History==

===Early history===

The earliest known human habitation in the Edinburgh area is from Cramond where evidence was found of a Mesolithic camp-site dated to c. 8500 BC.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.archaeologyuk.org/ba/ba60/news.shtml | title = Earliest evidence found of settlers in Scotland: hazelnuts and stone tools excavated near Edinburgh date to around 8500 BC | accessdate = 31 October 2013[/tpl] Traces of later Bronze Age and Iron Age settlements have been found on Castle Rock, Arthur's Seat, Craiglockhart Hill and the Pentland Hills.[tpl]cite book |last=Coghill |first=Hamish  |title=Lost Edinburgh |year=2008 |publisher=Birlinn Ltd |isbn=1-84158-747-8 |pages=1–2[/tpl]
By the time the Romans arrived in Lothian at the end of the 1st century AD, they discovered a Celtic Britonnic tribe whose name they recorded as the Votadini.[tpl]cite book |last=Ritchie |first=J. N.

Although its exact location has not been identified, it seems more than likely they would have chosen a commanding position like the Castle Rock or Arthur's Seat or Calton Hill.[tpl]cite book |last=Fraser|first=James |authorlink=James E.

In 638 AD the Gododdin stronghold was besieged by forces loyal to King Oswald of Northumbria, and around this time control of Lothian passed to the Angles. Their influence continued for the next three centuries until around 950 AD, when, during the reign of Indulf, son of Constantine II, the "burh" (fortress), named in the 10th-century Pictish Chronicle as "oppidum Eden",[tpl]cite book|last=Watson |first=William |title=The Celtic Place Names of Scotland |year=1926 |isbn=1-906566-35-6 |page=340[/tpl] fell to the Scots and thenceforth remained under their jurisdiction.[tpl]cite book |last=Lynch |first=Michael |title=The Oxford Companion to Scottish History |year=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-923482-0 |page=658[/tpl]

In 1603, King James VI of Scotland succeeded to the English throne, uniting the crowns of Scotland and England in a personal union known as the Union of the Crowns, though Scotland remained, in all other respects, a separate kingdom.[tpl]cite book |last=Donaldson |first=Gordon |title=Scottish Kings |year=1967 |publisher=Batsford  |isbn= |page=213[/tpl] In 1638, King Charles I's attempt to introduce Anglican church forms in Scotland encountered stiff Presbyterian opposition culminating in the conflicts of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms.[tpl]cite book |last=Newman |first=P R |title=Companion to the English Civil Wars |year=1990 |publisher=Facts on File Ltd |location=Oxford |isbn=0-8160-2237-2 |page=13[/tpl] Subsequent Scottish support for Charles Stuart's restoration to the throne of England resulted in Edinburgh's occupation by Oliver Cromwell's Commonwealth of England forces – the New Model Army – in 1650.[tpl]cite book |page=587 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=an-eXXA3DBMC |title=The Concise Encyclopedia of the Revolutions and Wars of England, Scotland, and Ireland, 1639–1660 |author=Stephen C.

In the 17th century, the boundaries of Edinburgh were still defined by the city's defensive town walls. As a result, expansion took the form of the houses increasing in height to accommodate a growing population. Buildings of 11 storeys or more were common,[tpl]Cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BFkLAAAAYAAJ |title=Notices of the most remarkable fires in Edinburgh, from 1385 to 1824 |accessdate=17 February 2013 |last=Chambers |first=Robert[/tpl] and have been described as forerunners of the modern-day skyscraper.[tpl]cite book |last =Wilson |first =Neil |title=Edinburgh Encounter |publisher= |series = | page=37 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ygf59UOCPfQC&pg=PA37&dq=edinburgh+old+town+skyscraper&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Ox4YUe_ADOSa0QWfjoGQBQ&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=skyscrapers&f=false|isbn=1-74179-306-8[/tpl] Most of these old structures were later replaced by the predominantly Victorian buildings seen in today's Old Town.

In 1706 and 1707, the Acts of Union were passed by the Parliaments of England and Scotland uniting the two kingdoms into the Kingdom of Great Britain.[tpl]cite book |last=Scott |first=Paul |title=1707: the Union of Scotland and England |year=1979 |publisher=Chambers |isbn=0-550-20265-X |pages=51–54[/tpl] As a consequence, the Parliament of Scotland merged with the Parliament of England to form the Parliament of Great Britain, which sat at Westminster in London.

From the 1770s onwards, the professional and business classes gradually deserted the Old Town in favour of the more elegant "one-family" residences of the New Town, a migration that changed the social character of the city.

===19th and 20th centuries===

Although Edinburgh's traditional industries of printing, brewing and distilling continued to grow in the 19th century and were joined by new rubber works and engineering works there was little industrialisation compared with other cities in Britain. By 1821, Edinburgh had been overtaken by Glasgow as Scotland's largest city.[tpl]cite book |last1=Pryde |first1=George Smith |title=Scotland from 1603 to the present day |year=1962 |publisher=Nelson |isbn= |page=141 |quote=Population figures for 1801 – Glasgow 77,385; Edinburgh 82,560; for 1821 – Glasgow 147,043; Edinburgh 138,325[/tpl] The city centre between Princes Street and George Street became a major commercial and shopping district, a development partly stimulated by the arrival of railways in the 1840s.

University building developments which transformed the George Square and Potterrow areas proved highly controversial.[tpl]cite book |last=Coghill |first=H|title=Lost Edinburgh |year=2008 |publisher=Birlinn Ltd.|location=Edinburgh |isbn=978-1-84158-747-9 |pages=219–220[/tpl]
Since the 1990s a new "financial district", including a new Edinburgh International Conference Centre, has grown mainly on demolished railway property to the west of the castle, stretching into Fountainbridge, a run-down 19th-century industrial suburb which has undergone radical change since the 1980s with the demise of industrial and brewery premises.

In 1998, the Scotland Act, which came into force the following year, established a devolved Scottish Parliament and Scottish Executive (renamed the Scottish Government since July 2012). Both based in Edinburgh, they are responsible for governing Scotland while reserved matters such as defence, taxation and foreign affairs remain the responsibility of the Parliament of the United Kingdom in London.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/46 |title=Scotland Act 1998 |date=19 November 1998 |accessdate=15 March 2013[/tpl]

==Geography==

===Cityscape===

Edinburgh is situated in Scotland's Central Belt and lies on the southern shore of the Firth of Forth. The city centre is [tpl]convert|2.5|mi|km[/tpl] south west of the shoreline of Leith and [tpl]convert|26|mi|km[/tpl] inland, as the crow flies, from the east coast of Scotland and the North Sea at Dunbar.[tpl]cite map |title=Geographia Atlas of the World |year=1984 |publisher=Geographia Ltd |location=London |isbn=0-09-202840-3 |page=99[/tpl] While the early burgh grew up in close proximity to the prominent Castle Rock, the modern city is often said to be built on seven hills, namely Calton Hill, Corstorphine Hill, Craiglockhart Hill, Braid Hill, Blackford Hill, Arthur's Seat and the Castle Rock,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.seven-hills.org.uk/course.asp |title=Seven Hills of Edinburgh |accessdate=28 February 2013 |publisher=VisitScotland[/tpl] giving rise to allusions to the seven hills of Rome.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.scotland.org/features/voltaire-said |title=Voltaire said: Athens of the North |publisher=Scotland.org |date=September 2003 |accessdate=28 March 2013[/tpl]
Occupying, in geological terms, a narrow gap between the Firth of Forth to the north and the Pentland Hills and their outrunners to the south, the city sprawls over a landscape which is the product of early volcanic activity and later periods of intensive glaciation.
[tpl]cite book |last1=Edwards |first1=Brian |last2=Jenkins |first2=Paul |title=Edinburgh: The Making of a Capital City |year=2005 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |isbn=0-7486-1868-6 |pages=64–65[/tpl] Igneous activity between 350 and 400 million years ago, coupled with faulting, led to the creation of tough basalt volcanic plugs, which predominate over much of the area. One such example is the Castle Rock which forced the advancing icesheet to divide, sheltering the softer rock and forming a mile-long tail of material to the east, thus creating a distinctive crag and tail formation. Glacial erosion on the north side of the crag gouged a deep valley later filled by the now drained Nor Loch. These features, along with another hollow on the south side of the rock, formed an ideal natural strongpoint upon which Edinburgh Castle was built. Similarly, Arthur's Seat is the remains of a volcano dating from the Carboniferous period, which was eroded by a glacier moving west to east during the ice age. Erosive action such as plucking and abrasion exposed the rocky crags to the west before leaving a tail of deposited glacial material swept to the east.[tpl]Cite book|author=Stuart Piggott |title=Scotland before History |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |year=1982 |isbn=0-85224-470-3[/tpl] This process formed the distinctive Salisbury Crags, a series of teschenite cliffs between Arthur's Seat and the location of the early burgh.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.landforms.eu/Lothian/sill.htm |title=Sill |accessdate=29 March 2013 |publisher=landforms.eu[/tpl] The residential areas of Marchmont and Bruntsfield are built along a series of drumlin ridges south of the city centre, which were deposited as the glacier receded.
Other prominent landforms such as Calton Hill and Corstorphine Hill are similarly products of glacial erosion. The Braid Hills and Blackford Hill are a series of small summits to the south west of the city commanding expansive views looking northwards over the urban area to the Forth.
Edinburgh is drained by the river named the Water of Leith, which rises at the Colzium Springs in the Pentland Hills and runs for [tpl]Convert|29|km|mi[/tpl] through the south and west of the city, emptying into the Firth of Forth at Leith.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.scottish-places.info/features/featurefirst2805.html |title=Overview of the Water of Leith |accessdate=19 April 2009 |publisher=Gazetteer for Scotland, Institute of Geography, University of Edinburgh[/tpl] The nearest the river gets to the city centre is at Dean Village on the north-western edge of the New Town, where a deep gorge is spanned by Thomas Telford's Dean Bridge, built in 1832 for the road to Queensferry. The Water of Leith Walkway is a mixed use trail that follows the course of the river for [tpl]convert|19.6|km|mi|1[/tpl] from Balerno to Leith.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.waterofleith.org.uk/walkway/ |title=The Water of Leith Walkway |accessdate=19 April 2009 |publisher=Water of Leith Conservation Trust[/tpl]
Excepting the shoreline of the Firth of Forth, Edinburgh is encircled by a green belt, designated in 1957, which stretches from Dalmeny in the west to Prestongrange in the east.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2004/08/19785/41543 |title=Review of Green Belt policy in Scotland – Edinburgh and Midlothian |date=11 August 2004 |accessdate=10 April 2009 |publisher=Scottish Government[/tpl] With an average width of [tpl]convert|3.2|km|mi|0[/tpl] the principal objectives of the green belt were to contain the outward expansion of the city and to prevent the agglomeration of urban areas. Expansion affecting the green belt is strictly controlled but developments such as Edinburgh Airport and the Royal Highland Showground at Ingliston lie within the zone. Similarly, outlying suburbs such as Juniper Green and Balerno are situated on green belt land. One feature of the Edinburgh green belt is the inclusion of parcels of land within the city which are designated green belt, even though they do not connect with the peripheral ring. Examples of these independent wedges of green belt include Holyrood Park and Corstorphine Hill.

===Areas===

Edinburgh is divided into distinct areas that retain much of their original character as settlements in existence before they were absorbed into the sprawling city of the nineteenth century.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.edinburghguide.com/areas |title=Edinburgh Areas |publisher=edinburghguide.com |accessdate=9 February 2013[/tpl] Many residences are tenements, although the more southern and western parts of the city have traditionally been more affluent with a greater number of detached and semi-detached villas.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.timeout.com/edinburgh/features/146/edinburgh-area-guide |title=Edinburgh area guide |publisher=timeout.com |accessdate=9 February 2013[/tpl]
The historic centre of Edinburgh is divided in two by the broad green swath of Princes Street Gardens. To the south the view is dominated by Edinburgh Castle, built high on the castle rock, and the long sweep of the Old Town descending towards Holyrood Palace. To the north lie Princes Street and the New Town.
The West End includes the financial district, with insurance and banking offices as well as the Edinburgh International Conference Centre.
The Old and New Towns of Edinburgh were listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1995 in recognition of the unique character of the Old Town with its medieval street layout and the planned Georgian New Town, including the adjoining Dean Village and Calton Hill areas. There are over 4,500 listed buildings within the city, a higher proportion relative to area than any other city in the United Kingdom.
The Old Town runs downhill and terminates at Holyrood Palace. Minor streets (called closes or wynds) lie on either side of the main spine forming a herringbone pattern.[tpl]cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/728 |title=Old and New Towns of Edinburgh |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=9 February 2013[/tpl] The street has several fine public buildings such as the church of St Giles, the City Chambers and the Law Courts. Other places of historical interest nearby are Greyfriars Kirkyard and the Grassmarket. The street layout is typical of the old quarters of many northern European cities.
The castle perches on top of a rocky crag (the remnant of an extinct volcano) and the Royal Mile runs down the crest of a ridge from it. Due to space restrictions imposed by the narrowness of this landform, the Old Town became home to some of the earliest "high rise" residential buildings. Multi-storey dwellings known as lands were the norm from the 16th century onwards with ten and eleven storeys being typical and one even reaching fourteen or fifteen storeys.

The New Town was an 18th-century solution to the problem of an increasingly crowded city which had been confined to the ridge sloping down from the castle. In 1766 a competition to design a "New Town" was won by James Craig, a 27-year-old architect.[tpl]cite journal |author=Cruft, Kitty |title=James Craig 1739–1795: Correction of his Date of Birth |journal=Book of the Old Edinburgh Club |volume=New Series Vol. 5 |pages=pp.103–5[/tpl] The plan was a rigid, ordered grid, which fitted in well with Enlightenment ideas of rationality. The principal street is George Street, running along the natural ridge to the north of what became known as the "Old Town". To either side of it are two other main streets: Princes Street and Queen Street. Princes Street has become the main shopping street in Edinburgh and now has few of its original Georgian buildings. The three main streets are connected by a series of streets running perpendicular to them. The east and west ends of George Street are terminated by St Andrew Square and Charlotte Square respectively. The latter, designed by Robert Adam, influenced the architectural style of the New Town into the early 19th century.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/architectsactive.pdf|title=Scottish Architects Homecoming|publisher=Historic Scotland|accessdate=18 January 2011[/tpl] Bute House, the official residence of the First Minister of Scotland, is on the north side of Charlotte Square.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.edinburghguide.com/venue/butehouse |title=Bute House |publisher=edinburghguide.com |accessdate=9 February 2013[/tpl]
The hollow between the Old and New Towns was formerly the Nor Loch, which was originally created for the town's defence but came to be used by the inhabitants for dumping their sewage. It was drained by the 1820s as part of the city's northward expansion. Craig's original plan included an ornamental canal on the site of the loch, but this idea was abandoned.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/from-monks-on-strike-to-dove-s-dung-1-881129|title=From monks on strike to dove's dung |publisher=scotsman.com |accessdate=9 February 2013[/tpl] Soil excavated while laying the foundations of buildings in the New Town was dumped on the site of the loch to create the slope connecting the Old and New Towns known as The Mound.
In the middle of the 19th century the National Gallery of Scotland and Royal Scottish Academy Building were built on The Mound, and tunnels for the railway line between Haymarket and Waverley stations were driven through it.
The Southside is a popular residential part of the city, which includes the districts of St Leonards, Marchmont, Newington, Sciennes, the Grange and Blackford. The Southside is broadly analogous to the area covered formerly by the Burgh Muir, and grew in popularity as a residential area after the opening of the South Bridge in the 1780s. The Southside is particularly popular with families (many state and private schools are here), young professionals and students (the central University of Edinburgh campus is based around George Square just north of Marchmont and the Meadows), and Napier University (with major campuses around Merchiston and Morningside). The area is also well provided with hotel and "bed and breakfast" accommodation for visiting festival-goers. These districts often feature in works of fiction. For example, Church Hill in Morningside, was the home of Muriel Spark's Miss Jean Brodie,

The urban area of Edinburgh is almost entirely contained within the City of Edinburgh Council boundary, merging with Musselburgh in East Lothian. Towns within easy reach of the city boundary include Dalkeith, Bonnyrigg, Loanhead, Newtongrange, Prestonpans, Tranent, Penicuik, Haddington, Livingston, Broxburn and Dunfermline. According to the European Statistical agency, Eurostat, Edinburgh lies at the heart of a Larger Urban Zone covering [tpl]convert|1724|km2|sqmi[/tpl] with a population of 778,000.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.urbanaudit.org/CityProfiles.aspx?CityCode=UK007C&CountryCode=UK |title=Urban Audit City Profiles – Edinburgh |accessdate=31 January 2009 |publisher=Eurostat[/tpl]

===Climate===

Like most of Scotland, Edinburgh has a temperate, maritime climate which is relatively mild despite its northerly latitude.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/es/ |title=Regional Climate – Eastern Scotland |accessdate=19 April 2009 |publisher=Met Office[/tpl] Winter daytime temperatures rarely fall below freezing and are milder than places such as Moscow, and Newfoundland which lie at similar latitudes. Summer temperatures are normally moderate, rarely exceeding [tpl]convert|22|C[/tpl]. The highest temperature ever recorded in the city was [tpl]convert|31.4|C[/tpl] on 4 August 1975 at Turnhouse Airport. The lowest temperature recorded in recent years was [tpl]convert|-14.6|C[/tpl] during December 2010 at Gogarbank.
The proximity of the city to the sea mitigates any large variations in temperature or extremes of climate. Given Edinburgh's position between the coast and hills, it is renowned as "the windy city", with the prevailing wind direction coming from the south west, which is frequently associated with warm, unstable air from the North Atlantic Current that can give rise to rainfall – although considerably less than cities to the west, such as Glasgow. Rainfall is distributed fairly evenly throughout the year. Winds from an easterly direction are usually drier but considerably colder, and may be accompanied by haar, a persistent coastal fog. Vigorous Atlantic depressions, known as European windstorms, can affect the city between October and May.

==Demography==

===Current===

At the United Kingdom Census 2011, Edinburgh had a population of 476,626, showing a rise of 6.2% since 2001. This makes Edinburgh the second largest city in Scotland after Glasgow and the seventh largest in Britain. Edinburgh lies at the heart of a Larger Urban Zone with a population of 778,000.
Edinburgh has a high proportion of young adults, with 19.5% of the population in their 20s (exceeded only by Aberdeen) and 15.2% in their 30s which is the highest in Scotland. The proportion of Edinburgh's population who were born in the UK fell from 92% to 84% between 2001 and 2011, while the proportion born in Scotland fell from 78% to 70%. Of those Edinburgh residents born in the UK, 335,000 or 83% were born in Scotland, with 58,000 or 14% being born in England.http://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/11895/census_2011-ethnicity_and_related_themes_ethnic_group_country_of_birth_national_identity_religion_languages_etc
The proportion of people born outside the UK was 15.9% comparing with 8% in 2001. Countries accounting for the largest number of Edinburgh citizens born overseas are: Poland (13,000), Republic of Ireland (8,603), China (8,076), India (6,470), Pakistan (5,858), United States (3,700), Germany (3,500), Australia (2,100), France (2,000) Spain (2,000), South Africa (1,800) and Canada (1,800). 47% of the non-UK born population in Edinburgh is of European origin, which is amongst the highest for any city in the UK.
Some 13,000 people or 2.7% of the city's total population are Polish. 39,500 people or 8.2% of Edinburgh's population class themselves as Non-White which is an increase from 4% in 2001. Of the Non-White population, the largest group by far are Asian, totalling 26,264 people. Within the Asian population, the Chinese are now the largest sub-group, with 8,076 people, amounting to about 1.7% of the city's total population. The city's Indian population amounts to 6,470 (1.4% of the total population), while there are some 5,858 Pakistanis (1.2% of the total population). Although they account for only 1,277 people or 0.3% of the city's population, Edinburgh has the highest number and proportion of Bangladeshis in Scotland. Over 7,000 people were born in African countries (1.6% of the total population) and nearly 7,000 in the Americas. With the notable exception of Inner London, Edinburgh has a higher number of people born in the United States (over 3,700) than any other city in the UK.

===Historical===

A census conducted by the Edinburgh presbytery in 1592 recorded a population of 8,003 adults spread equally north and south of the High Street which runs along the spine of the ridge sloping down from the Castle.[tpl]cite book |last=Lynch |first=Michael |title=The Oxford Companion to Scottish History |url= |accessdate= |year=2001 |publisher=OUP Oxford |location= |isbn=0-19-969305-6 |page=219 |pages=[/tpl] In the 18th and 19th centuries, the population expanded rapidly, rising from 49,000 in 1751 to 136,000 in 1831, primarily due to migration from rural areas.[tpl]cite book |title=Edinburgh: The Making of a Capital City |last1=Edwards |first1=Brian |last2=Jenkins |first2=Paul |year=2005 |isbn=0-7486-1868-6  |publisher= |page= 9[/tpl] As the population grew, problems of overcrowding in the Old Town, particularly in the cramped tenements that lined the present day Royal Mile and the Cowgate, were exacerbated. Poor sanitary arrangements resulted in a high incidence of disease, with outbreaks of cholera occurring in 1832, 1848 and 1866.[tpl]cite book |last=Gilbert (ed.)|first=W M |title=Edinburgh in the Nineteenth Century |year=1967 |publisher=J & R Allan Ltd. |location=Edinburgh |year=1901 |pages=95, 120, 140[/tpl]
The construction of the New Town from 1767 onwards witnessed the migration of the professional and business classes from the difficult living conditions in the Old Town to the lower density, higher quality surroundings taking shape on land to the north.

Early 20th century population growth coincided with lower-density suburban development. As the city expanded to the south and west, detached and semi-detached villas with large gardens replaced tenements as the predominant building style. Nonetheless, the 2001 census revealed that over 55% of Edinburgh's population were still living in tenements or blocks of flats, a figure in line with other Scottish cities, but much higher than other British cities, and even central London.[tpl]cite web|url=http://download.edinburgh.gov.uk/Census_2001_City_Comparisons/CCTable4Dwellings.pdf |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20090318032701/http://download.edinburgh.gov.uk/Census_2001_City_Comparisons/CCTable4Dwellings.pdf|archivedate=18 March 2009|title=Edinburgh Comparisons – Dwellings |accessdate=8 February 2009 |publisher=City of Edinburgh Council[/tpl]
From the early to mid 20th century the growth in population, together with slum clearance in the Old Town and other areas, such as Dumbiedykes, Leith, and Fountainbridge, led to the creation of new estates such as Stenhouse and Saughton, Craigmillar and Niddrie, Pilton and Muirhouse, Piershill, and Sighthill.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.localhistories.org/edinburgh.html |title=A BRIEF HISTORY OF EDINBURGH, SCOTLAND |accessdate=9 February 2013 |publisher=localhistories.org[/tpl]
