===Washington Redskins===

====2007 Season====

At the beginning of the 2007 season, Landry was immediately named the starting strong safety opposite Pro Bowl free safety Sean Taylor.  The combination at the safety position would be known to Redskins fans as "Area 51", a name derived from the combination of the numbers "21" and "30", the numbers of Taylor and Landry respectively.[tpl]cite web|url=http://misterirrelevant.com/index.php/2007/08/31/sean-taylor-laron-landry-area-51/ |title=Sean Taylor + LaRon Landry = ‘Area 51′ | Mr. Irrelevant, a D.C.

He recorded his first half sack in just the second week of the season and recorded his first unassisted sack on November 4 during a week 9 game against the New York Jets after a clean, full force hit behind the line of scrimmage on quarterback Kellen Clemens.  He recorded his first interception in a Wild Card Playoff game versus the Seattle Seahawks, in which he recorded five tackles and two interceptions.
Taylor suffered an injury which kept him out of action in Week 11 and 12, and Landry was moved to the free safety position in his place. After Taylor was murdered at his home in Miami on November 27, Landry remained in the free safety position across from strong safety Reed Doughty.  Landry started all 16 games, recording 95 total tackles (65 solo tackles, 32 assisted tackles), 1.5 sacks and six passes deflected.  His impressive rookie season earned him a 2007 Pro Bowl alternate selection and was selected to the 2007 NFL All-Rookie Defensive Team.  He also became the first Redskins rookie defensive player to start all 16 games since Champ Bailey in 1999.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.redskins.com/gen/players/LaRon_Landry.jsp |title=LaRon Landry |publisher=Redskins.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20[/tpl]
