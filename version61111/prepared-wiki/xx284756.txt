Moribund the Burgermeister is a song by British progressive rock musician Peter Gabriel. It is the B-side to his 1977 single Solsbury Hill, and it is the first track on his 1977 eponymous debut album. The song is about a nervous disorder called Sydenham's chorea that causes rapid jerking movements in its victims. Saint Vitus claimed to have had a cure for the disease. Gabriel had the idea for the song after reading a book about Middle Age epidemics.[tpl]cite web|title=Moribund The Burgermeister by Peter Gabriel|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=750|work=Songfacts|accessdate=12 August 2013[/tpl]
