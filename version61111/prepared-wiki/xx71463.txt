The woolly flying squirrel (Eupetaurus cinereus) is the sole species placed in the genus Eupetaurus.  Until recently scientific knowledge of this rare species was limited to 11 skins collected in the late nineteenth century.  However, recent research has confirmed that it remains in Pakistani Kashmir.  It is the longest member of the family Sciuridae and the biggest gliding animal known, but observations confirm that despite its size, it does glide effectively like other flying squirrels.

==Distribution and description==

Eupetaurus has been recorded in northern Pakistan in the area around Gilgit.  These areas include Chitral, Astor.  Other specimens have been purchased from a bazaar in Tibet, collected in Tibet, and collected in Yunnan, China.  Since 1994, specimens have been captured in the Sai Valley, Gorabad, and Balti Gali, all in northern Pakistan (Zahler and Woods, 1997).  In 2004, the animal was videotaped by Dinets in Raikot Valley near Nanga Parbat, Pakistan. The preferred habitat appears to be high elevation conifer forests associated with cliffs and caves.
The woolly flying squirrel is very large for a flying squirrel (head and body = [tpl]convert|45|â€“|60|cm|in[/tpl]). The cheek teeth are unique as they are both flat-crowned and high crowned (hypsodont), setting Eupetaurus apart from other squirrels and suggesting that it feeds on very abrasive plant material, including pine needles (Zahler and Khan, 2003).  The animal has fur that is long and thick, with a grizzled pattern that gives the appearance of a woolly pelage, thus the name.

==Relationships==

The woolly flying squirrel is unique among the flying squirrels. This is particularly true of its large size and its unique dentition.  This led a few early researchers to go so far as to create a distinct family.  Some of their arguments were based on poorly drawn and labeled diagrams of the cranium and lower jaw. Zahler and Woods (1997) suggest instead that Eupetaurus is closely related to another genus of large flying squirrels, Petaurista.
