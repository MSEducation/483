These cells predominantly occur in skin, but are also found in other parts of the body, including the bowel and the eye (see uveal melanoma). Melanoma can originate in any part of the body that contains melanocytes.
Melanoma is less common than other skin cancers. However, it is much more dangerous if it is not found in the early stages. It causes the majority (75%) of deaths related to skin cancer.[tpl]cite journal |author=Jerant AF, Johnson JT, Sheridan CD, Caffrey TJ |title=Early detection and treatment of skin cancer |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=62 |issue=2 |pages=357–68, 375–6, 381–2 |date=July 2000 |pmid=10929700 |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/20000715/357.html [/tpl]  Worldwide, doctors diagnose about 160,000 new cases of melanoma yearly.

The treatment includes surgical removal of the tumor. If melanoma is found early, while it is still small and thin, and if it is completely removed, then the chance of cure is high. The likelihood that the melanoma will come back or spread depends on how deeply it has gone into the layers of the skin. For melanomas that come back or spread, treatments include chemo- and immunotherapy, or radiation therapy. According to the World Health Organization, about 48,000 melanoma-related deaths occur worldwide per year.[tpl]cite book |author=Lucas, Robyn; McMichael, Tony; Smith, Wayne; Armstrong, Bruce |title=Solar Ultraviolet Radiation: Global burden of disease from solar ultraviolet radiation |publisher=World Health Organization |year=2006 |isbn=92-4-159440-3 |series=Environmental Burden of Disease Series |volume=13 |url=http://www.who.int/uv/health/solaruvradfull_180706.pdf |format=PDF[/tpl]

==Signs and symptoms==

Early signs of melanoma are changes to the shape or color of existing moles or, in the case of nodular melanoma, the appearance of a new lump anywhere on the skin (such lesions should be referred without delay to a dermatologist). At later stages, the mole may itch, ulcerate or bleed.MelanomaWarningSigns.com  Early signs of melanoma are summarized by the mnemonic "ABCDE":
These classifications do not, however, apply to the most dangerous form of melanoma, nodular melanoma, which has its own classifications:
Metastatic melanoma may cause nonspecific paraneoplastic symptoms, including loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting and fatigue. Metastasis of early melanoma is possible, but relatively rare: less than a fifth of melanomas diagnosed early become metastatic. Brain metastases are particularly common in patients with metastatic melanoma.[tpl]cite journal |author=Fiddler IJ |title=Melanoma metastasis |journal=Cancer Control |volume=2 |issue=5 |pages=398–404 |date=October 1995 |pmid=10862180 |url=http://www.moffitt.usf.edu/pubs/ccj/v2n5/article3.html[/tpl]  It can also spread to the liver, bones, abdomen or distant lymph nodes.

==Cause==

In general, cancers are caused by damage to DNA.Bernstein C, Prasad AR, Nfonsam V, Bernstein H.  (2013). DNA Damage, DNA Repair and Cancer, New Research Directions in DNA Repair, Prof. Clark Chen (Ed.), ISBN 978-953-51-1114-6, InTech, http://www.intechopen.com/books/new-research-directions-in-dna-repair/dna-damage-dna-repair-and-cancer  Melanomas are usually caused by DNA damage resulting from exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light from the sun.  Ultraviolet UVB light (wavelengths between 315 – 280 nm) from the sun is absorbed by skin cell DNA and results in a type of direct DNA damage called cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs)  (i.e. thymine-thymine, cytosine-cytosine or cytosine-thymine dimers that are formed by the joining of two adjacent pyrimidine bases within a strand of DNA).  Somewhat similarly to UVB, UVA light (longer wavelengths between 400 – 315 nm) from the sun or from tanning beds can also be directly absorbed by skin DNA (at about 100 to 1000 fold lower efficiency than UVB is absorbed).[tpl]cite journal |author=Rünger TM, Farahvash B, Hatvani Z, Rees A |title=Comparison of DNA damage responses following equimutagenic doses of UVA and UVB: a less effective cell cycle arrest with UVA may render UVA-induced pyrimidine dimers more mutagenic than UVB-induced ones |journal=Photochem.

If unrepaired, CPD photoproducts can lead to mutations by inaccurate translesion synthesis during DNA replication or repair.  The most frequent mutations due to inaccurate synthesis past CPDs are cytosine to thymine (C>T) or CC>TT transition mutations. These are commonly referred to as UV fingerprint mutations, as they are the most specific mutation caused by UV, being frequently found in sun-exposed skin but rarely found in internal organs.[tpl]cite journal |author=Budden T, Bowden NA |title=The Role of Altered Nucleotide Excision Repair and UVB-Induced DNA Damage in Melanomagenesis |journal=Int J Mol Sci |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=1132–51 |year=2013 |pmid=23303275 |pmc=3565312 |doi=10.3390/ijms14011132 |url=[/tpl]  Errors in DNA repair of UV photoproducts, or inaccurate synthesis past these photoproducts, can also lead to deletions, insertions and chromosomal translocations.
The entire genomes of 25 melanomas were sequenced (not only the protein-coding regions of the genome which are just 1% of the genome).[tpl]cite journal |author=Berger MF, Hodis E, Heffernan TP, Deribe YL, Lawrence MS, Protopopov A, Ivanova E, Watson IR, Nickerson E, Ghosh P, Zhang H, Zeid R, Ren X, Cibulskis K, Sivachenko AY, Wagle N, Sucker A, Sougnez C, Onofrio R, Ambrogio L, Auclair D, Fennell T, Carter SL, Drier Y, Stojanov P, Singer MA, Voet D, Jing R, Saksena G, Barretina J, Ramos AH, Pugh TJ, Stransky N, Parkin M, Winckler W, Mahan S, Ardlie K, Baldwin J, Wargo J, Schadendorf D, Meyerson M, Gabriel SB, Golub TR, Wagner SN, Lander ES, Getz G, Chin L, Garraway LA |title=Melanoma genome sequencing reveals frequent PREX2 mutations |journal=Nature |volume=485 |issue=7399 |pages=502–6 |date=May 2012 |pmid=22622578 |pmc=3367798 |doi=10.1038/nature11071 |url=[/tpl]  On average, there were about 80,000 mutated bases (mostly C>T transitions) and about 100 structural rearragements per melanoma genome.

===Genetics===

A number of rare mutations, which often run in families, are known to greatly increase one's susceptibility to melanoma. Several different genes have been identified as increasing the risk of developing melanoma. Some rare genes have a relatively high risk of causing melanoma; some more common genes, such as a gene called MC1R that causes red hair, have a relatively lower elevated risk.  Genetic testing can be used to determine whether a person has one of the currently known mutations.
One class of mutations affects the gene CDKN2A. An alternative reading frame mutation in this gene leads to the destabilization of p53, a transcription factor involved in apoptosis and in fifty percent of human cancers. Another mutation in the same gene results in a nonfunctional inhibitor of CDK4, a cyclin-dependent kinase that promotes cell division. Mutations that cause the skin condition xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) also seriously predispose one to melanoma. Scattered throughout the genome, these mutations reduce a cell's ability to repair DNA. Both CDKN2A and XP mutations are highly penetrant (meaning that the chances of a person carrying the mutation to express the phenotype is very high).
Familial melanoma is genetically heterogeneous,[tpl]Cite journal| author = Greene MH. | title = The genetics of hereditary melanoma and nevi | journal = Cancer | volume = 86 | issue = 11 | pages = 2464–77 | year = 1998 | pmid = 10630172 | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19991201)86:11 [/tpl] and loci for familial melanoma have been identified on the chromosome arms 1p, 9p and 12q.

Other mutations confer lower risk, but are more prevalent in the population. People with mutations in the MC1R gene, for example, are two to four times more likely to develop melanoma than those with two wild-type (typical unaffected type) copies of the gene. MC1R mutations are very common; in fact, all people with red hair have a mutated copy of the gene. Mutation of the MDM2 SNP309 gene is associated with increased risk of melanoma in younger women.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Firoz for Cancer Research |first1=EF |last2=Warycha |first2=M |last3=Zakrzewski |first3=J |last4=Pollens |first4=D |last5=Wang |first5=G |last6=Shapiro |first6=R |last7=Berman|first7=R |last8=Pavlick |first8=A |last9=Manga |first9=P |last10=Ostrer |first10=H. |last11=Celebi |first11=J.

===UV radiation===

The UV radiation from tanning beds increases the risk of melanoma.[tpl]cite journal|last=Boniol|first=M|author2=Autier, P|author3= Boyle, P|author4= Gandini, S|title=Cutaneous melanoma attributable to sunbed use: systematic review and meta-analysis.|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|date=Jul 24, 2012|volume=345|pages=e4757|pmid=22833605|pmc=3404185|doi=10.1136/bmj.e4757[/tpl] The International Agency for Research on Cancer finds that tanning beds are "carcinogenic to humans" with people who begin using tanning devices before age 30 are 75% more likely to develop melanoma.[tpl]Cite journal |author=WHO International Agency for Research on Cancer Monograph Working Group |title=A Review of Human Carcinogens—Part D:Radiation |journal=The Lancet Oncology|date = August 2009| volume=10| issue=8| pages=751–2| doi=10.1016/S1470-2045(09)70213-X| pmid=19655431[/tpl]
In a study scientists reveal that the dose of UV radiation is deciding factor and can lead to a different pathway.  The p16 pathway is favored at low doses of UV radiation and results in cell-cycle arrest, to the contrary; the p53 pathway is more responsive to higher doses and induces apoptosis depending on p53 mutation status.[tpl]cite journal|last=Abd Elmageed|first=Zakaria Y|author2=Gaur, Rajiv L|author3=Williams, Mandy|author4=Abdraboh, Mohamed E|author5=Rao, Prakash N|author6=Raj, Madhwa H G|author7=Ismail, Fathi M|author8= Ouhtit, Allal|title=Characterization of Coordinated Immediate Responses by p16INK4A and p53 Pathways in UVB-Irradiated Human Skin Cells|journal=Journal of Investigative Dermatology|date=21 August 2008|volume=129|issue=1|pages=175–183|doi=10.1038/jid.2008.208|pmid=18719612[/tpl]

==Pathophysiology==

The earliest stage of melanoma starts when the melanocytes begin to grow out of control. Melanocytes are found between the outer layer of the skin (the epidermis) and the next layer (the dermis). This early stage of the disease is called the radial growth phase, and the tumor is less than 1 mm thick. Because the cancer cells have not yet reached the blood vessels lower down in the skin, it is very unlikely that this early-stage cancer will spread to other parts of the body. If the melanoma is detected at this stage, then it can usually be completely removed with surgery.
When the tumor cells start to move in a different direction — vertically up into the epidermis and into the papillary dermis — the behaviour of the cells changes dramatically.
The next step in the evolution is the invasive radial growth phase, which is a confusing term; however, it explains the next step in the process of the radial growth, when individual cells start to acquire invasive potential. This step is important – from this point on the melanoma is capable of spreading. The Breslow's depth of the lesion is usually less than [tpl]convert|1|mm|2|abbr=on|lk=out[/tpl], the Clark level is usually 2.
The following step in the process is the invasive melanoma — the vertical growth phase (VGP). The tumor attains invasive potential, meaning it can grow into the surrounding tissue and can spread around the body through blood or lymph vessels. The tumor thickness is usually more than [tpl]convert|1|mm|2|abbr=on|lk=out[/tpl], and the tumor involves the deeper parts of the dermis.
The host elicits an immunological reaction against the tumor (during the VGP),[tpl]cite journal |title=ASCO Annual Meeting Proceedings Part I. Abstract: Protective effect of a brisk tumor infiltrating lymphocyte infiltrate in melanoma: An EORTC melanoma group study |journal=Journal of Clinical Oncology |volume=25 |issue=18S |page=8519 |year=2007|url=http://www.asco.org/ascov2/Meetings/Abstracts?&vmview=abst_detail_view&confID=47&abstractID=34439[/tpl] which is judged by the presence and activity of the tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). These cells sometimes completely destroy the primary tumor; this is called regression, which is the latest stage of the melanoma development. In certain cases, the primary tumor is completely destroyed and only the metastatic tumor is discovered.  About 40% of human melanomas contain activating mutations affecting the structure of the B-Raf protein, resulting in constitutive signaling through the Raf to MAP kinase pathway.[tpl]Cite journal | last = Davies | first = M A |author2=Samuels, Y | title = Analysis of the genome to personalize therapy for melanoma | journal = Oncogene | volume = 29 | issue = 41 | pages = 5545–5555 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20697348 |doi = 10.1038/onc.2010.323 | pmc = 3169242 [/tpl]

==Diagnosis==

Visual diagnosis of melanomas is still the most common method employed by health professionals.[tpl]cite journal |author=Wurm EM, Soyer HP |title=Scanning for melanoma |date=October 2010 |journal=Australian Prescriber |issue=33 |pages=150–5 |url=http://www.australianprescriber.com/magazine/33/5/150/5[/tpl] Moles that are irregular in color or shape are often treated as candidates of melanoma. To detect melanomas (and increase survival rates), it is recommended to learn what they look like (see "ABCDE" mnemonic below), to be aware of moles and check for changes (shape, size, color, itching or bleeding) and to show any suspicious moles to a doctor with an interest and skills in skin malignancy.[tpl]cite web |title=Prevention: ABCD's of Melanoma |publisher=American Melanoma Foundation |url=http://www.melanomafoundation.org/prevention/abcd.htm[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal| author = Friedman R, Rigel D, Kopf A | title = Early detection of malignant melanoma: the role of physician examination and self-examination of the skin | journal = CA Cancer J Clin | volume = 35 | issue = 3 | pages = 130–51 | year = 1985| pmid = 3921200 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/canjclin.35.3.130/abstract | doi = 10.3322/canjclin.35.3.130[/tpl]
A popular method for remembering the signs and symptoms of melanoma is the mnemonic "ABCDE":
A weakness in this system is the diameter. Many melanomas present themselves as lesions smaller than 6 mm in diameter; and all melanomas were malignant on day 1 of growth, which is merely a dot. An astute physician will examine all abnormal moles, including ones less than 6 mm in diameter.  Seborrheic keratosis may meet some or all of the ABCD criteria, and can lead to false alarms among laypeople and sometimes even physicians. An experienced doctor can generally distinguish seborrheic keratosis from melanoma upon examination, or with dermatoscopy.
Some advocate the system "ABCDE",AAD.org with E for evolution. Certainly moles that change and evolve will be a concern.  Alternatively, some refer to E as elevation. Elevation can help identify a melanoma, but lack of elevation does not mean that the lesion is not a melanoma. Most melanomas are detected in the very early stage, or in-situ stage, before they become elevated. By the time elevation is visible, they may have progressed to the more dangerous invasive stage.
Nodular melanomas do not fulfill these criteria, having their own mnemonic, "EFG":
A recent and novel method of melanoma detection is the "ugly duckling sign".SkinCancer.org[ref][tpl]cite journal |author=Mascaro JM, Mascaro JM |title=The dermatologist's position concerning nevi: a vision ranging from "the ugly duckling" to "little red riding hood" |journal=Arch Dermatol |volume=134 |issue=11 |pages=1484–5 |date=November 1998 |pmid=9828892 |url=http://archderm.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9828892 |doi=10.1001/archderm.134.11.1484[/tpl]
[/ref]  It is simple, easy to teach, and highly effective in detecting melanoma. Simply, correlation of common characteristics of a person's skin lesion is made. Lesions which greatly deviate from the common characteristics are labeled as an "Ugly Duckling", and further professional exam is required. The "Little Red Riding Hood" sign suggests that individuals with fair skin and light-colored hair might have difficult-to-diagnose amelanotic melanomas. Extra care and caution should be rendered when examining such individuals, as they might have multiple melanomas and severely dysplastic nevi. A dermatoscope must be used to detect "ugly ducklings", as many melanomas in these individuals resemble non-melanomas or are considered to be "wolves in sheep clothing".Dermnetnz.org  These fair-skinned individuals often have lightly pigmented or amelanotic melanomas which will not present easy-to-observe color changes and variation in colors. The borders of these amelanotic melanomas are often indistinct, making visual identification without a dermatoscope very difficult.
Amelanotic melanomas and melanomas arising in fair-skinned individuals (see the "Little Red Riding Hood" sign) are very difficult to detect, as they fail to show many of the characteristics in the ABCD rule, break the "Ugly Duckling" sign, and are very hard to distinguish from acne scarring, insect bites, dermatofibromas, or lentigines.
Following a visual examination and a dermatoscopic exam, or in vivo diagnostic tools such as a confocal microscope, the doctor may biopsy the suspicious mole. A skin biopsy performed under local anesthesia is often required to assist in making or confirming the diagnosis and in defining the severity of the melanoma. If the mole is malignant, the mole and an area around it need excision. Elliptical excisional biopsies may remove the tumor, followed by histological analysis and Breslow scoring. Punch biopsies are contraindicated in suspected melanomas, for fear of seeding tumor cells and hastening the spread of the malignant cells.
Total body photography, which involves photographic documentation of as much body surface as possible, is often used during follow-up of high-risk patients. The technique has been reported to enable early detection and provides a cost-effective approach (being possible with the use of any digital camera), but its efficacy has been questioned due to its inability to detect macroscopic changes. The diagnosis method should be used in conjunction with (and not as a replacement for) dermoscopic imaging, with a combination of both methods appearing to give extremely high rates of detection.

===Classification===

Melanoma is divided into the following types:[tpl]Cite book|author=James, William D.; Berger, Timothy G.; et al. |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: clinical Dermatology|publisher=Saunders Elsevier |year=2006 |isbn=0-7216-2921-0 |pages=694–9[/tpl]

===Laboratory===

Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) tests are often used to screen for metastases, although many patients with metastases (even end-stage) have a normal LDH; extraordinarily high LDH often indicates metastatic spread of the disease to the liver. It is common for patients diagnosed with melanoma to have chest X-rays and an LDH test, and in some cases CT, MRI, PET and/or PET/CT scans. Although controversial, sentinel lymph node biopsies and examination of the lymph nodes are also performed in patients to assess spread to the lymph nodes. A diagnosis of melanoma is supported by the presence of the S-100 protein marker.
HMB-45 is a monoclonal antibody that reacts against an antigen present in melanocytic tumors such as melanomas, and stands for Human Melanoma Black. It is used in anatomic pathology as a marker for such tumors.
The antibody was generated to an extract of melanoma. It reacts positively against melanocytic tumors but not other tumors, thus demonstrating specificity and sensitivity. The antibody also reacts positively against junctional nevus cells but not intradermal nevi, and against fetal melanocytes but not normal adult melanocytes.
HMB-45 is nonreactive with almost all non-melanoma human malignancies, with the exception of rare tumors showing evidence of melanogenesis (e.g., pigmented schwannoma, clear cell sarcoma) or tumors associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (angiomyolipoma and lymphangiomyoma).

===Staging===

Further context on cancer staging is available at TNM.
Also of importance are the "Clark level" and "Breslow's depth", which refer to the microscopic depth of tumor invasion.[tpl]cite web |title=Malignant Melanoma: staging |date=1 September 2006 |work=Collaborative Hypertext of Radiology |publisher=Medical College of Wisconsin |url=http://chorus.rad.mcw.edu/doc/00955.html[/tpl]
Melanoma stages:
5 year survival rates:
Stage 0: Melanoma in situ (Clark Level I), 99.9% survival
Stage I / II: Invasive melanoma, 89–95% survival
Stage II: High risk melanoma, 45–79% survival
Stage III: Regional metastasis, 24–70% survival
Stage IV: Distant metastasis, 7–19% survival
Based upon AJCC five-year survival from initial melanoma diagnosis with proper treatment.

In the past, use of sunscreens with a sun protection factor (SPF) rating of 50 or higher on exposed areas were recommended; as older sunscreens more effectively blocked UVA with higher SPF.Can Melanoma Be Prevented?

Using artificial light for tanning was once believed to help prevent skin cancers, but it can actually lead to an increased incidence of melanomas.[ref][tpl]cite journal |author=Clough-Gorr KM, Titus-Ernstoff L, Perry AE, Spencer SK, Ernstoff MS|title=Exposure to sunlamps, tanning beds, and melanoma risk |journal=Cancer Causes Control |volume=19 |issue=7 |pages=659–69|date=September 2008 |pmid=18273687 |doi=10.1007/s10552-008-9129-6 [/tpl]
[/ref]  Even though tanning beds emit mostly UVA, which causes tanning, it by itself might be enough to induce melanomas.
A good rule of thumb for decreasing ultraviolet light exposure is to avoid the sun between the hours of 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. or avoid the sun when one's shadow is shorter than one's height. These are rough rules, however, and can vary depending on locality and individual skin cancer risk.
Almost all melanomas start with altering the color and appearance of normal-looking skin. This area may be a dark spot or an abnormal new mole. Other melanomas form from a mole or freckle that is already present in the skin. It can be difficult to distinguish between a melanoma and a normal mole. When looking for danger signs in pigmented lesions of the skin, a few simple rules are often used.

==Treatment==

Confirmation of the clinical diagnosis is done with a skin biopsy. This is usually followed up with a wider excision of the scar or tumor. Depending on the stage, a sentinel lymph node biopsy is done, as well, although controversy exists around trial evidence for this procedure.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.malignant-melanoma.org/sentinel-node-biopsy/sentinel-node-biopsy-false-positivity/ |title=The Sentinel Node Biopsy Procedure in Melanoma does not offer a survival advantage |publisher=Malignant Melanoma |date=2008-01-08 |accessdate=2012-08-13[/tpl] Treatment of advanced malignant melanoma is performed from a multidisciplinary approach.

===Surgery===

Excisional biopsies may remove the tumor, but further surgery is often necessary to reduce the risk of recurrence. Complete surgical excision with adequate surgical margins and assessment for the presence of detectable metastatic disease along with short- and long-term followup is standard. Often this is done by a wide local excision (WLE) with 1 to 2 cm margins. Melanoma-in-situ and lentigo malignas are treated with narrower surgical margins, usually 0.2 to 0.5 cm.LabPath.com[tpl]Dead link|date=March 2012[/tpl]  Many surgeons consider 0.5 cm the standard of care for standard excision of melanoma-in-situ,[tpl]cite journal |author=Clark GS, Pappas-Politis EC, Cherpelis BS, et al. |title=Surgical management of melanoma in situ on chronically sun-damaged skin |journal=Cancer Control |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=216–24 |date=July 2008 |pmid=18596673 |format=PDF |url=http://www.moffitt.org/CCJRoot/v15n3/pdf/216.pdf[/tpl] but 0.2 cm margin might be acceptable for margin controlled surgery (Mohs surgery, or the double-bladed technique with margin control). The wide excision aims to reduce the rate of tumor recurrence at the site of the original lesion. This is a common pattern of treatment failure in melanoma. Considerable research has aimed to elucidate appropriate margins for excision with a general trend toward less aggressive treatment during the last decades.[tpl]cite journal | author = Balch C, Urist M, Karakousis C, Smith T, Temple W, Drzewiecki K, Jewell W, Bartolucci A, Mihm M, Barnhill R | title = Efficacy of 2-cm surgical margins for intermediate-thickness melanomas (1 to 4 mm).

Melanomas that spread usually do so to the lymph nodes in the area of the tumor before spreading elsewhere. Attempts to improve survival by removing lymph nodes surgically (lymphadenectomy) were associated with many complications, but no overall survival benefit. Recently, the technique of sentinel lymph node biopsy has been developed to reduce the complications of lymph node surgery while allowing assessment of the involvement of nodes with tumor.Malignant-Melanoma.org
Biopsy of sentinel lymph nodes is a widely used procedure when treating cutaneous melanoma.[tpl]cite journal|last=Crowson|first=AN|author2=Haskell, H|title=The role of sentinel lymph-node biopsy in the management of cutaneous melanoma.|journal=Giornale italiano di dermatologia e venereologia : organo ufficiale, Societa italiana di dermatologia e sifilografia|date=Oct 2013|volume=148|issue=5|pages=493–9|pmid=24005142[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Ross|first=MI|author2=Gershenwald, JE|title=Sentinel lymph node biopsy for melanoma: a critical update for dermatologists after two decades of experience.|journal=Clinics in dermatology|date=May–Jun 2013|volume=31|issue=3|pages=298–310|pmid=23608449[/tpl]
Neither sentinel lymph node biopsy nor other diagnostic tests should be performed to evaluate early, thin melanoma, including melanoma in situ, T1a melanoma or T1b melanoma ≤ 0.5mm.[ref][tpl]Citation |author1 = American Academy of Dermatology |author1-link = American Academy of Dermatology |date = February 2013 |title = Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher = American Academy of Dermatology |work = Choosing Wisely: an initiative of the ABIM Foundation |page = |url = http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/american-academy-of-dermatology/ |accessdate = 5 December 2013[/tpl], which cites
Sentinel lymph node biopsy is often performed, especially for T1b/T2+ tumors, mucosal tumors, ocular melanoma and tumors of the limbs.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl] A process called lymphoscintigraphy is performed in which a radioactive tracer is injected at the tumor site to localize the sentinel node(s). Further precision is provided using a blue tracer dye, and surgery is performed to biopsy the node(s). Routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and immunoperoxidase staining will be adequate to rule out node involvement.  Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests on nodes, usually performed to test for entry into clinical trials, now demonstrate that many patients with a negative sentinel lymph node actually had a small number of positive cells in their nodes. Alternatively, a fine-needle aspiration biopsy may be performed and is often used to test masses.
If a lymph node is positive, depending on the extent of lymph node spread, a radical lymph node dissection will often be performed. If the disease is completely resected, the patient will be considered for adjuvant therapy.
Excisional skin biopsy is the management of choice.   Here, the suspect lesion is totally removed with an adequate (but minimal, usually 1 or 2 mm) ellipse of surrounding skin and tissue.[tpl]Cite journal| author = Swanson N, Lee K, Gorman A, Lee H | title = Biopsy techniques. Diagnosis of melanoma | journal = Intensive 2011: The Third International Conference on Resource Intensive Applications and Services | volume = 20 | issue = 4 |pages = 677–80 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12380054 | doi = 10.1016/S0733-8635(02)00025-6[/tpl]  To avoid disruption of the local lymphatic drainage, the preferred surgical margin for the initial biopsy should be narrow (1 mm). The biopsy should include the epidermal, dermal, and subcutaneous layers of the skin. This enables the histopathologist to determine the thickness of the melanoma by microscopic examination. This is described by Breslow's thickness (measured in millimeters). However, for large lesions, such as suspected lentigo maligna, or for lesions in surgically difficult areas (face, toes, fingers, eyelids), a small punch biopsy in representative areas will give adequate information and will not disrupt the final staging or depth determination. In no circumstances should the initial biopsy include the final surgical margin (0.5 cm, 1.0 cm, or 2 cm), as a misdiagnosis can result in excessive scarring and morbidity from the procedure. A large initial excision will disrupt the local lymphatic drainage and can affect further lymphangiogram-directed lymphnode dissection. A small punch biopsy can be used at any time where for logistical and personal reasons a patient refuses more invasive excisional biopsy. Small punch biopsies are minimally invasive and heal quickly, usually without noticeable scarring.

===Adjuvant treatment===

High-risk melanomas may require adjuvant treatment, although attitudes to this vary in different countries. In the United States, most patients in otherwise good health will begin up to a year of high-dose interferon treatment, which has severe side effects, but may improve the patient's prognosis slightly.[tpl]cite journal | author = Kirkwood J, Strawderman M, Ernstoff M, Smith T, Borden E, Blum R | title = Interferon alfa-2b adjuvant therapy of high-risk resected cutaneous melanoma: the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Trial EST 1684 | journal = J Clin Oncol | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 7–17 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8558223[/tpl] However British Association of Dermatologist guidelines on melanoma state that interferon is not recommended as a standard adjuvant treatment for melanoma.[tpl]cite book|last=English|title=British Association of Dermatologists' management guidelines|year=2010|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Chichester, West Sussex|isbn=978-1-4443-3552-1|url=http://as.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1444335529,descCd-buy.html|editor=Neil H. Cox, John S.C.|accessdate=19 August 2013[/tpl] A 2011 meta-analysis showed that interferon could lengthen the time before a melanoma comes back but increased survival by only 3% at 5 years.

===Chemotherapy and immunotherapy===

Various chemotherapy agents are used, including dacarbazine (also termed DTIC), immunotherapy (with interleukin-2 (IL-2) or interferon (IFN)), as well as local perfusion, are used by different centers. The overall success in metastatic melanoma is quite limited.[tpl]cite journal | author = Bajetta E, Del Vecchio M, Bernard-Marty C, Vitali M, Buzzoni R, Rixe O, Nova P, Aglione S, Taillibert S, Khayat D | title = Metastatic melanoma: chemotherapy | journal = Semin Oncol | volume = 29 | issue = 5 | pages = 427–45 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12407508 | doi = 10.1053/sonc.2002.35238[/tpl] IL-2 (Proleukin) is the first new therapy approved for the treatment of metastatic melanoma in 20 years.

Other options include ipilimumab (a biological immmunotherapy agent), and chemotherapy drugs such as vemurafenib and temozolomide.

===Lentigo maligna treatment===

Standard excision is still being done by most surgeons. Unfortunately, the recurrence rate is exceedingly high (up to 50%). This is due to the ill-defined visible surgical margin, and the facial location of the lesions (often forcing the surgeon to use a narrow surgical margin). The narrow surgical margin used, combined with the limitation of the standard "bread-loafing" technique of fixed tissue histology — result in a high "false negative" error rate, and frequent recurrences. Margin control (peripheral margins) is necessary to eliminate the false negative errors. If bread loafing is used, distances from sections should approach 0.1 mm to assure that the method approaches complete margin control.
Mohs surgery has been done with cure rate reported to be as low as 77%, and as high as 95% by another author. The "double scalpel" peripheral margin controlled excision method approximates the Mohs method in margin control, but requires a pathologist intimately familiar with the complexity of managing the vertical margin on the thin peripheral sections and staining methods.[tpl]cite journal |author=Johnson TM, Headington JT, Baker SR, Lowe L |title=Usefulness of the staged excision for lentigo maligna and lentigo maligna melanoma: the "square" procedure |journal=J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. |volume=37 |issue=5 Pt 1 |pages=758–64 |date=November 1997 |pmid=9366823 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0190-9622(97)70114-2 |doi=10.1016/S0190-9622(97)70114-2[/tpl]
Some melanocytic nevi, and melanoma-in-situ (lentigo maligna) have resolved with an experimental treatment,  imiquimod (Aldara) topical cream, an immune enhancing agent. Some dermasurgeons are combining the 2 methods: surgically excising the cancer and then treating the area with Aldara cream postoperatively for three months.

===Radiation therapy===

Radiation therapy is often used after surgical resection for patients with locally or regionally advanced melanoma or for patients with unresectable distant metastases. It may reduce the rate of local recurrence but does not prolong survival.[tpl]cite journal | author = Bastiaannet E, Beukema J, Hoekstra H | title = Radiation therapy following lymph node dissection in melanoma patients: treatment, outcome and complications | journal = Cancer Treat Rev | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 18–26 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15707701 | doi = 10.1016/j.ctrv.2004.09.005[/tpl] Radioimmunotherapy of metastatic melanoma is currently under investigation.
Radiotherapy has a role in the palliation of metastatic melanoma.[tpl]cite book|author=Boyer|others=Ford|title=Primary Care Oncology|year=1999[/tpl]

==Prognosis==

Features that affect prognosis are tumor thickness in millimeters (Breslow's depth), depth related to skin structures (Clark level), type of melanoma, presence of ulceration, presence of lymphatic/perineural invasion, presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (if present, prognosis is better), location of lesion, presence of satellite lesions, and presence of regional or distant metastasis.[tpl]Cite journal| author = Homsi J, Kashani-Sabet M, Messina J, Daud A | title = Cutaneous melanoma: prognostic factors | journal = Cancer Control | volume = 12 | issue = 4 | pages = 223–9 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16258493 |url=https://www.moffitt.usf.edu/pubs/ccj/v12n4/pdf/223.pdf |format=PDF[/tpl] Certain types of melanoma have worse prognoses but this is explained by their thickness. Interestingly, less invasive melanomas even with lymph node metastases carry a better prognosis than deep melanomas without regional metastasis at time of staging. Local recurrences tend to behave similarly to a primary unless they are at the site of a wide local excision (as opposed to a staged excision or punch/shave excision) since these recurrences tend to indicate lymphatic invasion.
When melanomas have spread to the lymph nodes, one of the most important factors is the number of nodes with malignancy. Extent of malignancy within a node is also important; micrometastases in which malignancy is only microscopic have a more favorable prognosis than macrometastases. In some cases micrometastases may only be detected by special staining, and if malignancy is only detectable by a rarely employed test known as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the prognosis is better. Macrometastases in which malignancy is clinically apparent (in some cases cancer completely replaces a node) have a far worse prognosis, and if nodes are matted or if there is extracapsular extension, the prognosis is worse still.
When there is distant metastasis, the cancer is generally considered incurable. The five-year survival rate is less than 10%.[tpl]Cite journal| author = Balch C, Buzaid A, Soong S, Atkins M, Cascinelli N, Coit D, Fleming I, Gershenwald J, Houghton A, Kirkwood J, McMasters K, Mihm M, Morton D, Reintgen D, Ross M, Sober A, Thompson J, Thompson J | title = Final version of the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system for cutaneous melanoma | journal = J Clin Oncol | volume = 19 | issue = 16 | pages = 3635–48 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11504745 |url=http://www.jco.org/cgi/content/full/19/16/3635[/tpl] The median survival is 6–12 months. Treatment is palliative, focusing on life extension and quality of life. In some cases, patients may live many months or even years with metastatic melanoma (depending on the aggressiveness of the treatment). Metastases to skin and lungs have a better prognosis. Metastases to brain, bone and liver are associated with a worse prognosis.
There is not enough definitive evidence to adequately stage, and thus give a prognosis for, ocular melanoma and melanoma of soft parts, or mucosal melanoma (e.g. rectal melanoma), although these tend to metastasize more easily. Even though regression may increase survival, when a melanoma has regressed, it is impossible to know its original size and thus the original tumor is often worse than a pathology report might indicate.
