KLM Flight 607-E, also known as Hugo de Groot, registration PH-LKM, was an international scheduled flight operated by a Lockheed Super Constellation that crashed [tpl]convert|180|km[/tpl] west of Shannon, County Clare on August 14, 1958. All of the ninety-one passengers and eight crew died in the accident, including six members of the Egyptian fencing team.http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20061012/news_1s12crshlist.html The "E" in the flight number stood for the designation of being an extra economy class flight to match the increased seasonal tourist demand."Tragedy for Homeward-Bound Vacationers."

Flight 607-E departed Shannon at 3:05 GMT on the second leg of a transatlantic trip from Amsterdam to New York City with intermediate stops in Shannon and Gander, Newfoundland. Radio contact with the aircraft was lost at approximately 3:40 GMT; a rescue operation was launched which found light debris on the surface of the ocean approximately 180 km west of Shannon. The remains of 34 of those on board were also recovered.
Due to the lack of evidence, Irish and Dutch investigators could not pinpoint a probable cause for the accident. They examined the possibility of a bomb, electrical failure or pilot error, but believed that the most likely possibility was a catastrophic mechanical failure. The cause of the accident is believed to be a malfunctioning overspeeding outboard propeller caused by metal particles obstructing oil feed line regulator valves.  The particles may have been formed by a gear that was damaged when the supercharger of the corresponding engine was accelerated (gear ratio shifted). The malfunctions of the propeller pitch might have provoked a flight disturbance and as a consequence the propeller may have sheared off.
