The British Library is the national library of the United Kingdom.[tpl]Cite book | last=Reitz | first=Joan M. | year=2004 | title=Dictionary for Library and Information Science | publisher=Libraries Unlimited | isbn=978-1-59158-075-1  | page=103  [/tpl] The library is a major research library, holding over 150 million items from many countries, in many languages[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/aboutus/stratpolprog/coldevpol/index.html|title=Collection Development Policy|publisher=British Library|accessdate=15 January 2011[/tpl] and in many formats, both print and digital: books, manuscripts, journals, newspapers, magazines,  sound and music recordings, videos, play-scripts, patents, databases, maps, stamps, prints, drawings. The Library's collections include around 14 million books,[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.bl.uk/|title=The British Library; Explore the world's knowledge|publisher=British Library|accessdate=12 April 2010[/tpl] along with substantial holdings of manuscripts and historical items dating back as far as 2000 BC. The British Library is the largest library in the world by number of items catalogued."Using the British Library". British Library. Retrieved on 17 April 2014. However, such metrics are of limited utility due to the variety of cataloguing methods employed by institutions.
As a legal deposit library, the British Library receives copies of all books produced in the United Kingdom and Ireland, including a significant proportion of overseas titles distributed in the UK. It also has a programme for content acquisitions. The British Library adds some three million items every year occupying [tpl]convert|9.6|km|mi[/tpl] of new shelf space.The British Library Annual Report and Accounts 2010/11, p.31
The library is a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. It is located on the north side of Euston Road in St Pancras, London (between Euston railway station and St Pancras railway station) and has a document storage centre and reading room near Boston Spa, [tpl]convert|2.5|mi[/tpl] east of Wetherby in West Yorkshire.
Part of the library was originally a department of the British Museum and from the mid-19th century occupied the famous circular British Museum Reading Room.  It became legally separate in 1973, and by 1997 had moved into its new purpose-built building at St Pancras, London.

==Historical background==

The British Library was created on 1 July 1973 as a result of the British Library Act 1972.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/aboutus/quickinfo/facts/history/index.html|title=History of the British Library|publisher=British Library|accessdate=7 February 2010|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5nMvVlrFD|archivedate=7 February 2010[/tpl] Prior to this, the national library was part of the British Museum, which provided the bulk of the holdings of the new library, alongside smaller organisations which were folded in (such as the National Central Library, the National Lending Library for Science and Technology and the British National Bibliography). In 1974 functions previously exercised by the Office for Scientific and Technical Information were taken over; in 1982 the India Office Library and Records and the HMSO Binderies became British Library responsibilities.Whitaker's Almanack; 1988, p. 409 In 1983, the Library absorbed the National Sound Archive, which holds many sound and video recordings, with over a million discs and thousands of tapes.[tpl]cite web|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5nMvMvV7b|archivedate=7 February 2010|url=http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/bldept/soundarch/about/soundarchive.html|title=About the British Library Sound Archive|publisher=British Library|accessdate=7 February 2010[/tpl]
The core of the Library's historical collections is based on a series of donations and acquisitions from the 18th century, known as the 'foundation collections'.[tpl]Cite book | last=Wedgeworth | first=Robert | year=1993 | title=World Encyclopedia of Library and Information Services | edition=3 | publisher=ALA Editions | isbn=978-0-8389-0609-5 | page=149 [/tpl] These include the books and manuscripts of Sir Robert Cotton, Sir Hans Sloane, Robert Harley and the King's Library of King George III,[tpl]cite web|url=http://snfcc.snfoundation.org/snfcc/EN/index.php?ID=Zq437NxVGjNsz7nf_EN|title=Similar Projects – The British Library|publisher=Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center|accessdate=7 February 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5nMvFvVto |archivedate=7 February 2010[/tpl] as well as the Old Royal Library donated by King George II.
For many years its collections were dispersed in various buildings around central London, in places such as Bloomsbury (within the British Museum), Chancery Lane, Bayswater, and Holborn with an interlibrary lending centre at Boston Spa, Wetherby in West Yorkshire (situated on Thorp Arch Trading Estate) and the newspaper library at Colindale, north-west London.
Initial plans for the British Library required demolition of an integral part of Bloomsbury – a seven acre swathe of streets immediately in front of the Museum, so that the Library could be situated directly opposite. After a long and hard-fought campaign led by Dr George Wagner, this decision was overturned and the library was instead constructed on a site at Euston Road next to St Pancras railway station.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.casweb.org/bloomsburyassociation/news/item?item_id=134787 |title=What and Where is Bloomsbury Village? |publisher=Casweb.org |date= |accessdate=27 February 2013[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl]
From 1997 to 2009 the main collection was housed in this single new building and the collection of British and overseas newspapers was housed at Colindale. In July 2008 the Library announced that it would be moving low-use items to a new storage facility in Boston Spa in Yorkshire and that it planned to close the newspaper library at Colindale, ahead of a later move to a similar facility on the same site.[tpl]cite web|title=British Library Announces Collection Moves Strategy|url=http://pressandpolicy.bl.uk/Press-Releases/The-British-Library-Announces-Collection-Moves-Strategy-34e.aspx|publisher=British Library|accessdate=16 July 2013[/tpl] From January 2009 to April 2012 over 200 km of material was moved to the Additional Storage Building and is now delivered to British Library Reading Rooms in London on request by a daily shuttle service.[tpl]cite web|title=200km of books successfully moved to high-tech home|url=http://pressandpolicy.bl.uk/Press-Releases/200km-of-books-successfully-moved-to-high-tech-home-56e.aspx|publisher=British Library|accessdate=16 July 2013[/tpl] Construction work on the Newspaper Storage Building was completed in 2013 and the newspaper library at Colindale closed on 8 November 2013.

Collections housed in Yorkshire, comprising low-use material and the newspaper and Document Supply collections, will then make up around 70% of the total material the library holds.[tpl]cite news|title=British Library builds fire-proof home for 750m newspapers|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-20717391|publisher=BBC|accessdate=16 July 2013|date=13 December 2012[/tpl]
The Library previously had a book storage depot in Woolwich, south-east London, which is no longer in use. The new library was designed specially for the purpose by the architect Colin St John Wilson. Facing Euston Road is a large piazza that includes pieces of public art, such as large sculptures by Eduardo Paolozzi (a bronze statue based on William Blake's study of Isaac Newton) and Antony Gormley. It is the largest public building constructed in the United Kingdom in the 20th century.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/aboutus/quickinfo/facts/index.html|title=British Library – About Us|publisher=British Library|accessdate=7 February 2010|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5nMvdOGz0|archivedate=7 February 2010[/tpl][tpl]Cite book | last1=Walkowitz | first1=Daniel J. | year=2009 | title=Contested Histories in Public Space: Memory, Race, and Nation | last2=Knauer | first2=Lisa Maya | publisher=Duke University Press | isbn=978-0-8223-4236-6 | page=103 [/tpl]
In the middle of the building is a six-storey glass tower containing the King's Library, with 65,000 printed volumes along with other pamphlets, manuscripts and maps collected by King George III between 1763 and 1820.[tpl]Cite journal | last=Nichols | first=Thomas | year=1870 | title=A handy-book of the British Museum: for every-day readers | publisher=Cassell, Petter, and Galpin | page=396 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4rVCAAAAIAAJ [/tpl] In December 2009 a new storage building at Boston Spa was opened by Rosie Winterton.

On Thursday, 5 April 2013, Lucie Burgess, the British Library's head of content strategy, announced that, starting that weekend, the Library will begin saving all sites with the suffix .uk- every British website, e-book, online newsletter, and blog, in a bid to preserve the nation's "digital memory" (which as of then amounted to about 4.8 million sites containing 1 billion web pages). The Library will make all the material publicly available to users by the end of 2013, and will ensure that, through technological advancements, all the material is preserved for future generations, despite the fluidity of the Internet.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.msn.com/world/british-library-to-preserve-nation%e2%80%99s-entire-internet-history |title=British Library to preserve nation's entire Internet history |publisher=News.msn.com |date= |accessdate=4 September 2013[/tpl]

==Legal deposit==

In England, Legal Deposit can be traced back to at least 1610.Robert C. Barrington Partridge "The history of the legal deposit of books throughout the British Empire", London: Library Association, 1938 The Copyright Act 1911 established the principle of the legal deposit, ensuring that the British Library and five other libraries in Great Britain and Ireland are entitled to receive a free copy of every item published or distributed in Britain. The other five libraries are: the Bodleian Library at Oxford; the University Library at Cambridge; the Trinity College Library at Dublin; and the National Libraries of Scotland and Wales. The British Library is the only one that must automatically receive a copy of every item published in Britain; the others are entitled to these items, but must specifically request them from the publisher after learning that they have been or are about to be published, a task done centrally by the Agency for the Legal Deposit Libraries.
Further, under the terms of Irish copyright law (most recently the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000), the British Library is entitled to automatically receive a free copy of every book published in Ireland, alongside the National Library of Ireland, the Trinity College Library at Dublin, the library of the University of Limerick, the library of Dublin City University and the libraries of the four constituent universities of the National University of Ireland. The Bodleian Library, Cambridge University Library, and the National Libraries of Scotland and Wales are also entitled to copies of material published in Ireland, but again must formally make requests.
In 2003 the Ipswich MP Chris Mole introduced a Private Member's Bill which became the Legal Deposit Libraries Act 2003. The Act extends United Kingdom legal deposit requirements to electronic documents, such as CD-ROMs and selected websites.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2003/ukpga_20030028_en_1|title=Legal Deposit Libraries Act 2003|publisher=Office of Public Sector Information|accessdate=7 February 2010| archivedate=7 February 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5nNN5GQdv[/tpl]
The Library also holds the Asia, Pacific and Africa Collections (APAC) which include the India Office Records and materials in the languages of Asia and of north and north-east Africa.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/bldept/apac/apacoll/apac.html|title=Asia, Pacific and Africa Collections|publisher=British Library|accessdate=8 February 2010[/tpl]

==Using the library's reading rooms==

The Library is open to everyone who has a genuine need to use its collections. Anyone with a permanent address who wishes to carry out research can apply for a Reader Pass; they are required to provide proof of signature and address for security purposes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/inrrooms/stp/register/howreg/howtoregister.html|title=How to register for a Reader Pass|publisher=British Library|accessdate=8 February 2010[/tpl]
Historically, only those wishing to use specialised material unavailable in other public or academic libraries would be given a Reader Pass. The Library has been criticised for admitting numbers of undergraduate students, who have access to their own university libraries, to the reading rooms. The Library replied that it has always admitted undergraduates as long as they have a legitimate personal, work-related or academic research purpose.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23479468-british-library-like-a-branch-of-starbooks-say-the-literati.do|title=British Library like a branch of Starbooks say the literati|last=Brierley|first=Danny |date=21 April 2008|publisher=Evening Standard|accessdate=8 February 2010[/tpl]
The majority of catalogue entries can be found on Explore the British Library, the Library's main catalogue, which is based on Primo.[tpl]Cite journal|url=http://www.exlibrisgroup.com/category/PrimoOverview|date=8 December 2011 |publisher=Exlibris Group |title=Primo[/tpl] Other collections have their own catalogues, such as western manuscripts. The large reading rooms offer hundreds of seats which are often filled with researchers, especially during the Easter and summer holidays.
Members of the public are also able to view the Document Supply Collection in the Reading Room at the Library's site in Boston Spa in Yorkshire.  It is not necessary to register as a Reader to use the Boston Spa Reading Room, however, those who wish to do so must be over the age of 14 and need to provide photo identification.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/inrrooms/bspa/needtoknow/bspavisit.html|title=Using the Boston Spa Reading Room|publisher=British Library|accessdate=17 July 2013[/tpl]

==Material available online==

The British Library makes a number of images of items within its collections available online. Its Online Gallery gives access to 30,000 images from various medieval books, together with a handful of exhibition-style items in a proprietary format, such as the Lindisfarne Gospels. This includes the facility to "turn the virtual pages" of a few documents, such as Leonardo da Vinci's notebooks.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/index.html|title=Explore the British Library|publisher=British Library|accessdate=25 February 2010[/tpl] Catalogue entries for a large number of the illuminated manuscript collections are available online, with selected images of pages or miniatures from a growing number of them,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/welcome.htm |title=Catalogue of Illuminated manuscripts |publisher=Bl.uk |date= |accessdate=27 February 2013[/tpl] and there is a database of significant bookbindings.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/bookbindings/ |title=Database of bookbindings |publisher=Bl.uk |date= |accessdate=27 February 2013[/tpl]
The British Library's commercial secure electronic delivery service was started in 2003 at a cost of £6 million. This offers more than 100 million items (including 280,000 journal titles, 50 million patents, 5 million reports, 476,000 US dissertations and 433,000 conference proceedings) for researchers and library patrons worldwide which were previously unavailable outside the Library because of copyright restrictions. In line with a government directive that the British Library must cover a percentage of its operating costs, a fee is charged to the user. However, this service is no longer profitable and has led to a series of restructures to try to prevent further losses.
When Google Books started, the British Library signed an agreement with Microsoft to digitise a number of books from the British Library for its Live Search Books project.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2005/nov/04/microsoft.books |title=Microsoft teams up with British Library to digitise books | work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News and Media|accessdate=12 April 2010|date=4 November 2005|last=Tran|first=Mark | location=London[/tpl] This material was only available to readers in the US, and closed in May 2008.[tpl]cite news |first= Miguel|last= Helft|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Microsoft Will Shut Down Book Search Program |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/24/technology/24soft.html?_r=1&ref=technology&oref=slogin |publisher=New York Times |date=24 May 2008 |accessdate=26 February 2010 [/tpl] The scanned books are currently available via the British Library catalogue or Amazon.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.techradar.com/news/portable-devices/other-devices/amazon-seals-british-library-deal-for-free-kindle-classics-672583 |title=Amazon seals British Library deal for free Kindle classics[/tpl]
In October 2010 the British Library launched its Management and business studies portal.

In November 2011, four million newspaper pages from the 18th and 19th centuries were made available online. The project will scan up to 40 million pages over the next 10 years. The archive is free to search, but there is a charge for accessing the pages themselves.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15932683 |title=British Library scans 18th and 19th-Century newspapers |date=29 November 2011 | work=BBC News[/tpl]

==Electronic collections==

Explore the British Library is the latest iteration of the online catalogue. It contains nearly 57 million records and may be used to search, view and order items from the collections or search the contents of the Library's website. The Library's electronic collections include over 40,000 ejournals, 800 databases and other electronic resources.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/eresources/main.shtml |title=Electronic collections, British Library, 25 July 2012.

==Business and IP Centre==

In May 2005, the British Library received a grant of £1 million from the London Development Agency to change two of its reading rooms into the Business & IP Centre. The Centre was opened in March 2006.[tpl]cite news |last=Chadwick |first=Gareth |title=The British Library: An excellent business support centre |date=5 June 2007 |newspaper=The Independent |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/sme/the-british-library-an-excellent-business-support-centre-451812.html|quote=The pilot was such a success that in May 2005 the London Development Agency, the Mayor of London's agency for business and jobs, announced a £1m funding package to turn the project into a permanent resource.  The centre's facilities were enlarged and upgraded to include state-of-the-art meeting rooms, a networking area and wireless internet access. A team of information experts is on hand to help people find the information they need. The new centre re-launched in March 2006. In the 14 months since, it has welcomed more than 25,000 people through its doors.[/tpl] It holds arguably the most comprehensive collection of business and intellectual property (IP) material in the United Kingdom and is the official library of the UK Intellectual Property Office.
The collection is divided up into four main information areas: market research, company information, trade directories, and journals. It is free of charge in hard copy and online via approximately 30 subscription databases. Registered readers can access the collection and the databases.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.startups.co.uk/what-s-on-offer-at-the-british-library-business-and-ip-centre.html |title=What's on offer at the British Library Business & IP Centre? |publisher=Startups |date= |accessdate=28 January 2011[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl]
There are over 50 million patent specifications from 40 countries in a collection dating back to 1855. The collection also includes official gazettes on patents, trade marks and Registered Design; law reports and other material on litigation; and information on copyright. This is available in hard copy and via online databases.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/bipc/aboutus/faq/index.html |title=British Library Business & IP Centre in London | Frequently asked questions |publisher=British Library |date=30 November 2003 |accessdate=28 January 2011[/tpl]
Staff are trained to guide small and medium enterprises (SME) and entrepreneurs to use the full range of resources.

==Document Supply Service==

As part of its establishment in 1973, the British Library absorbed the National Lending Library for Science and Technology (NLL), based near Boston Spa in Yorkshire, which had been established in 1961. Before this, the site had housed a World War II Royal Ordnance Factory, ROF Thorp Arch, which closed in 1957. When the NLL became part of the British Library in 1973 it changed its name to the British Library Lending Division, in 1985 it was renamed as the British Library Document Supply Centre and is now known as the British Library Document Supply Service, often abbreviated as BLDSS.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/atyourdesk/docsupply/about/history/index.html|title=British Library document supply history|publisher=British Library|accessdate=17 July 2013[/tpl]
BLDSS now holds 87.5 million items, including 296,000 international journal titles, 400,000 conference proceedings, 3 million monographs, 5 million official publications, and 500,000 UK and North American theses and dissertations. 12.5 million articles in the Document Supply Collection are held electronically and can be downloaded immediately.Richard Ebdon, 'The World's One-Stop-Shop for Information Needs', Pipeline: The Journal of the Pharmaceutical Information & Pharmocovigilance Association, 40 (March 2013), pp.12–13
The collection supports research and development in UK, overseas and international industry, particularly in the pharmaceutical industry. BLDSS also provides material to Higher Education institutions, students and staff and members of the public, who can order items through their Public Library or through the Library's BL Document Supply Service (BLDSS).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/atyourdesk/docsupply/industryspecificinfo/publisher/docsupply|title=Document Supply Information for Publishers|publisher=British Library|accessdate=17 July 2013[/tpl] The Document Supply Service also offers Find it For Me and Get it For Me services which assist researchers in accessing hard-to-find material.
In April 2013, BLDSS launched its new online ordering and tracking system, which enables customers to search available items, view detailed availability, pricing and delivery time information, place and track orders, and manage account preferences online.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/atyourdesk/docsupply/help/customerupdates/index.html#BLDSS:OnlineOrderinglaunchedApril2013|title=Document Supply News & Customer Updates|publisher=British Library|accessdate=17 July 2013[/tpl]

==Newspapers==

The British Library Newspapers section was based in Colindale in North London until 2013,[tpl]cite news|url=http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2011/01/19/farewell-to-history/ |title=Farewell to history? |first=Alan |last=Cleaver |publisher=Independent |date=19 January 2011 |accessdate=28 January 2011 |location=London[/tpl] and is now divided between the St Pancras and Boston Spa sites.[tpl]cite web|title=Newspaper Collection -Frequently Asked Questions for Readers|publisher=British Library|url=http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/news/newspapermoves/newspaper-moves-faqs.pdf|accessdate=21 April 2014[/tpl]  The Library has an almost complete collection of British and Irish newspapers since 1840. This is partly because of the legal deposit legislation of 1869, which required newspapers to supply a copy of each edition of a newspaper to the library.

==Philatelic Collections==

The British Library Philatelic Collections are held at St Pancras.  The collections were established in 1891 with the donation of the Tapling collection,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/philatelic/philateliccollections/philateliccollectionsintroduction/philatelicintro.html|title=The Tapling Collection|work=British Library|accessdate=12 April 2010[/tpl] they steadily developed and now comprise over 25 major collections and a number of smaller ones, encompassing a wide range of disciplines. The collections include postage and revenue stamps, postal stationery, essays, proofs, covers and entries, "cinderella stamp" material, specimen issues, airmails, some postal history materials, official and private posts, etc., for almost all countries and periods.[tpl]Cite book |author1=David Beech|author2=Paul Skinner |author3=Bobby Birchall|author4=Catherine Britton |url=http://shop.bl.uk/mall/productpage.cfm/BritishLibrary/ISBN_9780712309530/353759 |title=Treasures in Focus – Stamps |publisher=British Library |date= |accessdate=16 January 2011 |isbn=978-0-7123-0953-0 [/tpl]
An extensive display of material from the collections is on exhibit, which may be the best permanent display of diverse classic stamps and philatelic material in the world. Approximately 80,000 items on 6,000 sheets may be viewed in 1,000 display frames; 2,400 sheets are from the Tapling Collection. All other material, which covers the whole world, is available to students and researchers. As well as these collections, the library actively acquires literature on the subject. This makes the British Library one of the world's prime philatelic research centres. The Head Curator of the Philatelic Collections is David Beech.

The Additional Manuscripts series covers manuscripts that are not part of the named collections, and contains all other manuscripts gifted, purchased or bequeathed to the Library since 1756.
