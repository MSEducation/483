==Club career==

Hu Yunfeng was born in Shanghai, China and played for the Shanghai Xuhui District football team before being picked up by top tier Chinese football club Bayi Football Team's youth team. With them he would graduate to their senior team during the 1994 league season and make eight appearances within his first season.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://sodasoccer.com/search/player/924AFB9E3F141447.html|title=胡云峰|publisher=sodasoccer.com|date=|accessdate=2012-07-27[/tpl] The following season would see him become an integral member of the team where he would strike up a vital partnership with Hao Haidong that  would see the club finish ninth and just above relegation. In the 1996 league season his goalscoring partnership with Hao Haidong would see the club drastically improve and finish third within the league, however this saw significant interest for Hao Haidong signature who decided to leave the club leaving Hu Yunfeng to get the goals for Bayi, which he continued until the 1998 league season when saw the club finish thirteenth and in the relegation zone at the end of the season.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesc/china98.html|title=China League 1998|publisher=rsssf.com|date=16 Jul 2003|accessdate=2012-07-27[/tpl] While Hu admitted that he would be willing to leave the club to return to his howntown of Shanghai he decided to stay with Bayi to help fight for promotion, which he achieved at the end of the 2000 league season.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesc/china00.html|title=China 2000|publisher=rsssf.com|date=19 Jun 2003|accessdate=2012-07-27[/tpl] Despite Bayi's promotion Hu's desire to leave the club for a move back to Shanghai became apparent once again and Bayi were willing to let Hu leave the club, but sold him to Shenyang Ginde F.C. at the beginning of the 2001 league season. He frustratingly joined Shenyang but quickly picked up an injury, which saw him miss much of his first season with club. Once he returned to action the following season he nevertheless became an intgral member of the team and stayed with the club until the end of the 2003 league season to join second tier football club Nanjing Yoyo F.C. While Hu had hoped to return to Shanghai to play out the remainder of his career there were no clubs willing to risk taking a player who was past his prime except for Nanjing who Hu admitted he joined because they neighboured Shanghai.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://sports.sohu.com/2004/01/20/24/news218712425.shtml|title=胡云峰身价让申花犯难 没人"截杀"却两头踏空|publisher=sports.sohu.com|date=2004-01-20|accessdate=2012-07-27[/tpl] While his move was uneventful the club would offer him the managerial position during the 2005 league season and Hu would see significantly less playing time to concentrate on his managerial duties and would eventually retire in 2007 league season.

==International career==

Hu Yunfeng would be called up to the Chinese senior national football team for the first time by the Head coach Bob Houghton to take part in the 1998 Dynasty Cup and would make his debut on March 1, 1998 against Hong Kong in a 1-0 win.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://teamchina.freehostia.com/en/match.php?date=1998-03-01|title=China PR 1-0 Hong Kong|publisher=teamchina.freehostia.com|date=1998-03-01|accessdate=2012-07-27[/tpl] During the tournament he would make his first start on March 7, 1998 in a 2-0 victory against Japan.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://teamchina.freehostia.com/en/match.php?date=1998-03-07|title=China PR 2-0 Japan|publisher=teamchina.freehostia.com|date=1998-03-07|accessdate=2012-07-27[/tpl] Once the tournament ended Hu struggled to gain a permanent place within the squad and with Bayi struggling against relegation he would find himself dropped from future Bob Houghton's squads. With the introduction of Bora Milutinović as the new Chinese Head coach Hu was given a revival in his international career after Milutinović included him in one of his first squads against New Zealand on January 14, 2000 in a friendly that China won 1-0.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://teamchina.freehostia.com/en/match.php?date=2000-01-14|title=China PR 1-0 New Zealand|publisher=teamchina.freehostia.com|date=2000-01-14|accessdate=2012-07-27[/tpl] In preparation for the 2002 FIFA World Cup qualifiers Hu was tested out for several further friendlies, however he could not find his goalscoring touch and was eventually dropped by Milutinović.
