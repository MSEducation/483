Henry Draycott (c. 1510–1572) was an English-born official in Ireland who held a number of senior offices including Chancellor of the Exchequer of Ireland. Despite his apparent lack of legal training he went on to have a successful career as a judge, becoming Baron of the Court of Exchequer and Master of the Rolls in Ireland. He also became a substantial landowner in the Pale, his estates centred on Mornington, County Meath.

==Background==

Draycott was said to be a native of Denby in Derbyshire;[tpl]cite book|last=Ball|first=F. Elrington|title=The judges in Ireland, 1221–1921|year=2004|publisher=Lawbook Exchange|location=Clark, N.J.|isbn=1584774282|page=209|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?isbn=1584774282[/tpl] his family name presumably derives from the village of Draycott, Derbyshire. Despite his later eminence as a judge, it is not clear when, or if, he was called to the Bar. He first appears in Ireland in 1544; his first official post was treasurer of the Lordship of Wexford, and he received a lease of Crown lands there.

==Administrator==

Draycott rose quickly in the Dublin administration, becoming Chief Remembrancer, a senior position in the Court of Exchequer. He was elected to the Irish House of Commons as member for Naas in 1559.Ball, p. 210 He was entrusted with a number of political missions to England, and was later a reliable supporter of Sir Henry Sidney; he was given the task of settling a controversy between the Earl of Ormond and the Earl of Desmond, and was involved in the settlement of Munster in 1567.
Draycott was granted substantial properties in Meath and Louth. His main estate was Mornington; he also owned the manor of Donnycarney and property in Dundalk. LIke most English settlers he was indifferent to the rights of earlier owners and was willng to assist other members of his class in "finding" (often a euphemism for forging) title to land; in particular John Hooker, when secretary to Sir Peter Carew, refers to the assistance Draycott gave his master in acquiring land.Tazon, Juan E. The Life and Times of Thomas Stukeley Ashgate Publishing 2003 p. 86

==Judicial career==

Draycott became a Baron of the Court of Exchequer (Ireland) in 1563 and Master of the Rolls in 1566. Although he gained a reputation for integrity, Elrington Ball queries his suitability in particular for the Mastership, since it is not clear if he had any legal training.Ball, p. 141 However the Mastership was then partly an administrative office and Draycott was an efficient administrator; it is recorded that one of his tasks was to peruse and sort official records. Another objection to his appointment was chronic ill-health: in 1567 Sir Henry Sidney, the Lord Deputy of Ireland, described him as "a very sick and a weak man".Ball p. 141 He died in 1572.

==Character==

Despite his lack of legal training, Draycott was praised as a judge of integrity, and as a man whose service to the Crown deserved praise. Less attractive was his greed for acquiring land and willingness to help other settlers in similar transactions. Unlike most settlers he may have had Roman Catholic sympathies: though he was outwardly a Protestant his family within a few years of his death became and remained Catholic.
Elizabeth had a personal regard for Draycott, and on his death wrote that she was sorry to have lost one whom she esteemed as a good and faithful servant, but trusted that he had exchanged this world for a better one.Ball, p. 144

==Descendants==

Draycott's widow, Mary, remarried Owen Moore, the Muster Master for Ireland. His daughter Alice died in mysterious circumstances in 1576, reputedly poisoned by the Earl of Leicester.Brooks E St. John The Death of Alice Draycott (1954) Journal of the County Louth Archaeological Society Vol 13 No. 2 p. 179 His descendant, Henry Draycott of Mornington, died in 1694 without issue: this led to a notable lawsuit, Draycott v. Talbot(1718) Brown's Parliamentary Cases Vol. 2 p. 92 in which one Edward Draycott claimed, unsuccessfully, to be Henry's son.
