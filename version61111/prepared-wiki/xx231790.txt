==Planetary system==

Lupus-TR-3 b is an exoplanet discovered in 2007 by personnel from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics using the transit method.  It has four-fifths the mass of Jupiter, nine-tenths the radius, and has density of 1.4 g/cm³. This planet is a typical "hot Jupiter" as it orbits at 0.0464 AU distance from the star, taking 3.9 days to orbit. It is currently the faintest ground-based detection of a transiting planet.
