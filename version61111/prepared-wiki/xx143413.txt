[[Challenge Project]]

CATEGORIES: Iraqi insurgency

The Challenge Project was an insurgency plan orchestrated by Directorate 14. Special Operations, a branch of Iraqi Intelligence Service. The Challenge Project was Saddam Hussein's pre-US invasion (see Iraq War) backup plan for establishing a long-term insurgency designed to inhibit the American occupation of Iraq. 
On the eve of the US-lead invasion of Iraq, Directorate 14. Special Operations was instructed to establish a network of intelligence agents who specialized in guerilla warfare. These agents were instructed to wait until the American military was fully entrenched in the occupation of Iraq before starting insurgent activities.
