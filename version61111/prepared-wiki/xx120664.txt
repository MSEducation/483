MKS Toolkit is a software package produced and maintained by MKS Inc. that provides a Unix-like environment for scripting, connectivity and porting Unix and Linux software to both 32- and 64-bit Microsoft Windows systems. It was originally created for MS-DOS.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.crn.com/reviews/applications-os/23900573/mks-makes-unix-migration-an-easy-task.htm|title=MKS Makes Unix Migration An Easy Task|author=Mario Morejon|date=2004-07-16|publisher=CRN[/tpl]
In 1999, MKS acquired a company based in Fairfax, Virginia, called Datafocus Inc. The Datafocus product NuTCRACKER had included the MKS Toolkit since 1994 as part of its Unix compatibility technology. The MKS Toolkit was also licensed by Microsoft for the first two versions of their Windows Services for Unix, but later dropped in favor of Interix after Microsoft purchased the latter company.
