</ref> Another study examined the change in the methane concentration in the atmosphere at the end of the [[Pleistocene epoch]] after the extinction of megafauna in the Americas. After early humans migrated to the Americas about 13,000 [[Before Present|BP]], their hunting and other associated ecological impacts led to the extinction of many megafaunal species there. Calculations suggest that this extinction decreased methane production by about 9.6 million tons per year. This suggests that the absence of megafaunal methane emissions may have contributed to the abrupt climatic cooling at the onset of the [[Younger Dryas]].<ref name = "Smith"/> The decrease in atmospheric methane that occurred at that time, as recorded in [[ice core]]s, was 2-4 times more rapid than any other decrease in the last half million years, suggesting that an unusual mechanism was at work.<ref name = "Smith"/>
