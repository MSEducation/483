Bishop Etienne succeeded Bishop David Ricken, who was transferred to the Diocese of Green Bay in July 2008. 
Etienne noted when he received the appointment. Describing how heard he noted that: "It was bizarre. I don’t know what else to say. papal nuncio Archbishop Sambi called the office at the parish and it was my day off. We had to play phone tag. I was up at the family farm with a chain saw, working in the woods. And, when he called, I was just getting out of my pickup truck. I was in my Carhart jeans and in my work boots, and had nothing to take notes with. I was just sitting there in my truck listening to him tell me that I’ve just been named bishop. And he had to say ‘Cheyenne’ four times before I could understand what he was saying."
He was consecrated on December 9, 2009 and took possession of the see on the same day.
