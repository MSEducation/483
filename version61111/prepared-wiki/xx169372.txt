Hayward City Hall is the third and current Hayward city hall building, located in downtown Hayward, California, USA. next to the Hayward BART Station. The city hall opened in January 1998, replacing the abandoned City Center Building, which served as Hayward's city hall for 29 years from 1969 to 1998. Hayward's first city hall, which is also closed to the public, is now in the Alex Giualini Plaza, three blocks away.

==Earthquake preparedness==

Since the building is located close to the Hayward Fault, it was designed to withstand a major earthquake.Seismic Isolation of Hayward City Hall, Earthquake Protection Systems, Inc. The inability of the Hayward City Center building to withstand a major earthquake, shown by damage to it from the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, was the main motivation for the new city hall's construction.
