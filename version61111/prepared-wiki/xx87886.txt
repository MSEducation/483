Description: Introduced Fourier analysis, specifically Fourier series. Key contribution was to not simply use trigonometric series, but to model all functions by trigonometric series.
When Fourier submitted his paper in 1807, the committee (which included Lagrange, Laplace, Malus and Legendre, among others) concluded: ...the manner in which the author arrives at these equations is not exempt of difficulties and ...  his analysis to integrate them still leaves something to be desired on the score of generality and even rigour. Making Fourier series rigorous, which in detail took over a century, led directly to a number of developments in analysis, notably the rigorous statement of the integral via the Dirichlet integral and later the Lebesgue integral.

====Sur la convergence des séries trigonométriques qui servent à représenter une fonction arbitraire entre des limites données====

===Baudhayana Sulba Sutra===

Description: Written around the 8th century BC[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2010|reason=no manuscript survives from anywhere near that early[/tpl], this is one of the oldest geometrical texts. It laid the foundations of Indian mathematics and was influential in South Asia and its surrounding regions, and perhaps even Greece. Among the important geometrical discoveries included in this text are: the earliest list of Pythagorean triples discovered algebraically, the earliest statement of the Pythagorean theorem,  geometric solutions of linear equations, several approximations of π, the first use of irrational numbers, and an accurate computation of the square root of 2, correct to a remarkable five decimal places. Though this was primarily a geometrical text, it also contained some important algebraic developments, including the earliest use of quadratic equations of the forms ax2 = c and ax2 + bx = c, and integral solutions of simultaneous Diophantine equations with up to four unknowns.

===Euclid's Elements===

Publication data: c. 300 BC
Online version: Interactive Java version
Description: This is often regarded as not only the most important work in geometry but one of the most important works in mathematics. It contains many important results in geometry, number theory and the first algorithm as well.  More than any specific result in the publication, it seems that the major achievement of this publication is the popularization of logic and mathematical proof as a method of solving problems.

===The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art===

Description: This was a Chinese mathematics book, mostly geometric, composed during the Han Dynasty, perhaps as early as 200 BC. It remained the most important textbook in China and East Asia for over a thousand years, similar to the position of Euclid's Elements in Europe. Among its contents: Linear problems solved using the principle known later in the West as the rule of false position. Problems with several unknowns, solved by a principle similar to Gaussian elimination. Problems involving the principle known in the West as the Pythagorean theorem. The earliest solution of a matrix using a method equivalent to the modern method.

===The Conics===

Description: The Conics was written by Apollonius of Perga, a Greek mathematician. His innovative methodology and terminology, especially in the field of conics, influenced many later scholars including Ptolemy, Francesco Maurolico, Isaac Newton, and René Descartes. It was Apollonius who gave the ellipse, the parabola, and the hyperbola the names by which we know them.

===Surya Siddhanta===

Description: Contains the roots of modern trigonometry. It describes the archeo-astronomy theories, principles and methods of the ancient Hindus. This siddhanta is supposed to be the knowledge that the Sun god gave to an Asura called Maya. It uses sine (jya), cosine (kojya or "perpendicular sine") and inverse sine (otkram jya) for the first time, and also contains the earliest use of the tangent and secant. Later Indian mathematicians such as Aryabhata made references to this text, while later Arabic and Latin translations were very influential in Europe and the Middle East.

===Aryabhatiya===

Description: This was a highly influential text during the Golden Age of mathematics in India. The text was highly concise and therefore elaborated upon in commentaries by later mathematicians. It made significant contributions to geometry and astronomy, including introduction of sine/ cosine, determination of the approximate value of pi and accurate calculation of the earth's circumference.

===La Géométrie===

Description: La Géométrie was published in 1637 and written by René Descartes. The book was influential in developing the Cartesian coordinate system and specifically discussed the representation of points of a plane, via real numbers; and the representation of curves, via equations.

===Grundlagen der Geometrie===

Online version: English
Publication data:  

Description: Hilbert's axiomatization of geometry, whose primary influence was in its pioneering approach to metamathematical questions including the use of models to prove axiom independence and the importance of establishing the consistency and completeness of an axiomatic system.

===Regular Polytopes===

Description: Regular Polytopes is a comprehensive survey of the geometry of regular polytopes, the generalisation of regular polygons and regular polyhedra to higher dimensions. Originating with an essay entitled Dimensional Analogy written in 1923, the first edition of the book took Coxeter 24 years to complete. Originally written in 1947, the book was updated and republished in 1963 and 1973.

==Topology==

===Analysis situs===

Description: Poincaré's Analysis Situs and his Compléments à l'Analysis Situs laid the general foundations for algebraic topology.  In these papers, Poincaré introduced the notions of homology and the fundamental group, provided an early formulation of Poincaré duality, gave the Euler–Poincaré characteristic for chain complexes, and mentioned several important conjectures including the Poincaré conjecture.

===L'anneau d'homologie d'une représentation, Structure de l'anneau d'homologie d'une représentation===

Description: These two Comptes Rendus notes of Leray from 1946 introduced the novel concepts of sheafs, sheaf cohomology, and spectral sequences, which he had developed during his years of captivity as a prisoner of war.  Leray's announcements and applications (published in other Comptes Rendus notes from 1946) drew immediate attention from other mathematicians.  Subsequent clarification, development, and generalization by Henri Cartan, Jean-Louis Koszul, Armand Borel, Jean-Pierre Serre, and Leray himself allowed these concepts to be understood and applied to many other areas of mathematics.[tpl]Cite web| last = Miller | first = Haynes | title = Leray in Oflag XVIIA: The origins of sheaf theory, sheaf cohomology, and spectral sequences | work = | publisher = | year = 2000 | url = http://www-math.mit.edu/~hrm/papers/ss.ps | format = ps[/tpl]  Dieudonné would later write that these notions created by Leray "undoubtedly rank at the same level in the history of mathematics as the methods invented by Poincaré and Brouwer".[tpl]Cite book| last = Dieudonné | first = Jean | title = A history of algebraic and differential topology 1900–1960 | publisher = Birkhäuser | year = 1989 | pages = 123–141 | isbn = 0-8176-3388-X[/tpl]

===Quelques propriétés globales des variétés differentiables===

Description: In this paper, Thom proved the Thom transversality theorem, introduced the notions of oriented and unoriented cobordism, and demonstrated that cobordism groups could be computed as the homotopy groups of certain Thom spaces.  Thom completely characterized the unoriented cobordism ring and achieved strong results for several problems, including Steenrod's problem on the realization of cycles.[tpl]Cite book| last = Dieudonné | first = Jean | title = A history of algebraic and differential topology 1900–1960 | publisher = Birkhäuser | year = 1989 | pages = 556–575 | isbn = 0-8176-3388-X[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal| last = Sullivan  | first = Dennis  |date=April 2004 | title = René Thom's Work On Geometric Homology And Bordism | journal = Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society  | volume = 41  | issue = 3  | pages = 341–350  | url = http://www.ams.org/bull/2004-41-03/S0273-0979-04-01026-2/S0273-0979-04-01026-2.pdf | format = PDF  | doi = 10.1090/S0273-0979-04-01026-2[/tpl]

==Category theory==

===General theory of natural equivalences===

Description: The first paper on category theory. Mac Lane later wrote in Categories for the Working Mathematician that he and Eilenberg introduced categories so that they could introduce functors, and they introduced functors so that they could introduce natural equivalences. Prior to this paper, "natural" was used in an informal and imprecise way to designate constructions that could be made without making any choices. Afterwards, "natural" had a precise meaning which occurred in a wide variety of contexts and had powerful and important consequences.

===Categories for the Working Mathematician===

Description: Saunders Mac Lane, one of the founders of category theory, wrote this exposition to bring categories to the masses.  Mac Lane brings to the fore the important concepts that make category theory useful, such as adjoint functors and universal properties.

==Set theory==

===Über eine Eigenschaft des Inbegriffes aller reellen algebraischen Zahlen===

Online version: Online version
Description: Contains the first proof that the set of all real numbers is uncountable; also contains a proof that the set of algebraic numbers is denumerable. (For history and controversies about this article, see Cantor's first uncountability proof.)

===Grundzüge der Mengenlehre===

Description: First published in 1914, this was the first comprehensive introduction to set theory. Besides the systematic treatment of known results in set theory, the book also contains chapters on measure theory and topology, which were then still considered parts of set theory. Here Hausdorff presents and develops highly original material which was later to become the basis for those areas.

===The consistency of the axiom of choice and of the generalized continuum-hypothesis with the axioms of set theory===

Description: Gödel proves the results of the title.  Also, in the process, introduces the class L of constructible sets, a major influence in the development of axiomatic set theory.

===The Independence of the Continuum Hypothesis===

Description: Cohen's breakthrough work proved the independence of the continuum hypothesis and axiom of choice with respect to Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory.  In proving this Cohen introduced the concept of forcing which led to many other major results in axiomatic set theory.

==Logic==

===Begriffsschrift===

Description: Published in 1879, the title Begriffsschrift is usually translated as concept writing or concept notation; the full title of the book identifies it as "a formula language, modelled on that of arithmetic, of pure thought". Frege's motivation for developing his formal logical system was similar to Leibniz's desire for a calculus ratiocinator. Frege defines a logical calculus to support his research in the foundations of mathematics. Begriffsschrift is both the name of the book and the calculus defined therein.  It was arguably the most significant publication in logic since Aristotle.

===Formulario mathematico===

Description: First published in 1895, the Formulario mathematico was the first mathematical book written entirely in a formalized language. It contained a description of mathematical logic and many important theorems in other branches of mathematics. Many of the notations introduced in the book are now in common use.

===Principia Mathematica===

Description: The Principia Mathematica is a three-volume work on the foundations of mathematics, written by Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead and published in 1910–1913. It is an attempt to derive all mathematical truths from a well-defined set of axioms and inference rules in symbolic logic. The questions remained whether a contradiction could be derived from the Principia's axioms, and whether there exists a mathematical statement which could neither be proven nor disproven in the system. These questions were settled, in a rather surprising way, by Gödel's incompleteness theorem in 1931.

===Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals===

===Über formal unentscheidbare Sätze der Principia Mathematica und verwandter Systeme, I===

(On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems)

Description: In mathematical logic, Gödel's incompleteness theorems are two celebrated theorems proved by Kurt Gödel in 1931.
The first incompleteness theorem states:
 
 

==Combinatorics==

===On sets of integers containing no k elements in arithmetic progression===

Description:  Settled a conjecture of Paul Erdős and Paul Turán (now known as Szemerédi's theorem) that if a sequence of natural numbers has positive upper density then it contains arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions.  Szemerédi's solution has been described as a "masterpiece of combinatorics"[tpl]Cite journal|date=April 2008 | title = 2008 Steele Prizes; Seminal Contribution to Research: Endre Szemerédi  | journal = Notices of the American Mathematical Society  | volume = 55  | issue = 4  | page = 488  | url = http://www.ams.org/notices/200804/tx080400486p.pdf  | format = PDF  | accessdate = 19 July 2008[/tpl] and it introduced new ideas and tools to the field including a weak form of the Szemerédi regularity lemma.[tpl]Cite journal|date=April 2013 | title = Interview with Endre Szemerédi  | journal = Notices of the American Mathematical Society  | volume = 60  | issue = 2  | page = 226  | url = http://www.ams.org/notices/201302/rnoti-p221.pdf  | format = PDF  | accessdate = 27 January 2013[/tpl]

===Graph theory===

====Solutio problematis ad geometriam situs pertinentis====

Description: Euler's solution of the Königsberg bridge problem in Solutio problematis ad geometriam situs pertinentis (The solution of a problem relating to the geometry of position) is considered to be the first theorem of graph theory.

====On the evolution of random graphs====

==Game theory==

===Zur Theorie der Gesellschaftsspiele===

Description: Went well beyond Émile Borel's initial investigations into strategic two-person game theory by proving the minimax theorem for two-person, zero-sum games.

===Theory of Games and Economic Behavior===

Description: This book led to the investigation of modern game theory as a prominent branch of mathematics. This profound work contained the method for finding optimal solutions for two-person zero-sum games.

===Equilibrium Points in N-person Games===

Description:Nash equilibrium

===On Numbers and Games===

Description: The book is in two, {0,1, parts. The zeroth part is about numbers, the first part about games – both the values of games and also some real games that can be played such as Nim, Hackenbush, Col and Snort amongst the  many described.

===Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays===

Description: A compendium of information on mathematical games.  It was first published in 1982 in two volumes, one focusing on Combinatorial game theory and surreal numbers, and the other concentrating on a number of specific games.

==Fractals==

===How Long Is the Coast of Britain? Statistical Self-Similarity and Fractional Dimension===

Description: A discussion of self-similar curves that have fractional dimensions between 1 and 2. These curves are examples of fractals, although Mandelbrot does not use this term in the paper, as he did not coin it until 1975.
Shows Mandelbrot's early thinking on fractals, and is an example of the linking of mathematical objects with natural forms that was a theme of much of his later work.

==Numerical analysis==

===Optimization===

====Method of Fluxions====

Description: Method of Fluxions was a book written by Isaac Newton. The book was completed in 1671, and published in 1736.  Within this book, Newton describes a method (the Newton–Raphson method) for finding the real zeroes of a function.

====Essai d'une nouvelle méthode pour déterminer les maxima et les minima des formules intégrales indéfinies====

Description: Major early work on the calculus of variations, building upon some of Lagrange's prior investigations as well as those of Euler.  Contains investigations of minimal surface determination as well as the initial appearance of Lagrange multipliers.

====Математические методы организации и планирования производства====

Description: Kantorovich wrote the first paper on production planning, which used Linear Programs as the model. He received the Nobel prize for this work in 1975.

====Decomposition Principle for Linear Programs====

Description: Dantzig's is considered the father of linear programming in the western world. He independently invented the simplex algorithm. Dantzig and Wolfe worked on decomposition algorithms for large-scale linear programs in factory and production planning.

====How good is the simplex algorithm?====

Description: Klee and Minty gave an example showing that the simplex algorithm can take exponentially many steps to solve a linear program.

====Полиномиальный алгоритм в линейном программировании====

Description: Khachiyan's work on Ellipsoid method. This was the first polynomial time algorithm for linear programming.

==Early manuscripts==

These are publications that are not necessarily relevant to a mathematician nowadays, but are nonetheless important publications in the history of mathematics.

===Rhind Mathematical Papyrus===

Description: It is one of the oldest mathematical texts, dating to the Second Intermediate Period of ancient Egypt. It was copied by the scribe Ahmes (properly Ahmose) from an older Middle Kingdom papyrus. It laid the foundations of Egyptian mathematics and in turn, later influenced Greek and Hellenistic mathematics. Besides describing how to obtain an approximation of π only missing the mark by less than one per cent, it is describes one of the earliest attempts at squaring the circle and in the process provides persuasive evidence against the theory that the Egyptians deliberately built their pyramids to enshrine the value of π in the proportions. Even though it would be a strong overstatement to suggest that the papyrus represents even rudimentary attempts at analytical geometry, Ahmes did make use of a kind of an analogue of the cotangent.

===Archimedes Palimpsest===

Description: Although the only mathematical tools at its author's disposal were what we might now consider secondary-school geometry, he used those methods with rare brilliance, explicitly using infinitesimals to solve problems that would now be treated by integral calculus.  Among those problems were that of the center of gravity of a solid hemisphere, that of the center of gravity of a frustum of a circular paraboloid, and that of the area of a region bounded by a parabola and one of its secant lines.  For explicit details of the method used, see Archimedes' use of infinitesimals.

===The Sand Reckoner===

Online version: Online version
Description: The first known (European) system of number-naming that can be expanded beyond the needs of everyday life.

==Textbooks==

===Synopsis of Pure Mathematics===

Description: Contains over 6000 theorems of mathematics, assembled by George Shoobridge Carr for the purpose of training students in the art of mathematics, studied extensively by Ramanujan. (first half here) It was one of the few books that attempts to summarize the entirety of known mathematics.

===Arithmetick: or, The Grounde of Arts===

Description: Written in 1542, it was the first really popular arithmetic book written in the English Language.

===Cocker's Arithmetick===

Description: Textbook of arithmetic published in 1678 by John Hawkins, who claimed to have edited manuscripts left by Edward Cocker, who had died in 1676.  This influential mathematics textbook used to teach arithmetic in schools in the United Kingdom for over 150 years.

===The Schoolmaster's Assistant, Being a Compendium of Arithmetic both Practical and Theoretical===

Description: An early and popular English arithmetic textbook published in America in the 18th century. The book reached from the introductory topics to the advanced in five sections.

===Geometry===

Publication data: 1892
Description: The most widely used and influential textbook in Russian mathematics. (See Kiselyov page and MAA review.)

===A Course of Pure Mathematics===

Description: A classic textbook in introductory mathematical analysis, written by G. H. Hardy. It was first published in 1908, and went through many editions. It was intended to help reform mathematics teaching in the UK, and more specifically in the University of Cambridge, and in schools preparing pupils to study mathematics at Cambridge.  As such, it was aimed directly at "scholarship level" students — the top 10% to 20% by ability. The book contains a large number of difficult problems. The content covers introductory calculus and the theory of infinite series.

===Moderne Algebra===

Description: The first introductory textbook (graduate level) expounding the abstract approach to algebra developed by Emil Artin and Emmy Noether.  First published in German in 1931 by Springer Verlag.  A later English translation was published in 1949 by Frederick Ungar Publishing Company.

===Algebra===

Description: A definitive introductory text for abstract algebra using a category theoretic approach. Both a rigorous introduction from first principles, and a reasonably comprehensive survey of the field.

===Calculus, Vol. 1===

===Algebraic Geometry===

Description: The first comprehensive introductory (graduate level) text in algebraic geometry that used the language of schemes and cohomology.  Published in 1977, it lacks aspects of the scheme language which are nowadays considered central, like the functor of points.

===Naive Set Theory===

Description: An undergraduate introduction to not-very-naive set theory which has lasted for decades.  It is still considered by many to be the best introduction to set theory for beginners.  While the title states that it is naive, which is usually taken to mean without axioms, the book does introduce all the axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory and gives correct and rigorous definitions for basic objects.  Where it differs from a "true" axiomatic set theory book is its character: There are no long-winded discussions of axiomatic minutiae, and there is next to nothing about topics like large cardinals.  Instead it aims, and succeeds, in being intelligible to someone who has never thought about set theory before.

===Cardinal and Ordinal Numbers===

Description:The nec plus ultra reference for basic facts about cardinal and ordinal numbers.  If you have a question about the cardinality of sets occurring in everyday mathematics, the first place to look is this book, first published in the early 1950s but based on the author's lectures on the subject over the preceding 40 years.

===Set Theory: An Introduction to Independence Proofs===

Description: This book is not really for beginners, but graduate students with some minimal experience in set theory and formal logic will find it a valuable self-teaching tool, particularly in regard to forcing. It is far easier to read than a true reference work such as Jech, Set Theory. It may be the best textbook from which to learn forcing, though it has the disadvantage that the exposition of forcing relies somewhat on the earlier presentation of Martin's axiom.

===Topologie===

Description: First published round 1935, this text was a pioneering "reference" text book in topology, already incorporating many modern concepts from set-theoretic topology, homological algebra and homotopy theory.

===General Topology===

Description:First published in 1955,for many years the only introductory graduate level textbook in the U.S.A. teaching the basics of point set, as opposed to algebraic, topology. Prior to this the material, essential for advanced study in many fields, was only available in bits and pieces from texts on other topics or journal articles.

===Topology from the Differentiable Viewpoint===

Description: This short book introduces the main concepts of differential topology in Milnor's lucid and concise style.  While the book does not cover very much, its topics are explained beautifully in a way that illuminates all their details.

===Number Theory, An approach through history from Hammurapi to Legendre===

Description: An historical study of number theory, written by one of the 20th century's greatest researchers in the field.  The book covers some thirty six centuries of arithmetical work but the bulk of it is devoted to a detailed study and exposition of the work of Fermat, Euler, Lagrange, and Legendre.  The author wishes to take the reader into the workshop of his subjects to share their successes and failures. A rare opportunity to see the historical development of a subject through the mind of one of its greatest practitioners.

===An Introduction to the Theory of Numbers===

Description: An Introduction to the Theory of Numbers was first published in 1938, and is still in print, with the latest edition being the 6th (2008). It is likely that almost every serious student and researcher into number theory has consulted this book, and probably has it on their bookshelf. It was not intended to be a textbook, and is rather an introduction to a wide range of differing areas of number theory which would now almost certainly be covered in separate volumes. The writing style has long been regarded as exemplary, and the approach gives insight into a variety of areas without requiring much more than a good grounding in algebra, calculus and complex numbers.

===Foundations of Differential Geometry===

===Hodge Theory and Complex Algebraic Geometry I===

===Hodge Theory and Complex Algebraic Geometry II===

==Popular writing==

===Gödel, Escher, Bach===

Description: Gödel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid is a Pulitzer Prize-winning book, first published in 1979 by Basic Books.
It is a book about how the creative achievements of logician Kurt Gödel, artist M. C. Escher and composer Johann Sebastian Bach interweave. As the author states: "I realized that to me, Gödel and Escher and Bach were only shadows cast in different directions by some central solid essence. I tried to reconstruct the central object, and came up with this book."

===The World of Mathematics===

Description:  The World of Mathematics was specially designed to make mathematics more accessible to the inexperienced. It comprises nontechnical essays on every aspect of the vast subject, including articles by and about scores of eminent mathematicians, as well as literary figures, economists, biologists, and many other eminent thinkers. Includes the work of Archimedes, Galileo, Descartes, Newton, Gregor Mendel, Edmund Halley, Jonathan Swift, John Maynard Keynes, Henri Poincaré, Lewis Carroll, George Boole, Bertrand Russell, Alfred North Whitehead, John von Neumann, and many others. In addition, an informative commentary by distinguished scholar James R. Newman precedes each essay or group of essays, explaining their relevance and context in the history and development of mathematics. Originally published in 1956, it does not include many of the exciting discoveries of the later years of the 20th century but it has no equal as a general historical survey of important topics and applications.
