CATEGORIES: British rugs and carpets, Embroidery

The Bradford Carpet is a canvas work embroidery made in the early 17th century (ca. 1600â€“1615) that originally belonged to the Earl of Bradford at Castle Bromwich.Digby 1964, p. 102, plates 46 and 47
The carpet measures [tpl]convert|16|x|6|ft[/tpl]. In the Victoria and Albert Museum it covers an entire wall. However, it was made neither for wall nor floor, but as a table covering.  Its [tpl]convert|17|in|mm|adj=mid|-wide[/tpl] border was designed to hang down over the edges of a table, and it would have been removed or covered with a linen cloth when the table was used.V&A Museum, Life in Tudor and Stuart times
The carpet is worked with silk embroidery thread in tent stitch on a linen ground.Levey & King 1993, p. 23 The stitching is very fine (400 stitches/inch, 62 stitches/cm) and was worked in at least 23 different colours.  The tension of the tent stitches over time has distorted the shape of the carpet.  It is characteristic of professional canvas work popular for furnishings in the Elizabethan era.  The field design is a grape vine trellis.  The border, thought to represent human progression from a wild state to civilisation,Levey & King 1993, p. 16 depicts a variety of country pursuits set against a pastoral landscape, described as "perhaps the finest range of genre scenes to come down to us from Elizabethan times". A manor house, shepherd, travelling vendor with his packhorse, lords and ladies, hunting scenes, milkmaids, millers, water mills and windmills are all shown.
