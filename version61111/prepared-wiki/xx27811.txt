Matthew George Easton's Illustrated Bible Dictionary, Third Edition, published in 1897 (three years after Easton's death) by Thomas Nelson, contains nearly 4,000 entries relating to the Bible, from a 19th-century. Many of the entries in Easton's are encyclopedic in nature, though there are also short, dictionary-like entries. Because of its age, it is now a public domain resource.
