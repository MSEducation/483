Paris Las Vegas is a hotel and casino located on the Las Vegas Strip in Paradise, Nevada. The property is owned and operated by Caesars Entertainment Corp. As its name suggests, its theme is the city of Paris, France; it includes a half scale, [tpl]convert|541|ft|m|adj=on[/tpl] tall replica of the Eiffel Tower, a sign in the shape of the Montgolfier balloon, a two-thirds size Arc de Triomphe, a replica of La Fontaine des Mers, and a 1,200-seat theatre called Le Théâtre des Arts. The front of the hotel suggests the Paris Opera House and the Louvre.
The Paris is linked via a promenade to its sister property, Bally's Las Vegas, through which it is linked to the Las Vegas Monorail.

==History==

In May 1995, the project was announced by Bally Entertainment, owner of the adjacent Bally's Las Vegas, at a shareholders meeting. Paris was designed by architectural companies Leidenfrost/Horowitz & Assoc.(LHA a division of gkkworks), Bergman, Walls & Assoc. and MBH Architects. The architect of the project was Bergman Walls Associates.
The ground was broken for the Paris Las Vegas on April 18, 1997. The cost of the Paris was estimated at $760 million. Construction on the project began in May 1997 and was completed in April 1999. When the scale model of the Eiffel Tower was designed, it was planned to be full scale, but the airport was too close and the tower had to be shrunk. The scale is approximately 1:2. The property that the Paris Las Vegas is built on covers [tpl]convert|24|acre[/tpl]. The hotel is 33 stories tall. A unique architectural aspect of the Paris is that the back legs of its Eiffel Tower actually come down through the ceiling into the casino floor. 
Paris Las Vegas opened on September 1, 1999, with fireworks being shot from the Eiffel Tower. French actress Catherine Deneuve flipped a switch, turning on all of Paris' lights, including the various crystal chandeliers in the main lobby.
On January 31, 2007, Paris Las Vegas premiered their new show The Producers, headlined by David Hasselhoff. There were continuing issues regarding Hasselhoff, as he was not showing up to the shows. Hasselhoff decided to leave the show, and The Producers refocused on Max, played by Tony Danza. Danza came on as the celebrity actor for the show until The Producers closed on February 9, 2008. Barry Manilow has headlined at the Paris since March 6, 2010.
To counter the 2008-2009 economic downturn, Harrah's focused on marketing its properties to specific segments of the population; as a result Paris is being marketed heavily towards gay and lesbian travelers.Arnold M.

Beginning in 2010, Caesars Entertainment Corp. has begun a series of improvement projects that will see some removal of the Parisian theme. Caesars is beginning to phase out the French greeters around the property, and in early 2010 begun a major remodel project at the front entrance. The project debuted in Spring 2011 and includes a new nightclub dubbed 'Chateau' and the largest Sugar Factory store on the Strip. It was announced in early December 2010 that the hotel's famous steakhouse Les Artisies would close at the end of January 2011 to make way for Gordon Ramsay Steak. The controversial icon's restaurant opened in June 2011.
It is expected that as of March 5, 2011[tpl]Update after|2011|8|31[/tpl] a new nightclub called Chateau is to be opened in the Paris Hotel. The new nightclub overlooking the Strip will span more than [tpl]convert|45000|sqft|m2[/tpl] in a two-story, outdoor-setting. Outside, guests will find a [tpl]convert|10000|sqft|m2|adj=on[/tpl] terrace overlooking the Strip with VIP cabanas and three additional bars. During the day, the terrace will serve as a beer garden and restaurant, opening at 10 a.m.Lasvegassun.com
