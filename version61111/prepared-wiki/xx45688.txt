</ref> A similar story exists for another Greek bishop, [[Saint Nicholas]] of Myra. Over the centuries the two legends have blended together, though the Western [[Santa Claus]] remains associated with Nicholas, while the Eastern "Santa" is identified with Basil.
Saint Basil died on January 1, and the Eastern Orthodox Church celebrates his feast day together with that of the Feast of the Circumcision on that day. This was also the day on which the Roman Catholic calendar of saints celebrated it at first; but in the 13th century it was moved to June 14, a date believed to be that of his ordination as bishop, and it remained on that date until the 1969 revision of the calendar, which moved it to January 2, rather than January 1, because the latter date is occupied by the Solemnity of Mary, Mother of God. On January 2 Saint Basil is celebrated together with Saint Gregory Nazianzen.Calendarium Romanum, Libreria Editrice Vaticana 1969, p. 84 Some traditionalist Catholics continue to observe pre-1970 calendars.
The Church of England celebrates Saint Basil's feast on January 2, but the Episcopal Church and the Anglican Church of Canada celebrate it on June 14.http://prayerbook.ca/the-prayer-book-online/57-the-calendar-ix
In the Byzantine Rite, January 30 is the Synaxis of the Three Holy Hierarchs, in honor of Saint Basil, Saint Gregory the Theologian and Saint John Chrysostom.
The Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria celebrates the feast day of Saint Basil on the 6th of Tobi (6th of Terr on the Ethiopian calendar of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church). At present, this corresponds to January 14, January 15 during leap year.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2008[/tpl]
The Macedonian Orthodox Church celebrates Saint Basil's feast on January 14. He is considered as one of the greatest saints in the Christianity and is called St. Basil the Great (Macedonian: Свети Василиј Велики).http://www.kurir.mk/makedonija/vesti/56976-Sveti-Vasilij-Veliki-?-Vecen-zastitnik-na-pravoslavnite?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+kurir%2Fmakedonija+%28%D0%9A%D1%83%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%80+-+%D0%9C%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%98%D0%B0%29
There are numerous relics of Saint Basil throughout the world. One of the most important is his head, which is preserved to this day at the monastery of the Great Lavra on Mount Athos in Greece. The mythical sword Durandal is said to contain some of Basil's blood.Keary (1882), p. 512
