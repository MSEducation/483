[[Zimbabwe at the Rugby World Cup]]

CATEGORIES: Rugby union in Zimbabwe, Rugby World Cup by nation, Zimbabwe national rugby union team

Zimbabwe have made two Rugby World Cup appearances – in 1987 and 1991.
In the 1987 Rugby World Cup, Zimbabwe were invited as the African entrant. No other African countries were invited, as South Africa was disqualified from the tournament on the basis of the continuing racist apartheid regime.
However, Zimbabwe succeeded in getting through 1991 Rugby World Cup qualifying, and hosted the Africa qualifications. In more recent years, Namibia has tended to beat them in African qualifying rounds, and Ivory Coast has also got through.
