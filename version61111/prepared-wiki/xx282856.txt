[[Brezis–Gallouet inequality]]

CATEGORIES: Mathematical analysis, Inequalities

In mathematical analysis, the Brezis–Gallouet inequality,Nonlinear Schrödinger evolution equation,  Nonlinear Analysis TMA 4, 677. (1980) named after Haïm Brezis and Thierry Gallouet, is an inequality valid in 2 spatial dimensions.   It shows that a function of two variables which is sufficiently smooth is (essentially) bounded, and provides an explicit bound, which depends only logarithmically on the second deivatives.  It is useful in the study of partial differential equations.
