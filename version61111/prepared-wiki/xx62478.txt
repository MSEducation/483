[[Nine Lessons and Carols]]

CATEGORIES: Christian liturgies, Christmas traditions

The Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols is a service of Christian worship celebrating the birth of Jesus that is traditionally followed at Christmas. The story of the fall of humanity, the promise of the Messiah, and the birth of Jesus is told in nine short Bible readings from Genesis, the prophetic books and the Gospels, interspersed with the singing of Christmas carols, hymns and choir music.
The format was based on an Order drawn up by Edward Benson, later Archbishop of Canterbury but at that time Bishop of Truro, in Cornwall, for use on Christmas Eve (24 December) 1880. Tradition says that he organized a 10:00 p.m. service on Christmas Eve in a temporary wooden structure serving as his cathedral[tpl]cite news|title=Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cornwall/content/articles/2005/12/16/faith_nine_lessons_feature.shtml|publisher=bbc.co.uk|date=16 December 2005[/tpl] and that the purpose of the service was to keep men out of the pubs.[tpl]citation|author=Alex Webb|title=Choir that sings to the world|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/1703517.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=24 December 2001[/tpl].
The original liturgy has since been adapted and used by other churches all over the world. Lessons and Carols most often occur in Anglican churches. However, numerous Christian denominations have adopted this service, or a variation on this service, as part of their Christmas celebrations. In the UK, the service has become the standard format for schools' Christmas carol services.
The best-known version is broadcast annually from King's College, Cambridge, on Christmas Eve. It features carols sung by the famous Choir of King's College. Groton School of Groton, Massachusetts, has performed the festival longer than any institution other than King's, holding its first Lessons and Carols in 1928.

==Service at King's College, Cambridge==

The first Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols at King's College, Cambridge, was held on Christmas Eve in 1918. It was conceived by Eric Milner-White, the Dean of the College, whose experience as an army chaplain had led him to believe that more imaginative worship was needed by the Church of England. The order of service was adapted from the order created by Benson for Truro Cathedral 38 years earlier, based on an idea from the future Bishop of Edinburgh, George Walpole.[tpl]citation|title=Nine lessons and carols: History of the service|url=http://www.kings.cam.ac.uk/chapel/ninelessons/history.html|publisher=King's College Chapel|accessdate=2008-03-09[/tpl].
The music at the first service at King's was directed by Arthur Henry Mann, who was the organist from 1876 to 1929. The choir had 16 trebles as specified in statutes laid down by Henry VI, and until 1927 the men's voices were provided by choral scholars and lay clerks. Today, 14 undergraduates from the Choir of King's College, Cambridge, sing the men's parts.
The service was first broadcast by the British Broadcasting Corporation in 1928 and, except for 1930, has been broadcast every year since. During the 1930s the BBC began broadcasting the service on its overseas programmes. Even throughout World War II, despite the stained glass having been removed from the Chapel and the lack of heating, the broadcasts continued. For security reasons, the name "King's" was not mentioned during wartime broadcasts. Since World War II it has been estimated that each year there are millions of listeners worldwide who listen to the service live on the BBC World Service. Domestically, the service is broadcast live on BBC Radio 4, and a recorded broadcast is made on Christmas Day on BBC Radio 3. In the USA the broadcast has been heard live on public radio stations affiliated with American Public Media since 1979, and most stations broadcast a repeat on Christmas Day. Since 1963, the service has been periodically filmed for television broadcast in the UK.[tpl]citation|title=History of A Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols|url=http://www.kings.cam.ac.uk/events/chapel-services/nine-lessons/history.html|publisher=King's College, Cambridge|accessdate=2010-12-25[/tpl]. Presently, each year a programme entitled Carols from King's is pre-recorded in early or mid-December then shown on Christmas Eve in the UK on BBC Two and BBC Four. The programme is weighted more heavily in favour of carols sung by the choir, with only seven readings in total, not all of which are from the Bible.

===Order of service===

The format of the first Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols did not differ substantially from the one known today. The order of the lessons was revised in 1919, and since that time the service has always begun with the hymn "Once in Royal David's City". These days the first verse is sung unaccompanied by a solo boy chorister. To avoid putting him under undue stress, the chorister is not told that he will be singing the solo until immediately before the service is to begin.[tpl]citation|author=Peter Kingston|title=The world's greatest carol event|url=http://education.guardian.co.uk/schools/story/0,,2231099,00.html|newspaper=The Guardian (EducationGuardian)|date=21 December 2007[/tpl].
The Nine Lessons, which are the same every year, are read by representatives of the college and of the City of Cambridge from the 1611 Authorized King James Version of the Bible in the following order: a chorister, a choral scholar, a representative of Cambridge churches, a representative of the City of Cambridge, a representative of King's College's sister college at Eton, the Chaplain, the Director of Music, a fellow of the College, and the Provost of the College. The singing is divided into "carols" which are sung by the Choir of King's College, Cambridge, and "hymns" sung by the Choir and congregation. Since 1982 the current Director of Music, Stephen Cleobury, has commissioned a new carol each year on behalf of the College for the Choir. The carols vary from year to year, although some music is repeated. The service ends with the hymn "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing". The following is from the service in 2008.[tpl]citation|title=A Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols, Christmas Eve, 2008|url=http://www.kings.cam.ac.uk/assets/1/1d/Nine_Lessons_and_Carols2008.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Provost and Fellows of King's College, Cambridge|date=24 December 2008|accessdate=2008-12-25[/tpl].

===Attendance of the service in person===

The Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols held on Christmas Eve at King's College Chapel is primarily intended for the City of Cambridge and members of the general public.[tpl]citation|title=Nine Lessons and Carols|url=http://www.kings.cam.ac.uk/chapel/ninelessons/index.html|publisher=King's College Chapel|accessdate=2008-03-10[/tpl]. There are about 650 seats in the Chapel for the service, most of which are in the Ante-Chapel;[tpl]citation|title=The Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols, King's College, Cambridge leaflet|publisher=King's College, Cambridge|date=24 December 2007[/tpl]. seats in the Choir are largely reserved for College members and their guests.
The demand for seats always exceeds the number available. Members of the public are admitted to the College through the main gate on King's Parade from 7:30 am (though some start queueing the night before),See, for instance, [tpl]citation|author=Neil Hallows|title=Queuing for King's|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6202751.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=22 December 2006[/tpl]. and each person is given an information leaflet which must be retained and shown to the duty porter for re-entry if he or she desires to leave the queue temporarily. People joining the queue before 9:00 am will usually gain admission to the Chapel, but this is not guaranteed. Porters monitor the number of people joining the queue, and once there are as many people as there are seats available, the others are advised that it is unlikely they will be able to attend the service. Members of Collegium Regale (the Choral Scholars of King's College Choir) usually sing Christmas carols to entertain the people who are queueing.
A limited number of seats are available for people unable to queue due to disability or illness. Application for such seats must be made by 31 October to the personal assistant of the Dean of King's College.
The doors of the Chapel are opened at 1:30 pm and the public allowed to find their seats. As the service is broadcast live by BBC Radio 4, at the request of the BBC it begins a little after 3:00 pm and not exactly on the hour due to an hourly radio news update. It concludes at around 4:30 pm or 4:45 pm at the earliest.

==Service at Groton School==

The Choir of Groton School, of Groton, Massachusetts, USA, has been presenting a Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols since 1928, ten years after the service began at King's. Groton has the oldest tenured Lessons and Carols service in the United States, and the second oldest in the world. The school's first organist and choirmaster, Twining Lynes, is believed to have heard the service at King's, and shortly thereafter began the tradition with his choir at Groton. In 82 years, only six organists have presided over the Groton service. Since 2011, the music has been led by Christopher Martin Hampson, a graduate of Oxford University and former Assistant Organist at St. Mary's Cathedral, Glasgow, Scotland.[tpl]citation|title=Lessons & Carols|url=http://www.groton.org/student_life/chapel/lessons_carols|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/63nT1ec72|archivedate=9 December 2011|publisher=Groton School|accessdate=9 December 2011[/tpl]; [tpl]citation|title=Organists and Scholars|url=http://thecathedral.org.uk/music/organists-and-scholars/|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20131021160550/http://thecathedral.org.uk/music/organists-and-scholars/|archivedate=21 October 2013|publisher=St. Mary's Cathedral, Glasgow|accessdate=22 November 2013[/tpl].
