[[Micrometre]]

CATEGORIES: Units of length, Orders of magnitude (length)

The micrometre (International spelling as used by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures; SI symbol: µm) or micrometer (American spelling), also commonly known as a micron, is an SI derived unit of length equaling 1×10−6 of a metre (SI standard prefix "micro-" = 10−6); that is, one millionth of a metre (or one thousandth of a millimetre, 0.001 mm, or about 0.000039 inch). The symbol µm is sometimes rendered as um if the symbol µ cannot be used, or if the writer is not aware of the distinction.
The micrometre is a common unit of measurement for wavelengths of infrared radiation as well as sizes of cells and bacteria and is also commonly used in plastics manufacturing."micrometre" Encyclopædia Britannica Online, accessed 17 March 2012
Micrometres are the standard for grading wool (referring to the diameter of wool fibres). Any wool finer than 25 µm can be used for garments, while coarser grades are used for outerwear, rugs and carpets.
The symbol for the SI prefix micro-, µ, is a Greek lowercase mu, μ. In Unicode, it has the codepoint U+00B5, distinct from that of the Greek letter lowercase mu so that machines can recognize it as the SI prefix symbol rather than as a letter. Many fonts use the same glyph for the two characters.

==SI standardisation==

The term micron, representing the micrometre, was officially accepted between 1879 and 1967, but officially revoked by the International System of Units (SI) in 1967.BIPM - Resolution 7 of the 13th CGPM (1967/68), "Abrogation of earlier decisions (micron, new candle.)" This came about because, before the official adoption of the unit prefix micro- during the creation of the SI in 1960, the symbol µ was used in isolation to denote the micron. In the SI, the systematic name micrometre became the official name of the unit, and µm became the official unit symbol.

(In spoken English they may be distinguished by pronunciation, as despite being homographs they are not homophones; the name of the measuring device is invariably stressed on the second syllable, whereas the systematic pronunciation of the unit name, in accordance with the convention for pronouncing SI units in English, places the stress on the first syllable.)
