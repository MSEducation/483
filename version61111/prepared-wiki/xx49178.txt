Arial, sometimes marketed or displayed in software as Arial MT, is a sans-serif typeface and set of computer fonts. Fonts from the Arial family are packaged with all versions of Microsoft Windows, some other Microsoft software applications,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/font.aspx?FMID=1705 |title=Arial – Products that supply this font |author=Microsoft Corporation |accessdate=2010-01-31[/tpl] Apple Mac OS X[tpl]cite web |url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1642 |title=Mac OS X 10.5: Fonts list |author=Apple Inc. |accessdate=2010-01-31| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100120085609/http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1642| archivedate= 20 January 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] and many PostScript 3 computer printers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/products/postscript/pdfs/ps3fonts.pdf|title=Adobe PostScript 3 fonts|accessdate=2011-05-04| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110605161801/http://www.adobe.com/products/postscript/pdfs/ps3fonts.pdf| archivedate= 5 June 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl] The typeface was designed in 1982 by a 10-person team, led by Robin Nicholas and Patricia Saunders, for Monotype Typography.
The Arial typeface comprises many styles: Regular, Italic, Medium, Medium Italic, Bold, Bold Italic, Black, Black Italic, Extra Bold, Extra Bold Italic, Light, Light Italic, Narrow, Narrow Italic, Narrow Bold, Narrow Bold Italic, Condensed, Light Condensed, Bold Condensed, and Extra Bold Condensed. The extended Arial type family includes even more styles: Rounded (Light, Regular, Bold, Extra Bold); Monospaced (Regular, Oblique, Bold, Bold Oblique). Many of these have been issued in multiple font configurations with different degrees of language support. The most widely used and bundled Arial fonts are Arial Regular, Italic, Bold, Bold Italic, along with the same styles of Arial Narrow, plus Arial Black. More recently Arial Rounded has also been widely bundled.

==Design characteristics==

Embedded in version 3.0 of the OpenType version of Arial is the following description of the typeface:
In 2005, Robin Nicholas said "It was designed as a generic sans serif; almost a bland sans serif."
The letter shapes of Arial are based on Monotype Grotesque.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Monotype Imaging|url=http://www.monotypeimaging.com/ProductsServices/TypeDesignerShowcase/RobinNicholas/Samples.aspx?type=samp3|title=Type Designer Showcase: Robin Nicholas – Arial|accessdate=2011-05-10[/tpl] Subtle changes and variations were made to both the letterforms and the spacing between characters in order to make it more readable at various resolutions.
The changes cause the typeface to nearly match Linotype Helvetica in both proportion and weight (see figure), and perfectly match in width. Nevertheless, there are differences. One columnist observed "Arial was drawn more rounded than Helvetica, the curves softer and fuller and the counters more open. The ends of the strokes on letters such as c, e, g and s, rather than being cut off on the horizontal, are terminated at the more natural angle in relation to the stroke direction."
The styling of Arabic glyphs comes from Times New Roman, which have more varied stroke widths than the Latin, Greek, Cyrillic glyphs found in the font. Arial Unicode MS uses monotone stroke widths on Arabic glyphs, similar to Tahoma.
The Cyrillic, Greek and Coptic Spacing Modifier Letters glyphs initially introduced in Arial Unicode MS, but later debuted in Arial version 5.00, have different appearances.
A 2010 Princeton University study involving presenting students with text in a font slightly more difficult to read found that they consistently retained more information from material displayed in so-called disfluent or ugly fonts (Monotype Corsiva, Haettenschweiler, Comic Sans Italicized were used) than in a simple, more readable font such as Arial.[tpl]Cite doi|10.1016/j.cognition.2010.09.012[/tpl]

==History==

IBM debuted two printers for the in-office publishing market in 1982: the 240-DPI 3800-3 laserxerographic printer, and the 600-DPI 4250 electro-erosion laminate typesetter.
[tpl]cite mailing list|title=Have you ever thought about the LaserWriter fonts and how you got them?|mailinglist=Typo-L|date=14 Oct 1996|last=Boag|first=Andrew|url=http://www.xnet.se/xpo/typetalk/|accessdate=9 May 2011[/tpl] "Monotype's first contract for the IBM 4250 included ... Helvetica (sub-licenced from Lino) ... When it came to the 3800 laser printer I think IBM wanted a functional equivalent to Helvetica to save on the licencing wrangles, and this is when the Arial bitmaps were first created. But IBM named all the fonts in the machine after rivers in Colorado (!) so it was initially called Sonoran Sans." Boag is a former Monotype employee.The 4250 prototype debuted at Drupa in 1982, but the production model 4250/II wasn't on the market until 1984. Monotype was under contract to supply bitmap fonts for both printers. The fonts for the 4250, delivered to IBM in 1983,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.monotypeimaging.com/aboutus/MT1982_1991.aspx|title=About Us: The Monotype Chronicles|last=Wallis|first=Lawrence W.|publisher=Monotype Imaging|accessdate=2011-05-11|quote=1983 ...

It was an association that burgeoned further with release of additional TrueType font packages in 1992 and afterwards.[/tpl]
 included Helvetica, which Monotype sub-licensed from Linotype.
 For the 3800-3, Monotype substituted Helvetica with Arial.
 The hand-drawn Arial artwork was completed in 1982 at Monotype by a 10-person team led by Robin Nicholas and Patricia Saunders

IBM named the font Sonoran Sans Serif due to licensing restrictions and the manufacturing facility's location (Tucson, Arizona, in the Sonoran Desert),

Due to licensing requirements in place at the time, the type family names used for the IBM-supplied versions of these fonts were changed from Times New Roman to Sonoran Serif and from Arial to Sonoran Sans Serif. These 240 dpi-only fonts were extensively hand-edited. Since the characters in the fonts were not derived from common databases, there is no linear progression of character size as point size increases, a requirement for migration to outline fonts. ... Since the linearity issue cannot be resolved (each character in each point size is unique and not linearly related to the same character in any other point size) there will be no outline font support for the Sonoran fonts and the migration path will stop at 300-pel..[/tpl] 
and announced in early 1984 that the Sonoran Sans Serif family, "a functional equivalent of Monotype Arial," would be available for licensed use in the 3800-3 by the fourth quarter of 1984. There were initially 14 point sizes, ranging from 6 to 36, and four style/weight combinations (Roman medium, Roman bold, italic medium, and italic bold), for a total of 56 fonts in the family. Each contained 238 graphic characters, providing support for eleven national languages: Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Swedish. Monotype and IBM later expanded the family to include 300-DPI bitmaps and characters for additional languages.
In 1989, Monotype produced PostScript Type 1 outline versions of several Monotype fonts, but an official PostScript version of Arial was not available until 1991.
[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2008[/tpl] In the meantime, a company called Birmy marketed a version of Arial in a Type 1-compatible format.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ms-studio.com/articles.html|title=The Scourge of Arial|last=Simonson|first=Mark|accessdate=2011-05-11| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110525025613/http://www.ms-studio.com/articles.html| archivedate= 25 May 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]citation|title=The Macintosh Font Book|last=Fenton|first=Erfert|publisher=Peachpit Press|year=1989|edition=1[/tpl] (Verification needed; Google Books search result only shows that Arial is mentioned.)

===TrueType/OpenType version history===

Version 2.76 or later includes Hebrew (designed by Baruch Gorkinhttp://luc.devroye.org/fonts-32904.html) and Arabic glyphs, with most of Arabic added on non-italic fonts.
Version 5.00 added support for Latin-C and Latin D, IPA Extension, Greek Extended, Cyrillic Supplement, and Coptic characters.

==Distribution==

TrueType editions of Arial have shipped as part of Microsoft Windows since the introduction of Windows 3.1 in 1992.
Since 1999, Microsoft Office has shipped with Arial Unicode MS, a version of Arial that includes many international characters from the Unicode standard. This version of the typeface is the most widely distributed pan-Unicode font.
Arial MT, a PostScript version of the Arial font family, was distributed with Acrobat Reader 4 and 5.
PostScript does not require support for a specific set of fonts, but Arial and Helvetica are among the 40 or so typeface families that PostScript Level 3 devices typically support.Adobe Systems Incorporated, PostScript Language Reference Supplement, Adobe PostScript 3, Version 3010 and 3011 Product Supplement, Appendix D, 30 August 1999. Retrieved 29 April 2006.Adobe Systems Incorporated, The Adobe PostScript 3 Font Set. Retrieved 29 April 2006.
Mac OS X was the first Mac OS version to include Arial. The operating system ships with Arial, Arial Black, Arial Narrow, and Arial Rounded MT. However, the default Mac OS X font for sans-serif/Swiss generic font family is Helvetica. The bundling of Arial with Windows and Mac OS has contributed to it being one of the most widely distributed and used typefaces in the world.
In 1996, Microsoft launched the Core fonts for the Web project to make a standard pack of fonts for the Internet. Arial in TrueType format was included in this project. The project allowed anyone to download and install these fonts for their own use (on end user's computers) without any fee. The project was terminated by Microsoft in August 2002, allegedly due to frequent EULA violations.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,3973,469394,00.asp |title=Microsoft Withdraws Free Web Fonts |author=Mark Hachman |publisher=ExtremeTech |date=14 August 2002 |accessdate=2010-04-13| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100417160545/http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,3973,469394,00.asp| archivedate= 17 April 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://typographica.org/000270.php  |title=Microsoft Cuts the Line to Web Core Fonts |author=Jesse Burgheimer |publisher=archive.org |date=13 August 2002 |accessdate=2010-04-13 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080111153435/http://typographica.org/000270.php |archivedate = 11 January 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://typographica.org/000270.php|title=Microsoft Cuts the Line to Web Core Fonts|date=13 August 2002|accessdate=2008-08-04| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080313020525/http://typographica.org/000270.php| archivedate = 13 March 2008[/tpl] For MS Windows, the core fonts for the web were provided as self-extracting executables (.exe); each included an embedded cabinet file, which can be extracted with appropriate software. For the Macintosh, the files were provided as BinHexed StuffIt archives (.sit.hqx). The latest font version that was available from Core fonts for the Web was 2.82, published in 2000. Later versions (such as version 3 or version 5 which include many new characters) were not available from this project. A Microsoft spokesman declared in 2002 that members of the open source community "will have to find different sources for updated fonts. ... Although the EULA did not restrict the fonts to just Windows and Mac OS, they were only ever available as Windows .exe's and Mac archive files." The chief technical officer of Opera Software cited the cancellation of the project as an example of Microsoft resisting interoperability.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/02/11/hakon_on_ms_interroperability/ |title=Opera to MS: Get real about interoperability, Mr Gates – Opera CTO Hakon Lie responds to Bill's clarion call |date=11 February 2005 |accessdate=2010-07-02| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100525233104/http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/02/11/hakon_on_ms_interroperability/| archivedate= 25 May 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
