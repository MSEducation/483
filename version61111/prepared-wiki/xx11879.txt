In the United States, the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) is the group most associated with the white supremacist movement. Many white supremacist groups are based on the concept of preserving genetic purity, and they do not focus solely on discrimination by skin color.http://law.jrank.org/pages/11302/White-Supremacy-Groups.html White Supremacy Groups The KKK's reasons for supporting racial segregation are not primarily based on religious ideals, but some Klan groups are openly Protestant. The KKK and other white supremacist groups like Aryan Nations, The Order and the White Patriot Party are considered Anti-Semitic.
Nazi Germany promulgated white supremacy in the belief that the Aryan race was the master race. It was combined with a eugenics programme that aimed for racial hygiene by using compulsory sterilizations and extermination of the Untermenschen (or "sub-humans"), which eventually culminated in the Holocaust.
Christian Identity is another movement closely tied to white supremacy. Some white supremacists identify themselves as Odinists, although many Odinists reject white supremacy. Some white supremacist groups, such as the South African Boeremag, conflate elements of Christianity and Odinism. The World Church of the Creator (now called the Creativity Movement) is atheistic and it denounces the Christian religion and other theistic religions.[tpl]cite book|url = http://books.google.com/books?id=HB1wyFPRGm4C&pg=PA23&dq=atheism+white+supremacy#v=onepage&q=atheistic&f=false|title =The new white nationalism in America: its challenge to integration|publisher = Cambridge University Press|quote=For instance, Ben Klassen, founder of the atheistic World Church of the Creator and the author of The White Man's Bible, discusses Christianity extensively in his writings and denounces religion that has brought untold horror into the world and divided the white race.|accessdate = 2011-03-27[/tpl][tpl]cite book|url = http://books.google.com/books?id=rBgn3xB75ZcC&pg=PA493&dq=competing+atheistic+white+racist+movement#v=onepage&q=competing%20atheistic%20white%20racist%20movement&f=false|title =The World's Religions: Continuities and Transformations|publisher = Taylor & Francis|quote=A competing atheistic or panthestic white racist movement also appeared, which included the Church of the Creator/ Creativity (Gardell 2003: 129–134).|accessdate = 2011-03-27[/tpl] Aside from this, its ideology is similar to many Christian Identity groups, in their belief that there is a Jewish conspiracy in control of governments, the banking industry and the media. Matthew F. Hale, founder of the World Church of the Creator has published articles stating that all races other than white are "mud races," which the religion teaches.
The white supremacist ideology has become associated with a racist faction of the skinhead subculture, despite the fact that when the skinhead culture first developed in the United Kingdom in the late 1960s, it was heavily influenced by black fashions and music, especially Jamaican reggae and ska, and African American soul musicSmiling Smash: An Interview with Cathal Smyth, a.k.a.

White supremacist recruitment activities are conducted primarily at a grassroots level and on the Internet. Widespread access to the Internet has led to a dramatic increase in white supremacist websites.[tpl]cite web |last=1Adams |first1=Josh |first2=Vincent J. |last2=Roscigno |title=White Supremacists, Oppositional Culture and the World Wide Web |work=University on North Carolina Press 84 (2005): 759-788 |date=20 November 2009 |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/3598477[/tpl] The Internet provides a venue to openly express white supremacist ideas at little social cost, because people who post the information are able to remain anonymous.

==Alliances with black supremacist groups==

In February 1962 George Lincoln Rockwell, the leader of the American Nazi Party, spoke at a Nation of Islam rally in Chicago, where he was applauded by Elijah Muhammed as he pronounced: "I am proud to stand here before black men.  I believe Elijah Muhammed is the Adolf Hitler of the black man!"[tpl]cite book|author=George Thayer|title=The Farther Shore of Politics: The American Political Fringe Today|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3EEGAAAAMAAJ|year=1967|publisher=Allen Lane|pages=25–6[/tpl]  Rockwell had attended, but did not speak at, an earlier NOI rally in June 1961 in Washington, D.C.[tpl]cite book|author=Mattias Gardell|title=In the Name of Elijah Muhammad: Louis Farrakhan and The Nation of Islam|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Z9ufS6aXctQC&pg=PA273|date=7 October 1996|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0-8223-1845-8|pages=273–4[/tpl] and even once donated $20 to the NOI.[tpl]cite news|title=White Supremacists Voice Support of Farrakhan|author=Wayne King|work=New York Times|date=October 12, 1985|page=12[/tpl] In 1965, after breaking with the Nation of Islam and denouncing its separatist doctrine, Malcolm X told his followers that the Nation of Islam under Elijah Muhammad had made secret agreements with the American Nazi Party and the Ku Klux Klan.  
Rockwell and other white supremacists (e.g. Willis Carto) also supported less well-known black supremacist groups, such as Hassan Jeru-Ahmed's Blackman's Army of Liberation, in reference to which Rockwell told Los Angeles Times reporter Michael Drosnin in 1967 that "Any Negro wants to go back to Africa, I'll carry him piggy-back."[tpl]cite news|title=U.S. Negro Group Plans Own Nation in Africa: 'Blackman's Army'|author=Michael Drosnin|work=Los Angeles Times|date=June 5, 1967|page=29[/tpl]
More recently, Tom Metzger, erstwhile Ku Klux Klan leader from California, spoke at an NOI rally in Los Angeles in September 1985 and donated $100 to the group.[tpl]cite news|title=Bedfellows: The Klan Connection|work=New York Times|date=October 6, 1985|page=E20[/tpl]  In October of that same year a collection of over 200 prominent white supremacists met at former Klan leader Robert E. Miles's farm to discuss an alliance with Louis Farrakhan, head of the NOI.  In attendance were Edward Reed Fields of the National States' Rights Party, Richard Girnt Butler of Aryan Nations, Don Black, Roy Frankhouser, and Metzger, who said that "America is like a rotting carcass.  The Jews are living off the carcass like the parasites they are.  Farrakhan understands this."
