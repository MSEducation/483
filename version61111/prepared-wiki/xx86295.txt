==Background==

Chris Moore was born in Easton, Maryland, where he grew up. He went to Harvard University where he studied American history. He worked as a production assistant at USA Network for two summers and found an opportunity to work as an intern for USA Network's comedy TV series Up All Night.[tpl]cite news | last=Owens | first=Donna M. | url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2003-08-14/entertainment/0308130071_1_chris-moore-easton-greenlight | title=Easton native finds success in Hollywood | work=Baltimore Sun | date=August 14, 2003 [/tpl] When Moore graduated from Harvard, he moved to Los Angeles with friends and began working in the mailroom at an agency. He eventually got promoted to literary agent and sold several scripts; some became films: The Stoned Age, PCU, Airheads, Last Action Hero, and My Girl. When Moore's agency was acquired by ICM, he left and strove to become a film producer. With friends, he raised money to produce the film Glory Daze. He knew Matt Damon from Harvard in passing, and he approached Damon to star in the film. Damon turned down the opportunity in favor of paid work but introduced Moore to his friend Ben Affleck, who ultimately starred in Glory Daze. Afterward, Damon and Affleck wrote the screenplay for what would be Good Will Hunting, and they involved Moore as co-producer in its production.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.miramax.com/subscript/chris-moore-interview-good-will-hunting | title=The Miramax Interview: Chris Moore | publisher=Miramax | date=August 21, 2012 | accessdate=October 2, 2012 [/tpl]

In June 2002, Moore co-founded the multimedia company LivePlanet with Damon, Affleck, and screenwriter/producer Sean Bailey. Moore became CEO of LivePlanet, and the company produced the TV series Project Greenlight as well as several films.
