The Flowers of Romance were an early punk band, formed in mid-1976 by Jo Faull and Sarah Hall. The band never played live or released any recordings, and, like London SS and Masters of the Backside, are more famed for the number of band members that later became well known, including: Sid Vicious of the Sex Pistols, Keith Levene (an early member of The Clash and later of Public Image Ltd) and Palmolive and Viv Albertine, who went on to play in The Slits. Despite never playing live, they were interviewed by a fanzine named SCUM, in which Sid Vicious proclaimed "I'll just be the yob that I am now".Punk77.co.uk
The highly controversial song "Belsen Was a Gas", about one of the concentration camps in Nazi Germany, Bergen-Belsen, which was liberated by British troops in 1945, originates from this band, and was later performed live by the Sex Pistols, Public Image Ltd, as well as Sid Vicious' solo act. Also, Viv Albertine wrote "So Tough" for this band, with the song eventually appearing on The Slits' debut album Cut."In Search of Sid". BBC Radio 4 broadcast 2009-01-20
The band's name subsequently became the title of an early Sex Pistols song, "The Flowers of Romance", as well as a 1981 Public Image Ltd album and song, The Flowers of Romance.

 Johnny Rotten:

The Flowers of Romance is about ponces, people who pretend to be friends but all they really want is to leech on a good thing and spend your money. The original Flowers of Romance had about 40 fucking members, Keith was one of them and I gave them that name.
