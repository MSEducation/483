==History==

Yealering's name is of Aboriginal origin and was first recorded in 1870 for the lake next to the town. It was first settled in the 1870s as a grazing lease and was later the site of a market garden. Yealering Lake was a valuable source of fresh water for the settlers. Community picnics and sporting days, for which the town became renowned, were held on the banks of the lake and in dry years horse races were run on the lake bed.
From 19 April 1944 - 29 September 1945 during world war II, Yealering had a prisoner of war camp which began with 100 Italian POWs and when it closed there was 125 POWs. The W15 POW Control Centre was run by Lt W Baker from 19 April 1944 – 12 October 1944
In 1907, land around Yealering was opened up for selection, and in 1908, the Yealering Lake Progress Association was formed. After the Government's announcement of a railway from Wickepin to Merredin, a townsite was surveyed and in 1912 the town was gazetted, and already by that stage included a primary school, post office and several other buildings. A hall made from local bricks was added in 1927.[tpl]LandInfo WA|c|Y|17 January 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wickepin.wa.gov.au/community/townsites.html|title=Shire of Wickepin - Townsites|author=Shire of Wickepin|accessdate=28 October 2006[/tpl]
