Written on each can were these words of endorsement, which were followed by Billy Carter's signature:http://www.falstaffbrewing.com/_borders/billybeercan.gif
 Brewed expressly for and with the personal approval of one of America's all-time great beer drinkers - Billy Carter. 
 I had this beer brewed up just for me.  I think it's the best I ever tasted.  And I've tasted a lot.  I think you'll like it, too. 

==As a collectible==

After Billy Beer ceased production, advertisements appeared in newspapers offering to sell Billy Beer cans for several hundred to several thousands of dollars each, attempting to profit from their perceived rarity. However, since the cans were actually produced in the millions, the real value of a can ranged from 50 cents to one dollar in 1981.[tpl]cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06EED61738F935A35751C1A967948260 |title=No Point In Treasuring Billy Beer Cans |publisher=New York Times |date=1981-12-06 |accessdate=2011-12-23[/tpl]
Billy Beer was also featured on an episode of the reality series Auction Kings, where an appraiser deemed a case of unopened Billy Beer to be worthless; however, at the featured auction, the case was sold for $100.
The hit television show The Simpsons featured Homer drinking a can of Billy Beer in the 1997 episode "Lisa the Skeptic"; after Bart tells him that the skeleton he is trying to hide is probably old enough already, he counters Bart's remark by introducing his Billy Beer stating that people said the same thing about the beer. After he drinks the beer, he says  "We elected the wrong Carter". Also in the 1992 episode "The Otto Show" Homer finds a can
of Billy Beer in the pocket of his old concert jacket, and drinks it.
Despite Carter's promotion of Billy Beer, his private preference was for Pabst Blue Ribbon.[tpl]cite web|url=http://oldbeerads.blogspot.com/2013/03/falls-city-beer-newspaper-ad-1970.html |title=In Private, It's Pabst for Billy Carter |publisher=The Milwaukee Journal |date=June 10, 1978 |accessdate=2013-03-30[/tpl]
