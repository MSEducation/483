Disney Channel (originally The Disney Channel from 1983 to 1997) is an American basic cable and satellite television network that serves as the flagship property of owner Disney Channels Worldwide, a unit of the Disney-ABC Television Group, itself a unit of the Disney Media Networks division of The Walt Disney Company.
Most of its original programming is aimed at pre-teens and adolescents ages 10–16 while its Disney Junior programs are targeted at younger children ages 3–9, although certain programs are aimed at audiences of all ages. The channel's programming consists of original first-run television series, theatrically-released and original made-for-cable movies and select other third-party programming. Disney Channel – which formerly operated as a premium service – originally marketed its programs towards families, and then at younger children by the late 1990s, although its viewing audience has diversified since the mid-2000s to include older teenagers and adults.
As of August 2013, Disney Channel is available to approximately 98,142,000 television households (85.94% of cable, satellite and telco customers) in the United States.[tpl]cite web |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/08/23/list-of-how-many-homes-each-cable-networks-is-in-cable-network-coverage-estimates-as-of-august-2013/199072/ |title=List of How Many Homes Each Cable Networks Is In - Cable Network Coverage Estimates As Of August 2013 |last=Seidman |first=Robert |work=TV by the Numbers |publisher=Zap2it |date=August 23, 2013 |accessdate=August 25, 2013[/tpl]

==History==

===Conception (1977–83)===

In early 1977, Walt Disney Productions executive Jim Jimirro brought forth the idea of a cable television network that would feature television and film material from the studio.[tpl]sfn|Flower|1991|p=87[/tpl] Since the company was focusing on the development of the Epcot Center at Walt Disney World, Disney chairman Card Walker turned down the proposal.[tpl]sfn|Grover|1991|p=15[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Grover|1991|p=147[/tpl] Disney tried again in 1982, entering into a partnership with the satellite unit of Group W (which had sold its 50% ownership stake in one of The Disney Channel's early rivals, Showtime, to Viacom around the same time); however, Group W would ultimately drop out of the intended joint venture that September, due to disagreements over the channel's creative control and financial obligations that would have required Group W to pay a 50% share of the channel's start-up costs.[tpl]sfn|Grover|1991|p=147[/tpl]
Despite losing Group W as a partner, The Disney Channel continued on with its development – now solely under the oversight of Walt Disney Productions, and under the leadership of the channel's first president Alan Wagner;[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/22/arts/22wagner.html?_r=1|last=Hevesi|first=Dennis|title=Alan Wagner, 76, First President of the Disney Channel, Is Dead|date=December 22, 2007|accessdate=October 26, 2009|work=The New York Times[/tpl] Walt Disney Productions formally announced the launch of its family-oriented cable channel in early 1983. Disney later invested US$11 million to acquiring space on two transponders of the Hughes Communications satellite Galaxy 1, and spent US$20 million on purchasing and developing programming.[tpl]sfn|Grover|1991|p=147[/tpl]

===Launch and early years as a premium channel (1983–90)===

The Disney Channel launched nationally as a premium channel on April 18, 1983 at 7 a.m. Eastern Time.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=P2YeAAAAIBAJ&sjid=5sgEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1920,4087795&dq=disney-channel&hl=en|last=Scott|first=Vernon|agency=United Press International (UPI)|title=Disney invades cable TV|date=April 19, 1983|accessdate=October 31, 2010|work=TimesDaily|volume=114|number=109|page=8[/tpl] The first program ever aired on the channel was also its first original series, Good Morning, Mickey!, which showcased classic Disney animated shorts.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jsxRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=m20DAAAAIBAJ&pg=7193,677930&dq=good+morning+mickey&hl=en|last=Fanning|first=Win|title=Mickey to star on Disney Channel|date=April 5, 1983|accessdate=October 31, 2010|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|volume=56|number=212|page=31[/tpl] At the time of its launch, The Disney Channel's programming aired for 16 hours each day, from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time (comparatively, its competitors HBO, Cinemax, Showtime and The Movie Channel all had been operating on 24-hour programming schedules for a few years at the time). By the fall of 1983, the channel was available to more than 532,000 subscribers in the U.S.;[tpl]sfn|Grover|1991|p=148[/tpl] |  this increased to 611,000 subscribers in December 1983.
Its programming during the channel's run as a premium service – carrying through to its transition to a basic cable channel – had targeted children and teenagers during the daytime, families during primetime and adults at night. The Disney Channel differed from other premium services in that it not only acquired broadcast rights to theatrical feature films, but, in addition to producing its own original programs, the channel aired several television series that were acquired through corporate sister Buena Vista Television and other program distributors. In its first years, The Disney Channel's programming included original programs Welcome to Pooh Corner and You and Me Kid, along with several foreign-imported animated series and movies including Asterix, The Raccoons, Paddington Bear and the Australian western Five Mile Creek; the original late night schedule also featured reruns of The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet.
The channel's daytime schedule during its existence as a pay service was populated primarily by series aimed at children (as opposed to the movie-driven daytime lineups of other premium services), interspersed with a limited number of movies – usually a single daytime feature on weekdays, and two or three films on weekends, along with occasional live-action and animated specials for children. The nighttime schedule featured a mix of theatrical, made-for-cable and straight-to-video films (recent and older family-oriented movies were shown in the early evenings, while classic films usually ran during the late evening and overnight hours) and original specials (primarily in the form of concerts, variety specials and documentaries). D-TV, a short segment featuring popular music interwoven with scenes from Disney's animated shorts and feature films, also periodically aired as filler between shows. Unlike other premium services, The Disney Channel opted not to disclose a film's Motion Picture Association of America rating the prior to the start of the feature (the only bumpers appearing at the start of programs indicated closed captioned programs, as well as on rare occasions, parental advisories for feature films).
The channel's primary logo (which was used until 1997) featured multiple lines resembling a TV screen that featured a negative space silhouette of Mickey Mouse's head; IDs shown before programs between 1986 and 1997 generally involved Mickey – whose arms are only shown – being involved in various situations (such as having a nightmare in which the "Mickey Mouse TV" logo chases and then engulfs one of his gloves or Mickey making shadow figures on a flashlight-lit wall) that featured the logo being formed or displayed in various ways. The channel also provided a monthly (and later bi-monthly) program guide/magazine called The Disney Channel Magazine to its subscribers (the magazine also lent its name to a series of interstitials seen during promotional breaks on the channel that provided behind-the-scenes looks at The Disney Channel's programming), until it ceased publication in early 1997 and was replaced by a magazine called Behind the Ears (which also shared its name with another series of behind-the-scenes interstitials that aired on the channel from 1997 to 2000) as the channel began primarily operating as a commercial-free basic channel.Gutman, Steve. "Letter from the Publisher". The Disney Channel Magazine, Vol. 14, no. 6, December 1996/January 1997: p. 4.
Interstitial segments that padded out extended promotional breaks between programs (usually those seen within its nighttime schedule) besides The Disney Channel Magazine during this period included A Disney Moment (featuring clips from Disney feature films and animated shorts), Backstage Pass (behind-the-scenes segments profiling upcoming Disney film and television projects), Dateline Disney (a generalized segment focusing on Disney's various filmed and themed entertainment projects; Dateline Walt Disney World and Dateline Disneyland were offshoots that aired during the late 1980s and early 1990s which focused on attractions at the Disney theme parks), Walt Disney Imagineering (focusing on Disney projects from animation to attractions at the Disney theme parks) and Discover Magazine (an informative science and technology segment that was produced in conjunction with the magazine of the same name).
As a premium channel, The Disney Channel often ran free previews of five days to one week in length four times annually, as well as two periodic weekend-only previews (with ads targeted to cable and satellite customers who were not subscribers to the channel); this resulted in The Disney Channel offering more preview events each calendar year during its tenure as a pay service than HBO, Cinemax and Showtime had ran during that timeframe. In April 1984, the channel extended its daily programming to 18 hours (from 7 a.m. to 1 a.m. Eastern and Pacific Time), with the addition of two hours onto its late night schedule.The Disney Channel Magazine, April 1984. On December 1, 1986, The Disney Channel began broadcasting 24 hours a day.The Disney Channel Magazine, December 1986.
By September 1983, The Disney Channel was available on cable providers in all 50 U.S. states. In October 1983, the channel debuted its first made-for-cable movie, Tiger Town, which earned the channel a CableACE Award.[tpl]cite news|first=Kidscreen Staff|title=A Salute to Disney Channel: Disney Channel time line|url=http://kidscreen.com/1998/04/01/21442-19980401/|accessdate=April 12, 2014|newspaper=KidScreen.com|date=April 1, 1998[/tpl] The first classic Disney animated film to be broadcast on the channel, Alice in Wonderland, premiered on the network in January 1984. By January 1985, the channel's programming reached 1.75 million subscribers, resulting in the channel reaching profitability.
Early in 1986, the musical sitcom Kids Incorporated premiered on the channel; the series was centered around a pre-teen (and later teen-to-young adult) group of friends who formed a pop music group, mixing their everyday situations with variety show and music video-style performances. Incorporating popular and recent songs that were performed by the cast (some of which had certain lyrics toned down to be more age-appropriate), it became a hit for The Disney Channel, spawning many future stars in both the music and acting worlds during its nine-year run, including Martika (who went by her real name of Marta Marrero in the show's first season); eventual Party of Five co-stars Scott Wolf and Jennifer Love Hewitt (billed as Love Hewitt); and Stacy Ferguson (later a member of The Black Eyed Peas as well as a solo artist, under the stage name "Fergie").
In May 1988, The Disney Channel began scrambling its signal to prevent unauthoized viewing by home satellite dish users that did not subscribe to the network. That August, the channel debuted a series of concert specials, titled Going Home, with the first such special featuring Ashford & Simpson. That same year, Good Morning, Miss Bliss, a starring vehicle for Hayley Mills (of Polyanna and The Parent Trap fame), made its debut. Following its cancellation by The Disney Channel after 13 episodes due to low ratings, the series was picked up by NBC in 1989, and retooled as Saved by the Bell, with Mark-Paul Gosselaar, Dustin Diamond, Lark Voorhies and Dennis Haskins as the only Miss Bliss actors carried over to the new show; the retooled series became a hit as part of NBC's Saturday morning lineup (producing two spinoffs in the process) and through worldwide syndication.
In April 1989, the channel revived one of Disney's early television staples with The All-New Mickey Mouse Club (later known as simply MMC); it became an immediate hit that proved Disney's basic variety show formula still worked in the modern era (unlike the short-lived 1970s revival). This version contained many elements featured in the original series from "theme days" to updated mouseketeer jackets, but the scripted and musical segments were more contemporary. MMC served as the launching pad for several future stars such as Christina Aguilera, Britney Spears, Ryan Gosling, Keri Russell, JC Chasez and Justin Timberlake.
In August 1989, the channel launched a series of interstitial segments called The Disney Channel Salutes The American Teacher; the channel subsequently began telecasting the American Teacher Awards in November 1991. By January 1990, The Disney Channel had about five million subscribers nationwide. In May of that year, The Disney Channel won its first Daytime Emmy Awards for the original made-for-cable film Looking for Miracles, the documentary Calgary ’88: 16 Days of Glory and the special A Conversation with... George Burns, as well as its first Peabody Award for the television film Mother Goose Rock 'n' Rhyme.

===As a hybrid premium/basic channel (1990–97)===

On September 1, 1990, TCI's Montgomery, Alabama system became the first cable provider to carry the channel as a basic cable service. In 1991, eight cable providers volunteered to move the channel to their expanded basic cable tiers, with the first to make the transition (as a test run) being Jones Intercable's Fort Myers and Broward County, Florida systems.Jones to offer Disney on basic tier in Fla., Multichannel News (via HighBeam Research), February 25, 1991.More systems trying Disney on expanded basic, Multichannel News (via HighBeam Research), September 30, 1991. Other cable providers eventually began moving the channel to their basic tiers, either experimentally or on a full-time basis. Even as major providers such as Cox Communications and Marcus Cable began offering The Disney Channel on their basic tiers, executives for The Walt Disney Company denied that the channel had plans to convert into an ad-supported basic service, stating that the move from premium to basic cable on some systems was part of a five-year "hybrid" strategy that allowed providers to offer the channel in either form.Marcus moves Disney; Marcus Cable makes The Disney Channel part of its basic service; analysts wonder if Disney is planning major changes, Broadcasting & Cable (via HighBeam Research), May 27, 1996.

In March 1992, the channel debuted the original children's program Adventures in Wonderland, a live-action adaption of Alice in Wonderland (which, in turn, was based on the novel Alice Through the Looking Glass). In September 1992, the channel began carrying the Disney's Young Musicians Symphony Orchestra specials, which aired annually until 1998. In honor of its 10th anniversary, the channel embarked on a 14-city nationwide bus tour starting in April 1993. By January 1995, The Disney Channel was available to 12.6 million subscribers; the period from 1994 to 1995 saw the largest yearly subscriber increase with 4.87 million households with cable television adding the channel. In March 1995, the first international Disney Channel service was launched in Taiwan. That year, the documentary Anne Frank Remembered premiered on the channel; that film would earn an Academy Award for Best Documentary in 1996.
In 1996, veteran cable executive Anne Sweeney was appointed to oversee The Disney Channel; that September, the channel began offering a nightly films in primetime, with the expansion of the Sunday Magical World of Disney film block to weeknights and Saturday nights; the new primetime schedule launched with the pay cable premiere of The Lion King.Sweeney makes first changes at Disney Channel, Multichannel News (via HighBeam Research), July 22, 1996.

===Transition to basic cable (1997–2002)===

On April 6, 1997, The Disney Channel underwent a significant rebranding, shortening its name to just "Disney Channel" – though on-air promos that ran until September 2002 typically referred to the channel simply as "Disney" – and introducing a new logo (a black Mickey ear-shaped TV, though the TV's patterning often varied, particularly by the early 2000s, when a new graphics package was introduced for the channel's on-air promotions; early versions of the logo featured people and animated characters appearing within it such as a 1930s-era Mickey Mouse).Disney Channel sets major prod'n revamp, Variety', January 19, 1997. The debut of its new on-air look coincided with the cable television premiere of Pocahontas''.
The channel continued to transition from a premium service into a basic cable channel around this time, albeit with a similar programming format to the one it carried as a full-fledged pay channel; however, the channel began shifting its target audience more toward kids but continued to cater to family audiences at night,After 14 Years, One Network For Children Refocuses . . ., The New York Times, July 27, 1997. the channel decreased the amount of classic films it aired, and its music programming shifted towards the pre-teen and teenage demographic, incorporating music videos and revamping its concert specials to feature younger musicians popular with that target audience. Disney Channel initially continued to offer free preview events for pay television providers that continued to carry it as a premium service but discontinued them altogether within three years of the rebrand (Disney Channel would not complete its transition to a basic cable service until around 2004).Disney move to basic keys system campaigns, Multichannel News (via HighBeam Research), February 17, 1997. Disney Channel also began to air break interruptions within shows, featuring promotions for the channel's programs, and feature film and home video releases from Disney.Now that Duff's had enough...: is it time for Disney Channel to cash in and rethink no-ads strategy?, Daily Variety, June 6, 2003. Retrieved April 15, 2013. By March 1998, the channel was available to 35 million cable subscribers.
The channel's programming would eventually be split into three distinct blocks: amongst which were "Playhouse Disney" (comprising shows aimed at preschoolers) and "Vault Disney" (which debuted as a Sunday-only nighttime block in September 1997 and featured classic Disney programs such as Zorro,Television News & Notes, The Record (via HighBeam Research), September 9, 1997. The Mickey Mouse Club and the Walt Disney anthology television series, as well as older television specials and feature films). The most popular series from the Playhouse Disney block,Bear in the Big Blue House, debuted in October 1997 and was named by TV Guide as one of the "top 10 new shows for kids.""Zoog Disney" was introduced in August 1998 and became the channel's most distinct program block,Digital L.A. : Truly It's All Happening at the Zoog, Los Angeles Daily News (via HighBeam Research), December 26, 1998. the afternoon to late evening lineup was hosted by anthropomorphic robot/alien hybrid characters called "Zoogs" (which were originally two-dimensional figures, but were given a cel shaded redesign and mature voices in 2001, before being phased out after less than a year) and was designed to encourage viewer interactivity between television and the internet. The Zoog Disney brand would later expand, with all weekend programming on the channel (outside of the Vault Disney and Playhouse Disney blocks) becoming part of the "Zoog Weekendz" umbrella block from September 2001 to August 2002.
Original programming on Disney Channel began to ramp up during this period starting with the sitcom Flash Forward, and would increase in the following years with shows like The Famous Jett Jackson and So Weird, into the early 2000s with Lizzie McGuire – whose star Hilary Duff became the first lead actor or actress in one of the channel's original series to cross over into music through a record deal with co-owned music label Hollywood Records – and Even Stevens – which helped launch the career of its star Shia LaBeouf.
In 1999, Disney Channel placed a mandate to cable operators that continued to carry it as a premium service to move the channel to a basic cable tier or stop carrying it altogether, stipulating that it would not renew carriage agreements with providers (such as Time Warner Cable and Comcast, the last major cable providers to carry the channel as a pay service) that chose to continue carrying the network as a premium channel.Disney Serves Notice, Multichannel News (via HighBeam Research), August 30, 1999. With the shift towards children as its target audience, some of the off-network programs acquired by the channel during the early 2000s (such as Boy Meets World and later Sister, Sister) began to be edited for content deemed inappropriate like profanity and sexual references.
By 2001, Disney Channel was available to approximately 70 million cable and satellite subscribers, largely consisting of those who already received the channel through basic cable, as well as what remained of its pay subscriber base.Disney Channel Springs Into April With 70 million Subscribers; Network's Transition From Premium to Basic Service Nears Completion, Business Wire (via HighBeam Research), April 4, 2001. The music videos and concert specials that the channel had run since the 1997 rebrand were dropped by this time, citing the inability to obtain revenue from the artists' CD sales and lack of exclusivity for the videos;UMSTEAD, R. THOMAS. "Disney Bounces Videos! Concerts from Schedule", Multichannel News, June 25, 2001. Retrieved February 25, 2011 from HighBeam Research. the channel soon after began featuring music videos from artists signed to Disney's in-house record labels Hollywood Records and Walt Disney Records, and songs featured in Disney-produced feature films. The channel debuted The Proud Family as its first original animated series in 2001, though it achieved its first major animated series hit the following year with the premiere of Kim Possible.

===Success and changing focus in the 2000s (2002–07)===

By 2002, Disney Channel was available in 80 million cable homes nationwide.Television news briefs, Zap2it (via HighBeam Research), May 1, 2002. In early September of that year, Disney Channel began a gradual rebranding with the "Zoog" brand being discontinued from on-air use (though Zoog Disney would continue to exist as a separate website until 2003, when the site's content was consolidated onto Disney Channel's primary website, disneychannel.com).
On September 16, the Vault Disney overnight block was replaced by same-day repeats of the channel's original and acquired programs, primarily to contribute to the network's then-upcoming "hip" image. The block's removal resulted in Disney Channel not featuring programs aimed at adults for the first time in its history – with the channel's primetime feature films becoming the only programs that intentionally targeted a broader family audience. As of 2014, Disney Channel is the only major American cable channel aimed at children that does not directly maintain a dual audience of both kids and adults (Nickelodeon, Hub Network and Cartoon Network each feature nighttime programming for families and/or adults). Movies shown during primetime were also reduced from an average of two to three features to only one each night of the week.Disney to Pull the Plug on 'Vault', The Cincinnati Post (via HighBeam Research), September 5, 2002. The channel phased out reality and scripted drama series from its original programming, while substantially increasing the channel's reliance on live-action sitcoms and animated series.
One month later on October 7, 2002, Disney Channel introduced a new on-air logo designed by CA Square (using an outline of Mickey Mouse's head as its centerpiece) that would later be adopted by its international sister channels in May 2003, and unveiled a new graphics design to fit the network's new look. Moreover, Disney Channel began using a series of bumpers that are still used to this day, primarily featuring actors and animated characters from its original programs (and occasionally from Disney's theatrical releases) drawing the Disney Channel logo using a glowstick. Playhouse Disney became the only program block introduced in 1997 to remain by this point (it was later relaunched as Disney Junior in February 2011). Around this time, Disney Channel's original series began airing as part of corporate sister ABC's Saturday morning children's program block, where they would run until 2011.
Anne Sweeney became president of Disney-ABC Television Group in 2004, ultimately helping to remake Disney Channel into "the major profit driver in the company" by the middle of the decade[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.portfolio.com/news-markets/national-news/portfolio/2008/04/14/Disneys-Evolving-Business-Model|last=Greenfeld|first=Karl Taro|title=How Mickey Got His Groove Back|date=May 2008|accessdate=October 31, 2010|work=Condé Nast Portfolio|pages=126–131, 150[/tpl] as the channel made major inroads in increasing its overall viewership, while in turn using a strategy – that proved successful – to discover, nurture and aggressively cross-promote teen music stars whose style and image were carefully targeted to the pre-teen and teenage demographic. Around that time as Disney Channel's intended target audience began ranging from preschoolers to young adolescents; the channel began to add viewers outside this target demographic, creating increased competition with Viacom-owned Nickelodeon.
In 2003, Disney Channel premiered its first ever made-for-cable movie musical, The Cheetah Girls, which received a worldwide audience of 84 million viewers. In 2005, That's So Raven (which debuted in 2003) became the channel's highest-rated series since its transition to basic cable as well as becoming the first original series to run longer than 65 episodes – breaking a highly controversial rule that was implemented in 1998, aimed at limiting increases in production costs for its original programming (the 65-episode rule is no longer enforced, although most series are now usually discontinued after their fourth season at maximum) – Raven eventually became the channel's longest-running original series at 100 episodes and became the first to spawn a spin-off series (Cory in the House). The Suite Life of Zack & Cody also debuted in 2005, becoming a hit for the channel. The earlier success of The Cheetah Girls led to the creation of other music-themed original programming: 2006 saw the debut of the hit original movie High School Musical and the series Hannah Montana, the latter of which launched the career of its star Miley Cyrus (who starred opposite her father, country singer Billy Ray Cyrus, in the series). On July 28 of that year, the channel saw the debut of the its first multiple-series crossover, That's So Suite Life of Hannah Montana (which involved That's So Raven, The Suite Life of Zack & Cody and Hannah Montana).

===Disney Channel today (2007–present)===

In 2007, the channel began dropping most of its acquired programs, and also began to incorporate rotating hour-long blocks of its original series and other programs during the daytime hours. It also moved first-run episodes of its original series on weekends from late afternoon/early evening to primetime. Two new series also premiered: the That's So Raven spin-off Cory in the House (which ended after two seasons) and the more successful Wizards of Waverly Place (which surpassed That's So Raven in October 2011 to become Disney Channel's longest-running original series, having aired 106 episodes by the time Wizards ended its run in January 2012). High School Musical 2 premiered on August 17 of that year, becoming the highest-rated non-sports program in the history of basic cable and the highest-rated made-for-cable movie premiere on record (as well as the highest-rated television program – broadcast or cable – of Summer 2007) with 17.2 million viewers.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117970479.html?categoryid=14&cs=1 |title='High School Musical 2' huge hit |accessdate=2007-08-18 |work= Variety| first1=Rick | last1=Kissell | first2=Michael | last2=Schneider | date=August 18, 2007[/tpl] 2008 saw the debut of Phineas and Ferb, the first original animated series to be broadcast in HD, and The Suite Life of Zack & Cody spin-off, The Suite Life on Deck, along with two more music-based original made-for-TV movies: Camp Rock and The Cheetah Girls: One World.

Capitalizing on the rising star status of the Jonas Brothers and Demi Lovato following Camp Rock, two series respectively starring both acts premiered in 2009: JONAS and Sonny with a Chance (Lovato also starred in the original movie Princess Protection Program, which premiered in June). The August debut of the original film Wizards of Waverly Place: The Movie became the highest-rated cable program of 2009 (excluding sporting events), premiering to 11.4 million viewers and becoming the second highest-rated original movie premiere in Disney Channel's history. The July 17 premiere of the Wizards/Suite Life on Deck/Hannah Montana crossover special Wizards on Deck with Hannah Montana also beat out its cable and broadcast competition that night with 9.1 million viewers (effectively making the Wizards and On Deck episodes featured in the special the highest-rated episodes of both series at that point).
In 2010, Good Luck Charlie debuted as Disney Channel's first original sitcom targeted at family audiences, while Fish Hooks and Shake It Up also made their debuts. That year also saw the premiere of Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam among the four original movies premiering that year, along with two made-for-TV movies that were co-produced with Canadian specialty channels (Harriet the Spy: Blog Wars, in conjunction with Movie Central and The Movie Network; and 16 Wishes, with Family Channel). On November 19, 2010, Disney Channel began offering an alternate Spanish-language audio feed (carried either as a separate second audio program track or sold by cable and satellite providers in the form of a separate channel that is part of a Spanish-language programming package). Hannah Montana and The Suite Life on Deck both ended in 2011; Sonny with a Chance, meanwhile, was retooled as So Random! – focusing on the show within the show – after Demi Lovato decided not to return to the series to focus on her music career, following her treatment for bulimia and bipolar disorder (the So Random! spin-off series was canceled after one season in May 2012).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYz1KNqQ_tU|title=Tiffany Thornton Talks "So Random!"

In January 2013, Disney launched Disney Shows, a YouTube channel featuring free episodes of past and present Disney Channel and Disney XD series, as well as original shorts seen on both channels.Disney Shows channel on YouTube On July 19, 2013, the original movie Teen Beach Movie premiered, with no other films preceding it or succeeding it that year, making it the first time that Disney Channel has premiered only one film during a calendar year (the last time this occurred was in 1992, when its original films were branded under the "Disney Channel Premiere Films" banner, with the premiere of Still Not Quite Human).

==Programming==

Disney Channel's schedule currently consists largely of original series aimed at pre-teens and young teenagers (including animated series such as Phineas and Ferb, Fish Hooks and Gravity Falls, to live-action series such as I Didn't Do It, Dog with a Blog, A.N.T. Farm, Liv and Maddie, Jessie and Austin & Ally) and Disney Junior series aimed at preschoolers (such as Sofia the First, Jake and the Never Land Pirates and Mickey Mouse Clubhouse). The channel also airs repeats of former Disney Channel original series (such as The Suite Life on Deck, Good Luck Charlie, Shake It Up and Wizards of Waverly Place), occasional reruns of Disney XD original series (such as Kickin' It, Lab Rats and Kick Buttowski: Suburban Daredevil), original made-for-TV movies, feature films, short-form programs known as "short shows" (which air more commonly on the Disney Junior block, and are used primarily to fill five-minute gaps between programs) and music videos from artists signed to sister companies Hollywood Records and Walt Disney Records as well as songs featured in recent and upcoming Disney feature film releases (full versions of these music videos typically air only during the video's premiere and as filler between programs, while shorter versions usually air during promo breaks during the current program).
Disney Channel essentially operates as a commercial-free channel, opting not to feature traditional commercial advertisements during its in-show breaks due to concerns that younger viewers may be unable to separate the difference between programs and advertisements, and in order to pay a lower license fee rate to broadcast feature films distributed by major movie studios than ad-supported channels would pay – in lieu of running commercials, Disney Channel maintains underwriter sponsorships with major companies such as Best Western and Mattel, in addition to in-house promotions for Disney Channel's programs (and occasionally, programs seen on other Disney-owned channels, most commonly Disney XD and Disney Junior) and Disney entertainment products.
Atypical of most U.S. cable channels, since 2006, Disney Channel's scripted programs (including shows featured on the Disney Junior block) feature additional scenes played over the closing credits. It also has an unwritten requirement that its original live-action series no more than six regular cast members (So Weird was the last series prior to 2003 to have more than six series regulars within its cast, only Shake It Up has featured more than that since that point with its second season having seven cast members on contract with the show). The channel's series tend to have smaller writing staffs compared to scripted series seen on other broadcast and cable networks (usually featuring around four and eight credited staff writers, instead of the eight to 11 writers commonly found on most scripted shows). Its live-action multi-camera series also commonly utilize a simulated film look (the FilmLook processing for such shows debuting between 2003 and 2008; the HD-compatible 'filmizing' technique for all newer and returning original series produced after 2009, which reduce the video frame rate to 24 frames per second).
During the 1980s and 1990s, Disney Channel ran classic Disney animated shorts released between the 1930s and 1960s, which were removed from the lineup in 2000; since 2009, repackaged versions of these shorts are seen as part of the short series ReMicks and have a laugh!. The channel later debuted Mickey Mouse, a series of original shorts featuring the classic Disney animated characters including the animated character of the same name on June 28, 2013.

===Movie library===

Disney Channel often broadcasts a movie most nights during the week and occasionally airs films during the daytime hours, but these may not necessarily be a theatrically released film. The channel produces original made-for-cable movies called Disney Channel Original Movies (or DCOMs), which are frequently broadcast during prime time hours; family-oriented made-for-TV movies began airing on the Disney Channel in October 1983 under the brand Disney Channel Premiere Films with the premiere of Tiger Town, the DCOM slate began with the August 1997 premiere of Northern Lights. After that point, the number of DCOMs that debuted each year began to increase – from two in 1997 to a high of twelve in 2000, when the network premiered a new original movie each month during that year, before decreasing the current rate of roughly four to six premieres each year. Disney Channel previously ran double airings of its original movies on the night of their premiere (until the January 2006 premiere of High School Musical), though encore presentations of said films occasionally still air on the Saturday or Sunday of the initial debut weekend with few exceptions (Camp Rock was the first film not to be encored in this manner). "Special edition" airings of its higher-profile original movies are also sometimes aired, including sing-along versions of music-based films (featuring on-screen lyrics for viewers to sing along with the film's songs) and "What's What" editions (styled similarly to Pop-Up Video, featuring on-screen pop up facts about the movie and its stars).
High School Musical 2 is currently the most successful DCOM in terms of popularity and accolades, setting a basic cable record for the single most-viewed television program, as its August 2007 debut was watched by 17.2 million (counting sports, this record stood until a December 3, 2007 New England Patriots-Baltimore Ravens game telecast on corporate sibling ESPN's Monday Night Football was watched by 17.5 million viewers). The Cheetah Girls films were also notably successful in terms of merchandise, and sales for its concert tour and soundtrack albums. The first film was the first made-for-TV movie musical in Disney Channel's history, and had a worldwide audience of over 84 million viewers. The second movie was the most successful of the series, bringing in 8.1 million viewers in the U.S. An 86-date concert tour featuring the group was ranked as one of the top 10 concert tours of 2006; the tour broke a record at the Houston Rodeo that was set by Elvis Presley in 1973, selling out with 73,500 tickets sold in three minutes.
In addition to its made-for-cable films, Disney Channel has rights to theatrically released feature films, with some film rights shared with sister network ABC Family. Along with films released by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, the channel also has rights to films from other studios including Warner Bros. Entertainment, Universal Pictures, The Weinstein Company, Sony Pictures Entertainment, Lions Gate Entertainment, 20th Century Fox and Paramount Pictures. Some films released by Bagdasarian Productions (such as The Chipmunk Adventure and Alvin and the Chipmunks Meet Frankenstein) have also aired on Disney Channel, although most of them are not presently owned by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures.
Films made up roughly half of Disney Channel's daily schedule between 1986 and 1998; the number of movies broadcast on the channel have steadily eroded since then, to the point that films now only air Monday through Thursdays in primetime on an inconsistent basis (with episodes of its original series airing on nights when a film is not scheduled), regularly on weekend late nights and [tpl]as of|December 2013|lc=y[/tpl], during the daytime hours also on an inconsistent basis. Except for some holiday-themed movies, many Disney Channel Original Movies made from 1997 to 2005 have seldom aired on the channel in recent years; these older original movies began airing on the channel again in January 2009, as part of a late night block on Fridays and Saturdays (a Sunday block was later added in June 2010; the late movie presentations were then moved from 3 a.m. to 2:30 a.m. Eastern and Pacific Time – and sometimes airing without interruption – the following month). Cadet Kelly, Camp Rock and Wendy Wu: Homecoming Warrior are currently the only Disney Channel Original Movies to have aired on a network outside of the Disney Channel brand domestically (the latter two have aired on sister channel ABC Family, while Cadet Kelly and Camp Rock have also been broadcast on ABC as part of The Wonderful World of Disney).
On September 13, 2010, Disney Channel began airing theatrical film releases in a 4:3 letterbox format on the channel's primary standard definition feed, airing them in the widescreen-style format as they are broadcast on the HD feed; although theatrical movies shot with an aspect ratio of 2.35:1 or 2.40:1 are panned and scanned to fit high-definition sets to eliminate screen burn-in on plasma displays. Partly due to the network advertising mainly its own programs in lieu of traditional commercials, films featured on Disney Channel often run short of their allotted time slot with interstitial programming airing to pad out the remainder of the time period (usually an episode of an original series if a film runs approximately 90 to 100 minutes, an 11-minute-long episode of an original animated series for films running 105 minutes or a mix of music videos, network promotions and short segments for films running longer than 105 minutes).

(replacing predecessor Toon Disney), carrying action and comedy programming from Disney Channel and the former Jetix block from Toon Disney, along with some first-run original programming and off-network syndicated shows. Like its predecessor Toon Disney and unlike parent network Disney Channel and its sister channel Disney Junior, Disney XD is an advertiser-supported service.

====Disney Junior====

On May 26, 2010, Disney-ABC Television Group announced the launch of a new digital cable and satellite channel targeted at preschool-aged children called Disney Junior, which debuted on March 23, 2012. The Disney Junior channel – which like Disney Channel (though unlike Disney XD or the channel Disney Junior replaced, Soapnet), is commercial-free – competes with other preschooler-skewing cable channels such as Nick Jr., qubo and Sprout. The channel features programs from Disney Channel's existing preschool programming library and films from the Walt Disney Pictures film library. Disney Junior took over the channel space held by Soapnet – a Disney-owned cable channel featuring soap operas – due to the soap opera genre's decline in popularity on broadcast television, and the growth of video on demand (including the online streaming availability for soap operas) and digital video recorders negating the need for a linear channel devoted to the genre. An automated Soapnet feed continues to exist, though, for providers that have not yet made carriage agreements for Disney Junior (such as Dish Network) and those that have kept Soapnet as part of their lineups while adding Disney Junior as an additional channel (such as DirecTV and Cox Communications);[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Disney-Junior-SoapNet-March-1041380.aspx|title=Disney Junior to replace Soapnet in March|last=Schneider|first=Michael|work=TV Guide|date=January 9, 2012|accessdate=January 9, 2012[/tpl]Villarreal, Yvonne.

The channel carried a format of reruns of Walt Disney Television Animation and Disney Channel-produced animated programming, along with some third-party programs from other distributors, animated films and original programming. In 2004, the channel debuted a nighttime program block aimed at children ages 7–14 called Jetix, which featured action-oriented animated and live-action series.

The network ceased operations on February 13, 2009 and was replaced with the preteen male-oriented Disney XD, featuring a broader array of programming, with a heavier emphasis on live-action programs.

==Criticism and controversies==

Disney Channel has received heavy criticism by some critics and former viewers for its current programming direction. Critics disapprove of the marketing strategy drafted by Disney-ABC Television Group president Anne Sweeney,[tpl]cite web|url=http://corporate.disney.go.com/corporate/bios/anne_sweeney.html |title=The Walt Disney Company – Anne Sweeney Executive Biography |publisher=Corporate.disney.go.com |accessdate=June 20, 2011[/tpl] which results in a slant in the target audience of Disney Channel's programs toward pre-teen and teenage girls.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.commercialexploitation.org/news/2009/04/disneyexpert.html |title=Disney Expert Uses Science to Draw Boy Viewers |publisher=Commercialexploitation.org |date=April 14, 2009 |accessdate=June 20, 2011[/tpl] Sweeney had once stated that Disney Channel, resulting from its multi-platform marketing strategy using television and music, would become "the major profit driver for the Disney Company."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.portfolio.com/news-markets/national-news/portfolio/2008/04/14/Disneys-Evolving-Business-Model |title=Disneys Evolving Business Model – News Markets |publisher=Portfolio.com |date=September 11, 2008 |accessdate=June 20, 2011[/tpl]
Most viewers who had grown up watching Disney Channel's family-targeted shows during its run as a premium/hybrid premium-basic service have also complained about a perceived decline in quality in its programming since the early 2000s, a lack of programming content dedicated to Walt Disney and Mickey Mouse, and sexist humor against boys. The channel has also been criticized contradictorily for a perceived incorporation of some sexual content (in a manner mildly similar to that found on some original scripted programs on competitor Nickelodeon, that still avoids violating the channel's content guidelines), and for being too strict in regards to program content (with its editing and occasional removal of episodes of select acquired programs that ran between 1997 and 2007 due to subject matter and some profanity considered inappropriate for children as well as sporadic edits of minced oaths that are otherwise acceptable under its guidelines and placement of non-Disney products among viewer complaints regarding this particular issue).
The channel has also pulled episodes (even once having to reshoot an episode) that have featured subject matter either deemed inappropriate due to its humor, the timing of the episode's airing with real-life events or subject matter considered inappropriate for Disney Channel's target audience. In December 2008, the Hannah Montana episode "No Sugar, Sugar" was pulled before its broadcast after complaints from parents who saw the episode through video on demand services due to misconceptions regarding diabetics and sugar intake (the Mitchel Musso character of Oliver Oken is revealed in the episode to have been diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes). Portions of that episode were subsequently rewritten and re-filmed to become the season three episode "Uptight (Oliver's Alright)", which aired in September 2009.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/hannah-montana-episode-diabetes-set-air-disney-channel-article-1.403081 | work=New York Daily News | first=Richard | last=Huff | title='Hannah Montana' episode on diabetes set to air on Disney Channel | date=September 9, 2009[/tpl] In December 2011, Disney Channel pulled episodes of two of its original series from the network's broadcast cycle – the season one Shake It Up episode "Party It Up", and the So Random! episode "Colbie Caillat" – after Demi Lovato (star of So Random! parent series Sonny with a Chance, who was treated for bulimia nervosa in 2010) objected on Twitter to jokes featured in both episodes (the Shake It Up episode, in particular) that made light of eating disorders.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/23/demi-lovato-slams-disney-for-eating-disorder-joke-on-shake-it-up_n_1168436.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Stephanie | last=Marcus | title=Demi Lovato Slams Disney For Eating Disorder Joke On 'Shake It Up' (UPDATE) | date=December 23, 2011[/tpl]https://twitter.com/#!/DisneyChannelPR/status/150418514426081281[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gossipcop.com/demi-lovato-slams-disney-channel-eating-disorder-joke-shake-it-up/ |title=Demi Lovato Slams Disney Channel - Eating Disorder Joke |publisher=Gossip Cop |date=2011-12-23 |accessdate=2012-09-04[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://disneyinfonet.com/2011/08/18/demi-lovato-fans-upset-over-last-episode-of-so-random-ddlovato-therealtiffany-disneychanphoto/|title=Demi Lovato Fans Upset Over Last Episode Of So Random|publisher=disneyinfonet.com|date=|accessdate=2013-05-05|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120429190255/http://disneyinfonet.com/2011/08/18/demi-lovato-fans-upset-over-last-episode-of-so-random-ddlovato-therealtiffany-disneychanphoto/|archivedate=29 April 2012[/tpl] On May 17, 2013, the channel pulled "Quitting Cold Koala", a second season episode of Jessie, prior to its scheduled premiere broadcast, due to parental concerns over a scene in which a character's gluten-free diet leads to him being ridiculed.Mom: Disney show 'Jessie' ridicules kids with celiac disease, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, May 20, 2013.

==Video games==

In 2010, Disney Channel All Star Party was released for the Nintendo Wii and allowed players to visit Disney Channel locations and characters including Sonny With A Chance, Wizards of Waverly Place and JONAS L.A.http://uk.wii.ign.com/objects/078/078798.html the four-player mascot party game, in which the stages resemble board games, features characters from Disney Channel programs. Several video games based on the Disney Channel cartoon series Phineas and Ferb were released by Disney Interactive Studios. The Disney Channel website also features various flash games incorporating characters from the channel's various program franchises.

==International==

Disney Channel has established its channels in various countries worldwide including South Africa, Southeast Asia, Hong Kong, India, Australia, New Zealand, the Middle East, Scandinavia, the Baltic states, United Kingdom, Ireland, the Caribbean, the Netherlands, Israel and Flanders. Disney Channel also licenses its programming to air on certain other broadcast and cable channels outside the United States (such as Family Channel in Canada), regardless as to whether an international version of Disney Channel exists in the country.
