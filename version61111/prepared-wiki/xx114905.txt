[[Holcolaetis]]

CATEGORIES: Salticidae

Holcolaetis is a genus of the spider family Salticidae (jumping spiders).
Like Euryattus and Thiania bhamoensis, these spiders build a flat, densely woven egg sac that is not contiguous with the silk of the nest. Holcolaetis posits the egg sac on the trunks of trees.Li et al. 2002
