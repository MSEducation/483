In Greek mythology, the Nereids ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|n|ɪər|i|ɪ|d|z[/tpl] [tpl]respell|NEER|ee-idz[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-grc|Νηρηΐδες[/tpl], sg. [tpl]lang|grc|Νηρηΐς[/tpl]) are sea nymphs (female spirits of sea waters), the fifty daughters of Nereus and Doris, sisters to Nerites.  They were distinct from the mermaid-like Sirens. They often accompany Poseidon, the god of the sea, and can be friendly and helpful to sailors fighting perilous storms.

==Mythology==

Nereids are particularly associated with the Aegean Sea, where they dwelt with their father in the depths within a silvery cave. The most notable of them are Thetis, wife of Peleus and mother of Achilles; Amphitrite, wife of Poseidon; and Galatea, lover of the Cyclops Polyphemus.
In Homer's Iliad XVIII, when Thetis cries out in sympathy for the grief of Achilles for the slain Patroclus, her sisters appear. The nymph Opis is mentioned in Virgil's Aeneid.  She is called on by the goddess Diana to avenge the death of the Amazon-like female warrior Camilla.  Diana gives Opis magical weapons with which to take revenge on Camilla's killer, the Etruscan Arruns.  Opis sees and laments Camilla's death and shoots Arruns in revenge as directed by Diana.Virgil: His life and times by Peter Levi, Duckworth, 1998

==Modern use==

In modern Greek folklore, the term "nereid" ([tpl]lang|el|νεράϊδα[/tpl], neráïda) has come to be used for all nymphs, or fairies, or mermaids, not merely nymphs of the sea.
The Nereids are the namesake of one of the moons of the planet Neptune.
