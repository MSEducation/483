The Swiss Formula Three Championship is a Level 2 European Formula Three car racing series made up of circuit races and also hillclimbs. Despite its name, the bulk of the series events was held in neighbouring countries due to the legal difficulties of organising motorsport events in Switzerland and the lack of available facilities in Switzerland. Most events were held in Italy and France. The series however did have a prominent role in promoting Swiss drivers.
