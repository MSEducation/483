Griswold v. Connecticut, [tpl]ussc|381|479|1965[/tpl],[tpl]cite court |litigants=Griswold v. Connecticut |vol=381 |reporter=U.S. |opinion=479 |pinpoint= |court= |date=1965 |url=http://www4.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0381_0479_ZO.html[/tpl] is a landmark case in which the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that the Constitution protected a right to privacy. The case involved a Connecticut statute that prohibits any person from using "any drug, medicinal article or instrument for the purpose of preventing conception." By a vote of 7–2, the Supreme Court invalidated the law on the grounds that it violated the "right to marital privacy".
Although the Bill of Rights does not explicitly mention "privacy", Justice William O. Douglas wrote for the majority that the right was to be found in the "penumbras" and "emanations" of other constitutional protections, such as the self-incrimination clause of the Fifth Amendment. The right to privacy is seen as a right to "protection from governmental intrusion." Justice Arthur Goldberg wrote a concurring opinion in which he used the Ninth Amendment in support of the Supreme Court's ruling. Justice Arthur Goldberg and Justice John Marshall Harlan II wrote concurring opinions in which they argued that privacy is protected by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Justice Byron White also wrote a concurrence based on the due process clause.
Two Justices, Hugo Black and Potter Stewart, filed dissents. Justice Black argued that the right to privacy is to be found nowhere in the Constitution. Furthermore, he criticized the interpretations of the Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments to which his fellow Justices adhered. Justice Stewart called the Connecticut statute "an uncommonly silly law" but argued that it was nevertheless constitutional.
Since Griswold, the Supreme Court has cited the right to privacy in several rulings, most notably in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), where the Court ruled that a woman's choice to have an abortion was protected as a private decision between her and her doctor. For the most part, the Court has made these later rulings on the basis of Justice Harlan's substantive due process rationale.

==History==

Griswold v. Connecticut involved a Connecticut law that prohibited the use of "any drug, medicinal article or instrument for the purpose of preventing conception."[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.ucs.louisiana.edu/~ras2777/judpol/griswold.html | title =Griswold v. Connecticut 381 U.S. 479 (1965) | author =University of Louisiana at Lafayette | publisher =ucs.louisiana.edu | date =June 10, 2013[/tpl] Although the law was passed in 1879, the statute was almost never enforced.
Attempts had been made to test the constitutionality of the law; however, the challenges failed on technical grounds. In Tileston v. Ullman (1943), a doctor and mother challenged the statute on the grounds that a ban on contraception could, in certain sexual situations, threaten the lives and well-being of patients. The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal on the grounds that the plaintiff lacked standing to sue on behalf of his patients. A second challenge to the Connecticut law was brought by a doctor as well as his patients in Poe v. Ullman (1961). However, the Supreme Court again voted to dismiss the appeal, on the grounds that the case was not ripe. It held that, because the plaintiffs had not been charged or threatened with prosecution, there was no actual controversy for the judiciary to resolve. Thus, the Connecticut statute had evaded judicial review until Griswold v. Connecticut.
In Poe, Justice John Marshall Harlan II filed one of the most cited[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2011[/tpl] dissenting opinions in Supreme Court history. He argued, foremost, that the Supreme Court should have heard the case rather than dismissing it. Thereafter he indicated his support for a broad interpretation of the due process clause. He famously wrote, "the full scope of the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause cannot be found in or limited by the precise terms of the specific guarantees elsewhere provided in the Constitution. This 'liberty' is not a series of isolated points pricked out in terms of the taking of property; the freedom of speech, press, and religion; the right to keep and bear arms; the freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures; and so on. It is a rational continuum which, broadly speaking, includes a freedom from all substantial arbitrary impositions and purposeless restraints." On the basis of this interpretation of the due process clause, Harlan concluded that the Connecticut statute violated the Constitution.
Shortly after the Poe decision was handed down, Estelle Griswold (Executive Director of the Planned Parenthood League of Connecticut)[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.cwhf.org/inductees/reformers/estelle-griswold/ | title =Estelle Griswold | author =Connecticut Women's Hall of Fame | publisher =cwhf.org[/tpl] and Dr. C. Lee Buxton (a physician and professor at the Yale School of Medicine)[tpl]cite web | url=http://actionspeaksradio.org/griswold-v-connecticut/#.UbZVV_mTgV0 | title =1965 Griswold v. Connecticut Contraception as a right of privacy?

Connecticut (1965) | author =Alex McBride | publisher =pbs.org | date =December 2006[/tpl] Shortly after the clinic was opened, Griswold and Buxton were arrested, tried, found guilty, and fined $100 each. The conviction was upheld by the Appellate Division of the Circuit Court, and by the Connecticut Supreme Court.[tpl]cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Zzz41t_0ufEC&pg=PA44&lpg=PA44&dq=griswold+v.+connecticut+conviction+was+upheld+by+the+Appellate+Division+of+the+Circuit+Court&source=bl&ots=iXlW7GAzgY&sig=WfjCpDtLqNRMntUfSXgbeqUHL6M&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ula2Ud3WCMK0yAGmqYHgBg&ved=0CFUQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=griswold%20v.%20connecticut%20conviction%20was%20upheld%20by%20the%20Appellate%20Division%20of%20the%20Circuit%20Court&f=false | title =The Baby Matrix | author =Laura Carroll | author2 = | publisher =books.google.com | isbn =0615642993 | date =July 2012[/tpl] Griswold then appealed her conviction to the Supreme Court of the United States. Griswold argued that the Connecticut statute against the use of contraceptives was contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which states, "no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law...nor deny any person the equal protection of the laws," (Amendment 14 Section 1).[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/supremecourt/antebellum/sources_document5.html | title =Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution -- Ratified 1868 | publisher =pbs.org | year =2007[/tpl] The U.S. Supreme Court concluded that the Connecticut Statute was unconstitutional.

==Subsequent jurisprudence==

Later decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court extended the principles of Griswold beyond its particular facts. Eisenstadt v. Baird (1972) extended its holding to unmarried couples, whereas the "right of privacy" in Griswold was said to only apply to marital relationships.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.npr.org/2012/03/22/149138889/the-nation-still-fighting-eisenstadt-v-baird | title =The Nation: Still Fighting 'Eisenstadt v. Baird' | author =Frances Kissling, Jonathan D. Moreno | author2 =The Nation | publisher =npr.org | date =March 22, 2012[/tpl] The argument in Eisenstadt was that it was a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to deny unmarried couples the right to use contraception when married couples did have that right (under Griswold).[tpl]cite web | url=http://embryo.asu.edu/pages/eisenstadt-v-baird-1972 | title =Griswold v. Connecticut (1965) | author =Sheraden Seward Keywords | publisher =Arizona State University[/tpl] Writing for the majority, Justice Brennan wrote that Massachusetts could not enforce the law against married couples because of Griswold v. Connecticut, so the law worked "irrational discrimination" if not extended to unmarried couples as well.
The reasoning and language of both Griswold and Eisenstadt were cited in the concurring opinion by Associate Justice Potter Stewart in support of Roe v. Wade (1973).[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0410_0113_ZC.html | title =Roe v. Wade (No. 70-18) 314 F.Supp. 1217, affirmed in part and reversed in part. STEWART, J., Concurring Opinion SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES | author =Cornell University Law School | publisher =law.cornell.edu[/tpl] The decision in Roe struck down a Texas law that criminalized aiding a woman in getting an abortion.[tpl]cite web | url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/roemoot.html | title =ROE v. WADE 410 U.S. 113 (1973) | author =University of Missouri-Kansas City | publisher =umkc.edu | date =January 22, 1973[/tpl] The Court ruled that this law was a violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The law was struck down, legalizing abortion for any woman for any reason, up through the first trimester, with possible restrictions for maternal health in the second (the midpoint of which is the approximate time of fetal viability), and possibly illegal in the third with exception for the mother's health, which the court defined broadly in Doe v. Bolton.
Lawrence v. Texas (2003) struck down a Texas state law that prohibited certain forms of intimate sexual contact between members of the same sex. Without stating a standard of review in the majority opinion, the court overruled Bowers v. Hardwick (1986), declaring that the "Texas statute furthers no legitimate state interest which can justify its intrusion into the personal and private life of the individual." Justice O'Connor, who wrote a concurring opinion, framed it as an issue of rational basis review. Justice Kennedy's majority opinion, based on the liberty interest protected in the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, stated that the Texas anti-sodomy statute touched "upon the most private human conduct, sexual behavior, and in the most private of places, the home," and attempted to "control a personal relationship that . . . is within the liberty of persons to choose without being punished." Thus, the Court held that adults are entitled to participate in private, consensual sexual conduct. While the opinion in Lawrence was framed in terms of the right to liberty, Kennedy described the "right to privacy" found in Griswold as the "most pertinent beginning point" in the evolution of the concepts embodied in Lawrence.[tpl]cite court |litigants=Lawrence v.
