Ephorus or Ephoros (Ancient Greek: [tpl]lang|grc|Ἔφορος[/tpl]), of Kyme in Aeolia, in Asia Minor, was an ancient Greek historian. He is called "the Younger" to distinguish him from Ephorus, his earlier colleague from the same town.
Ephorus the Younger is mentioned only by Suidas, according to whom he wrote a history of Galienus in twenty-seven books, a work on Corinth, one on the Aleuadae, and a few others. The name Galienus in this account, it should be observed, is only a correction of Volaterranus, for the common reading in Suidas is Galênou.Comp. Marx, Ephor. Fragm. p. 7. (cited by Schmitz)
