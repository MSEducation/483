</ref> The mining operations at the Bayan Obo deposit made China the largest supplier of rare earth elements in the 1990s. Only 0.2% of the rare earth element content is europium. The second large source for rare earth elements between 1965 and its closure in the late 1990s was the [[Mountain Pass rare earth mine]]. The bastnäsite mined there is especially rich in the light rare earth elements (La-Gd, Sc, and Y) and contains only 0.1% of europium. Another large source for rare earth elements is the loparite found on the Kola peninsula. It contains besides niobium, tantalum and titanium up to 30% rare earth elements and is the largest source for these elements in Russia.<ref name="Kirk"/><ref>[tpl]cite journal| doi = 10.1016/S0925-8388(96)02824-1| title = Loparite, a rare-earth ore (Ce, Na, Sr, Ca)(Ti, Nb, Ta, Fe+3)O3| year = 1997| last1 = Hedrick| first1 = J| last2 = Sinha| first2 = S| last3 = Kosynkin| first3 = V| journal = Journal of Alloys and Compounds| volume = 250| pages = 467–470[/tpl]</ref>

==Compounds==

Europium compounds tend to exist trivalent oxidation state under most conditions.  Commonly these compounds feature Eu(III) bound by 6-9 oxygenic ligands, typically water.  These compounds, the chlorides, sulfates, nitrates, are soluble in water or polar organic solvent.  Lipophilic europium complexes often feature acetylacetonate-like ligands, e.g., Eufod.

===Halides===

Europium metal reacts with all the halogens:
This route gives white europium(III) fluoride (EuF3), yellow europium(III) chloride (EuCl3), gray europium(III) bromide (EuBr3), and colorless europium(III) iodide (EuI3). Europium also forms the corresponding dihalides: yellow-green europium(II) fluoride (EuF2), colorless europium(II) chloride (EuCl2), colorless europium(II) bromide (EuBr2), and green europium(II) iodide (EuI2).Holleman, A. F.; Wiberg, E. "Inorganic Chemistry" Academic Press: San Diego, 2001. ISBN 0-12-352651-5.

===Chalcogenides and pnictides===

Europium forms stable compounds with all of the chalcogens, but the heavier chalcogens (S, Se, and Te) stabilize the lower oxidation state. Three oxides are known: europium(II) oxide (EuO), europium(III) oxide (Eu2O3), and the mixed-valence oxide Eu3O4, consisting of both Eu(II) and Eu(III).
Otherwise, the main chalcogenides are europium(II) sulfide (EuS), europium(II) selenide (EuSe) and europium(II) telluride (EuTe): all three of these are black solids. EuS is prepared by sulfiding the oxide at temperatures sufficiently high to decompose the Eu2O3:[tpl]cite journal|doi = 10.1002/9780470132418.ch15|chapter = Europium (II) Sulfide|title = Inorganic Syntheses|series = Inorganic Syntheses|year = 1967|last1 = Archer|first1 = R.

The main nitride is europium(III) nitride (EuN).

==History of study==

Although europium is present in most of the minerals containing the other rare elements, due to the difficulties in separating the elements it was not until the late 1800s that the element was isolated. William Crookes observed the phosphorescent spectra of the rare elements and observed spectral lines later assigned to europium.[tpl]cite journal|jstor = 92772|pages = 411–414|last1 = Crookes|first1 = W.|authorlink=William Crookes|title = On the Phosphorescent Spectra of S δ  and Europium|volume = 76|issue = 511|journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of London|year = 1905|bibcode = 1905RSPSA..76..411C|doi = 10.1098/rspa.1905.0043[/tpl]
Europium was first found by Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran in 1890, who obtained basic fractions from samarium-gadolinium concentrates which had spectral lines not accounted for by samarium or gadolinium. However, the discovery of europium is generally credited to French chemist Eugène-Anatole Demarçay, who suspected samples of the recently discovered element samarium were contaminated with an unknown element in 1896 and who was able to isolate it in 1901; he then named it europium.[tpl]cite journal|url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k30888/f1580.image| journal = Comptes rendus| first = Eugène-Anatole|last = Demarçay|title = Sur un nouvel élément l'europium|volume = 132|pages = 1484–1486|year = 1901[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|doi = 10.1021/ed009p1751|title = The discovery of the elements.

When the europium-doped yttrium orthovanadate red phosphor was discovered in the early 1960s, and understood to be about to cause a revolution in the color television industry, there was a scramble for the limited supply of europium on hand among the monazite processors,[tpl]cite journal | url = http://www.electrochem.org/dl/interface/sum/sum03/IF6-03-Pages48-51.pdf | journal = The Electrochemical Society Interface | year = 2003 | pages = 48–51 | title =Phosphors | first1 =A. M. | last1= Srivastava | first2 = C. R. | last2=Ronda [/tpl] as the typical europium content in monazite is about 0.05%. However, the Molycorp bastnäsite deposit at the Mountain Pass rare earth mine, California, whose lanthanides had an unusually high europium content of 0.1%, was about to come on-line and provide sufficient europium to sustain the industry. Prior to europium, the color-TV red phosphor was very weak, and the other phosphor colors had to be muted, to maintain color balance. With the brilliant red europium phosphor, it was no longer necessary to mute the other colors, and a much brighter color TV picture was the result. Europium has continued in use in the TV industry ever since, and, of course, also in computer monitors. Californian bastnäsite now faces stiff competition from Bayan Obo, China, with an even "richer" europium content of 0.2%.
Frank Spedding, celebrated for his development of the ion-exchange technology that revolutionized the rare earth industry in the mid-1950s, once related the story of how[tpl]cite journal|doi = 10.1039/DF9490700214|title = Large-scale separation of rare-earth salts and the preparation of the pure metals|year = 1949|last1 = Spedding|first1 = Frank H.|journal = Discussions of the Faraday Society|volume = 7|pages = 214 | authorlink = Frank Spedding[/tpl] he was lecturing on the rare earths in the 1930s when an elderly gentleman approached him with an offer of a gift of several pounds of europium oxide. This was an unheard-of quantity at the time, and Spedding did not take the man seriously. However, a package duly arrived in the mail, containing several pounds of genuine europium oxide. The elderly gentleman had turned out to be Herbert Newby McCoy who had developed a famous method of europium purification involving redox chemistry.[tpl]cite journal|url = http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10269&page=300–326|journal = Biographical Memoirs National Academy of Sciences|publisher = National Academy of Sciences|volume = 80|first = John D.|last = Corbett|title = Frank Harold Spedding|bibcode = 1986PhT....39e.106H|year = 1986|pages = 106|doi = 10.1063/1.2815016|issue = 5[/tpl]

==Applications==

Relative to most other elements, commercial applications for europium are few and rather specialized. Almost invariably, they exploit its phosphorescence, either in the +2 or +3 oxidation state.
It is a dopant in some types of glass in lasers and other optoelectronic devices. Europium oxide (Eu2O3) is widely used as a red phosphor in television sets and fluorescent lamps, and as an activator for yttrium-based phosphors.[tpl]cite book|url =http://books.google.de/books?id=P4UCrfp_s0EC&pg=PA323|pages = 323–325|chapter= Rare earths in luminescence|title =Rare earths|isbn =978-84-89784-33-8|last1 =Caro|first= Paul|date =1998-06-01[/tpl][tpl]cite book|url = http://books.google.de/books?id=aFbgmoyArYoC&pg=PA159| pages = 159–171|chapter= Inorganic Phosphors|title = Chromic phenomena: technological applications of colour chemistry|isbn = 978-0-85404-474-0|author1 = Bamfield, Peter|year = 2001[/tpl] Color TV screens contain between 0.5 and 1 g of europium.[tpl]cite journal|url = http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/maney/imr/1992/00000037/00000001/art00015|title = Extractive metallurgy of rare earths|last1= Gupta|first1 = C. K.|last2= Krishnamurthy|first2= N.|journal = International Materials Reviews|volume = 37|year = 1992|pages = 197–248[/tpl] Whereas trivalent europium gives red phosphors, the luminescence of divalent europium depends on the host lattice, but tends to be on the blue side. The two classes of europium-based phosphor (red and blue), combined with the yellow/green terbium phosphors give "white" light, the color temperature of which can be varied by altering the proportion or specific composition of the individual phosphors. This phosphor system is typically encountered in helical fluorescent light bulbs. Combining the same three classes is one way to make trichromatic systems in TV and computer screens. Europium is also used in the manufacture of fluorescent glass. One of the more common persistent after-glow phosphors besides copper doped zinc sulfide is europium doped strontium aluminate.[tpl]cite book| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=lKCWAaCiaZgC&pg=PA269| chapter = Persistent Afterglow Phosphors| title = Luminescence and Display Phosphors: Phenomena and Applications| isbn = 978-1-60456-018-3| author1 = Lakshmanan| first1 = Arunachalam| year = 2008[/tpl] Europium fluorescence is used to interrogate biomolecular interactions in drug-discovery screens. It is also used in the anti-counterfeiting phosphors in euro banknotes.[tpl]cite web| title = Europium and the Euro|url =http://www.smarterscience.com/eurosandeuropium.html| accessdate = 2009-06-06[/tpl][tpl]cite book|url = http://books.google.de/books?id=lvQpiVHrb78C&pg=PA77|page = 77|chapter= Euro banknotes|title = Lanthanide and actinide chemistry|isbn = 978-0-470-01006-8|author1 = Cotton, Simon|year = 2006[/tpl]
An application that has almost fallen out of use with the introduction of affordable superconducting magnets is the use of europium complexes, such as Eu(fod)3, as shift reagents in NMR spectroscopy. Chiral shift reagents, such as Eu(hfc)3 are still used to determine enantiomeric purity.[tpl]cite book|url = http://books.google.de/books?id=CIu-jKr4vWwC&pg=PA106|title = Essential Practical NMR for Organic Chemistry|isbn = 978-0-470-71092-0|author1 = Richards, Stephen|author2 = Hollerton, John|date = 2011-02-15[/tpl][tpl]cite book|url = http://books.google.de/books?id=FkaNOdwk0FQC&pg=PA351|title = Introduction to spectroscopy|isbn = 978-0-495-11478-9|author1 = Pavia, Donald L|author2 = Lampman, Gary M|year = 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite book|url = http://books.google.de/books?id=vOAjp2R29XwC&pg=PA339|title = Discrimination of chiral compounds using NMR spectroscopy|isbn = 978-0-471-76352-9|author1 = Wenzel, Thomas J|year = 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite book|url = http://books.google.de/books?id=lvQpiVHrb78C&pg=PA77|title = Lanthanide and actinide chemistry|isbn = 978-0-470-01006-8|author1 = Cotton, Simon|year = 2006[/tpl][tpl]cite book|url = http://books.google.de/books?id=Q8oPxFJlfp0C&pg=PA221|title = Handbook on the Physics and Chemistry of Rare Earths|isbn = 978-0-444-52028-9|author1 = Gschneidner, Karl A|author2 = Bünzli, Jean-Claude|author3 = Pecharsky, Vitalij K|date = 2005-09-26[/tpl]

==Precautions==

There are no clear indications that europium is particularly toxic compared to other heavy metals. Europium chloride nitrate and oxide have been tested for toxicity: europium chloride shows an acute intraperitoneal LD50 toxicity of 550 mg/kg and the acute oral  LD50 toxicity is 5000 mg/kg. Europium nitrate shows a slightly higher intraperitoneal LD50 toxicity of 320 mg/kg, while the oral toxicity is above 5000 mg/kg.[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1002/jps.2600540435 | title = Pharmacology and toxicology of europium chloride | year = 1965 | last1 = Haley | first1 = Thomas J. | last2 = Komesu | first2 = N. | last3 = Colvin | first3 = G. | last4 = Koste | first4 = L. | last5 = Upham | first5 = H.
