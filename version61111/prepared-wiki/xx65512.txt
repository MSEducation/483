==Geography==

Samar island occupies the eastern portion of the Philippines. It lies southeast of Luzon and occupies the northernmost section of Eastern Visayas.  It is separated from Luzon on the north by San Bernardino Strait and from Leyte on the southwest by the narrow San Juanico Strait.  It is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean, on the south by Leyte Gulf and on the west by the Samar Sea.

===Topography===

Samar province is hilly, with mountain peaks ranging from [tpl]Convert|200|to|800|m[/tpl] high and narrow strips of lowlands, which tend to lie in coastal peripheries or in the alluvial plains and deltas accompanying large rivers.  The largest lowlands are located along the northern coast extending up to the valleys of Catubig and Catarman rivers.  Smaller lowlands in Samar are to be found in the Calbayog area and on the deltas and small valleys of Gandara and Ulot rivers.  Slopes are generally steep and barren of trees due to deforestation.  Run-off waters after heavy rains can provoke flooding in low-lying areas and the erosion of the mountains enlarges the coastal plains of the province.

===Climate and rainfall===

Areas of the Samar province that are characterized by having no dry season with a pronounced maximum rain period which usually occurs from December to January generally along or very near the eastern coast, and thus are open to the northeast monsoon. Municipalities in the southeastern part of the province experience this type of climate.
Those areas located in the northwestern part of the province have a more or less evenly distributed rainfall throughout the year.

===Subdivisions===

The province of Samar is composed of two congressional districts, 24 municipalities and two cities (Catbalogan and Calbayog). It has a total of 952 barangays.
