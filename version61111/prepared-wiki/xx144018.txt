Stewartia ovata, also Stuartia ovata, known commonly as Mountain Camellia, is a species of Stewartia native to low to mid-elevations in the southern Appalachian Mountains. A relative of the evergreen Camellias of Asia, other common names include summer dogwood and Mountain Stewartia. 
Although not endangered, the plant does have a limited range and is considered to be rare.  Mountain Camellia grows in the understory of predominately hardwood forests and tends to be found near streams, usually at elevations below 800 m (2,500 feet).
