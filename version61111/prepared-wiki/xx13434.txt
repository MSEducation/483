[[60]]

CATEGORIES: 60

Year 60 (LX) was a leap year starting on Tuesday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Caesar and Afer (or, less frequently, year 813 ''Ab urbe condita''). The denomination 60 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.
