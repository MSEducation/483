Big government (sometimes capitalized as Big Government) is a derogatory term generally used by political conservatives, laissez-faire advocates, or libertarians to describe a government or public sector that they consider to be excessively large, corrupt and inefficient, or inappropriately involved in certain areas of public policy or the private sector. The term may also be used specifically in relation to government policies that attempt to regulate matters considered to be private or personal, such as private sexual behavior or individual food choices.[tpl]cite news|last=Grynbaum|first=Michael|title=New York Plans to Ban Sale of Big Sizes of Sugary Drinks|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/31/nyregion/bloomberg-plans-a-ban-on-large-sugared-drinks.html?_r=1|accessdate=2 June 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=May 31, 2012[/tpl] The term has also been used to define a dominant federal government that seeks to control the authority of local institutions - an example being the overriding of state authority in favor of federal legislation.[tpl]cite web|title=The meaning of big government|url=http://www.renewamerica.com/analysis/garry/110614|publisher=Renew America|accessdate=26 April 2012|author=Patrick Garry|date=June 14, 2011[/tpl]

Big government is primarily defined by its size, a criterion that incorporates variables such as the number of employees, relative costs, and the "spheres of involvement"[tpl]clarify|date=May 2012[/tpl]. The concept can also be defined by the perceived role of government in society, the quality of services (that is, the impact of government effort), and the degree of democracy and societal representation.Micheletti, M.
