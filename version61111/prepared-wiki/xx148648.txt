The Mission School (sometimes called "New Folk"Joo, Eungie. 2002. "The New Folk”, Flash Art, May/June 2002, pp 124-126. or "Urban Rustic"Pritikin, Renny. Harvest: Introduction, republished in Shift #69, August 2002.) is an art movement of the 1990s and 2000s, centered in the Mission District of San Francisco, California.

==History and characteristics==

This movement is generally considered to have emerged in the early 1990s around a core group of artists who attended (or were associated with) San Francisco Art Institute. The term "Mission School", however, was not coined until 2002, in a San Francisco Bay Guardian article by Glen Helfand.Helfand, Glen. "The Mission school", San Francisco Bay Guardian, October 28, 2002.
The Mission School is closely aligned with the larger lowbrow art movement, and can be considered to be a regional expression of that movement. Artists of the Mission School take their inspiration from the urban, bohemian, "street" culture of the Mission District and are strongly influenced by mural and graffiti art, comic and cartoon art, and folk art forms such as sign painting and hobo art.Modigliani, Leah. "Marketing the Mission: Commodifying San Francisco’s Art, the 'Mission School', and the Problem of Regionalism", Stretcher.org, September 17, 2004. These artists are also noted for use of non-traditional artistic materials, such as house paint, spray paint, correction fluid, ballpoint pens, scrapboard, and found objects."The New 'Mission School'" (panel), Commonwealth Club of California, June 4, 2003. (link to RealAudio file) Gallery work by these artists is often displayed using the "cluster method", in which a number of individual works (sometimes by different artists) are clustered closely together on a gallery wall, rather than the traditional gallery display method of widely separating individual works.Rose, Aaron; Strike, Christian. 2004. Beautiful Losers: Contemporary Art and Street Culture. ISBN 1-891024-74-4
Street art has always been an important part of the Mission School aesthetic. Several Mission School artists crossed over into San Francisco's burgeoning graffiti art scene of the 1990s, notably Barry McGee (who wrote under the name "Twist"), Ruby Neri (a.k.a. "Reminisce"), Dan Plasma, and Margaret Kilgallen (a.k.a. "Meta").Blague, Amor Sans. "Reminisce Remembered", Motility Blog, 30 April 2005.Wilson, Megan. Clarion Alley Mural Project, MeganWilson.com, 2006.

==Artists==

Artists considered to be part of the Mission School (past or present) have included:Reader responses to "Marketing the Mission", Dan Plasma Stretcher.org, January 17, 2005."Ten by Twenty", SFStation.com, November 16, 2004.Feaster, Felicia. "Bill Daniel: Off the grid", Creative Loafing Atlanta, 26 March 2008.
The profile of these artists was raised considerably by the inclusion of the work of Barry McGee in the 2001 Venice Biennale"Panic Attack: Navigating the Venice Biennale's Sprawling Interzone" by Kim Levin, Village Voice, June 25th, 2001. and the works of Chris Johanson and Margaret Kilgallen in the 2002 Whitney Biennial."Adobe proved fertile ground for 'Mission School' artist Chris Johanson's work featured in Whitney Biennial" by Jamie Berger, San Francisco Chronicle, April 10, 2003.

==New Mission School==

In 2003, not long after the term "Mission School" was coined, a panel at the Commonwealth Club of California named several emerging San Francisco artists as constituting a "New Mission School". These artists included Andrew Schoultz, Dave Warnke, Sirron Norris, Neonski, Ricardo, Damon Soule, Misk, and NoMe, though many of these artists do not embrace the "Mission School" label.

==Criticism==

The term Mission School has been criticized for being too geographically specific (many artists outside of San Francisco share this aesthetic, while others living in the Mission District do not), while at the same time being a vague catch-all, with many artists who are referred to as Mission School having a hard time seeing how they are part of this "school".Noble, Aaron.
