==Career==

Growing up, Derlago excelled at multiple sports, including golf, tennis, baseball, and hockey. He achieved best success with ice hockey, playing with Brandon Wheat Kings and setting a number of WCJHL records. Subsequently, he was selected fourth overall by the Vancouver Canucks in the 1978 NHL Entry Draft.
As a rookie with the Canucks in 1978–79, Derlago badly injured his knee and was limited to just 9 games, though he did score a respectable 8 points. Though he played well in Vancouver, he was unable to live up to the high expectations, and was traded to Toronto along with Rick Vaive for Tiger Williams and Jerry Butler on February 18, 1980.[tpl]legendsofhockey|12444[/tpl]
In Toronto Derlago, raised to a star status, worked particularly well with Vaive. Though successful on the ice, it was speculated that Derlago could have achieved more.
On October 11, 1985, he was traded to the Boston Bruins for Tom Fergus. In Boston, he played as a defensive forward on the third- and fourth-line. After only 39 games in Boston he was again traded, this time to the Winnipeg Jets in exchange for Wade Campbell. In the later stages of his career Derlago, was sent to the Quebec Nordiques in 1987. Finally, Derlago was relegated to the Fredericton Express of the AHL. 
Derlago would spend one additional season in Italy before announcing his retirement in 1988. 
Derlago currently resides in Concord, Ontario, and operates a Chrysler dealership.
