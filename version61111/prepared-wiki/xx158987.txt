[[RLIF Awards]]

CATEGORIES: Rugby league trophies and awards

The Rugby League International Federation (RLIF) currently oversees and awards the major international sporting award for rugby league on an annual basis and has done so since its inception in 2004.
This ceremony awards  the best referee, coach, developing nations player, international newcomer, captain and a team of the year.
In 2007, the RLIF did not organise any awards. To fill the gap, Rugby League World magazine asked its Golden Boot panel to come up with winners in the existing categories used by the RLIF.
Coinciding with the 2008 Rugby League World Cup, the RLIF Awards were rebranded and the old award system was replaced.http://www.rlwc08.com/news/news/archive/2008/11/16/rlif-awards-night.aspx [tpl]Dead link|date=July 2011[/tpl]
