E minor (Em, Mim) is a minor scale based on the note E. The E natural minor scale ([tpl]music|scale|1[/tpl] [tpl]music|scale|2[/tpl] [tpl]music|b[/tpl][tpl]music|scale|3[/tpl] [tpl]music|scale|4[/tpl] [tpl]music|scale|5[/tpl] [tpl]music|b[/tpl][tpl]music|scale|6[/tpl][tpl]music|b[/tpl][tpl]music|scale|7[/tpl]) consists of the pitches E, F[tpl]Music|sharp[/tpl], G, A, B, C, and D.  The E harmonic minor scale ([tpl]music|scale|1[/tpl] [tpl]music|scale|2[/tpl] [tpl]music|b[/tpl][tpl]music|scale|3[/tpl] [tpl]music|scale|4[/tpl] [tpl]music|scale|5[/tpl] [tpl]music|b[/tpl][tpl]music|scale|6[/tpl] [tpl]music|scale|7[/tpl]) contains the natural 7, D[tpl]Music|sharp[/tpl], rather than the flatted 7, D â€“ to align with the major dominant chord, B7 (B D[tpl]music|#[/tpl] F[tpl]music|#[/tpl] A).
Its key signature has one sharp, F (see below: Scales and keys).
Its relative major is G major, and its parallel major is E major.
Much of the classical guitar repertoire is in E minor, as this is a very natural key for the instrument. In standard tuning (E A D G B E), four of the instrument's six 'open' (unfretted) strings are part of the tonic chord. The key of E minor is also extremely popular in heavy metal music, as its tonic is the lowest note on a standard-tuned guitar.
