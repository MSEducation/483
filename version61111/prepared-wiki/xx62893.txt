CATEGORIES: Anomura, Hermit crabs

Hermit crabs are decapod crustaceans of the superfamily Paguroidea.[tpl]cite WoRMS |author=Patsy McLaughlin & Michael Türkay |year=2011 |title=Paguroidea |db=Paguroidea |id=106687 |accessdate=November 25, 2011[/tpl] Most of the 1100 species possess an asymmetrical abdomen which is concealed in an empty gastropod shell carried around by the hermit crab.

==Description==

Most species have long, spirally curved abdomens, which are soft, unlike the hard, calcified abdomens seen in related crustaceans. The vulnerable abdomen is protected from predators by a salvaged empty seashell carried by the hermit crab, into which its whole body can retract.[tpl]cite book |author=Ray W.

As the hermit crab grows in size, it must find a larger shell and abandon the previous one. This habit of living in a second-hand shell gives rise to the popular name "hermit crab", by analogy to a hermit who lives alone.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=hermit |title=Hermit |work=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=March 26, 2010 |author=Douglas Harper[/tpl] Several hermit crab species, both terrestrial and marine, use vacancy chains to find new shells; when a new, bigger shell becomes available, hermit crabs gather around it and form a kind of queue from largest to smallest. When the largest crab moves into the new shell, the second-biggest crab moves into the newly vacated shell, thereby making its previous shell available to the third crab, and so on.[tpl]cite book|last=Borden|first=Kristin|title=Vacancy Chains in the Hermit Crab, Pagurus Longicarpus|year=1995|publisher=Florida State University|location=Tallahassee, Florida|pages=104|url=http://books.google.com/books/about/Vacancy_Chains_in_the_Hermit_Crab_Paguru.html?id=SD8etwAACAAJ[/tpl][tpl]cite news |publisher=Tufts University |url=http://now.tufts.edu/news-releases?id=169 |title=Social networking helps hermit crabs find homes: previously unknown group behaviors lead to better housing for all |date=April 26, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Randi D.

Most species are aquatic and live in varying depths of salt water, from shallow reefs and shorelines to deep sea bottoms. Tropical areas host some terrestrial species, though even those have aquatic larvae and therefore need access to water for reproduction. Most hermit crabs are nocturnal.
A few species do not use a "mobile home" and inhabit immobile structures left by polychaete worms, vermetid gastropods, corals, and sponges.

==Biology==

===Shells and shell competition===

As hermit crabs grow, they require larger shells. Since suitable intact gastropod shells are sometimes a limited resource, vigorous competition often occurs among hermit crabs for shells. The availability of empty shells at any given place depends on the relative abundance of gastropods and hermit crabs, matched for size. An equally important issue is the population of organisms that prey upon gastropods and leave the shells intact.[tpl]cite journal |title=Shell acquisition by hermit crabs: which tactic is more efficient? |author=E. Tricarico & F. Gherardi |journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology |volume=60 |issue=4 |pages=492–500 |year=2006 |doi=10.1007/s00265-006-0191-3[/tpl] Hermit crabs kept together may fight or kill a competitor to gain access to the shell they favour. However, if the crabs vary significantly in size, the occurrence of fights over empty shells will decrease or remain nonexistent.
Hermit crabs with too-small shells cannot grow as fast as those with well-fitting shells, and are more likely to be eaten if they cannot retract completely into the shell.[tpl]cite journal |title=Effects of shell fit on the biology of the hermit crab Pagurus longicarpus (Say) |author=J. E. Angel |journal=Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology |volume=243 |issue=2 |pages=169–184 |year=2000 |doi=10.1016/S0022-0981(99)00119-7[/tpl] However, during times of molting, hermit crabs in captivity may temporarily move into a smaller shell, presumably so that less sand comes through the shell opening when they bury themselves. The inverse has also been observed: a hermit crab getting ready to molt may move into a shell that is much too large, especially if the hermit crab is not in a habitat where it can bury itself in sand.[tpl]fact|date=March 2014[/tpl]
For some larger marine species, supporting one or more sea anemones on the shell can scare away predators. The sea anemone benefits, because it is in position to consume fragments of the hermit crab's meals. Other very close symbiotic relationships are known from encrusting bryozoans and hermit crabs forming 
bryoliths.[tpl]cite journal |author=A. Klicpera, Paul D. Taylor, H. Westphal |year=2013 |title=Bryoliths constructed by bryozoans in symbiotic associations with hermit crabs in a tropical heterozoan carbonate system, Golfe d’Arguin, Mauritania |journal=Marine Biodiversity |doi=10.1007/s12526-013-0173-4[/tpl]

===Development and reproduction===

Hermit crab species range in size and shape, from species with a carapace only a few millimetres long to Coenobita brevimanus, which can live 30–70 years
and can approach the size of a coconut. The shell-less hermit crab Birgus latro (coconut crab) is the world's largest terrestrial invertebrate.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1098/rstb.1971.0020 |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B |year=1971 |volume=260 |issue=836 |pages=411–416 |author=P.

The young develop in stages, with the first two (the nauplius and protozoea) occurring inside the egg. Most hermit crab larvae hatch at the third stage, the zoea. In this larval stage, the crab has several long spines, a long, narrow abdomen, and large fringed antennae. Several zoeal moults are followed by the final larval stage, the megalopa.[tpl]cite journal |title=Larvae of the hermit crab, Pagurus arcuatus, from the plankton (Crustacea, Decapoda) |author=H. J.

==Classification==

Hermit crabs are more closely related to squat lobsters and porcelain crabs than they are to true crabs (Brachyura). However, the relationship of king crabs to the rest of Paguroidea is a highly contentious topic. Many studies based on physical characteristics, genetic information, and combined data support the longstanding hypothesis that the king crabs in the family Lithodidae are derived hermit crabs and should be classified as a family within Paguroidea.[tpl]cite journal |journal = Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London |author= J.

==Fossil record==

The fossil record of in situ hermit crabs using gastropod shells stretches back to the Late Cretaceous. Before that time, at least some hermit crabs used ammonites' shells instead, as shown by a specimen of Palaeopagurus vandenengeli from the Speeton Clay, Yorkshire, UK from the Lower Cretaceous.[tpl]cite journal |author=René H. Fraaije |year=2003 |title=The oldest in situ hermit crab from the Lower Cretaceous of Speeton, UK |journal=Palaeontology |volume=46 |pages=53–57 |doi=10.1111/1475-4983.00286 |issue=1[/tpl]

==As pets==

Several marine species of hermit crabs are common in the marine aquarium trade. Of the approximately 15 terrestrial species in the world, the following are commonly kept as pets: Caribbean hermit crab (Coenobita clypeatus), Australian land hermit crab (Coenobita variabilis), and the Ecuadorian hermit crab (Coenobita compressus). Other species, such as Coenobita brevimanus, Coenobita rugosus, Coenobita perlatus or Coenobita cavipes, are less common but growing in availability and popularity as pets.
These omnivorous or herbivorous species can be useful in the household aquarium as scavengers, because they eat algae and debris.
Hermit crabs are often seen as a "throwaway pet" that would live only a few months, but species such as Coenobita clypeatus have a 23-year lifespan if properly treated,[tpl]Cite journal | first = Pet Smart Veterinarians | title = Land Hermit Crab Care Guide | publisher = Pet Smart | year =2006 | url = http://www.petsmart.com/uc/petarticles_db.jsp?ucCategory=CARE&ucTopic=FISH&ucSubTopic=CARE&ucSubTopic2=&ucContent=/articles/content/fish/care/hermit-crab/HermitCrabs.html | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20110611083925/http://www.petsmart.com/uc/petarticles_db.jsp?ucCategory=CARE&ucTopic=FISH&ucSubTopic=CARE&ucSubTopic2=&ucContent=/articles/content/fish/care/hermit-crab/HermitCrabs.html | archivedate = 2011-06-11[/tpl] and some have lived longer than 32 years.[tpl]cite news |author=Linda Lombardi |title=Hermit crabs don’t have to fade away; with proper care they can have long life | publisher = The Associated Press |newspaper=Amherst Daily News |date=July 22, 2008 |url=http://www.amherstdaily.com/index.cfm?sid=155348&sc=510 |accessdate=July 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web |author=Stacy |title=How old is my hermit crab? |publisher=The Crabstreet Journal |date=February 21, 2013 |url=http://crabstreetjournal.org/wp/blog/2013/02/21/how-old-is-my-hermit-crab/ |accessdate=April 28, 2013[/tpl]
In general, and despite their moniker, hermit crabs are social animals that do best in groups.[tpl]cite web |author=Christa Wilkin |title=Basic crab care |year=2004 |url=http://www.hermit-crabs.com/care.html |accessdate=August 2008[/tpl] In the wild they can be found in colonies of a hundred or more. Therefore, many sellers encourage the purchase of more than one crab.[tpl]cite web |author=Tammy Weick |title=The Hermit Crab Patch |year=2010 |url=http://www.hermitcrabpatch.com/Hermit-Crab-Friends-a/150.htm |accessdate= November 2010[/tpl] Hermit crab terrarium environments require a temperature around 75-85 °F - and humidity around 70-80% -controlled environment. Hermit crabs need salt and fresh water. Hermit crabs are scavengers, thus the food given to hermit crabs is various. Fruits, vegetables, and cooked meat can be given to hermit crabs, as long as they are not put in preservatives. Substrate needed is sand, coconut mulch or crushed coral substrate that is deep enough to allow them to completely bury themselves while moulting. During molting, hermit crabs should not be dug up. Those that are dug up regularly will create a molt inhibiting hormone called Xanthurenic acid. The exoskeleton that is left behind is eaten by the newly molted hermit crab. The exoskeleton contains much needed nutrients, including calcium.
