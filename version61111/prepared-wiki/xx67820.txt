===Drama===

Carlton High School is known for its productions dealing with topics such as Nazism, dark Gothic romances, and light-hearted children's plays. Every year, three productions are put on with one being a children's play that tours the public elementary schools in November. The next play is put on in early March and is a contestant in the region 7 drama festival. The final play is often presented in early May, consisting of a large cast and crew. Most often this play is of a Shakespearean genre, but with a strange modernized twist. The drama club often does a short film to complement the final play.[ref]

Carlton High School also has a French drama group called Les Solipsistes, directed by Michael Bowden, a French immersion and core French teacher. The group performs two plays every year, one Christmas play, directed towards children, and a competition play for the drama festival.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2011[/tpl]

===Festivals===

Every year Prince Albert has a variety of festivals, fairs, shows, etc. Different times of the year have different festivals.
Since 1990 the city of Prince Albert has hosted the "Lil Jim Festival" each year. Lil Jim is the nickname of a short but tremendously talented soccer player from the city. The true name of this soccer player is unknown, so many people believe Lil Jim exists merely as a fictional legend. During its first few years the festival was a one-day event. The festival grew in popularity throughout the early 1990s though, and by 1995 it was expanded to a two-day event. The festival continued to grow after its 1995 expansion. In 2001 it became the week long event it is today. Now the Lil Jim Festival is one of Prince Albert's premiere events. People from all over Saskatchewan attend it annually. The festival has also become a substantial source of revenue for the city.
