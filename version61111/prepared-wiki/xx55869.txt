In demonology, Vine is an Earl and also a King of Hell, commanding 36 legions of demons. He can tell present, past and future, discover witches and hidden things, create storms and make the water rough by means of them, bring down walls and build towers.
This demon is portrayed as a lion holding a snake in his hand and riding a black horse.
The etymology of his name seems to be the Latin word 'vinea', vine, that is also the name given to an ancient war machine made of wood and covered with leather and branches, used to overthrow walls.
Other spellings: Vin√©, Vinea.
