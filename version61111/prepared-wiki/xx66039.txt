Biman Bangladesh Airlines ([tpl]lang-bn|বিমান বাংলাদেশ এয়ারলাইনস[/tpl]),[tpl]#tag:ref|বিমান ('biman)'' means initially a ''vehicle'', a ''charriot''. This word applies also to an aircraft and to the sky. Derived terms mean ''aerodrome'' (ঘাঁটি – together with বিমানাঙ্গন, ''airfield''), ''aviation'' (চলন), ''pilot'' (চালক), ''airport'' (বন্দর) or ''aeronautics'' (বিদ্যা), among others (source: 'Bangla Ovidhan' dictonary online). Biman Bangladesh is the exact translation of Air Bangladesh.|group="nb"[/tpl] partly transcribed from English into Bengali and the other way around; commonly known as Biman' ([tpl]lang-bn|বিমান[/tpl]); is the national flag carrier of Bangladesh. Its main hub is at Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka and it also operates flights from its secondary hubs at Shah Amanat International Airport in Chittagong and Osmani International Airport in Sylhet. The airline provides international passenger and cargo services to its destinations. It has air service agreements with 42 countries. The airline's headquarters, Balaka Bhaban'', is located in Kurmitola, Dhaka. Annual Hajj flights; transporting tourists and non-resident Bangladeshi workers and migrants; and the activities of its subsidiaries form an integral part of the airline's business.[tpl]rp|11[/tpl] The carrier is currently facing stiff competition from a number of domestic Bangladeshi private airlines as well as some international carriers, which offer greater flexibility targeting Bangladesh's air transport sector which is experiencing an 8% annual growth rate, thanks to a large number of tourists and non-resident Bangladeshi travellers.
Created in February 1972, Biman enjoyed an internal monopoly in the aviation industry of Bangladesh until 1996.[tpl]cite encyclopedia |title=Airports |encyclopedia=Banglapedia |publisher=Asiatic Society of Bangladesh |url=http://www.banglapedia.org/httpdocs/HT/A_0134.HTM |accessdate=30 May 2007[/tpl] In the decades following its founding, the airline expanded its fleet and destinations but it was adversely affected by corruption and mismanagement. At its peak, Biman operated flights to 29 international destinations, extending from New York City in the west to Tokyo in the east. The airline was wholly owned and managed by the government of Bangladesh until 23 July 2007, when it was transformed into the country's largest public limited company by the Caretaker Government of Bangladesh. Since becoming a public limited company in 2007, the airline has reduced staff and begun to modernise its fleet. The airline has made a deal with Boeing for ten new aircraft along with options for ten more."Boeing starts $1.3bln Bangladesh plane supply 2011", Reuters, 8 May 2010 Biman Bangladesh Airlines is certified as safe to fly in Europe by the European Aviation Safety Agency"List of airlines banned within the EU", European Aviation Safety Agency, 4 December 2012"Official Journal of the European Union", European Aviation Safety Agency, 4 December 2012 and it also successfully passed the IATA Operational Safety Audit and since then, the airline has resumed flights to some of its previous destinations in Asia and Europe.

==History==

Biman Bangladesh Airlines was established on 4 January 1972 as Bangladesh's national airline under the Bangladesh Biman Ordinance (Presidential Order No. 126).[tpl]cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.banglapedia.org/httpdocs/HT/B_0516.HTM |title=Biman Bangladesh Airlines |encyclopedia=Banglapedia |accessdate=4 September 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.minlaw.gov.bd/first_schedule.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070928082723/http://www.minlaw.gov.bd/first_schedule.htm |archivedate=28 September 2007 |title=First Schedule (Article 47) |publisher=Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh |accessdate=4 September 2007[/tpl] The initiative to launch the flag carrier was taken by 2,500 former employees, including ten Boeing 707 commanders and seven other pilots of Pakistan International Airlines, who submitted a proposal to the government on 31 December 1971 following the independence of Bangladesh.The History of Biman Bangladesh Airlines. Jatree. Biman Bangladesh Airlines. January–March 1987.[tpl]rp|6[/tpl] The airline was initially called Air Bangladesh but was soon changed to its current name.
On 4 February 1972, Biman started its domestic services, initially linking Dhaka with Chittagong, Jessore and Sylhet, using a single Douglas DC-3 acquired from India. Following the crash of this DC-3 on 10 February 1972, near Dhaka, during a test flight,[tpl]Cite web|url= http://aviation-safety.net/database/operator/airline.php?var=5131|title= Accident record for Biman Bangladesh Airlines|work= Aviation Safety Network|accessdate= 6 November 2013[/tpl] two Fokker F27s belonging to Indian Airlines and supplied by the Indian government entered the fleet as a replacement. Shortly afterwards, additional capacity was provided with the incorporation of a Douglas DC-6, loaned by the World Council of Churches, which was in turn replaced with another Douglas DC-6, a DC-6B model leased from Troll-Air, to operate the Dhaka-Calcutta route. On 4 March 1972, Biman started its international operations with a weekly flight to London using a Boeing 707 chartered from British Caledonian.[tpl]Cite journal|title= AIR TRANSPORT|journal= Flight International|date= 16 March 1972|page= 373|format= pdf|url= http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1972/1972%20-%200577.html|accessdate= 24 August 2011|quote= Bangladesh Biman, new national carrier of Bangladesh, began operating London-Dacca charter services by subcontract to British Caledonian on 4 March.[/tpl] The short haul fleet was supplemented by a Fokker F27 from India on 3 March 1972; the aircraft was employed on a daily scheduled flight between Calcutta and Dhaka on 28 April 1972.[tpl]rp|7[/tpl] Three additional Fokker F27s were acquired during March and September of that year.[tpl]rp|6[/tpl] In the first year of operation, Biman operated 1,079 flights carrying just over 380,000 passengers.[tpl]rp|8[/tpl]

===Ownership===

The airline was wholly owned by the Bangladeshi government through the Bangladesh Biman Corporation since its inception. In 1977, Biman was converted into a public sector corporation which afforded Biman limited autonomy, led by a government-appointed board of directors.[tpl]rp|7[/tpl] The authorised share capital was increased to BDT 2 billion in 1987,[tpl]Cite web|title= Amendment of section 5 of Ord.

===Privatisation===

====1980s====

During the late 1980s, Hossain Mohammad Ershad, President of Bangladesh at the time, served as president of Biman. After an early period of expansion and growth, Biman entered an era of nose-diving profits and slow growth, exacerbated by incompetent and corrupt management, who padded purchases, falsified repair bills, and kept unprofitable routes in operation for political reasons.[tpl]Cite news|url= http://www.thedailystar.net/2006/10/08/d6100801044.htm|title= Nothing impossible in Biman purchase|first= Rashidul|last= Hasan|work= The Daily Star|date= 8 October 2006|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/67sFc1E4m|archivedate= 23 May 2012|accessdate= 23 May 2012[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/5298284.stm|title= Airline's 'lonely hearts' tactic|first= Alastair|last= Lawson|publisher= BBC News|date= 30 August 2006|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/67sFKcDaP|archivedate= 23 May 2012|accessdate= 23 May 2012[/tpl] Research conducted in 1996 found that Biman had 5,253 non-flying personnel, 30 percent more than Singapore Airlines, a carrier who operated a fleet almost ten times the size of Biman's. The report described Biman as "poorly managed, overstaffed, undercapitalized, and subject to excessive political interference in its day-to-day management."[tpl]Cite web|url= http://www.lcgbangladesh.org/Governance/reports/1996-WB-Government%20that%20works.pdf|title= Government that Works: Reforming the Public Sector|work= Private Sector Development & Finance Division{–}Country Department 1 – South Asia Region|date= 10 July 1996|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/67sFqFTQT|archivedate= 23 May 2012|accessdate= 23 May 2012[/tpl]

====1990s====

In the 1992–93 fiscal year, accounts under the Ministry of Civil Aviation and Tourism revealed that BDT 22 million in tax was not paid to the government. The audit carried out in 1999, also showed that Biman was owed BDT 2.2 million by travel agents from the proceeds of ticket sales, most likely with the collusion of Biman officials.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cagbd.org/pdf/annual_report_1999.pdf |title=Annual Report 1999, Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General of Bangladesh. |publisher=Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh |year=1999 |accessdate=13 September 2007|format=PDF |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080414152850/http://www.cagbd.org/pdf/annual_report_1999.pdf  |archivedate = 14 April 2008[/tpl] Additionally, BDT 2.4 million was overpaid as incentive commissions to the sales agents in violation of Biman policies. In 2007, the caretaker government launched an anti-corruption drive which saw the arrest of Shamim Iskander, the brother of ex-prime minister Begum Khaleda Zia and a former Biman flight engineer, on multiple corruption charges.[tpl]Cite news|title= Clipping the wings|first= Imran|last= Asif|work= The Daily Star|date= 16 March 2007|url= http://www.thedailystar.net/2007/03/16/d703161501133.htm|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/67sG9IE0i|archivedate= 23 May 2012|accessdate= 23 May 2012[/tpl] This was shortly followed by the forced retirement of 35 other employees and officials, some of whom were close aides of Iskander.[tpl]Cite news|url= http://www.thedailystar.net/2007/03/28/d70328013326.htm|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/67sGUpI9V|archivedate= 23 May 2012|accessdate= 23 May 2012|title= 35 Biman staff sent on forced retirement|work= The Daily Star|date= 28 March 2007[/tpl]

However, the proposal demanded that many decision-making rights remain within the Bangladesh government, and the offer was ignored by outside airlines. A similar initiative in 1998 cost Biman $1.6 million in consultancy fees with no positive results.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.newagebd.com/2006/nov/18/front.html#3 |title=Biman's call for strategic partner flops |work=The New Age|date=18 November 2006 |accessdate=10 June 2007[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=August 2013[/tpl]

====2000s====

In the 2005–06 fiscal year, Biman carried 1.15 million passengers, a growth of 70% over the previous decade. With the rise of private domestic carriers in Bangladesh, however, Biman's market share for domestic passengers dropped by 35% over the previous ten years' average, with only 162,000 passengers travelling with Biman in the domestic sector in the 2005–06 fiscal year. During the same period, Biman reported its biggest annual loss of over US$120 million (BDT 8.3 billion as of 2010), with a US$100 million (BDT 6.9 billion as of 2010) loss reported the following year.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.newagebd.com/2006/jun/12/nat.html |title=Biman loses Tk 836cr in first 10 months of 2005–06 fiscal |work=The New Age|date=12 June 2006 |accessdate=20 September 2007[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=August 2013[/tpl] Biman also fell behind on millions of dollars in payments to its fuel supplier, the Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC),[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.bangladeshmonitor.net/aviation_story.php?recordID=976  |title=No plan to tackle critical problems |work=The Bangladesh Monitor |date=1 June 2007 |accessdate=10 June 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080401103901/http://www.bangladeshmonitor.net/aviation_story.php?recordID=976 |archivedate = 1 April 2008[/tpl] with debts that rose to BDT 15.64 billion in late [tpl]Start date|df=yes|2006|12[/tpl].

====Public limited company====

In [tpl]Start date|2007|5|df=yes[/tpl], the caretaker government approved plans to turn Biman into a public limited company with shareholdings split between seven public sector organisations.[tpl]Cite news|url= http://www.thedailystar.net/2007/06/06/d70606011710.htm |title= Biman offers its staff voluntary retirement|first= Rashidul|last= Hasan|work= The Daily Star|date= 6 June 2007|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/696JRQM8Q|archivedate= 12 July 2012|accessdate= 12 July 2012[/tpl] As a part of the restructuring, the government put in place a voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) to reduce the man-equipment ratio (MER) of 367:1 (ratio of manpower to aircraft). The industry average at the time was 200:1, and other Asian airlines operated with MERs of about 150:1. The VRS provided compensation based on length of service, at a cost to the government of over BDT 2.97 billion borrowed from the World Bank. Biman management expected to reduce its workforce by 1,600, but 2,162 applications were received, many from employees who expected to be dismissed with little or no severance pay if the quota was not met. Biman accepted between 1,863[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.southasianmedia.net/cnn.cfm?id=403449&category=Services&Country=BANGLADESH |title= 1863 Biman staff sent into retirement |publisher=South Asian Media Net |date=3 July 2007 |accessdate=29 August 2007 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070927215931/http://www.southasianmedia.net/cnn.cfm?id=403449&category=Services&Country=BANGLADESH  |archivedate=27 September 2007[/tpl] and 1877 applications, and affirmed that key personnel would not be allowed to leave the organisation via VRS.
On 23 July 2007, Biman Bangladesh Airlines became the largest public limited company in Bangladesh.

The airline made profits in FY 2007–08 (BDT 60 million) and FY 2008–09 (BDT 150 million); In FY 2009–10, however, the carrier incurred in a net loss of BDT 800 million.

====2010s====

In FY 2010–11 it made losses of BDT 2 billion, despite the government exempting it a debt of about BDT 11.94 billion and BDT 5.73 billion owed to the BPC and the CAAB, respectively. In FY 2011–12 it made a loss of BDT 6.06 billion ([tpl]US$|75[/tpl] million); in FY 2012–13 unaudited figures show a loss of BDT 2 billion. The airline plans to be fully profitable by FY 2014–15. [tpl]As of|2013|12[/tpl], Biman owed BDT 15.60 billion to different sources; of which BDT 3676.2 million to CAAB[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/beta2/news/biman-faces-cash-crunch/ |title=Biman faces cash crunch |work=The Daily Star |date=12 August 2013 |accessdate=30 November 2013[/tpl] and BDT 8.50 billion to Padma Oil Company, its fuel supplier.

===Subsidiaries===

Biman's subsidiaries are associated with aircraft ground handling, aviation engineering, aviation training and flight catering.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.biman-airlines.com/corporate | title = Corporate Profile | publisher = Biman Bangladesh Airlines | accessdate=22 July 2013[/tpl] There are five wholly owned subsidiaries, including:

The wholly owned subsidiary BFCC was set up in 1989 to provide in-flight meals. It is one of Biman's profitable operations, supplying food to Saudia, Etihad, Malaysia Airlines, Thai Airways, Emirates, Dragon Air, China Southern Airlines and Regent Airways, along with casual orders from other airlines operating into Bangladesh. The BFCC consumes 90% of the eggs and chickens from the BPC, another profit-making subsidiary of Biman formed in 1976 and put into operation in November 1980 to rear poultry at farms in Dhaka. Bird flu was detected at one of the farms in March 2007, and many of the birds were culled. This was the first incident of bird flu in Bangladesh.

==Services==

Biman is notable for disruptions to its flight schedule and poor customer service. In 2007, Biman faced strong criticism from major international airports including London Heathrow Airport and Dubai International Airport for its failure to maintain flight schedules. Heathrow Airport operator BAA wrote to Biman providing evidence which showed Biman had not achieved the minimum 80% usage of its allocated landing slots at Heathrow, as required by EU and International Air Transport Association (IATA) regulations, during the summer of 2007. Biman should, therefore, not expect slot allocations at Heathrow for the summer of 2008 and should look to Stansted or Gatwick airports if it wished to continue serving London.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/story.php?nid=9935 |title=Int'l airports warn Biman of boycott |work=The Daily Star |date=2 November 2007 |accessdate=2 November 2007 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071102130720/http://www.thedailystar.net/story.php?nid=9935  |archivedate=2 November 2007[/tpl] Following discussions with BAA, however, Biman obtained landing slots for the summer of 2008 on condition that it achieved 80% usage.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/story.php?nid=11122 |title=Biman gets conditional slot at Heathrow until Oct '08 |work=The Daily Star |date=11 November 2007 |accessdate=13 November 2007 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071111105014/http://www.thedailystar.net/story.php?nid=11122  |archivedate=11 November 2007[/tpl] Delays continued unabated and in September 2008, Biman's Dhaka–London direct flight utilising a DC-10 aircraft was diverted and landed at Gatwick when it did not have sufficient fuel to remain in a holding pattern over Heathrow following arrival over three hours after the scheduled time. In a 10 September 2008 article published in The Times, Biman was labelled the worst performer for punctuality at Heathrow, with flights delayed on average by three hours.[tpl]cite news |url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/transport/article4727137.ece |title=Punctuality at Heathrow deteriorates |work=The Times |date=10 September 2008 |accessdate=24 September 2008 | location=London | first=David | last=Robertson[/tpl][tpl]subscription required[/tpl] In 2008, the United Nations advised its staff not to fly with Biman, citing both safety and security concerns and Biman's unreliable flight schedules. It was made clear that UN staff who flew with Biman did so at their own risk, and would be ineligible to make claims on insurance. Biman's then newly appointed managing director said he was unaware of the UN directive, but admitted that Biman did face problems in managing its flight schedules. He expected the situation to improve with the procurement of aircraft in the coming months.
In 2013, Biman signed agreements with SITA[tpl]Cite web|title= SITA SIGNS 10-YEAR AGREEMENT WITH BIMAN BANGLADESH AIRLINES|url= http://www.sita.aero/content/sita-signs-10-year-agreement-with-biman-bangladesh-airlines|work= SITA|date= 2 August 2013 |accessdate= 27 December 2013[/tpl] and Mercator[tpl]Cite web|title= mercator's new and improved RAPID 3.0 to support Biman Bangladesh Airlines' growth |url= http://www.emirates.com/english/about/news/news_detail.aspx?article=1470893&offset=0|work= Emirates Group|date= 5 December 2013 |accessdate= 27 December 2013[/tpl] to provide infrastructure support and revenue accounting services to the airline. Biman will launch services such as meal bookings and online check-in in a bid to modernise its website, and improve services. As of November 2013, 65% to 70% of Biman's flights were on-time.

===Flight classes===

A two-class service (J and Y) is operated on all of Biman's airliners. The Business Class cabin on its Boeing 777 are arranged in a 2–3–2 configuration, while economy class cabin is setup in a 3–3–3 configuration. The narrow-body Boeing 737-800s' Business Class is set up in a 2–2 configuration while Economy Class is in a 3–3 arrangement. The older Airbus A310s have a 2-4-2 configuration in Economy Class; 2-3-2 in Business Class.

===In-flight amenities===

Biman relaunched its inflight magazine re-branded as Bihanga in September 2013. The bi-monthly magazine, previously known as Diganta, and prior to that Jatri, is being published by Indian company Maxposure. The magazine is available in both Bengali and English, covering topics about Bangladesh and Biman's destinations. English and Bengali language newspapers are also available on board in the aircraft.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl]
The newer Boeing 777s are equipped with modern in-flight entertainment. Every seat is fitted with personal touch screen displays provided by Thales. It is loaded with movies, songs and games. It also has high resolution moving maps and live flight information. It is in two languages – English and Bengali.[tpl]cite press release|title= Biman Bangladesh Airlines Takes Giant Leap Forward with the Delivery of its First Ever New B777 Aircraft with the Thales In-Flight Entertainment System|publisher=Thales Group|date= 24 October 2011|url= http://www.thales-ifec.com/pdf/press/11-10-24-biman_bangladesh.pdf|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/6IIwBsR6L|archivedate= 22 July 2013[/tpl]

===Frequent-flyer program===

Biman launched a frequent-flyer program, named Biman Loyalty Club, in November 2013.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.daily-sun.com/details_Biman-launches-frequent-flyer-programme_665_1_10_1_18.html |title=Biman launches frequent flyer programme |work=daily sun |date=5 November 2013 |accessdate=5 November 2013[/tpl] It offers rewards such as tiered benefits, mileage bonuses, extra baggage, lounge access and priority check-in at airports.

===Ticketing===

An agreement was signed with Amadeus in 2007 to upgrade Biman's ticketing system with an e-ticketing solution to comply with IATA rules, which set out a deadline of 31 December 2007 for all member airlines to switch over their ticketing systems. E-ticketing has enabled major airlines to provide online check-in facilities, reducing the need to queue up at check-in counters. However, Biman has not made any attempts to improve customer service through the adoption of e-ticketing, although it has been able to reduce its own costs.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.amadeus.com/hk/x65830.html |title=Amadeus ties up with Biman Bangladesh Airlines for e-ticketing |publisher=Amadeus |date=12 April 2007 |accessdate=20 September 2007[/tpl] In 2005, Biman had briefly stopped using the Amadeus ticketing system when the government suspended the operation of a local Amadeus subsidiary following a court order, after allegations of money laundering.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/2005/12/18/d51218050747.htm |title=Biman asks travel agents not to use Amadeus system for ticket booking |work=The Daily Star |date=17 December 2005 |accessdate=16 September 2007[/tpl] The suspension, however, lasted only a month, and was lifted after the writ was appealed in the High Court.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/2006/01/24/d60124011410.htm |title=Biman resumes ticketing thru' Amadeus |work=The Daily Star |date=24 January 2006 |accessdate=20 September 2007[/tpl]
In 2013, Biman signed an agreement with German e-ticketing company Hahn Air, enabling Biman's tickets to be purchased from anywhere around the world.

===Biman Cargo===

Biman also operates a cargo service using the cargo holds of its passenger aircraft to ship freight to international destinations.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.biman-airlines.com/services/cargo |title=Biman Cargo |publisher=Biman Bangladesh Airlines |accessdate=28 September 2013[/tpl] It has established Cargo Village at Shahjalal International Airport where the cargo is packaged and labelled before being loaded onto its aircraft.[tpl]cite news |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=31973 |title=Govt mulls private management for ZIA's cargo village |author=Porimol Palma |work=The Daily Star |date=13 April 2008 |accessdate=28 September 2013[/tpl]
While the air cargo industry in Bangladesh grew by 16.5% in the fiscal year 2003–04, Biman's cargo operations remained stagnant when private operators such as Bismillah Airlines, Best Aviation and Air Bangladesh produced a 108% growth from the previous year. The private operators increased their share of the cargo market by 10.6% and were responsible for handling 24% of the total 99,000 tonnes of cargo at the expense of both Biman and foreign airlines which saw a reduction in their shares by 4.6% and 6.0% respectively. Foreign airlines handled 47% of the total cargo with Biman taking on the remaining 29%.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/2004/09/13/d40913050155.htm |title=Private cargo operators fly high |work=The Daily Star |date=13 September 2004 |accessdate=19 September 2007[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=August 2013[/tpl]
As with its passenger service and management, corruption has also been rife at Biman Cargo. An investigation in 2004 uncovered irregularities in a number of Biman's Middle East operations which deprived the government of millions of dollars in revenue. Biman officials in Dubai were found to have been "extending special privileges" to the main freight handler in exchange for bribes. The smuggling of foreign currency and gold bars is reported to have taken place at the Biman Cargo Village by Biman and CAAB employees. A number of arrests were made but the perpetrators evaded punishment through lack of evidence and pressure from the CAAB union.[tpl]Cite news|url= http://nation.ittefaq.com/artman/exec/view.cgi/26/15478 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071114195652/http://nation.ittefaq.com/artman/exec/view.cgi/26/15478 |archivedate=14 November 2007 |title=Syndicates use ZIA as transit for smuggling |work=The New Nation |date=14 January 2005 |accessdate=20 September 2007[/tpl]

==Destinations==

[tpl]As of|2014|4[/tpl], Biman serves 22 cities in 16 countries.[tpl]cite web|title= Destination Map|publisher= Biman Bangladesh Airlines|url= http://www.biman-airlines.com/flights/map|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20140401001034/http://www.biman-airlines.com/flights/map|archivedate= 1 April 2014 [/tpl][tpl]cite web|title= Flight Schedule|url= http://www.biman-airlines.com/bookings/flight_schedule.aspx|publisher= Biman Bangladesh Airlines|accessdate= 3 December 2013[/tpl] However, the carrier has air service agreements with 43 countries leaving room for expansion for which it lacks aircraft.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/2007/05/20/d7052001022.htm |title=Steps to make Biman PLC by June approved |work=The Daily Star |date=20 May 2007 |accessdate=22 May 2007[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=August 2013[/tpl] The airline operates flights to several destinations in the Middle East, some destinations in South and South East Asia; London, Rome and Frankfurt in Europe.

===New York and Manchester===

From 1993 to 2006, Biman operated flights to John F. Kennedy International Airport, New York City, from Dhaka via Brussels.[tpl]cite news |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/2006/07/29/d60729012414.htm |title=Biman makes its last flight to NY today |work=The Daily Star|date=29 July 2006|accessdate=28 September 2013[/tpl] New York was Biman's farthest and most prestigious destination, and was kept operational despite heavy financial losses to maintain a landing slot in the US which, if cancelled, could be difficult to regain.[tpl]cite news |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/2006/03/05/d6030501044.htm|title=Biman to reroute NY flight to halve loss|work=The Daily Star|date=5 March 2006|accessdate=28 September 2013[/tpl] To curb the losses, Biman reduced the service to one flight per week and re-routed it through Manchester Airport, UK, capitalising on travel demands from the expatriate Bangladeshi community in the north of England. On 8 April 2006, Biman's inaugural flight to Manchester landed at Manchester Airport en route to JFK.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.ringwayreports.co.uk/apr06fp.htm|title=Manchester Airport Reports and Images|publisher=Ringway Reports|date=April 2006|accessdate=25 May 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070930165402/http://www.ringwayreports.co.uk/apr06fp.htm  |archivedate = 30 September 2007[/tpl] However, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had placed the CAAB into Category 2 (does not meet International Civil Aviation Organization standards) according to its International Aviation Safety Assessment Program,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/iasa/ |title=International Aviation Safety Assessment Program |publisher=FAA |accessdate=25 May 2007[/tpl] which placed additional restrictions on the country's airlines when flying to the US. A former CAAB assistant director made scathing remarks about the CAAB in an opinion article in the Aviatour, a monthly travel and tourism supplement of Bangladeshi news magazine Weekly Holiday.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.weeklyholiday.net/260903/avi.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070903053626/http://www.weeklyholiday.net/260903/avi.html |archivedate=3 September 2007 |title=What is happening to flight safety? |work=Weekly Holiday |date=26 September 2003 | accessdate=25 May 2007[/tpl] For Biman, this meant that it could continue flying to the US, but could not expand or make alterations to its routes, such as changing the transit from Brussels to Manchester. The FAA fined Biman for breaching its rules, and flights to New York were again re-routed through Brussels.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.newagebd.com/2006/may/04/busi.html|title=Biman to suspend NY flights in June|work=New Age|date=4 May 2006|accessdate=25 May 2007|archiveurl=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20070930184913/http://www.newagebd.com/2006/may/04/busi.html|archivedate=30 September 2007[/tpl]
The FAA had already warned Biman to replace its ageing DC-10s by December 2005. According to experts, these aircraft were inadequately equipped to safely cross the Atlantic.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.newagebd.com/2006/jul/27/front.html|title=Biman not to continue flight to New York|work=New Age|date=27 July 2006|accessdate=25 May 2007|archiveurl=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20100918224058/http://www.newagebd.com/2006/jul/27/front.html|archivedate=18 September 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.thebangladeshtoday.com/archive/May%2706/17-05-2006.htm |title=Biman in a ferrango|work=The Bangladesh Today|date=17 May 2006|accessdate=25 May 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061119185647/http://www.thebangladeshtoday.com/archive/May%2706/17-05-2006.htm |archivedate = 19 November 2006[/tpl] On 13 May 2006, the FAA refused permission for Biman flight BG001 (Dhaka–Brussels–JFK) to enter its airspace, citing safety concerns over the ailing DC–10 aircraft used on the route. The flight was diverted to Montréal-Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport in Canada, where the passengers were provided with alternative airline options to complete their journey.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/2006/05/16/d6051601033.htm|title=CAAB warned of poor aircraft maintenance|work=The Daily Star|date=16 May 2006|accessdate=28 September 2013[/tpl] Canadian authorities inspected the aircraft and gave it a clean bill of health after which the aircraft returned to Dhaka without any passengers. The FAA eventually admitted it was mistaken and apologised for the error.
The incident put an end to the route,[tpl]cite news|title= SPECIAL : Biman NY flights: no smooth take-off yet|publisher= bdnews24.com|date= 4 November 2009|url= http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2009/11/04/special-biman-ny-flights-no-smooth-take-off-yet|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/6IF5rRRk0|archivedate= 19 July 2013[/tpl] which had been losing [tpl]US$|80000[/tpl] per flight, owing to its use of obsolete DC-10s. Biman decided to axe the route along with a number of other regional and domestic routes to curb the huge losses being incurred by the airline each month.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.newagebd.com/2006/jul/30/front.html|title=Saturday saw the last DC 10 Dhaka–New York flight|work=New Age|date=30 July 2006|accessdate=25 May 2007|archiveurl=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20100918080233/http://www.newagebd.com/2006/jul/30/front.html|archivedate=18 September 2010[/tpl] However, in October 2007, Biman was directed by the then caretaker government to resume flights to New York. Biman was given until 25 October 2008 (extended from an earlier deadline of 23 March 2008) to resume flights to the airport by the JFK airport authority, after which it would have lost the landing slot permanently.

===Hajj flights===

The annual Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca for the Hajj is undertaken by thousands of Bangladesh's predominantly Muslim population. Biman has been the sole Bangladeshi airline permitted by the government to provide flights for pilgrims to King Abdulaziz International Airport, Jeddah. Every year, the commencement of these flights is inaugurated by high-ranking government officials, including, at times, the Prime Minister.[tpl]cite news |url=http://nation.ittefaq.com/artman/exec/view.cgi/38/23763 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070927175928/http://nation.ittefaq.com/artman/exec/view.cgi/38/23763 |archivedate=27 September 2007 |title=Khaleda opens Hajj flights |work=The New Nation |date=11 December 2005 |accessdate=30 August 2007[/tpl]
In 2002, the government opened the service to private tour operators for the first time. The initial private flights were plagued with delays, with both outgoing and return flights postponed for as long as nine days, which caused the Bangladesh government to return the Hajj flights' monopoly to Biman.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]
Biman's handling of Hajj flights has also been beset with troubles. In 2005, the State Minister for Civil Aviation and Tourism resigned after complaints that he set fares too high.[tpl]cite news |url=http://nation.ittefaq.com/artman/exec/view.cgi/36/23236 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070927175320/http://nation.ittefaq.com/artman/exec/view.cgi/36/23236 |archivedate=27 September 2007 |title=Mir Nasir resigns |work=The New Nation |date=17 November 2005 |accessdate=30 August 2007[/tpl] In 2006, Biman took the unprecedented step of removing the business–class seats from its dedicated Hajj flights to accommodate more economy-class passengers.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.newagebd.com/2006/nov/13/nat.html |title=Biman prepares for smooth hajj flights |work=New Age |date=13 November 2006 |accessdate=30 August 2007|archiveurl=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20110101000605/http://www.newagebd.com/2006/nov/13/nat.html|archivedate=1 January 2011[/tpl] Procedural irregularities by the Hajj agencies delayed the confirmation of pilgrims' visas, and Biman had to cancel 19 flights owing to lack of sufficient passengers. Once the situation was resolved, Biman was then unable to offer the required number of flights to cope with the backlog of passengers.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.newagebd.com/2006/dec/11/nat.html |title=Foreign airlines won't offer extra flights for Hajj pilgrims |work=New Age |date=11 December 2006 |accessdate=30 August 2007|archiveurl=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20081015154038/http://www.newagebd.com/2006/dec/11/nat.html|archivedate=15 October 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.bangladeshnews.com.bd/2006/12/16/hajj-still-uncertain-for-thousands-of-pilgrims/ |title=Hajj still uncertain for thousands of pilgrims |publisher=BangladeshNews.com.bd |date=16 December 2006 |accessdate=30 August 2007[/tpl]
In June 2007, the caretaker government approved a three-year Hajj policy aiming to alleviate the problems encountered during the previous two years. Hajj flights would also begin leaving from Bangladesh's two other international airports, Shah Amanat International Airport and Osmani International Airport. Biman put out a tender for the wet lease of two aircraft for additional Hajj flights and reached an agreement with Phuket Air. However, the deal fell through in August 2007 after Phuket Air demanded advance payment of 30% instead of the previously agreed-to 10%. Ausban Aeronautical Services of Australia was selected next, following a re-tender, to fill the gap left by Phuket Air.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/story.php?nid=1649 |title=Australian pvt airline chosen for hajj trips |work=The Daily Star |date=27 August 2007 |accessdate=30 August 2007 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070927192907/http://www.thedailystar.net/story.php?nid=1649  |archivedate=27 September 2007[/tpl] In 2008, Biman wet-leased a 542-seater Boeing 747-200 from Kabo Air of Nigeria for six months to operate flights to Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Another 512-seater Boeing 747-300 was leased from Orient Thai Airlines.
[tpl]As of|2012|8[/tpl], Biman still experienced difficulties in providing their scheduled services, as the carrier gave priority to the transportation of pilgrims to Jeddah during the Hajj season using aircraft that otherwise were flown on its regular flights.[tpl]cite news|title=Biman set to fly into schedule chaos|url=http://bdnews24.com/business/2012/08/31/biman-set-to-fly-into-schedule-chaos|newspaper=bdnews24.com|date=31 August 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6IG3XgeVk|archivedate=20 July 2013[/tpl] Despite this, the airline reported a profit of almost BDT 1 billion from the 2012 Hajj season, the highest results ever since these services were started in 1973.

==Fleet==

A vintage Douglas Dakota and Douglas DC-3 were the first aircraft in Biman's fleet. Domestic operations commenced with the acquisition of four Fokker F27 aircraft flying passengers to Chittagong and Sylhet from its base in Dhaka. Shortly afterwards, a Boeing 707, chartered from British Caledonian, joined the airline's fleet, allowing Biman to begin international flights. In 1983, Biman purchased three McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 aircraft from Singapore Airlines to provide services on its long haul routes. The British Aerospace ATP entered the fleet in late 1990, coming to replace the Fokker F27s.
During the mid-1990s, Biman switched its airliner of choice for long haul routes to the Airbus series of aircraft. Two new Airbus A310s joined Biman's fleet in 1996 followed by one more in 2000. It nevertheless retained its elderly DC–10 fleet, even though the aircraft had been banned by several countries (notably the USA) because of safety concerns.
For over three decades, the DC–10–30s were Biman's sole widebody aircraft and served the airline consistently well, with no noteworthy mechanical problems – in marked contrast to the record of its domestic operations. These were operated with Fokker F28 and BAe ATPs which were routinely out of service because of technical trouble. In one incident, a government minister disembarked a flight and travelled by road when he learned that the aircraft he was on was a BAe ATP. In January 2003, Biman leased two Boeing 737-300s which were used on domestic and regional routes for eighteen months. These acted as a replacement for the BAe ATPs.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]
McDonnell Douglas DC-10s and Airbus A310-300s made up most of Biman's international fleet, before the delivery of the modern Boeing 777-300ERs started in 2011. Fokker F28s made up the remainder of the fleet for the domestic and regional sectors, before they were retired in 2012.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.airframes.org/fleet/bbc |title=Aircraft Registration History |publisher=AirFrames.org |accessdate=29 May 2007[/tpl] Biman's fleet contains the second-to-last Douglas DC–10 to come off the production line (l/n 445), and only three other Airbus A310–300s were produced following Biman's purchase of two new Airbus A310s in 1996.[tpl]Cite news|title= Biman's obsolete planes|first= Erfan|last= Chowdhury|work= The Daily Star|date= 2 November 2005|url= http://www.thedailystar.net/2005/11/02/d51102110182.htm|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/696Le0Ucm|archivedate= 12 July 2012|accessdate= 12 July 2012[/tpl] The two Fokker F28–4000s were acquired from PBair in 2004 at a cost of $2.91 million.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.thai-aviation.net/Operators+09.htm  |title=Air Operators in Thailand |accessdate=29 May 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080313105932/http://www.thai-aviation.net/Operators+09.htm |archivedate = 13 March 2008[/tpl] Both of these aircraft were built in 1977, making Biman's latest acquisitions the oldest aircraft in its fleet.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.weeklyholiday.net/270204/aviatour.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070403013310/http://www.weeklyholiday.net/270204/aviatour.html |archivedate=3 April 2007 |title=Biman set to purchase two old F–28s |date=27 February 2004 |accessdate=29 May 2007[/tpl] The ageing fleet made it difficult for Biman to maintain its flight schedule, as the aircraft suffered from mechanical problems, leading to flight delays and cancellations.[tpl]cite news |url=http://nation.ittefaq.com/artman/publish/article_37383.shtml |title=Biman's 3 flights delayed for 40 hours: Passengers stranded at Shahjalal International without food, shelter |work=The New Nation |date=7 July 2007 |accessdate=30 August 2007[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=July 2012[/tpl] A number of aircraft remained grounded owing to lack of spare parts as they are no longer manufactured and used parts are difficult to source.

===Modernisation===

====2000s====

In 2000, Biman put out a request for proposal for the acquisition of four wide-bodied aircraft to replace the DC–10s, but both the fleet renewal plans and the airline's expected privatisation were shelved by the government.[tpl]Cite news|title= Biman seeks aircraft proposals |work=Flight International|date= 18 July 2000|url= http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2000/07/18/67929/biman-seeks-aircraft-proposals.html|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/696KzfZ1T|archivedate= 12 July 2012|accessdate= 12 July 2012[/tpl] A further attempt was made in 2005 to acquire new aircraft and plans were submitted for the purchase of ten new wide-bodied Airbus and Boeing aircraft at a total cost of $1 billion.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.theindependent-bd.com/details.php?nid=35886 |title=Bangladesh Biman plans fleet renewal  |work=The Independent (Bangladesh) |date=29 May 2005 |accessdate=29 May 2007|archiveurl=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20080115185120/http://www.theindependent-bd.com/details.php?nid=35886|archivedate=15 January 2008[/tpl] Boeing arranged to finance the purchase provided a guarantee was given by the Bangladesh government. After bureaucratic delays and a perceived lack of commitment from the government, Boeing lost interest and the plans were cancelled. A similar attempt to purchase medium-haul aircraft for domestic service was also postponed. In [tpl]Start date|df=yes|2007|3[/tpl], Biman put out a tender for the dry lease of two Airbus A310-300 and two Airbus A300-600 aircraft for two years.[tpl]Cite web|title= Dry Lease of two A310-300 and two A300-600 Aircraft|publisher= Central Procurement Technical Unit|date= 21 March 2007|url=http://www.cptu.gov.bd/ShowDetailTender.aspx?ADId=4568|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/6IFtOMauT|archivedate= 20 July 2013[/tpl] The sole response to the tender came from Star Aviation of the United Arab Emirates (UAE).[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/daily_detail.asp?id=55288 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070927213130/http://www.thenews.com.pk/daily_detail.asp?id=55288 |archivedate=27 September 2007 |title=UAE firm lone bidder in Biman tender |work=The News |date=11 May 2007 |accessdate=14 May 2007[/tpl]
After Biman became a public limited company, renewed attempts were made to procure new-generation aircraft to replace its ageing fleet. In November 2007, Boeing made an offer to supply Biman with four Boeing 777-200s (with options for two more) to be delivered by 2013 and four Boeing 787-8 Dreamliners (with options for two more) to be delivered by 2017 and provide similar aircraft on lease for the interim period beginning in 2009. The average price of these aircraft was quoted as [tpl]US$|165[/tpl] million. Airbus also made an offer to supply four Airbus A320 or Airbus A330 series aircraft at a much lower price than that of Boeing. To manage the fleet in the short run, Biman again floated a tender in January 2008 to purchase/dry lease with options to purchase two used Airbus A310-300 aircraft.[tpl]cite news |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=27162 |title=Biman to buy 8 aircraft |work=The Daily Star |date=11 March 2008 |accessdate=28 September 2013[/tpl]
On 10 March 2008, the Biman management unveiled a plan to procure eight next-generation wide-bodied aircraft from Boeing Commercial Airplanes for a total cost of [tpl]US$|1.26[/tpl] billion, including four 419-seater Boeing 777-300ER (average price of [tpl]US$|182.9[/tpl] million per unit), and four Boeing 787-8 Dreamliners that will seat 294 ([tpl]US$|133.31[/tpl] million per unit), to be delivered in 2017. The deal for the acquisition of these eight aircraft was signed with Boeing in April 2008, and also included a memorandum of understanding for the purchase of two Boeing 737-800s to be delivered in 2015,[tpl]cite news |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=43058 |title=Biman seals deal with Boeing for 10 planes |work=The Daily Star |date=27 June 2008 |accessdate=28 September 2013[/tpl] with Biman making an initial instalment of [tpl]US$|1.54[/tpl] million. Of the remaining cost, US-based EXIM bank will finance 85%, while a syndication of local banks will finance the balance. In [tpl]MONTHNAME|6[/tpl] the same year, Biman placed a firm order for two Boeing 737-800s, and took options for two more aircraft of the type. The total order for these ten aircraft was valued at around [tpl]US$|2.5[/tpl] billion.

====2010s====

In 2010, Biman leased two Boeing 777-200ERs from EuroAtlantic Airways. These aircraft were used mainly on routes to European destinations to cover the interim period before the delivery of the first two new Boeing 777-300ERs in 2011. To secure the delivery of these two brand new 777-300ERs the airline used an initial [tpl]US$|277[/tpl] million loan granted from JPMorgan Chase.[tpl]Cite news|url= http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/biman-inks-277m-loan-with-jp-morgan-for-new-aircraft-360607/|title= Biman inks $277m loan with JP Morgan for new aircraft|publisher= Flightglobal|date= 11 August 2011|accessdate= 26 October 2011[/tpl][tpl]subscription required[/tpl] Wearing a new livery, the carrier took delivery of its first Boeing 777-300ER in late October 2011. It was the [tpl]ordinal|300[/tpl] 777-300ER delivered by Boeing. The [tpl]ordinal|301[/tpl] ever delivered Boeing 777-300ER also went to Biman; the airline took possession of it in late [tpl]Start date|df=yes|2011|11[/tpl]. The [tpl]ordinal to word|3[/tpl] and [tpl]ordinal to word|4[/tpl] aircraft of the type the carrier has on order are expected to be phased in by [tpl]MONTHNAME|3[/tpl] and [tpl]start date|df=yes|2014|4[/tpl], following the government approving a [tpl]US$|356[/tpl] million loan, of which [tpl]US$|290[/tpl] million will be provided by the Ex-Im Bank and the rest by the Standard Chartered Bank. The [tpl]ordinal to word|3[/tpl] Boeing 777-300ER, named ″Akashprodip″, was handed over to the carrier in [tpl]start date|df=yes|2014|2[/tpl].

===Livery===

In modern Bengali, the word বিমান biman refers to "aeroplane", originating from the Sanskrit word vimāna, a name given to a flying machine mentioned in ancient Vedic literature. The logo, painted on the tail, is a stylised white stork (বলাকা bôlaka) inside a red circle. The logo was designed by painter Quamrul Hassan.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/beta2/news/quamrul-hassans-92nd-birth-anniversary/ |title=Quamrul Hassan's 92nd birth anniversary |work=The Daily Star|date=3 December 2013 |accessdate=3 December 2013[/tpl] The initial livery was a dark blue line extending across the aircraft along the windows and covering the tail section. This was replaced in the 1980s by dark green and red lines, matching the colours of the Bangladesh flag, and has remained so for over two decades.
In 2010, Biman went through a rebranding exercise and unveiled a new logo and livery, designed by Teague, which was applied to its leased Boeing 777 and 737 aircraft.[tpl]cite web|title= Biman Bangladesh :: Trashes Biman's Boeing Livery |publisher= Aviation Branding Weblog |url= http://iloapp.liladesign.com/blog/aviationbrandingweblog?Home&post=47 |date= 8 April 2010|accessdate= 8 February 2014[/tpl] However, following change of government, Biman was forced to revert to the original branding as the new brand image was not endorsed by the incoming government. The carrier has adopted a new, more modern revised version of its livery, that was applied to the new Boeing 777-300ERs delivered in late 2011.
The bôlaka has also given its name to the Biman headquarters, the Balaka Bhaban (বলাকা ভবন bôlaka bhôban, Stork Building), and a landmark sculpture in Dhaka depicting storks is in front of Biman's former headquarters,[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.newagebd.com/2006/sep/10/met.html |title=A unique junkyard sculpture |work=The New Age|date=10 September 2006 |accessdate=9 September 2007|archiveurl=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20080629083909/http://www.newagebd.com/2006/sep/10/met.html|archivedate=29 June 2008[/tpl] the Biman Bhaban in the Motijheel Commercial Area in Dhaka.
