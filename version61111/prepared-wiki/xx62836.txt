[[Camaragibe]]

CATEGORIES: Populated places in Pernambuco

Camaragibe (population 143.210) is a city in northeastern Brazil, in the State of Pernambuco. It lies near Recife at 8.00° South, 35.04° West.
Currently, Camaragibe is run by Jorge Alexandre (from the political party PSDB, the Party of Brazilian Social Democracy) and Reginaldo Albuquerque (The Vice-mayor).
The lands now belonging to the city were used as a reserve of wood, and then for sugar planting. It was populated by natives, until the arrival of Portuguese with Duarte Coelho Pereira, around 1500. After the Portuguese arrival, however, the natives where not completely driven from the area. Instead, they lived "peacefully" with the invaders. 
In the 16th century the city (then just an engenho) was considered one of richest in the region until the Dutch invasion in 1645. At that time, the farm was burned to the ground by the natives.
In 13 May 1982, Camaragibe, which was then part of the bigger city São Lourenço da Mata, was elevated to the category of city.
The small city is considered among the most densely populated urban areas in the world because of the very accelerated growth that the city experienced from the emancipation until now.
