Disney Channel's 3 Minute Game Show is a three-minute game show series on Disney Channel where three contestants have three minutes to answer trivia questions to win the trophy. The show started in 2007 for High School Musical 2 with Monique Coleman hosting. The most recent host was Alyson Stoner in the Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam version of it on October 20, 2010.  It is created and directed by Art Spigel and produced by Jason Wolk.

==First round==

All three contestants are asked three multiple-choice questions mostly pre-taped by co-stars of the show or movie. The contestants then lock in A, B, or C. Each correct answer is worth one point. The two contestants with the highest scores move on to the Super Speed Round. If there is a three-way tie for first place or a two-way tie for second place, all three contestants move on (similar to the MTV game show Remote Control).

==Super Speed Round==

In the Super Speed Round, the contestants are asked more questions, except that the players have to buzz in to answer the question. Each correct answer is again worth one point. The player with the most points when time runs out, usually after three questions, is the winner.

===Variations===

There are multiple variations of the Speed Round.

====Finish That Line====

Players finish the line of a well-known song or movie line.

====Finish That Spell====

A variation of Finish That Line played in the Wizards of Waverly Place: The Movie edition where the players have to guess the ending of a popular spell.

====Who Says It?====

A quote is read and the players have to guess which character said it.

====It's All Relative!====

A character is given and the players have to guess how they are related to the main character.

====Place to Place====

The players have to answer what place it is from The Suite Life On Deck.

==Hosts==

There has been a different host for each edition.  The only exception being David Henrie as he hosted The Cheetah Girls: One World and Wizards of Waverly Place: The Movie back to back.  

==60 Second Game Show==

Disney Channel's 3 Minute Game Show has recently been replaced by Disney's 60 Second Game Show in 2011. The first episode was on Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension, which was hosted by Alyson Stoner.
