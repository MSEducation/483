==Background==

In December 1980, the Co-Princes agreed on reforms, including the establishment of an Executive Council and the holding of a referendum on the voting system. Voters were offered the options of a majority system, a proportional system (in which the parishes would serve as constituencies), or a mixed system, with candidates elected using the majority system at the national level and the proportional system in the parishes.
