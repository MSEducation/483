Isaac McKim (July 21, 1775 â€“ April 1, 1838) was a U.S. Representative from Maryland, nephew of Alexander McKim.
Born in Baltimore, Maryland, McKim attended the public schools, and later engaged in mercantile pursuits.  He served in the War of 1812 as aide-de-camp to General Samuel Smith.  After the war, McKim served as member of the Maryland Senate from December 4, 1821, until January 8, 1823, when he resigned.
McKim was elected as a Democrat to the Seventeenth Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Samuel Smith.  On the same day, McKim was elected as a Jackson Republican to the Eighteenth Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Representative-elect Smith and served from January 4, 1823, to March 3, 1825.  After Congress, McKim served as director of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Co. from 1827 until 1831.
McKim returned to Congress, elected as a Jacksonian to the Twenty-third and Twenty-fourth Congresses and reelected as a Democrat to the Twenty-fifth Congress.  He served from March 4, 1833, until his death in Baltimore, Maryland, on April 1, 1838.  He was interred in the burying ground of St. Paul's Church.
