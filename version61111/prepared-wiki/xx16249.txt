==Cosmology==

Cosmology is the study of the cosmos in several of the above meanings, depending on context. All cosmologies have in common an attempt to understand the implicit order within the whole of being. In this way, most religions and philosophical systems have a cosmology.
In physical cosmology, the term cosmos is often used in a technical way, referring to a particular spacetime continuum within the (postulated) multiverse. Our particular cosmos, the observable universe, is generally capitalized as the Cosmos.

==Theology==

In theology, the term can be used to denote the created Universe, not including the creator. In Christian theology, the word is also used synonymously with  aion[tpl]cite web|title=Concerning Aion and Aionios|url=http://www.saviourofall.org/Writings/aion.html|publisher=Saviour of All Fellowship|accessdate=22 April 2014[/tpl]  to refer to "worldly life" or "this world" as opposed to the afterlife or World to Come.
The cosmos as originated by Pythagoras is parallel to the Zoroastrian term aša, the concept of a divine order, or divinely ordered creation.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl]
