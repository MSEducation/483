In this passage Isaiah applies to a king of Babylon the image of the morning star fallen from the sky, an image he is generally believed to have borrowed from a legend in Canaanite mythology.See #Mythology behind Isaiah 14:12 below.

Christian writers explained the motives of the angel's rebellion and the nature of his sin in the same way, but added pride against God, which they mention more frequently than envy or jealousy with regard to humanity.
Christian tradition, influenced by the Jewish presentation of the passage of Isaiah as applicable to Satan, came to use the Latin word for "morning star", lucifer, as a proper name ("Lucifer") for Satan as Satan was before his fall.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/350594/Lucifer | title=Lucifer | publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica | accessdate=2013-09-06[/tpl] As a result, "Lucifer has become a by-word for Satan in the Church and in popular literature", as in Dante Alighieri's Inferno and John Milton's Paradise Lost.
However, the Latin word lucifer kept its original positive sense for early Christians, as is evident from its use as a personal name by, among others, two 4th-century bishops, Lucifer of Cagliari and Lucifer of Siena, and its appearance in the Easter Proclamation as a description of Jesus.

==Lucifer or morning star==

Translation of הֵילֵל as "Lucifer", as in the King James Version, has been abandoned in modern English translations of Isaiah 14:12. Present-day translations have "morning star" (New International Version, New Century Version, New American Standard Bible, Good News Translation, Holman Christian Standard Bible, Contemporary English Version, Common English Bible, Complete Jewish Bible), "daystar" (New Jerusalem Bible, English Standard Version, The Message), "shining one" (New Life Version, New World Translation, JPS Tanakh) or "shining star" (New Living Translation).
The term appears in the context of an oracle against a dead king of Babylon, who is addressed as הילל בן שחר (hêlêl ben šāḥar),[tpl]cite web|url=http://interlinearbible.org/isaiah/14-12.htm |title=Isaiah 14 Biblos Interlinear Bible |publisher=Interlinearbible.org |accessdate=2012-12-22[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://wlc.hebrewtanakh.com/isaiah/14.htm |title=Isaiah 14 Hebrew OT: Westminster Leningrad Codex |publisher=Wlc.hebrewtanakh.com |accessdate=2012-12-22[/tpl] rendered by the King James Version as "O Lucifer, son of the morning!" and by others as "morning star, son of the dawn".
In a modern translation from the original Hebrew, the passage in which the phrase "Lucifer" or "morning star" occurs begins with the statement: "On the day the Lord gives you relief from your suffering and turmoil and from the harsh labour forced on you, you will take up this taunt against the king of Babylon: How the oppressor has come to an end! How his fury has ended!"[tpl]bibleverse||Isaiah|14:3–4|NIV[/tpl] After describing the death of the king, the taunt continues:
J. Carl Laney has pointed out that in the final verses here quoted, the king of Babylon is described not as a god or an angel but as a man.[tpl]bibleverse||Isaiah|14:16|NIV[/tpl]

==Mythology behind Isaiah 14:12==

In ancient Canaanite mythology, the morning star is pictured as a god, Attar, who attempted to occupy the throne of Ba'al and, finding he was unable to do so, descended and ruled the underworld.John Day, Yahweh and the gods and goddesses of Canaan (Continuum International Publishing Group, 2002. ISBN 0-82646830-6. ISBN 978-0-8264-6830-7), pp. 172–173Gregory A. Boyd, God at War: The Bible & Spiritual Conflict (InterVarsity Press, 1997 ISBN 0-8308-1885-5. ISBN 978-0-8308-1885-3), pp. 159–160 The original myth may have been about a lesser god Helel trying to dethrone the Canaanite high god El who lived on a mountain to the north.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ns4UAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Pope+%22El+in+the+Ugaritic+texts%22 |title=Marvin H. Pope, El in the Ugaritic Texts |publisher=|accessdate=2012-12-22[/tpl] Hermann Gunkel's reconstruction of the myth told of a mighty warrior called Hêlal, whose ambition it was to ascend higher than all the other stellar divinities, but who had to descend to the depths; it thus portrayed as a battle the process by which the bright morning star fails to reach the highest point in the sky before being faded out by the rising sun.
Similarities have been noted with the East Semitic story of Ishtar's or Inanna's descent into the underworld,[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=cLN08jf_C2EC&pg=PA314&dq=%22several+attempts+to+find+mythical+allusions%22 |author=Gary V.

The Eerdmans Commentary on the Bible points out that no evidence has been found of any Canaanite myth of a god being thrown from heaven, as in Isaiah 14:12. It concludes that the closest parallels with Isaiah's description of the king of Babylon as a fallen morning star cast down from heaven are to be found not in any lost Canaanite and other myths but in traditional ideas of the Jewish people themselves, echoed in the Biblical account of the fall of Adam and Eve, cast out of God's presence for wishing to be as God, and the picture in [tpl]bibleverse||Psalm|82|NIV[/tpl] of the "gods" and "sons of the Most High" destined to die and fall.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2Vo-11umIZQC&pg=PA511&dq=%22any+Canaanite+myth%22 |author=James D.

==Latin word lucifer==

As an adjective, the Latin word lucifer meant "light-bringing" and was applied to the moon. As a noun, it meant "morning star", or, in Roman mythology, its divine personification as "the fabled son of Aurora[tpl]cite book | editor1-first=Christoph | editor1-last=Auffarth | editor2-first=Loren T. | editor2-last=Stuckenbruck | title=The Fall of the Angels | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=lhNyGFkT3QYC&printsec=frontcover | year=2004 | publisher=BRILL | location=Leiden | page=62  | id=ISBN 978-9-00412668-8| isbn= 9-00412668-6[/tpl] and Cephalus, and father of Ceyx", or (in poetry) "day".
The second of the meanings attached to the word when used as a noun corresponds to the image in Greek mythology of Eos, the goddess of dawn, giving birth to the morning star Phosphorus.
[tpl]bibleverse||Isaiah|14:12[/tpl] is not the only place where the Vulgate uses the word lucifer. The Vulgate uses the same word in contexts where it clearly has no reference to a fallen angel: [tpl]bibleverse|2|Peter|1:19[/tpl] (meaning "morning star"), [tpl]Bibleverse||Job|11:17[/tpl] ("the light of the morning"), [tpl]bibleverse||Job|38:32[/tpl] ("the signs of the zodiac") and [tpl]bibleverse||Psalms|110:3[/tpl] ("the dawn").Anthony Maas, "Lucifer" in Catholic Encyclopedia (New York 1910) To speak of the morning star, lucifer is not the only expression that the Vulgate uses: three times it uses stella matutina: [tpl]Bibleverse||Sirach|50:6[/tpl] (referring to the actual morning star), and [tpl]bibleverse||Revelation|2:28[/tpl] (of uncertain reference) and [tpl]bibleverse-nb||Revelation|22:16[/tpl] (referring to Jesus).
Other indications that in Christian tradition the Latin word lucifer did not carry connotations of a fallen angel are the names of Bishops Lucifer of Cagliari and Lucifer of Siena, and its use in the Easter Proclamation prayer to God regarding the paschal candle: Flammas eius lucifer matutinus inveniat: ille, inquam, lucifer, qui nescit occasum. Christus Filius tuus, qui, regressus ab inferis, humano generi serenus illuxit, et vivit et regnat in saecula saeculorum (May this flame be found still burning by the Morning Star: the one Morning Star who never sets, Christ your Son, who, coming back from death's domain, has shed his peaceful light on humanity, and lives and reigns for ever and ever). In the works of Latin grammarians, Lucifer, like Daniel, was discussed as an example of a personal name.Mark Amsler, Etymology and Grammatical Discourse in Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages (John Benjamins 1989 ISBN 978-9-02724527-4), p. 66

==Christianity==

Early Christians were influenced by the association of Isaiah 14:12-18 with the Devil, which had developed in the period between the writing of the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament,[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7R0IGTSvIVIC&pg=PA199&dq=Origen+name+Lucifer |author=David L.

Some time later, the metaphor of the morning star that Isaiah 14:12 applied to a king of Babylon gave rise to the general use of the Latin word for "morning star", capitalized, as the original name of the Devil before his fall from grace, linking Isaiah 14:12 with [tpl]bibleverse||Luke|10:18|NIV[/tpl] ("I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven") and interpreting the passage in Isaiah as an allegory of Satan's fall from heaven.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IrcZEZ1bOJsC&pg=PA280&lpg=PA280&dq=name+Lucifer+was+born+-magazine&source=bl&ots=7Qwvlc4AZr&sig=UbOS0ltHHmWrzrd36c6z8VSXmus&hl=en&sa=X&ei=z6oRUJ3cEdKZhQfTw4HgDw&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=name%20Lucifer%20was%20born%20-magazine&f=false |title=The Merriam-Webster New Book of Word Histories |ISBN=978-0-87779603-9 |page=280 |publisher=Merriam-Webster |year=1991 |accessdate=2012-12-23[/tpl][tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=X5-pmLBcw44C&pg=PA57&dq=%22the+name+Lucifer+was+given%22 |author=Harold Bloom |title=Satan |publisher=Infobase Publishing |year=2005 |ISBN=978-0-79108386-4 |page=57 |accessdate=2012-12-23[/tpl]
However, the understanding of the morning star in Isaiah 14:12 as a metaphor referring to a king of Babylon continued also to exist among Christians. Theodoret of Cyrus (c. 393 – c. 457) wrote that Isaiah calls the king "morning star", not as being the star, but as having had the illusion of being it.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=y17fkvqXOBcC&pg=PA252&dq=%22Theodoret+of+Cyrus%22%22illusion+of+so+being%22 |author=Johanna Manley |title=Isaiah through the Ages |publisher=St Vladimir's Seminary Press |year=1995 |ISBN=978-0-96225363-8 |page=252 |accessdate=2012-12-23[/tpl] The same understanding is shown in Christian translations of the passage, which in English generally use "morning star" rather than treating the word as a proper name, "Lucifer". So too in other languages, such as French,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=%C3%89sa%C3%AFe+14%3A12-15&version=LSG |title=Ésaïe 14:12-15 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |accessdate=2012-12-23 |language=French[/tpl] German,[tpl]cite web|url=http://bibeltext.com/isaiah/14-12.htm |title=Jesaja 14:12 |publisher=Bibeltext.com |accessdate=2012-12-23 |language=German[/tpl] Portuguese,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isa%C3%ADas+14%3A12-17&version=AA |title=Isaías 14:12-17 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |accessdate=2012-12-23 |language=Portuguese[/tpl] and Spanish.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2014:12&version=LBLA |title=Isaías 14:12 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |accessdate=2012-12-23|language=Spanish[/tpl] Even the Vulgate text in Latin is printed with lower-case lucifer (morning star), not upper-case Lucifer (proper name).

===Christians who identify Lucifer with Satan or the Devil===

Adherents of the King James Only movement and others who hold that Isaiah 14:12 does indeed refer to the devil have decried the modern translations.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=_1Y-9sCXItMC&pg=PA94&dq=%22the+KJV+correctly+translates%22 |title=A Primer on Salvation and Bible Prophecy |author=Larry Alavezos |publisher=TEACH Services |isbn=978-1-57258640-6 |date=2010-09-29 |page=94 |accessdate=2012-12-22[/tpl][tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=vDrfOawsb4UC&pg=PA64&dq=%22say+Lucifer+or+morning+star%22 |author=David W.

Treating "Lucifer" as a name for the devil or Satan, they may use that name when speaking of such accounts of the devil or Satan as the following:

- Satan inciting David to number Israel (1 Chronicles [tpl]Bibleref2-nb|1 Chronicles|21:1[/tpl])

- Job tested by Satan (Book of Job)

- Satan ready to accuse the high priest Joshua (Zechariah [tpl]Bibleref2-nb|Zechariah|3:1-2[/tpl])

- Sin brought into the world through the devil's envy (Wisdom [tpl]Bibleref2-nb|Wisdom|2:24|63[/tpl])

- "The prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience" (Ephesians [tpl]Bibleref2-nb|Ephesians|2:2|ESV[/tpl])

- "The god of this world" (2 Corinthians [tpl]Bibleref2-nb|2 Corinthians|4:4|ESV[/tpl]).

- The devil disputing with Michael about the body of Moses (Jude [tpl]Bibleref2-nb|Jude|1:9|ESV[/tpl])

- The dragon of the Book of Revelation "who is called the devil and Satan" ([tpl]Bibleref2|Revelation|12:9;20:2|ESV[/tpl])
They may also use the name Lucifer when speaking of Satan's motive for rebelling and of the nature of his sin, which Origen, Chrysostom, Jerome, Ambrose, and Augustine attributed to the devil's pride against God, and Irenaeus, Tertullian, Justin Martyr, Cyprian, and again Augustine attributed to the devil's envy of humanity created in the image of God.[tpl]cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vwbtWmJYyIUC&printsec=frontcover | title=The fathers of the church.

==Islam==

In Islam the Devil is known as [tpl]transl|ar|ALA|Iblīs[/tpl] ([tpl]lang-ar|إبليس[/tpl], plural: [tpl]lang|ar|ابالسة[/tpl] [tpl]transl|ar|ALA|abālisah[/tpl]) or [tpl]transl|ar|ALA|Shayṭān[/tpl] ([tpl]lang-ar|شيطان[/tpl], plural: [tpl]lang|ar|شياطين[/tpl] [tpl]transl|ar|ALA|shayāṭīn[/tpl]) and has no name corresponding in meaning to that of the Latin word lucifer. Iblis is banished from heaven for refusing to prostrate himself before Adam. Thus, he sins after the creation of man. He asks God for a respite until the Last Day rather than being consigned to the Fire of Hell immediately. God grants this request, and Iblis then swears revenge by tempting human beings and turning them away from God. God tells him that any humans who follow him will join him in the Fire of Hell at Judgement, but that Iblis will have no power over all mankind except who wants to follow Iblis. This story is cited multiple times in the Holy Qur'an for different reasons. While in Judaism and Christianity, Satan is a fallen angel, Iblis is a jinn. Muslims believe that angels are the servants of God and cannot disobey him, but jinn, like men, can choose to obey or disobey.[tpl]cite book|last=Jung|first=Rabbi Leo|title=Fallen angels in Jewish, Christian, and Mohammedan literature|year=2004|edition=Reprint|publisher=Kessinger Reprints|location=Whitefish, MT|isbn=0-76617938-9|pages=34–35[/tpl]

==Occultism==

Luciferianism is a belief system that venerates the essential characteristics that are affixed to Lucifer. The tradition, influenced by Gnosticism, usually reveres Lucifer not as the Devil, but as a liberator or guiding spirit[tpl]cite book |title=Vampires in Their Own Words: An Anthology of Vampire Voices |author=Michelle Belanger |publisher=Llewellyn Worldwide |year=2007 |page=175 |isbn=0-73871220-5[/tpl] or even the true god as opposed to Jehovah.[tpl]cite book |title=An Encyclopedia of Occultism |author=Spence, L. |publisher=Carol Publishing |year=1993[/tpl]

==Taxil's hoax==

Léo Taxil (1854–1907) claimed that Freemasonry is associated with worshipping Lucifer. In what is known as the Taxil hoax, he claimed that supposedly leading Freemason Albert Pike had addressed "The 23 Supreme Confederated Councils of the world" (an invention of Taxil), instructing them that Lucifer was God, and was in opposition to the evil god Adonai. Supporters of Freemasonry contend that, when Albert Pike and other Masonic scholars spoke about the "Luciferian path," or the "energies of Lucifer," they were referring to the Morning Star, the light bearer,"Lucifer, the Son of the Morning! Is it he who bears the Light, and with its splendors intolerable blinds feeble, sensual, or selfish Souls? Doubt it not!" (Albert Pike, Morals and Dogma, p. 321). Much has been made of this quote (Masonic information: Lucifer). the search for light; the very antithesis of dark, satanic evil. Taxil promoted a book by Diana Vaughan (actually written by himself, as he later confessed publicly)[tpl]cite web|url=http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/texts/taxil_confessed.html |title=Leo Taxil's confession |publisher=Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon |date=2001-04-02 |accessdate=2012-12-23[/tpl] that purported to reveal a highly secret ruling body called the Palladium, which controlled the organization and had a satanic agenda. As described by Freemasonry Disclosed in 1897:
Taxil's work and Pike's address continue to be quoted by anti-masonic groups.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.masonicinfo.com/taxil.htm |title=Leo Taxil: The tale of the Pope and the Pornographer |accessdate=14 September 2006[/tpl]
In Devil-Worship in France, Arthur Edward Waite compared Taxil's work to what today we would call a tabloid story, replete with logical and factual inconsistencies.
