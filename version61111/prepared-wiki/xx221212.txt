Khuhro was born into a landed family at Larkana in Sind province of what was then British India in 1901. He entered politics in 1923 when he was elected to the Bombay Legislative Council from one of the three Larkana seats. From then onwards and despite his occasional roles in national affairs, he was primarily identified with the politics and interests of Sind. Hamida Khuhro, an academic, is his daughter and has written his biography.
