Ancona. During his loan spell with the club, Antenucci scored 2 goals in 27 league appearances, before returning to Giulianova Calcio in the summer of 2005.

===Calcio Catania===

In July 2007 he was signed by Serie A side, Calcio Catania[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.tuttomercatoweb.com/?action=read&id=68617|title=UFFICIALE: Antenucci va al Catania, ma su di lui l'asta continua|date=22 July 2007|accessdate=29 October 2010|work=Tutto Mercato Web|language=Italian[/tpl] and was loaned to S.S.C. Venezia ahead of the 2007–08 Serie C1 campaign. He made 27 league appearances that season, scoring 6 goals.
On 1 July 2008, Antenucci returned to Catania and entered into the first team squad. He made 4 substitute appearances under, then coach, Walter Zenga in the first half of the 2008–09 Serie A season. On 5 January 2009, however, Mirco Antenucci was sent out on loan to Serie B club Pisa Calcio, to gain experience and playing time. During his six-month spell with the Serie B club, Antenucci scored just 1 goal in 20 league appearances, and the club failed to avoid relegation and also bankrupted. He returned to Catania on 30 June 2009.
On 19 August 2009, Catania opted to send out the striker on another loan deal to Ascoli[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.ascolicalcio.net/altre_news.asp?id=4894|title=Mirko Antenucci all’Ascoli. Domani la presentazione|date=19 August 2009|accessdate=28 October 2010|work=Ascoli Calcio 1898|language=Italian[/tpl] where he joined fellow Catania loanees Marcello Gazzola and Vito Falconieri. Following his transfer to Ascoli, the player really thrived, earning a regular starting role, and going on to make 40 appearances in the league, scoring an impressive 24 goals. He only missed 2 league matches: the first round of the season and once due to suspension.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.ascolicalcio.net/altre_news.asp?id=5685|title=Giudice Sportivo: 7.000 € di multa. Un turno a Giallombardo e Antenucci|date=11 May 2010|accessdate=29 October 2010|work=Ascoli Calcio 1898|language=Italian[/tpl] The player returned to Catania ahead of the 2010–11 Serie A season. Antenucci did make 14 league appearances for Catania that season, although most of them were off the substitute's bench. After just 1 goal, Antenucci was sent out on a co-ownership agreement.
On 23 January 2011, it was announced that he joined Torino F.C. in a co-ownership deal. In his first 6-month spell with the club, Antenucci scored 6 goals in 19 appearances, before turning in an additional 10 goals in 40 league appearances the following season. His efforts helped guide the club to a second place finish in the 2011–12 Serie B standings, and hence, promotion to Serie A.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.torinofc.it/content/view/7626/61/ |title=Antenucci al Toro |trans_title=Antenucci at the bull |date=23 January 2011 |accessdate=23 January 2011 |work=Torino FC |language=Italian[/tpl]
On 21 June 2012, Calcio Catania out-bided Torino in a blind auction for the player's co-ownership, and so the 28-year old returned to Sicily ahead of the 2012–13 Serie A season. After making a substitute appearance in matchday 1 of the season on 26 August 2012, the player was sent out on loan to Spezia Calcio of the Italian Serie B, on yet another season-long loan deal.
He was loaned to Serie B side Ternana Calcio on 20 July 2013.
