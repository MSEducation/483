Eddie Shaw (born March 20, 1937, Stringtown, Mississippi, United States)[tpl]cite web|author=Bill Dahl |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/eddie-shaw-mn0000795387/biography |title=Eddie Shaw | Biography |publisher=AllMusic |date=1937-03-20 |accessdate=2014-01-26[/tpl] is an African-American Chicago blues tenor saxophonist.

==Biography==

In his teenage years, Shaw played tenor saxophone with local blues musicians such as Little Milton and Willie Love. At the age of 14, he was involved in a jam session in Greenville, Mississippi, with Ike Turner's band. At a gig in Itta Bena, Mississippi, when the then 20-year-old Shaw performed, Muddy Waters invited him to join his Chicago-based band.
Shaw more or less divided the tenor saxophone duties with A.C. Reed. In 1972 he joined Howlin' Wolf, leading his band, the Wolf Gang, and writing half the songs on The Back Door Wolf (1973). After the singer's death in 1976 he took over the band and its residency at the 1815 Club, renamed Eddie's Place. Shaw led the gang on Living Chicago Blues Vol. 1 and Have Blues - Will Travel (1980), and recorded albums in different company for Isabel Records, Rooster Blues, and Wolf Records.
By the late 1970s, Shaw's own recording career started, with an appearance on Alligator Records' Living Chicago Blues anthologies (1978), his own LPs for Evidence and Rooster Blues, and more recent discs for Rooster Blues (In the Land of the Crossroads) and Wolf (Home Alone).
Shaw's many contributions to the blues include arranging tracks for The London Howlin' Wolf Sessions (which featured Eric Clapton, Bill Wyman, Ringo Starr and others) and performing with a list of blues notables  that included Hound Dog Taylor, Freddie King, Otis Rush and Magic Sam (on his Black Magic album).
In 2013, Shaw won the Blues Music Award in the "Instrumentalist - Horn" category.[tpl]cite web|url=https://blues.org/#ref=bluesmusicawards_pastyears|title=The Blues Foundation, Blues Music Awards, Past Blues Music Awards, 2013 - 34th Blues Music Awards|publisher=Blues.org|accessdate=May 17, 2013[/tpl]

==Legacy==

Another son, the husky Stan Shaw (born 1952), is a Hollywood, California-based character actor.
