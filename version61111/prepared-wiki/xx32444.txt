The Saab JAS 39 Gripen (English: Griffin[tpl]#tag:ref |Literally "the Griffin", as the names of Swedish combat aircraft are in the definite form, like Viggen or Draken.|group = Nb|name= "Naming"[/tpl][tpl]Cite web |last = Nilsson |first = Axel |url = https://www.fmv.se/en/Projects/JAS-39-Gripen/Milestones/ |title = JAS 39 Gripen − Milestones |work= Projects |publisher = Swedish Defence Materiel Administration |date= 13 Jan 2012 |accessdate = 12 Feb 2014 |quote= Gripen is the Swedish word for Griffin[/tpl]) is a light single-engine multirole fighter aircraft manufactured by the Swedish aerospace company Saab.  It was designed to replace the Saab 35 Draken and 37 Viggen in the Swedish Air Force (Flygvapnet).  The Gripen has a delta wing and canard configuration with relaxed stability design and fly-by-wire flight controls. It is powered by the Volvo RM12, and has a top speed of Mach 2. Later aircraft are modified for NATO interoperability standards and to undertake in-flight refuelling.
In 1979, the Swedish government began development studies for an aircraft capable of fighter, attack and reconnaissance missions to replace the Saab 35 Draken and 37 Viggen. A new design from Saab was selected and developed as the JAS 39, first flying in 1988. Following two crashes during flight development and subsequent alterations to the aircraft's flight control software, the Gripen entered service with the Swedish Air Force in 1997. Upgraded variants, featuring more advanced avionics and adaptations for longer mission times, began entering service in 2003.
In order to market the aircraft to export customers, Saab has formed several partnerships and collaborative efforts with multiple overseas aerospace companies.  One example of such efforts was Gripen International, a joint partnership between Saab and BAE Systems formed in 2001. Gripen International was responsible for marketing the aircraft, and was heavily involved in the successful export of the type to South Africa; the organization was later dissolved amidst allegations of bribery being employed to secure foreign interest and sales.  On the export market, the Gripen has achieved moderate success in sales to nations in Central Europe, South Africa and Southeast Asia.  As of 2013, more than 247 Gripens have been built.[tpl]#tag:ref | Comprising 204 (30 Batch I, 110 Batch II, 64 Batch III) Gripens delivered to Sweden, 26, South Africa, and 12, Thailand.  This figure does not include those of the Empire Test Pilots School, or Czech and Hungarian Gripens, with the latter two having received ex-Swedish Air Force aircraft. Five development aircraft were built.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.saabgroup.com/en/Air/Gripen-Fighter-System/Gripen/Gripen/In-use/ | title= Gripen Multirole Fighter: In Use | publisher= Saab |accessdate= 23 July 2011 |deadurl= |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20131030111838/http://www.saabgroup.com/en/Air/Gripen-Fighter-System/Gripen/Gripen/In-use/ |archivedate= 30 October 2013[/tpl] | group ="Nb"|name= aircraft_produced[/tpl]
A further version, designated Gripen JAS 39 E/F, is under development as of 2014; it has been referred to as Gripen NG or Super-JAS.[tpl]Cite news | url = http://www.thelocal.se/20120727/42260 |title= ‘Super-Jas’ costlier than expected: report |work= The Local | location = SE | date= 27 July 2012 |accessdate = 13 January 2014 |deadurl= |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20140113035555/http://www.thelocal.se/20120727/42260 |archivedate= 13 January 2014[/tpl]  The changes include the adoption of a new powerplant, the General Electric F414G, an active electronically scanned array radar, and significantly increased internal fuel capacity.  Saab has proposed other derivatives, including a navalised Sea Gripen for carrier operations and an optionally-manned aircraft for unmanned operations.  Sweden has ordered the Gripen NG and Brazil and Switzerland selected it for procurement.

==Development==

===Origins===

By the late 1970s, Sweden needed a replacement for its ageing Saab 35 Draken and Saab 37 Viggen.[tpl]Sfn | Frawley | 2002 | p= 147[/tpl]  The Swedish Air Force required an affordable Mach 2 aircraft with good short-field performance for a defensive dispersed basing plan in the event of invasion; the plan included 800 m long by 9 m wide rudimentary runways as stated in the Base 90 directives.[tpl]Sfn |Altaya | 2011 | loc = Características especiais | ps =: ‘O Gripen foi concebido conforme as diretivas da força aérea sueca – a Base 90 – que previa a utilização de pistas rudimentares de 800 m de comprimento e 9 m de largura…  Gripen was conceived according to the Base 90 Swedish Air Force directives that foresaw the use of rudimentary runways 800m  long and 9 m wide…’[/tpl] One goal was for the aircraft to be smaller than the Viggen while equalling or improving on its payload-range characteristics.[tpl]Sfn |Spick |2000 |pp = 426–27[/tpl] Early proposals included the Saab 38, also called B3LA, intended as an attack aircraft and trainer,[tpl]Sfn | Björeman | 2009 | pp = 139–49[/tpl] and the A 20, a development of the Viggen that would have capabilities as a fighter, attack and sea reconnaissance aircraft.[tpl]cite web | language = Swedish | place= SE | title= Om anslaget Flygvapenförband: Forskning och utveckling | type= government bill | year= 1977/78 |id= 95 |trans_title= On the appropriation Air Force First Aid: Research and development |publisher= Riksdagen |url= http://www.riksdagen.se/sv/Dokument-Lagar/Forslag/Propositioner-och-skrivelser/prop-19777895-om-anslaget-Fl_G10395/ [/tpl]  Several foreign designs were also studied, including the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon, the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet,[tpl]Sfn | Williams | 2003 | p = 72[/tpl] the Northrop F-20 Tigershark and the Dassault Mirage 2000.[tpl]Sfn | Green | Swanborough | 1987 | p= 225[/tpl] Ultimately, the Swedish government opted for a new fighter to be developed by Saab (Svenska Aeroplan Aktiebolag).[tpl]Sfn |Williams |2003 |p= 72[/tpl]
In 1979, the government started a study calling for a versatile platform capable of "JAS", standing for Jakt (air-to-air), Attack (air-to-surface), and Spaning (reconnaissance), indicating a multirole, or swingrole, fighter aircraft that can fulfill multiple roles during the same mission.[tpl]Sfn | Williams | 2003 | p=72[/tpl] A number of Saab designs were accordingly reviewed, with the most promising being "Project 2105" (redesignated "Project 2108" and, later, "Project 2110"), recommended to the government by the Defence Materiel Administration (Försvarets Materielverk, or FMV).[tpl]Sfn | Williams | 2003 | p = 72[/tpl] In 1980, Industrigruppen JAS (IG JAS, "JAS Industry Group") was established as a joint venture by Saab-Scania, LM Ericsson, Svenska Radioaktiebolaget, Volvo Flygmotor and Försvarets Fabriksverk, the industrial wing of the Swedish armed forces.[tpl]Citation |title= Svenskt militärhistoriskt bibliotek |url = http://www.smb.nu/index.php/svenska-flygplan/jaktflygplan/612 |place= NU | title= JAS 39A, B 1992– |publisher = SMB[/tpl]
The preferred aircraft was a single-engine, lightweight single-seater, embracing fly-by-wire technology, canards, and an aerodynamically unstable design.[tpl]Sfn | Williams | 2003 | p= 73[/tpl]  The powerplant selected was the Volvo-Flygmotor RM12, a license-built derivative of the  General Electric F404-400; engine development priorities were weight reduction and lowering component count.[tpl]Sfn | Williams | 2003 | p = 73[/tpl][tpl]Sfn | Cross | 1986 |p= 27[/tpl]  On 30 June 1982, with approval from the Riksdag,[tpl]cite web |url = http://www.gripen.com/en/GripenFighter/GripenStory.htm |title = Gripen: The Story So Far |work = Gripen International | publisher = Saab |accessdate= 14 October 2010 |deadurl= |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100127182209/http://www.gripen.com/en/GripenFighter/GripenStory.htm |archivedate= 27 January 2010 |quote= Swedish Parliament approves the program for the development of a new fighter aircraft[/tpl] the FMV issued contracts worth SEK25.7 billion to prime contractor Saab covering five prototypes and an initial batch of 30 production aircraft.[tpl]Sfn | Williams | 2003 |pp= 73, 88[/tpl][tpl]Sfn | Keijsper | 2003 | p= 12[/tpl] To test avionics intended for the JAS 39, such as the fly-by-wire controls, a Viggen was converted to operate as a test aircraft, flying by January 1983.[tpl]Sfn | Flight International |1983 | p= 64[/tpl]  Through a public competition, the JAS 39 received the name Gripen (griffin),[tpl]#tag:ref || group =Nb |name = "Naming"[/tpl][tpl]Cite web |url = https://www.fmv.se/en/Projects/JAS-39-Gripen/Milestones/ |title = Milestones JAS 39 Gripen | work = Projects | section = September 1982 | date = 2012-01-13 | publisher= Swedish Defence Materiel Administration |accessdate = 14 October 2010 |quote= The new aircraft is named Gripen after a prize competition[/tpl] which is the heraldry on Saab's logo.[tpl]#tag:ref| Griffin is the symbolic animal on the coat of arms of Östergötland, the province in which Saab AB is headquartered (Linköping).[tpl]Citation |url= http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/definitions/blazon?cx=partner-pub-0939450753529744%3Av0qd01-tdlq&cof=FORID%3A9&ie=UTF-8&q=blazon&sa=Search#906 |type = definition | contribution = Blazon |last= Webster | edition= online | title= Dictionary |accessdate= 20 July 2011[/tpl]| group = Nb[/tpl]

===Testing, production and improvements===

The first Gripen was rolled out on 26 April 1987, marking Saab's 50th anniversary.[tpl]Sfn | Winchester | 2004 | p = 216[/tpl]  Originally planned to fly in 1987,[tpl]Sfn | Cross |1986 |p= 27[/tpl] the first flight was delayed by 18 months due to issues with the flight control system.  On 9 December 1988, the first prototype (serial number 39-1) took its 51-minute maiden flight with pilot Stig Holmström at the controls.[tpl]Sfn |Williams |2003 |p= 73[/tpl][tpl]Sfn |Flight International |1988 |p= 3[/tpl]  During the test programme, concern surfaced about the aircraft's avionics, specifically the fly-by-wire flight control system (FCS), and the relaxed stability design. On 2 February 1989, this issue was dramatically highlighted with the crash of the prototype during an attempted landing at Linköping; the test pilot Lars Rådeström walked away with only a broken elbow.  The cause of the crash was identified as pilot-induced oscillation, caused by problems to the FCS's pitch-control routine.[tpl]Sfn |Williams | 2003 | p= 73[/tpl][tpl]Sfn | Gaines | 1989 | p = 4[/tpl][tpl]Sfn |Flight International |1989 |p= 3[/tpl]
To rectify the problem, Saab and US firm Calspan introduced major software improvements to the aircraft. A modified Lockheed NT-33A was used to test these improvements, which allowed flight testing to resume within 15 months following the accident. The programme was again hindered when, on 8 August 1993, production aircraft 39102 was destroyed in an accident during an aerial display in Stockholm.  Test pilot Rådeström lost control of the aircraft during a roll at low altitude, and the aircraft rapidly stalled, forcing him to eject. Saab later found the problem to be high amplification of the pilot's quick and significant stick command inputs. The ensuing investigations and flaw rectification delayed test flying by several months, resuming in December 1993.[tpl]Sfn |Williams | 2003 |p= 73[/tpl]
The first order included an option for another 110, which became a firm order in June 1992.  Batch II consisted of 96 one-seat JAS 39As and 14 two-seat JAS 39Bs.[tpl]Sfn |Keijsper |2003 |pp= 12, 21[/tpl][tpl]Sfn |Matláry | Ø̈sterud |2007 |p = 150[/tpl]  The JAS 39B variant is 66 cm (26 in) longer than the JAS 39A to accommodate a second seat, which also necessitated the deletion of the cannon and a reduced internal fuel capacity.[tpl]Sfn | Williams |2003 |p=88[/tpl]  By April 1994, five prototypes and two series-production Gripens had been completed; the only major decision remaining was to select a beyond-visual-range missile (BVR).[tpl]Sfn | Forsberg |1994 |p= 223[/tpl] A third batch was ordered in June 1997, composed of 50 upgraded single-seat JAS 39Cs and 14 JAS 39D two-seaters,[tpl]Sfn | Williams | 2003 | p = 88[/tpl] known as ‘Turbo Gripen’, with NATO compatibility for exports.[tpl]Sfn |Altaya | 2011 | loc = Diversas versões ¶1a | ps =: “A necessidade de adaptar o Gripen às especificidades da Otan, para estimular as vendas no estrangeiro, levou ao desenvolvimento de uma nova versão chamada ‘Turbo Gripen’.

In-flight refueling was tested via a specially equipped prototype (39‐4) used in successful trials with a Royal Air Force VC10 in 1998.[tpl]Sfn | Williams | 2003 | p = 88[/tpl]

===Teaming agreements===

During the 1995 Paris Air Show, Saab Military Aircraft and British Aerospace (BAe, now BAE Systems) announced the formation the joint-venture company Saab-BAe Gripen AB with the goal of adapting, manufacturing, marketing and supporting Gripen worldwide.[tpl]Sfn |Williams |2003 |p= 88[/tpl][tpl]Sfn |Lorell |2002 |p= 147[/tpl]  The deal involved the conversion of the A and B series aircraft to the "export" C and D series, which developed the Gripen for compatibility with NATO standards.[tpl]Sfn |Eliasson |2010 |p= 256[/tpl]  This cooperation was extended in 2001 with the formation of Gripen International to promote export sales.[tpl]Sfn |Lorell |2002 |pp= 147–48[/tpl] In December 2004, Saab and BAE Systems announced that BAE was to sell a large portion of its stake in Saab, and that Saab would take full responsibility for marketing and export orders of the Gripen.[tpl]Cite news | last = Reece | first=Damian |url= http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/bae-cuts-saab-stake-after-gripen-revamp-6156400.html |title =BAE cuts Saab stake after Gripen revamp |newspaper=The Independent |date=8 December 2004 |accessdate =2 November 2013 |deadurl= |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20131217000028/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/bae-cuts-saab-stake-after-gripen-revamp-6156400.html |archivedate= 17 December 2013[/tpl] In June 2011, Saab announced that an internal investigation revealed evidence former partner BAE Systems had performed acts of corruption, including money laundering, in South Africa, a customer of the Gripen.[tpl]cite web |last=Page |first= Lewis |url= http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/06/20/saab_sa_fighter_accusation/ |title= Saab fingers BAE over South African fighter deal |work= The Register |date= 20 June 2011 |place= United Kingdom |accessdate= 17 December 2013 |deadurl= |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20131106103506/http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/06/20/saab_sa_fighter_accusation/ |archivedate =6 November 2013[/tpl]
On 26 April 2007, Norway signed a NOK150 million joint-development agreement with Saab to cooperate in the development programme of the Gripen, including the integration of Norwegian industries in the development of future versions of the aircraft.[tpl]Cite press release |url= http://www.saabgroup.com/en/about-saab/newsroom/press-releases--news/2007---4/gripen---agreement-in-norway/ |title= Gripen – agreement in Norway |publisher= Saab |date= 26 April 2007 |accessdate =2 November 2013 |deadurl= |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20120329130100/http://www.saabgroup.com/en/about-saab/newsroom/press-releases--news/2007---4/gripen---agreement-in-norway/ |archivedate=29 March 2012[/tpl] In June of the same year, Saab also entered an agreement with Thales Norway A/S concerning the development of communications systems for the Gripen fighter; this order was the first to be awarded under the provisions of the Letter of Agreement signed by the Norwegian Ministry of Defence and Gripen International in April 2007. As a result of the United States diplomatic cables leak in 2010, it was revealed that US diplomats had become concerned with cooperation between Norway and Sweden on the topic of the Gripen, and had sought to exert pressure against a Norwegian purchase of the aircraft.
In December 2007, as part of Gripen International's marketing efforts in Denmark, a deal was signed with Danish technology supplier Terma A/S which allows them to participate in an industrial cooperation programme over the next 10–15 years. The total value of the programme is estimated at over DKK10 billion, and is partly dependent on a procurement of the Gripen by Denmark.[tpl]Cite press release |url= http://www.saabgroup.com/en/about-saab/newsroom/press-releases--news/2007---12/gripen--a-catalyst-for-danish-industry/ |title= Gripen – A Catalyst for Danish Industry |publisher= Saab |date= 4 December 2007 |accessdate= 2 November 2013 |deadurl= |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20120329130140/http://www.saabgroup.com/en/about-saab/newsroom/press-releases--news/2007---12/gripen--a-catalyst-for-danish-industry/ |archivedate= 29 March 2012[/tpl]

===Controversies, scandals, and costs===

Developing an advanced multi-role fighter was a major undertaking for Sweden.  The predecessor Viggen, despite being less advanced and less expensive, had been criticized for occupying too much of Sweden's military budget and was branded "a cuckoo in the military nest" by critics as early as 1971. At the 1972 party congress of the Social Democrats, the dominant party in Swedish politics since the 1950s, a motion was passed to stop any future projects to develop advanced military aircraft.[tpl]cite web | language = Swedish |publisher=Sveriges Radio |work= P3 Dokumentär | type = radio broadcast | url = http://sverigesradio.se/sida/avsnitt/91822?programid=2519 |title= JAS-projektet| trans_title= JAS project | date= 23 March 2008 |deadurl= |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20131219044311/http://sverigesradio.se/sida/avsnitt/91822?programid=2519 |archivedate= 19 December 2013[/tpl]  In 1982, the project passed in the Riksdag by a narrow of margin of 176 for and 167 against, with the entire Social Democratic voting against the proposal due to demands for more studies. A new bill was introduced in 1983[tpl]cite web |language= Swedish |title = Regeringens proposition 1982/83:119 om riktlinjer för JAS-projektet |type= government bill |year= 1982–83 | number = 119 |trans_title= on guidelines for the JAS project |url= http://www.riksdagen.se/sv/Dokument-Lagar/Forslag/Propositioner-och-skrivelser/prop-198283119-om-riktlinjer_G603119/ |publisher = Riksdagen | place= SE[/tpl] and a final approval was given in April 1983 with the condition that the project was to have a predetermined fixed-price contract,[tpl]Sfn | Björeman | 2009 | pp= 137–49[/tpl] a decision that would later be criticized as unrealistic due to later cost overruns.
According to Annika Brändström, in the aftermath of the 1989 and 1993 crashes during the aircraft's development, the Gripen risked a loss of credibility and the weakening of its public image.  There was public speculation that failures to address technical problems exposed in the first crash had directly contributed to the second crash and thus would have been avoidable.[tpl]Sfn |Brändström | 2003 | pp= 61, 72[/tpl] Brändström observed that elements of the media had called for greater public accountability and explanation of the project; ill-informed media analysis had also proved to distort public knowledge of the Gripen.[tpl]Sfn | Brändström | 2003 |pp= 57–62[/tpl] The sitting Conservative government was quick to initiate efforts to maintain political support for the Gripen and endorse the aircraft – Minister of Defense Anders Björck issued a public reassurance that the project was very positive for Sweden.[tpl]Sfn |Brändström |2003 |pp=58–62, 72–73[/tpl]
In relation to the marketing efforts of the Gripen to multiple countries, including South Africa, Austria, the Czech Republic and Hungary, there were reports of widespread bribery and corruption by BAE Systems and Saab.[tpl]Cite news | url = http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/07/bae-chiefs-linked-bribes-conspiracy | title = BAE chiefs 'linked to bribes conspiracy' | newspaper = The Observer | place = United Kingdom | publisher = The Guardian | date= 7 February 2010 |accessdate= 3 November 2013 | first1 = David | last1 = Leigh | first2 = Rob |last2= Evans |deadurl= |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20131104220310/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/07/bae-chiefs-linked-bribes-conspiracy |archivedate= 4 November 2013 |quote= …lawyers for the Serious Fraud Office described what they said were BAE's systematic methods for making corrupt payments to foreign politicians and officials.[/tpl]  In 2007, Swedish journalists reported that BAE had paid bribes equivalent to millions of dollars,[tpl]Cite news |language = Swedish |url= http://www.svt.se/ug/slutet-pa-jas-harvan |title= Greven som sätter punkt för JAS-härvan | trans_title = Count which closes the JAS-scandal | place = SE | publisher = SVT | date= 12 March 2013 |accessdate = 18 June 2013[/tpl][tpl]Cite news | url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13813281 | title = Call for new South African arms deal investigation | date = 17 June 2011 |accessdate = 18 June 2013 | publisher = BBC | work= News | place= United Kingdom |deadurl= |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20121223173023/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13813281 |archivedate= 23 December 12[/tpl] and was followed by investigative reporting on BAE Systems in the UK and South Africa.[tpl]Cite news |url = http://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2011/07/31/hawks-reveal-arms-deal-bombshell |title= Hawks reveals Arms deal bombshell |place= ZA | newspaper= The Sunday Times | date= 31 July 2011 |accessdate= 18 June 2013 |deadurl= |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20131103161203/http://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2011/07/31/hawks-reveal-arms-deal-bombshell |archivedate= 3 November 2013[/tpl]  Following criminal investigations in eight countries, only one individual in Austria, Alfons Mensdorf-Pouilly, was prosecuted for bribery.

The Gripen's cost has been subject to frequent attention and speculation. In 2008, Saab announced reduced earnings for that year, partly attributing this to increased marketing costs for the aircraft.[tpl]Cite news | last1 = Lindstroem | first1= Jakob | first2 = Steve | last2 = Rothwell | editor-last = Jasper | editor-first = Chris | url = http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aY7i3Jy3VrDM | title = Saab Says ‘Turmoil’ in Swedish Budget Hurts Earnings | publisher = Bloomberg |date = 5 September 2008 |accessdate =2 November 2013 |deadurl= |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20131102121308/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aY7i3Jy3VrDM |archivedate= 2 November 2013[/tpl] In 2008, Saab disputed Norway's cost calculations for the Gripen NG as overestimated and in excess of real world performance with existing operators.  A 2007 report by the European Union Institute for Security Studies stated the total research and development costs of Gripen to be €1.84 billion.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.iss.europa.eu/uploads/media/occ69.pdf | series = Occasional Paper |number= 69 |title= Lessons learned from European defence equipment programmes |publisher= European Union Institute for Security Studies |date = October 2007 |format= PDF |deadurl= |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20131102225130/http://www.iss.europa.eu/uploads/media/occ69.pdf |archivedate= 2 November 2013[/tpl]  According to a study by Jane's Information Group in 2012, the Gripen's operational cost was the lowest among several modern fighters; its cost was estimated at $4,700 per flight hour.[tpl]cite web |last= Joshi |first= Saurabh |url= http://www.stratpost.com/gripen-operational-cost-lowest-of-all-western-fighters-janes |title= Gripen operational cost lowest of all western fighters: Jane's |work = Strat Post |date= 4 July 2012 |accessdate = 27 August 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20131102135024/http://www.stratpost.com/gripen-operational-cost-lowest-of-all-western-fighters-janes |archivedate= 2 November 2013[/tpl]  According to the Swedish Ministry of Defense, the cost estimation of the full system, comprising 60 Gripen E/F, amounts to SEK 90 billion distributed over the period 2013–42.

==Design==

===Overview===

The Gripen is a multirole fighter aircraft, intended to be a lightweight and agile aerial platform incorporating advanced, highly-adaptable avionics. It has canard control surfaces which contributes a positive lift force at all speeds, while the generous lift from the delta wing compensates for the rear stabilizer producing negative lift at high speeds, increasing induced drag.[tpl]Citation | last = Karlsson | first = Arne | language = Swedish | title = Kompendium till 4E1201 Flygteknik | trans_title = Compendium to 4E1201 Aeronautical Engineering | year = 1998 | place = SE | publisher = KTH[/tpl]. By being intentionally instable and employing digital fly-by-wire flight controls to maintain stability; this removes many flight restrictions, improves manoeuvrability, and reduces drag.[tpl]Sfn | Lindqvist | Widfeldt | 2003 | pages = 50–60, 133–37[/tpl] The Gripen also has good short takeoff performance, being able to maintain a high sink rate and strengthened to withstand the stresses of short landings.[tpl]Sfn |Green | Swanborough |1987 |pp= 227–28[/tpl] The canards can move to help stabilize the aircraft.[tpl]Citation needed|date = March 2014[/tpl] The Gripen has a pair of air brakes on the sides of the fuselage at the tail; the canards angle downward to act as air brakes and decrease landing distance.[tpl]Sfn |Williams |2003 |pp= 81–82[/tpl]
In order to enable the Gripen to have a long service life, projected to be roughly 50 years, the aircraft was designed to have low maintenance requirements;[tpl]Sfn |Eliasson | 2010 | p= 125[/tpl] major systems such as the RM12 engine and PS-05/A radar are of a modular construction, this approach was to reduce operating cost and increase reliability. The Gripen was designed to be flexible as it had been anticipated that newly developed sensors, computers, and armaments would need to be integrated as technology advances.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.gripenblogs.com/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?ID=791 | title = Fighter Aircraft Design: Then and Now | work = Gripen | type = blog | publisher= Saab | date= 10 December 2013 |accessdate = 12 January 2014 |deadurl= |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20140111035631/http://www.gripenblogs.com/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?ID=791 |archivedate= 11 January 2014[/tpl]  The aircraft was estimated to be roughly 67% sourced from Swedish or European suppliers and 33% from the United States.[tpl]Cite web | last=Tran | first= Pierre | url= http://www.defensenews.com/story.php?i=3627265&c=EUR&s=TOP | title = Buy Now, Save a Bundle on the F-35|work= Defense News |date= 15 July 2008 | publisher= Gannett Government Media | location = Springfield, VA |issn= 0884-139X[/tpl]
One key aspect of the Gripen program that Saab have been keen to emphasize has been technology-transfer agreements and industrial partnerships with export customers.[tpl]cite web |url = http://www.saabgroup.com/en/Air/Gripen-Fighter-System/Gripen-and-Switzerland/Industrial-partnership/ | title= Gripen and Switzerland: Industrial Partnership | publisher = Saab |accessdate= 6 January 2014 |deadurl= |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20131220070215/http://www.saabgroup.com/en/Air/Gripen-Fighter-System/Gripen-and-Switzerland/Industrial-partnership/ |archivedate= 20 December 2013[/tpl] The Gripen is typically customized to customer requirements, enabling the routine inclusion of local suppliers in the manufacturing and support processes. A number of South African firms provide components and systems – including the communications suite and electronic warfare systems – for the Gripens operated by South African Air Force.[tpl]Sfn |Henk | 2006 | p= 73[/tpl] Operators also have access to the Gripen's source code and technical documentation, allowing for upgrades and new equipment to be independently integrated.[tpl]cite web | format = PDF | url = http://www.swedenabroad.com/SelectImageX/115931/071024_Gripen_Press_Hand_Out.pdf |title= Facts on the Bilateral Cooperation Program between Thailand and Sweden by the Swedish Government |publisher= Ministry for Foreign Affairs (Sweden) |accessdate= 3 September 2012 |deadurl= |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20131217011145/http://www.swedenabroad.com/SelectImageX/115931/071024_Gripen_Press_Hand_Out.pdf |archivedate= 17 December 2013[/tpl]  Some export customers intend to domestically assemble the Gripen; it has been proposed that Brazilian aerospace manufacturer Embraer may produce Gripens for other export customers as well.[tpl]Cite news |last= Trevisani | first =Paulo |url = http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20131220-710814.html |title= New Gripen Fighter to Be Built at Brazil-Based Plant, Saab Executive Says |work= The Wall Street Journal |date= 20 December 2013|accessdate= 12 January 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web |last= O'Dwyer |first= Gerald |url= http://www.defensenews.com/article/20131224/DEFREG01/312240006/Swedish-Government-Looks-Add-Value-Gripen-E-Sale-Talks | title= Swedish Government Looks to Add Value to Gripen-E Sale Talks | work= Defense News | date= 24 December 2013 |accessdate= 12 January 2014 |deadurl= |archiveurl= http://archive.is/hTh49 |archivedate= 11 January 2014 | publisher =Gannett Government Media | location = Springfield, VA |issn= 0884-139X[/tpl]

===Avionics and sensors===

All of the Gripen's avionics are fully integrated using total of five MIL-STD 1553B digital data buses, described as 'sensor fusion'. The total integration of the avionics makes the Gripen a "programmable" aircraft, allowing software updates to be introduced over time to increase performance and allow for additional operational roles and equipment.[tpl]Sfn | Frédriksen |2001 | p= 280[/tpl]  The ADA programming language was adopted for the Gripen, and is used for the primary flight controls on the final prototypes from 1996 onwards and all subsequent production aircraft.[tpl]Sfn |Frisberg |1998 |p= 288[/tpl]  The Gripen's software is continuously being improved to add new capabilities, as compared to the preceding Viggen which was updated only in an 18-month schedule.[tpl]Sfn |Eliasson | 2010 | p= 125[/tpl]
Much of the data generated from the onboard sensors and by cockpit activity is digitally recorded throughout the length of an entire mission. This information can be replayed in the cockpit or easily extracted for detailed post-mission analysis using a this data transfer unit that can also be used to insert mission data to the aircraft.  The Gripen, like the Viggen, was designed to operate as one component of a networked national defence system, which allows for automatic exchange of information in real-time between Gripen aircraft and ground facilities.[tpl]Sfn | Eliasson | 2010 | p= 126[/tpl]  According to Saab, the Gripen features "the world's most highly developed data link". The Gripen's Ternav tactical navigation system combines information from multiple onboard systems such as the air data computer, radar altimeter, and GPS to continuously calculate the Gripen's location.[tpl]cite web |last=Sherman | first= Ron | url = http://www.aviationtoday.com/av/issue/feature/The-Gripens-NATO-ized-NINS_12891.html | title= The Gripen's NATO-ized Nins |work= Aviation Today | date= 1 October 2002 |accessdate= 17 December 2013 |deadurl= |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20131217013108/http://www.aviationtoday.com/av/issue/feature/The-Gripens-NATO-ized-NINS_12891.html#.UtIaSEm4bIU |archivedate= 17 December 2013[/tpl]
The Gripen entered service using the PS-05/A pulse-doppler X-band multi-mode radar, developed by Ericsson and GEC-Marconi, which is based on the latter's advanced Blue Vixen radar for the Sea Harrier that also served as the basis for the Eurofighter's CAPTOR radar.[tpl]Sfn |Lake |2008 |p= 2[/tpl] The all-weather radar is capable of locating and identifying targets 120 km (74 mi) away,[tpl]Sfn |Williams |2003 |p= 74[/tpl] and automatically tracking multiple targets in the upper and lower spheres, on the ground and sea or in the air.  It can guide several beyond visual range air-to-air missiles to multiple targets simultaneously.[tpl]Sfn |Signal | 1994 | p= 32[/tpl]  Saab stated the PS-05/A is able to handle all types of air defense, air-to-surface, and reconnaissance missions.
The future Gripen E/F shall make use of a new active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, Raven ES-05, based on Selex ES's Vixen AESA radar family. Amongst other improvements, the new radar is to be capable of scanning over a greatly increased field of view and improved range.[tpl]cite web | last = Joshi | first = Saurabh | url= http://www.stratpost.com/gripen-hardsells-new-aesa-radar-low-cost-for-mmrca | title = Gripen hardsells new AESA radar, low cost for MMRCA | work = Strat Post | date = 10 September 2009 |accessdate = 23 March 2010 |deadurl= |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20131103132052/http://www.stratpost.com/gripen-hardsells-new-aesa-radar-low-cost-for-mmrca |archivedate= 3 November 2013[/tpl] In addition, the new Gripen integrates the Skyward-G infrared search and track (IRST) sensor, which is capable of passively detecting thermal emissions from air and ground targets in the aircraft's vicinity.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.saabgroup.com/en/Air/Gripen-Fighter-System/Gripen-and-Switzerland/The-Gripen-Solution/Other-sensors/ |work= The Gripen Solution | title = Other Sensors | publisher= Saab |accessdate = 4 January 2013 |deadurl= |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20131219235627/http://www.saabgroup.com/en/Air/Gripen-Fighter-System/Gripen-and-Switzerland/The-Gripen-Solution/Other-sensors/ |archivedate= 19 December 2013[/tpl] The sensors of the Gripen E are claimed to be able to detect low-radar-cross-section (RCS) targets at beyond visual range.[tpl]Citation | url = http://www.aviationweek.com/Article.aspx?id=/article-xml/AW_03_17_2014_p28-671791.xml | title = Gripen Sensors Claim Counter-Stealth Performance | newspaper = Aviation week | date = 17 March 2014[/tpl].

The Gripen includes the EP-17 cockpit display system, developed by Saab to provide pilots with a high level of situational awareness and reduces pilot workload through intelligent information management. The Gripen features a sensor fusion capability, information from onboard sensors and databases is combined, automatically analysed, and useful data is presented to the pilot via a wide field-of-view head-up display, three large multi-function colour displays, and optionally a helmet mounted display system (HMDS).[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.saabgroup.com/en/Air/Avionics_Systems/Avionics_Equipment/EP_17_Gripen_Display_System_HUD/Features/ |title=Ep-17 Gripen Display System |publisher= Saab |accessdate=3 October 2013 |deadurl= |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20131103092341/http://www.saabgroup.com/en/Air/Avionics_Systems/Avionics_Equipment/EP_17_Gripen_Display_System_HUD/Features/ |archivedate= 3 November 2013[/tpl]
Of the three multi-function displays (MFD), the central display is for navigational and mission data, the display to the left of the center shows aircraft status and electronic warfare information, and the display to the right of the center has sensory and fire control information.  In two-seat variants, the rear seat's displays can be operated independently of the pilot's own display arrangement in the forward seat, Saab has promoted this capability as being useful during electronic warfare and reconnaissance missions, and while carrying out command and control activities. In May 2010, Sweden began equipping their Gripens with additional onboard computer systems and new displays.[tpl]Cite news |url= http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Security-Industry/2010/05/26/Saab-to-develop-new-Gripen-avionics/UPI-73771274898005/ | title = Saab to develop new Gripen avionics |agency = United Press International | date = 26 May 2010 |accessdate = 3 November 2013 |deadurl= |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20131103092248/http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Security-Industry/2010/05/26/Saab-to-develop-new-Gripen-avionics/UPI-73771274898005/ |archivedate= 3 November 2013[/tpl] The MFDs are interchangeable and designed for redundancy in the event of failure, flight information can be presented on any of the displays.
Saab and BAE developed the Cobra HMDS for use in the Gripen, based on the Striker HMDS used on the Eurofighter.[tpl]Sfn | Larsson | Ekrot | 2008 | p= 1[/tpl] By 2008, the Cobra HMDS was fully integrated on operational aircraft, and is available as an option for export customers; it has been retrofitted into older Swedish and South African Gripens.[tpl]Sfn | Larsson | Ekrot |2008 | p=1[/tpl] The HMDS provides control and information on target cueing, sensor data, and flight parameters, and is optionally equipped for night time operations and with chemical/biological filtration.  All connections between the HMDS and the cockpit were designed for rapid detachment, for safe use of the ejection system.[tpl]Sfn |Larsson |Ekrot |2008 |pp= 2, 4[/tpl]

===Engine===

All in-service Gripens as of January 2014 are powered by the Volvo RM12 turbofan engine, a license-manufactured derivative of General Electric F404 ; changes include increased performance and improved reliability to meet single engine use safety criteria, as well as a greater resistance to bird strike incidents.[tpl]Sfn |Flight International |1994 |p= 15[/tpl]  Several subsystems and components were also redesigned to reduce maintenance demands.[tpl]cite web |url =http://www.vfsco.com/financialservices/hungary/hu-hu/news_media/_layouts/CWP.Internet.VolvoCom/NewsItem.aspx?News.ItemId=36253&News.Language=en-gb |title= Gripen surpasses 100,000 flight hours – Volvo Aero’s engine safest in the world |publisher=Volvo Aero|date=31 January 2008 |accessdate= 12 January 2014 |deadurl= |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20140110084849/http://www.vfsco.com/financialservices/hungary/hu-hu/news_media/_layouts/CWP.Internet.VolvoCom/NewsItem.aspx?News.ItemId=36253&News.Language=en-gb |archivedate= 10 January 2014[/tpl]  By November 2010, the Gripen had accumulated over 143,000 flight hours without a single engine-related failure or incident; Rune Hyrefeldt, head of Military Program management at Volvo Aero, stated "I think this must be a hard record to beat for a single-engine application".
The JAS 39E and F variants currently under development are to adopt the F414G powerplant, a variant of the General Electric F414. The F414G can produce 20% greater thrust than the current RM12 engine, enabling the Gripen to supercruise (maintain speed beyond the sound barrier without the use of afterburners) at a speed of Mach 1.1 while carrying an air-to-air combat payload.  In 2010, Volvo Aero stated it was capable of further developing its RM12 engine to better match the performance of the F414G, and claimed that developing the RM12 would be a less expensive option.[tpl]Cite news |last= Karlberg |first= Lars Anders| url= http://www.nyteknik.se/nyheter/fordon_motor/flygplan/article2510693.ece |language= Swedish |title= Volvo vill trimma Gripens motor |trans_title= Volvo wants to trim the Gripen's engine |work= Ny Teknik |date= 19 November 2010 |deadurl= |archiveurl= 12 January 2014 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20140110085415/http://www.nyteknik.se/nyheter/fordon_motor/flygplan/article2510693.ece |archivedate= 10 January 2014[/tpl]  Prior to Saab's selection of the F414G, the Eurojet EJ200 had also been under consideration for the Gripen; proposed implementations included the use of thrust vectoring.[tpl]Cite web |url= http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/eurojet-aims-ej200-variant-at-thrust-vectored-gripen-37567/ |title= Eurojet aims EJ200 variant at thrust vectored Gripen |work= Flightglobal |date=27 May 1998 |accessdate=13 January 2014[/tpl]

Saab describes the Gripen as a "swing-role aircraft", stating that it is capable of "instantly switching between roles at the push of a button".  The human/machine interface changes when switching between roles, being optimized by the computer in response to new situations and threats.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.saabgroup.com/Global/Documents%20and%20Images/Air/Gripen/Gripen%20product%20sheet/The_Gripen_Mission.pdf |work= The Gripen |title= Mission |format= PDF |publisher= Saab |accessdate= 4 September 2012 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20131217020258/http://www.saabgroup.com/Global/Documents%20and%20Images/Air/Gripen/Gripen%20product%20sheet/The_Gripen_Mission.pdf |archivedate= 17 December 2013[/tpl] The Gripen is also equipped to use a number of different communications standards and systems, including SATURN secure radio, Link-16, ROVER, and satellite uplinks.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.saabgroup.com/en/Air/Gripen-Fighter-System/Gripen-and-Switzerland/The-Gripen-Solution/Communication/ |work= The Gripen Solution |title= Communications |publisher= Saab |accessdate= 5 January 2014|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20131219235634/http://www.saabgroup.com/en/Air/Gripen-Fighter-System/Gripen-and-Switzerland/The-Gripen-Solution/Communication/ |archivedate= 19 December 2013[/tpl]

===Usability and maintenance===

During the Cold War, the Swedish Armed Forces were to be ready to defend against a possible invasion from the Soviet Union. This scenario required combat aircraft to be dispersed in order to maintain an air defence capacity.[tpl]Sfn |Spick |2000 |p= 426[/tpl] Thus, a key design goal during the Gripen's development was the ability to take off from snow-covered landing strips of only [tpl]Convert|800|m|ft[/tpl];[tpl]Sfn | Williams | 2003 | p = 82[/tpl] furthermore, a short-turnaround time of just ten minutes, during which a team composed of a technician and five conscripts would be able to re-arm, refuel, and perform basic inspections and servicing inside that time window before returning to flight.[tpl]Sfn |Williams |2003 |p=82[/tpl][tpl]Sfn |Chant |Taylor |1999 |p= 48[/tpl]
During the design process, great priority was placed on facilitating and minimising aircraft maintenance; in addition to a maintenance-friendly layout, many subsystems and components require little or no maintenance at all.[tpl]Sfn | Eliasson | 2010 | p= 125[/tpl] Aircraft are fitted with a Health and Usage Monitoring Systems (HUMS) that monitors the performance of various systems, and provides information to technicians to assist in servicing it.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.saabgroup.com/en/Air/Mission_Support_Systems/Maintenance_Ground_Support/Maintenance_Ground_Support_System/Features/ | title = Maintenance Ground Support System | publisher = Saab |accessdate = 5 September 2012 |deadurl= |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20131217105625/http://www.saabgroup.com/en/Air/Mission_Support_Systems/Maintenance_Ground_Support/Maintenance_Ground_Support_System/Features/ |archivedate= 17 December 2013[/tpl] Saab operates a continuous improvement programme, information from the HUMS and other systems can be submitted for analysis.[tpl]Cite journal | last1 = Sandberg |first1= Anna |first2= Ulrika |last2= Strömberg | url = http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=843247 | title = Gripen: with focus on availability, performance and life support cost over the product life cycle | journal = Journal of Quality in Maintenance Engineering | year = 1999 | volume= 5 | issue= 4 | pages = 325–35 | issn = 1355-2511[/tpl] According to Saab, the Gripen provides "50% lower operating costs than its best competitor".
A 2012 Jane's Aerospace and Defense Consulting study compared the operational costs of a number of modern combat aircraft, concluding that Gripen had the lowest cost per flight hour (CPFH) when fuel used, pre-flight preparation and repair, and scheduled airfield-level maintenance together with associated personnel costs were combined.  The next cheapest, the F-16 Block 40/50, had a 49% higher CPFH at an estimated $7,000 per hour.

===Czech Republic===

When the Czech Republic became a NATO member in 1999, the need to replace their existing Soviet-built MiG-21 fleet with aircraft compatible with NATO interoperability standards became apparent. In 2000, the Czech Republic began evaluating a number of aircraft, including the F-16, F/A-18, Mirage 2000, Eurofighter Typhoon and the Gripen. One major procurement condition was the industrial offset agreement, set at 150% of the expected purchase value.[tpl]cite news |language= Swedish |newspaper= Dagens Industri |url = http://www.di.se/artiklar/2000/10/17/tjeckien-tar-in-jas-offert/ | title= Tjeckien tar in JAS-offert | trans_title= Czech Republic receives the JAS quote |date= 17 October 2000 |accessdate= 12 January 2014 |deadurl= |archiveurl= http://archive.is/CAWgv |archivedate= 18 April 2013[/tpl] In December 2001, having reportedly been swayed by Gripen International's generous financing and offset programme, the Czech Government announced that the Gripen had been selected.[tpl]Sfn | Spreen | 2007 |p= 77[/tpl] In 2002, the deal was delayed until after parliamentary elections had taken place; alternative means of air defense were also studied, including leasing the aircraft.[tpl]cite news| language = Swedish |newspaper=Dagens Industri |url= http://www.di.se/artiklar/2002/9/13/tjeckien-stoppar-jas-kop/ | title = Tjeckien stoppar Jas-köp | trans_title= Czech Republic concludes Jas buy |date= 13 September 2002 |accessdate= 12 January 2014 |deadurl= |archiveurl= http://archive.is/hEa2M |archivedate= 18 April 2013[/tpl]

===Hungary===

Following Hungary's membership of NATO in 1999, there were several proposals to achieve a NATO-compatible fighter force. Considerable attention went into studying second-hand aircraft options as well as modifying the nation's existing MiG-29 fleet. In 2001, Hungary received several offers of new and used aircraft from various nations, including Sweden, Belgium, Israel, Turkey, and the United States.[tpl]cite news | language = Swedish | newspaper = Dagens Industri | date= 28 August 2001 |url= http://www.di.se/artiklar/2001/8/28/ungern-pa-vag-rata-jas/ |title= Ungern på väg rata JAS | trans_title = Hungary on the road rata JAS |accessdate= 12 January 2014 |deadurl= |archiveurl= http://archive.is/omk8Q |archivedate= 18 April 2013[/tpl] Although the Hungarian government initially intended to procure the F-16, in November 2001 it was in the process of negotiating a 10-year lease contract for 12 Gripen aircraft, with an option to purchase the aircraft at the end of the lease period.[tpl]cite news |language= Swedish | newspaper= Dagens Industri |date= 12 November 2011 |url = http://www.di.se/artiklar/2001/11/23/jas-avtalet-vart-5-mdr/ |title = Jas-avtalet värt 5 mdr |trans_title= Jas agreement worth 5 billion |accessdate= 12 January 2014 |deadurl= |archiveurl= http://archive.is/I0N3x |archivedate= 18 April 2013[/tpl][tpl]Sfn |Larrabee |2003 |p= 24[/tpl]

====Denmark====

In 2007, Denmark signed a Memorandum of Understanding between the Defence Ministers of Sweden and Denmark to evaluate the Gripen as a replacement for Denmark's fleet of 48 F-16s. Denmark also requested the development of Gripen variants featuring more powerful engines, larger payloads, longer range, and additional avionics; this request contributed to Saab's decision to go ahead with development of the Gripen JAS E/F.[tpl]cite web |url = http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/new-gripen-variants-studied-by-saab-207410/ |title = New Gripen variants studied by Saab |work = Flightglobal | date= 27 June 2006 |accessdate=17 December 2013 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20131217024052/http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/new-gripen-variants-studied-by-saab-207410/ |archivedate= 19 December 2013[/tpl] Denmark has repeatedly delayed the purchase decision;[tpl]Cite news | url = http://www.cphpost.dk/news/national/88-national/47278-fighter-jet-decision-postponed-again.html | title = Fighter jet decision postponed – again | newspaper = The Copenhagen Post | date= 22 October 2009 |accessdate = 23 October 2009 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091023102022/http://www.cphpost.dk/news/national/88-national/47278-fighter-jet-decision-postponed-again.html |archivedate= 23 October 2009[/tpl] in 2013, Saab indicated that the Gripen was one of four contenders for the Danish purchase.

Saab and the Swedish defence minister Sten Tolgfors have criticised the selection, stating that there were flaws in Norway's cost calculations for the Gripen NG.[tpl]cite web |last=Hoyle |first =Craig |url= http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/saab-launches-attack-on-norway39s-39faulty39-fighter-319967/ |title= Saab launches attack on Norway's 'faulty' fighter analysis| work= Flightglobal |date= 10 December 2008 |accessdate=12 January 2014 |deadurl= |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20140112034652/http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/saab-launches-attack-on-norway39s-39faulty39-fighter-319967/ |archivedate= 12 January 2014[/tpl]  The offer was for 48 aircraft over 20 years, but Norway had extrapolated it to operating 57 aircraft over 30 years, thus doubling the cost; Norway's operational cost projections also failed to relate to the operational costs of Sweden's Gripens. Norway also calculated with more attrition losses than what Sweden considered reasonable. According to Tolgfors, Norway's decision would complicate further export deals for the Gripen.[tpl]Cite news |url= http://svt.se/svt/jsp/Crosslink.jsp?d=22620&a=1439630 |title= Norge räknade fel i Gripenaffär |place= SE |trans_title= Norway miscalculated in Gripen deal |language= Swedish |publisher= SVT |date= 10 February 2009 |deadurl= |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110612114659/http://svt.se/svt/jsp/Crosslink.jsp?d=22620&a=1439630 |archivedate=12 June 2011[/tpl][tpl]Cite news |url= http://mobil.e24.no/utenriks/article2876712.ece |title= Gripen passer ikke for Norge |trans_title= Gripen does not suit Norway |language= Norwegian |place= NO |newspaper= E24 |date= 20 February 2009 |deadurl= |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110822081206/http://mobil.e24.no/utenriks/article2876712.ece |archivedate= 22 August 2011[/tpl] In December 2010 leaked United States diplomatic cables revealed that the United States deliberately delayed Sweden's request for access to a US AESA radar until after Norway's selection.

[tpl]As of|2011|07[/tpl], the Gripen has been involved in eight incidents, including five hull-loss accidents, with no loss of life.[tpl]Cite web |url= http://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/dblist.php?AcType=SB39 |title= Saab JAS 39 incidents |publisher= Aviation Safety Network |date= 19 July 2011 |accessdate =24 July 2011[/tpl] Note page has two entries for the 31 May 2010 accident with the same serial number.
The first two crashes, in 1989 and 1993 respectively, occurred during public displays of the Gripen and resulted in considerable negative reporting in media. The first crash was filmed by a Sveriges Television news crew and led to calls from previous critics of the project to cancel development altogether.[tpl]Sfn |Brändström |2003 |pp=17–18, 23–24[/tpl] The second crash resulted in a minor scandal since it occurred during the 1993 Stockholm Water Festival in central Stockholm with tens of thousands of spectators present. A human tragedy was narrowly avoided as the aircraft crashed in an empty area on the island of Långholmen. The pilot ejected unscathed, but one woman was hospitalized for burns and 14 other individuals reported injuries of a "psychological nature". There was public criticism of the decision to display the Gripen over large crowds, and it was compared to the 1989 crash.[tpl]Sfn |Brändström |2003 |pp=5–6[/tpl][tpl]cite web |language= Swedish |url= http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=1602&artikel=851408 |title= JAS Gripen störtar på Långholmen – SR Minnen |trans_title= JAS Gripen crashes on Long Holmen – SR Memories |publisher= Sveriges Radio |place= SE |accessdate=2013-10-06 |deadurl= |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20131219213959/http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=1602&artikel=851408 |archivedate= 19 December 2013[/tpl]  Both the 1989 and 1993 crashes were related to flight control software issues.[tpl]Sfn |Eden |2004 |p= 389[/tpl]
