Withernsea Lighthouse is an inland lighthouse that stands in the middle of the town of Withernsea in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England. The lighthouse stands 127 feet (38 m) high and took 18 months to build between 1892 and 1894. It is no longer active as a lighthouse and is now used as a museum.

The base of the lighthouse features RNLI and HM Coastguard exhibits, with models and old photographs. These record the history of ship-wrecks in the area and detail the Withernsea lifeboats and crews who saved 87 lives between 1862 and 1913. It also depicts the history of the nearby Spurn lifeboats.
The local history room has Victorian and Edwardian photos of the town including the pier and railway.
There is a Kay Kendall memorial to the 1950s film star, who was born in the town.
Views from the lamp room in the Withernsea Lighthouse are breathtaking, especially after climbing the 144 steps.
The lighthouse and adjoining lighthouse keepers' houses are now a Grade II listed building.
