==Reception==

The album received universal acclaim with Metacritic giving it a score of 85% from 10 reviews.Metacritic summary, accessed February 5, 2014 AllMusic awarded the album 4 stars and in its review by Thom Jurek, states "As an album, Ode reveals just how far this group has traveled together these past seven years. More importantly, it provides an exciting glimpse of what may lie on their collective horizon". PopMatters reviewer Will Layman said "Ode itself does not reach for epic dimension often, and that’s cool. It seems less like a manifesto or a film than like a very fine jazz album. Though the leading jazz pianists today are making lots of impressive statements about where the music is going, maybe creating a compelling album, old school, is still one of the music’s clearest callings. Ode fits the bill"Layman, W., PopMatters Review, April 9, 2012 The Observer's Dave Gelly commented "Mehldau is so brilliant at "recomposing" standards that his remarkable talent as a composer is often overlooked. Now, for his trio's first studio album in more than six years, he comes up with 11 absorbing new pieces".Gelly, D., Brad Mehldau Trio: Ode Review, The Observer, March 18, 2012 BBC Music's Martin Longley enthused "All three players are articulating a ceaseless stream of fresh ideas throughout this electrically energised session".Longley, M., Brad Mehldau Trio: Ode Review, BBC Music, accessed February 5, 2014 On All About Jazz, Ian Patterson noted "On Ode, Mehldau further refines the relationship between composed and improvised form, infusing improvisations with a melodic, pop-like simplicity. His continuing exploration of the art of the trio is one of the joys of the contemporary jazz panorama".Patterson, I., All About Jazz Review, May 5, 2012 JazzTimes reviewer Lloyd Sachs commented "Ode is the work of a trio that’s firing on all cylinders while sounding like it’s on cruise control".Sachs, L., Brad Mehldau Trio Ode Review, JazzTimes, November 2012
