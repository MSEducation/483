[[Feeder line (network)]]

CATEGORIES: Power engineering, Public transport, Network topology

A feeder line is a peripheral route or branch in a network, which connects smaller or more remote nodes with a route or branch carrying heavier traffic. The term is applicable to any system based on a hierarchical network
In telecommunications, a feeder line branches from a main line or trunk line.
In electrical engineering, a feeder line is a type of transmission line. In radio engineering, a feeder connects radio equipment to an antenna, usually open wire (air-insulated wire line) or twin-lead from a shortwave transmitter. In power engineering, a feeder line is part of an electric distribution network, usually a radial circuit of intermediate voltage.
The concept of feeder lines is also important in public transportation. The term is particularly used in US air travel and rail transport. Efficient, high-capacity routes connect important nodes while feeder lines connect these nodes to departure and destination points.
