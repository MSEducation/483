The International Martial Arts Federation (IMAF), established in Kyoto 1952, was the first international organisation after WWII to promote the development of martial arts worldwide. Today, IMAF includes kendo as one of the Japanese disciplines.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.imaf.com/faq.html| title= FAQ |publisher=International Martial Arts Federation (IMAF)[/tpl]
The International Kendo Federation (FIK) was founded in April 1970; it is an international federation of national and regional kendo federations and the world governing body for kendo.  The FIK is a non-governmental organisation, and its aim is to promote and popularise kendo, iaido and jodo.International Kendo Federation

==Practitioners==

Practitioners of kendo are called [tpl]Nihongo|kendōka|剣道家[/tpl], meaning "someone who practices kendo",[tpl]cite book| last = Allison| first = Nancy| title = The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Body-Mind Disciplines| url = http://books.google.com/?id=5199jcnbqwEC| year = 1999| publisher = Taylor & Francis | isbn = 978-0-8239-2546-9| page = 293 [/tpl] or occasionally [tpl]Nihongo|kenshi|剣士[/tpl], meaning "swordsman".[tpl]cite book| last = Tokeshi| first = Jinichi| title = Kendo: Elements, Rules, and Philosophy| url = http://books.google.com/?id=qJ4tXYnttP0C&pg=PA271| year = 2003| publisher = University of Hawaii Press| isbn = 978-0-8248-2598-0| page = 271 [/tpl] The old term of kendoists is sometimes used.[tpl]harvnb|Sasamori|Warner|1989|p=69[/tpl]
The "Kodansha Meibo" (a register of dan graded members of the All Japan Kendo Federation) shows that as of September 2007, there were 1.48 million registered dan graded kendōka in Japan. According to the survey conducted by the All Japan Kendo Federation, the number of active kendo practitioners in Japan is 477,000 in which 290,000 dan holders are included. From these figures, the All Japan Kendo Federation estimates that the number of "kendōka" in Japan is 1.66 million, with over 6 million practitioners worldwide, by adding the number of the registered dan holders and the active kendo practitioners without dan grade.[tpl]cite web|title=全国剣道人口調査の結果まとまる 平成20年05月号 |publisher=All Japan Kendo Federation|url= http://www.kendo.or.jp/column/250.html|date=March 2008|language=Japanese[/tpl]

==Concept and purpose==

In 1975, the All Japan Kendo Federation (AJKF) developed then published "The Concept and Purpose of Kendo" which is reproduced below.[ref]
</ref><ref>[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.kendo-fik.org/english-page/english-page2/concept-of-Kendo.htm| title=Concept of Kendo |publisher=All Japan Kendo Federation (AJKF)[/tpl]</ref>

===Concept===

Kendo is a way to discipline the human character through the application of the principles of the katana.

===Purpose===

==Equipment and clothing==

Kendo is practiced wearing a traditional Japanese style of clothing, [tpl]nihongo|protective armour|防具|bōgu[/tpl] and using one or, less commonly, two [tpl]nihongo|shinai|竹刀|shinai[/tpl].[ref]

===Equipment===

The shinai is meant to represent a Japanese sword (katana) and is made up of four bamboo slats, which are held together by leather fittings. A modern variation of a shinai with carbon fiber reinforced resin slats is also used.[tpl]harvnb|Sasamori|Warner|1964|p=70[/tpl]
Kendōka also use hard [tpl]nihongo|wooden swords|木刀|bokutō[/tpl] to practice kata.[tpl]harvnb|Sasamori|Warner|1964|p=52[/tpl]
Kendo employs strikes involving both one edge and the tip of the shinai or bokutō.
Protective armour is worn to protect specified target areas on the head, arms and body. The head is protected by a stylised helmet, called [tpl]nihongo||面|men[/tpl], with a [tpl]nihongo|metal grille|面金|men-gane[/tpl] to protect the face, a series of hard leather and [tpl]nihongo|fabric flaps|突垂れ|tsuki-dare[/tpl] to protect the throat, and padded [tpl]nihongo|fabric flaps|面垂れ|men-dare[/tpl] to protect the side of the neck and shoulders. The forearms, wrists, and hands are protected by long, thickly padded fabric gloves called [tpl]nihongo||小手|kote[/tpl]. The torso is protected by a [tpl]nihongo|breastplate|胴|dō[/tpl], while the waist and groin area is protected by the [tpl]nihongo||垂れ|tare[/tpl], consisting of three thick vertical fabric flaps or faulds.

===Clothing===

The clothing worn under the bōgu comprise a jacket (kendogi or keikogi) and hakama, a garment separated in the middle to form two wide trouser legs.[tpl]harvnb|Sasamori|Warner|1964|p=71[/tpl]
A [tpl]nihongo|cotton towel|手拭い|tenugui[/tpl] is wrapped around the head, under the men, to absorb perspiration and provide a base for the men to fit comfortably.

==Modern practice==

Kendo training is quite noisy in comparison to some other martial arts or sports.  This is because kendōka use a shout, or [tpl]nihongo||気合い|kiai[/tpl], to express their fighting spirit when striking. Additionally, kendōka execute [tpl]nihongo||踏み込み足|fumikomi-ashi[/tpl], an action similar to a stamp of the front foot, when making a strike.
Like some other martial arts, kendōka train and fight barefoot.  Kendo is ideally practiced in a purpose-built dōjō, though standard sports halls and other venues are often used. An appropriate venue has a clean and well-sprung wooden floor, suitable for fumikomi-ashi.
Modern kendo techniques comprise both strikes and thrusts. Strikes are only made towards specified [tpl]nihongo|target areas|打突-部位|datotsu-bui[/tpl] on the wrists, head, or body, all of which are protected by armour. The targets are men, sayu-men (sometimes called sayuno men) or yoko-men (upper left or right side of the men), the right kote at any time, the left kote when it is in a raised position, and the left or right side of the dō. [tpl]nihongo|Thrusts|突き|tsuki[/tpl] are only allowed to the throat. However, since an incorrectly performed thrust could cause serious injury to the opponent's neck, thrusting techniques in free practice and competition are often restricted to senior dan graded kendōka.

Once a kendōka begins practice in armour, a practice session may include any or all of the following types of practice.

==Techniques==

Techniques are divided into shikake-waza (to initiate a strike) and ōji-waza (a response to an attempted strike).
Kendoka who wish to use such techniques during practice or competitions, often practice each technique with a motodachi. This is a process that requires patience. First practising slowly and then as familiarity and confidence builds, the kendoka and motodachi increase the speed to match and competition level.

===Shikake-waza===

These attack techniques are used to create suki in an opponent by initiating an attack, or strike boldly when your opponent has created a suki. Such techniques include:
This is a technique used when one's opponent has weak kisei (spirit, vigour) or when they yield a suki under pressure. Always hold kisei and strike quickly.
Body and shinai will lose balance as you strike or when being attacked. This technique takes advantage of this to help execute a strike. A good example is Hikibana-kote, when a strike is made to an opponent's kote as they feel threatened and raise their kensen as you push forward.
This provides a surprise attack, by lifting the shinai over your shoulder before striking. Here a skilful use of the kensen and spirited attack is crucial for effective katsugi-waza or luring your opponent into breaking his/her posture.
There are two types. The first is for moving to the next waza after a failed first strike, and the second holds your opponent's attention and posture to create the suki for a second strike. The former requires a continuous rhythm of correct strikes. The latter requires continuous execution of waza, to take advantage of your opponent's suki.
This can be used if one's opponent's kamae has no suki when your opponent tries to attack. Your opponent's shinai is either knocked down from above or swept up from below with a resulting strike just when his/her kamae  is broken.
This technique involves striking your opponent as you realise he/she is about to strike. This is because their concentration will be on striking and their posture will have no flexibility to respond. Thus debana-waza is ideal. This can be to any part of your opponent's body, with valid strikes being: debana-men, debana-kote, and debana-tsuki.

===Oji-waza===

These counter-attack techniques are performed by executing a strike after responding or avoiding an attempted strike by your opponent. This can also be achieved by inducing the opponent to attack, then employing one of the oji-waza.
Avoiding an attack from another, then instantly responding. Here, timing has to be correct. A response that is too slow or fast will may not be effective. Therefore close attention to an opponent's every move is required.
If struck by an opponent's shinai, this technique sweeps up their shinai in a rising-slide motion, with the right(ura) or left(omote) side of the shinai. Then strike in the direction of their shinai, or at the suki resulting from their composure's collapse. This technique needs to be smooth. That is, don't separate the rising-slide motion and the upward-sweeping motion or it will not be successful. Valid strikes include: men-suriage-men, kote-suriage-men, kote-suriage-kote,and tsuki-suriage-men.
This waza knocks an opponent's shinai to the right or left. This neutralises a potential strike and gives the ideal chance to strike as an opponent is off-balance. For success, an opponent's maai has to be correctly perceived and then one knocks down their shinai before their arm fully extends. Valid examples are: do-uchiotoshi-men and tsuki-uchiotoshi-men.
This technique is a response. As an opponent strikes, you parry their shinai with yours. Then flip over (turn over your hands) and strike their opposite side. Valid strikes include:men-kaeshi-men, men-kaeshi-kote, men-kaeshi-do, kote-kaeshi-men, kote-kaeshi-kote, and do-kaeshi-men.

==Rules of Competition==

A scorable [tpl]nihongo|point|有効打突|yūkō-datotsu[/tpl] in a kendo competition (tai-kai)  is defined as an accurate strike or thrust made onto a datotsu-bui of the opponent's kendo-gu with the shinai making contact at its datotsu-bu, the competitor displaying high spirits, correct posture and followed by zanshin.[ref]
</ref>[tpl]Clarify|date=January 2014[/tpl]
Datotsu-bui or point scoring targets in kendo are defined as:[tpl]harvnb|FIK Regulations|2006|p=6[/tpl]
Datotsu-bu of the 'shinai' is the forward, or blade side (jin-bu) of the top third (monouchi) of the shinai.
[tpl]nihongo||残心|Zanshin[/tpl], or continuation of awareness, must be present and shown throughout the execution of the strike, and the kendōka must be mentally and physically ready to attack again.
In competition, there are usually three [tpl]nihongo|referees|審判|shinpan[/tpl]. Each referee holds a red flag and a white flag in opposing hands. To award a point, a referee raises the flag corresponding to the colour of the ribbon worn by the scoring competitor.  Usually at least two referees must agree for a point to be awarded. The match continues until a pronouncement of the point that has been scored.
Kendo competitions are usually a three point match. The first competitor to score two points, therefore wins the match. If the time limit is reached and only one competitor has a point, that competitor wins.
In the case of a tie, there are several options:

==International Kendo Competition==

The World Kendo Championships have been held every three years since 1970.  They are organised by the International Kendo Federation (FIK) with the support of the host nation's kendo federation.World Kendo Championships  The European championship is held every year, except in those years in which there is a world championship.http://www.ekf-eu.com/disci_page.cfm?type=3&disc=1 European Kendo Championships.  Kendo is also one of the martial arts in the World Combat Games.

==Advancement==

===Grades===

Technical achievement in kendo is measured by advancement in grade, rank or level. The [tpl]nihongo||級|kyū[/tpl] and [tpl]nihongo||段|dan[/tpl] grading system, created in 1883,[tpl]cite book| author = Active Interest Media, Inc.| title = Black Belt| url = http://books.google.com/?id=fdcDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA64| year = 1991| publisher = Active Interest Media, Inc.| page = 64 [/tpl] is used to indicate one's proficiency in kendo. The dan levels are from [tpl]nihongo|first-dan|初段|sho-dan[/tpl] to [tpl]nihongo|tenth-dan|十段|jū-dan[/tpl].  There are usually six grades below first-dan, known as kyu. The kyu numbering is in reverse order, with [tpl]nihongo|first kyu|一級|ikkyū[/tpl] being the grade immediately below first dan, and [tpl]nihongo|sixth kyu|六級|rokkyū[/tpl] being the lowest grade. There are no visible differences in dress between kendo grades; those below dan-level may dress the same as those above dan-level.[tpl]cite book | title = Standard Rules for Dan/Kyu Examination | publisher = International Kendo Federation |date=December 2006 | location = Tokyo, Japan [/tpl]
[tpl]nihongo|Eighth-dan|八段|hachi-dan[/tpl] is the highest dan grade attainable through a test of physical kendo skills.  In the AJKF the grades of [tpl]nihongo|ninth-dan|九段|kyū-dan[/tpl] and tenth-dan are no longer awarded, but ninth-dan kendōka are still active in Japanese kendo. International Kendo Federation (FIK) grading rules allow national kendo organisations to establish a special committee to consider the award of those grades.
All candidates for examination face a panel of examiners.  A larger, more qualified panel is usually assembled to assess the higher dan grades. Kendo examinations typically consist of jitsugi, a demonstration of the skill of the applicants, Nihon Kendo Kata and a written exam.  The eighth-dan kendo exam is extremely difficult, with a reported pass rate of less than 1 percent.http://www.kendo.or.jp

===Titles===

[tpl]nihongo|Titles|称号|shōgō[/tpl] can be earned in addition to the above dan grades by kendōka of a defined dan grade. These are [tpl]nihongo||錬士|renshi[/tpl], [tpl]nihongo||教士|kyōshi[/tpl], and [tpl]nihongo||範士|hanshi[/tpl]. The title is affixed to the front of the dan grade when said, for example [tpl]nihongo||錬士六段|renshi roku-dan[/tpl]. The qualifications for each title are below.

==Kata==

Kata are fixed patterns that teach kendoka the basic elements of swordsmanship.   The kata include fundamental techniques of attacking and counter-attacking, and have useful practical application in general kendo.  There are ten [tpl]nihongo||日本剣道形|Nihon Kendō Kata[/tpl].  These are generally practised with [tpl]nihongo|wooden swords|木刀|bokutō or bokken[/tpl]. Occasionally, real swords or swords with a blunt edge, called [tpl]nihongo||形用|kata-yō[/tpl] or [tpl]nihongo||刃引|ha-biki[/tpl], may be used for display of kata.[ref]
</ref>
All are performed by two people: the [tpl]nihongo||打太刀|uchidachi[/tpl], the teacher, and [tpl]nihongo||仕太刀|shidachi[/tpl], the student.  The uchidachi makes the first move or attack in each kata. As this is a teaching role, the uchidachi is always the losing side, thus allowing the shidachi to learn and to gain confidence.
Kata one to seven are performed with both partners using a normal length wooden sword. Kata eight to ten are performed with uchidachi using a normal length weapon and shidachi using a shorter one (kodachi).
The forms of the [tpl]nihongo||日本剣道形|Nihon Kendō Kata[/tpl] were finalised in 1933 based on the Dai nihon Teikoku Kendo Kata, composed in 1912.[tpl]cite book| last = Budden| first = Paul| title = Looking at a Far Mountain: A Study of Kendo Kata| year = 2000| publisher = Tuttle | isbn = 978-0-8048-3245-8| pages = 9, 12, 14 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=i5KxDxLttt0C&pg=PA9 |ref=harv[/tpl]  "It is impossible to link the individual forms of Dai nihon Teikoku Kendo Kata to their original influences, although the genealogical reference diagram does indicate the masters of the various committees involved, and it is possible from this to determine the influences and origins of Kendo and the Kata."[tpl]harvnb|Budden|2000|p=9[/tpl]
In 2003, the All Japan Kendo Federation introduced [tpl]nihongo||木刀による剣道基本技稽古法|Bokutō Ni Yoru Kendō Kihon-waza Keiko-hō[/tpl], a set of basic exercises using a bokuto. This form of practice, is intended primarily for kendōka up to [tpl]nihongo|second dan|二段|ni-dan[/tpl], but is very useful for all kendo students which are organised under FIK.
Kata can also be treated as competitions where players are judged upon their performance and technique.[tpl]cite web |title=Kendo Kata Taikai |publisher=British Kendo Association |url=http://www.kendo.org.uk/taikai-rules-kendo-kata-taikai/[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=Kendo Kata Taikai Rules |format=PDF |publisher=British Kendo Association |url=http://www.kendo.org.uk/files/2009KataTaikaiRules.pdf[/tpl]

==National and international organisations==

Many national and regional organisations manage and promote kendo activities outside Japan. The major organising body is the International Kendo Federation (FIK). The FIK is a non-governmental international federation of national and regional kendo organisations.  An aim of the FIK is to provide a link between Japan and the international kendo community and to promote and popularise kendo, iaido and jodo. The FIK was established in 1970 with 17 national federations. The number of affiliated and recognised organisations has increased over the years to 53 (as of February 2012).http://www.kendo-fik.org/english-page/english-page2/IKF-affiliates/IKF-affiliates.htm The FIK is  recognised by SportAccord as a 'Full Member'.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.sportaccord.com/en/members/ |title=SportAccord Members |publisher=SportAccord Members |deadurl=no |accessdate=17 September 2012[/tpl] and by the World Anti-Doping Agency.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.wada-ama.org/en/World-Anti-Doping-Program/Sports-and-Anti-Doping-Organizations/The-Code/Code-Acceptance/Outside-the-Olympic-Movement/ |title=Alliance of Members of Sportaccord |publisher=WADA |deadurl=no |accessdate=17 September 2012[/tpl]
Other organisations that promote the study of Japanese martial arts, including kendo, are the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai (DNBK) and the International Martial Arts Federation (IMAF).  The current DNBK has no connection to the pre-war organisation, although it shares the same goals.  The International Martial Arts Federation (IMAF) was established in Kyoto in 1952 and is dedicated to the promotion and development of the martial arts worldwide, including kendo.
