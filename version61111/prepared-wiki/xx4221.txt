==Etymology==

Hezekiah, more properly transliterated as Ḥizkiyyahu (and sometimes as Ezekias) (Hebrew: [tpl]hebrew|חִזְקִיָּ֫הוּ[/tpl] [tpl]unicode|Ḥizqiyyāhu[/tpl], Khizkiyahu; or [tpl]hebrew|יְחִזְקִיָּ֫הוּ[/tpl] [tpl]unicode|Yəḥizqiyyāhu[/tpl], Y'khizkiyahu); ; or Ḥizkiyyah (Hebrew: [tpl]hebrew|חִזְקִיָּ֫ה[/tpl] [tpl]unicode|Ḥizqiyyāh[/tpl]).  The root of the name [tpl]hebrew|חִזְקִיָּהוּ[/tpl] Ḥizkiyyahu is [tpl]hebrew|[/tpl]חזק, a verb stem that can mean -
It also spawns a number of nouns, including
as well as the adjectives
Accordingly, [tpl]hebrew|חִזְקִיָּהוּ[/tpl] Ḥizkiyyahu can be said to mean something like "Strengthened by Yahweh".http://messiahtruth.yuku.com/sreply/39873/t/-truth---claim----Jews--Jesus-wrote-----claim--Jesus---Messi.html Professor Mordochai ben Tzyyion, Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel

==Biblical sources==

The main account of Hezekiah's reign is found in [tpl]bibleverse|2|Kings|18-20|HE[/tpl], [tpl]bibleverse||Isaiah|36-39|HE[/tpl], and [tpl]bibleverse|2|Chronicles|29-32|HE[/tpl] of the Hebrew Bible. [tpl]bibleverse||Proverbs|25:1|HE[/tpl] mentions that it is a collection of King Solomon’s proverbs that were “copied” “by the officials of King Hezekiah of Judah”. His reign is also referred to in the books of the prophets Jeremiah, Hosea, and Micah. The books of Hosea and Micah record that their prophecies were made during Hezekiah’s reign.

===Reign over Judah===

According to the Hebrew Bible, Hezekiah assumed the throne of Judah at the age of 25 ([tpl]bibleverse|2|Chronicles|29:1|HE[/tpl]) and reigned for 29 years ([tpl]bibleverse|2|Kings|18:2|HE[/tpl]). Some writers have proposed that Hezekiah served as coregent with his father Ahaz for about 14 years in 729 BC. His sole reign is dated by Albright as 715 – 687 BC, and by Thiele as 716 – 687 BC (the last ten years being a co-regency with his son Manasseh).See William F. Albright for the former and for the latter Edwin R. Thiele's, The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings (3rd ed.; Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan/Kregel, 1983) 217. But Gershon Galil dates his reign to 697–642 BC.
Among Hezekiah's first acts was the repair of the Temple, which had been closed during the reign of Ahaz. He reorganized the services of the priests and Levites, purged the Temple and its vessels, and opened it with imposing sacrifices ([tpl]bibleverse|2|Chronicles|29:3-36|HE[/tpl]). He resolved to abolish idolatry from his kingdom, and among other things that he did to this end, he destroyed the high places (or bamot) and "bronze serpent" (or "Nehushtan"), recorded as being made by Moses according to the command of God ([tpl]bibleverse||Numbers|21:8|HE[/tpl]), which became an object of idolatrous worship. In place of this, he centralized the worship of God at the Jerusalem Temple. Hezekiah also resumed the Passover pilgrimage and the tradition of inviting the scattered tribes of Israel to take part in a Passover festival. He also sent messengers to Ephraim and Manasseh inviting them to Jerusalem for the celebration of the Passover. The messengers, however, were not only not listened to, but were even laughed at; only a few men of Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun came to Jerusalem. Nevertheless the Passover was celebrated with great solemnity and such rejoicing as had not been in Jerusalem since the days of Solomon.
Hezekiah is portrayed by the Hebrew Bible as a great and good king. He is one of the few kings praised so highly as to have “trusted in the Lord the God of Israel; so that there was no one like him among all the kings of Judah after him, or among those who were before him” ([tpl]bibleverse|2|Kings|18:5|HE[/tpl]).

===Family and life===

Hezekiah was the son of King Ahaz and Abijah ([tpl]bibleverse|2|Chronicles|29:1|HE[/tpl]). His mother, Abijah (also called Abi), was a daughter of the high priest Zechariah ([tpl]bibleverse|2|Kings|18:1-2|HE[/tpl]). Based on Thiele's dating, Hezekiah was born in c. 741 BC. He was married to Hephzi-bah. ([tpl]bibleverse|2|Kings|21:1|HE[/tpl]) He died from natural causes at the age of 54 in c. 687 BC, and was succeeded by his son Manasseh ([tpl]bibleverse|2|Kings|20:21|HE[/tpl]).

===Political moves and Assyrian invasion===

Between the death of the Assyrian king Sargon II, and the succession of his son Sennacherib, Hezekiah sought to throw off his subservience to the Assyrian kings. He ceased to pay the tribute imposed on his father, Ahaz, and "rebelled against the king of Assyria, and served him not," but entered into a league with Egypt ([tpl]bibleverse||Isaiah|30-31|HE[/tpl]; [tpl]bibleverse-nb||Isaiah|36:6-9|HE[/tpl]). Though Hezekiah expected the Egyptians to come to his aid, they did not come, and Hezekiah had to face the invasion of Judah by Sennacherib ([tpl]bibleverse|2|Kings|18:13-16|HE[/tpl]) in the 4th year of Sennacherib (701 BC). [tpl]bibleverse|2|Kings|19:35|HE[/tpl] records that during the siege the Angel of the Lord killed 185,000 Assyrian soldiers in a single night.
Hezekiah initially paid tribute to Assyria, but then rebelled.Peter J. Leithart, 1 & 2 Kings, Brazos Theological Commentary on the Bible, p255-256, Baker Publishing Group, Grand Rapids, MI (2006) The Assyrians recorded that Sennacherib lifted his siege of Jerusalem after Hezekiah acknowledged Sennacherib as his overlord and paid him tribute.Sennacherib's Hexagonal Prism The Hebrew Bible records that Hezekiah tried to pay off Sennacherib with three hundred talents of silver and thirty of gold as tribute, even despoiling the doors of the Temple to produce the promised amount, but, after the payment was made, Sennacherib renewed his assault on Jerusalem. ([tpl]bibleverse|2|Kings|18:14-16|HE[/tpl]) Sennacherib besieged Jerusalem and sent his Rabshakeh to the walls as a messenger.  
The Rabshakeh addressed the soldiers manning the city wall in Hebrew (Yĕhuwdiyth), asking them to distrust Yahweh and Hezekiah, pointing to Hezekiah's righteous reforms (destroying the High Places) as a sign that the people should not trust their king ([tpl]bibleverse|2|Kings|18:17-35|HE[/tpl]).  
The fundamental law in [tpl]bibleverse||Deuteronomy|12:1-32|HE[/tpl] prohibits sacrifice at every place except the Temple in Jerusalem.
[tpl]bibleverse|2|Kings|19:15|HE[/tpl] records that Hezekiah went to the Temple and there he prayed, the first king of Judah to do so in about 250 years, since the time of Solomon.

===Hezekiah's construction===

Hezekiah made at least two major preparations that would help Jerusalem to resist conquest: the construction of Hezekiah's Tunnel (also known as the Siloam Tunnel), and construction of the Broad Wall.
