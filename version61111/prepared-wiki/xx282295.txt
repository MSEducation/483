Greenhouse is a bar/restaurant at 100 St Georges Terrace in Perth, Western Australia.  Designed by Dutch-born florist, artist, builder and environmentalist Joost Bakker, and opened in 2009, it is a "quirky, eco-friendly restaurant" concept, which has been described as "... a breath of fresh air and a brilliant example of innovation in the restaurant sector."
As a concept, Greenhouse has a mission to improve vastly on the ways restaurants are created, to have better design, better operation, and to be "completely waste free from the ground up".  Amongst other things, Greenhouse "... has its vegetable garden on the roof, grinds its own organic flour, has walls made of hay bales and boasts a zero-carbon footprint."
The Greenhouse concept has also appeared, in temporary, "pop-up" restaurant form, at Federation Square in Melbourne in 2008-09, at Sydney Harbour in 2011, and at the Melbourne Food and Wine Festival in 2012. 
The head chef at Greenhouse is Matt Stone.  Both he and the restaurant have won a number of awards.  In 2010, Stone was named Best New Talent at the national Gourmet Traveller Awards; he has since been awarded Young Chef of the Year by The West Australian Good Food Guide in 2011 and 2012.
The restaurant was given a one star rating, and the award for Best New Restaurant of the Year, by The West Australian Good Food Guide 2011, and retained its one star rating for 2012 and 2013, but lost that rating for 2014.
Greenhouse also featured in an episode of MasterChef Australia series 5 in 2013.
