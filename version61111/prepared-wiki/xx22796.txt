However, migrants did not always travel long distances; many would simply travel to the next town or county.  No matter the distance, the Dust Bowl caused the proportion between migrants and residents to be nearly equal in the Great Plains states because of the high number of families that left their farms.

===Characteristics of migrants===

When James N. Gregory examined the Census Bureau statistics, as well as other surveys, he discovered some surprising percentages. For example, in 1939, the Bureau of Agricultural Economics surveyed the occupations of about 116,000 families who had arrived in California in the 1930s.  It showed that only 43 percent of southwesterners were doing farm work immediately before they migrated.  Nearly one-third of all migrants were professional or white-collar workers.Gregory, N. James. 1991. American Exodus: The Dust Bowl Migration and Okie Culture in California. Oxford University Press. The poor economy brought more than just farmers as refugees to California; many teachers, lawyers, and small business owners moved west with their families during this time.  After the Great Depression ended, some moved back to their original states, but many remained where they had started their new lives.  In fact, around one-eighth of California's population is of Okie heritage.Babb, Sanora, Dorothy Babb, and Douglas Wixson. "On the Dirty Plate Trail". Edited by Douglas Wixson.

==U.S. government response==

During President Franklin D. Roosevelt's first 100 days in office in 1933, governmental programs designed to conserve soil and restore the ecological balance of the nation were implemented. Interior Secretary Harold L. Ickes established the Soil Erosion Service in August 1933 under Hugh Hammond Bennett. In 1935, it was transferred and reorganized under the Department of Agriculture and renamed the Soil Conservation Service.  More recently, it has been renamed the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS).Steiner, Frederick (2008). The Living Landscape, Second Edition: An Ecological Approach to Landscape Planning, p. 188. Island Press. ISBN 1-59726-396-6. As part of New Deal programs, Congress passed the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act in 1936, requiring landowners to share the allocated government subsidies with the laborers who worked on their farms. Under the law, "benefit payments were continued as measures for production control and income support, but they were now financed by direct Congressional appropriations and justified as soil conservation measures. The Act shifted the parity goal from price equality of agricultural commodities and the articles that farmers buy to income equality of farm and non-farm population." Rau, Allan. Agricultural Policy and Trade Liberalization in the United States, 1934–1956; a Study of Conflicting Policies. Genève: E. Droz, 1957. p.81. Thus, the parity goal was to re-create the ratio between the purchasing power of the net income per person on farms from agriculture and that of the income of persons not on farms that prevailed during 1909–1914.
Additionally, the Federal Surplus Relief Corporation (FSRC) was created after more than six million pigs were slaughtered to stabilize prices. The pigs were sent to slaughterhouses and the meat packed and distributed to the poor and hungry. FDR in an Address on the AAA commented, "Let me make one other point clear for the benefit of the millions in cities who have to buy meats. Last year the Nation suffered a drought of unparalleled intensity. If there had been no Government program, if the old order had obtained in 1933 and 1934, that drought on the cattle ranges of America and in the corn belt would have resulted in the marketing of thin cattle, immature hogs and the death of these animals on the range and on the farm, and if the old order had been in effect those years, we would have had a vastly greater shortage than we face today. Our program – we can prove it – saved the lives of millions of head of livestock. They are still on the range, and other millions of heads are today canned and ready for this country to eat."
The FSRC diverted agricultural commodities to relief organizations.  Apples, beans, canned beef, flour and pork products were distributed through local relief channels.  Cotton goods were later included, to clothe the needy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/dustbowl/timeline/|title=The American Experience / Surviving the Dust Bowl / Timeline[/tpl]
In 1935, the federal government formed a Drought Relief Service (DRS) to coordinate relief activities.  The DRS bought cattle in counties which were designated emergency areas, for $14 to $20 a head.  Animals unfit for human consumption – more than 50 percent at the beginning of the program – were killed.  The remaining cattle were given to the Federal Surplus Relief Corporation (FSRC) to be used in food distribution to families nationwide.  Although it was difficult for farmers to give up their herds, the cattle slaughter program helped many of them avoid bankruptcy. "The government cattle buying program was a blessing to many farmers, as they could not afford to keep their cattle, and the government paid a better price than they could obtain in local markets."Monthly Catalog, United States Public Documents, By United States Superintendent of Documents, United States Government Printing Office, Published by G.P.O., 1938
President Roosevelt ordered the Civilian Conservation Corps to plant a huge belt of more than 200 million trees from Canada to Abilene, Texas to break the wind, hold water in the soil, and hold the soil itself in place. The administration also began to educate farmers on soil conservation and antierosion techniques, including crop rotation, strip farming, contour plowing, terracing, and other improved farming practices.[tpl]cite book|title=Texas|author=Federal Writers' Project|location=Writers' Program (Tex.)|publisher=Writers' Program Texas|page=16[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=Chronicles of Oklahoma|first=James Shannon|last=Buchanan|publisher=Oklahoma Historical Society|page=224[/tpl]  In 1937, the federal government began an aggressive campaign to encourage Dust Bowlers to adopt planting and plowing methods that conserved the soil.  The government paid the reluctant farmers a dollar an acre to practice one of the new methods.  By 1938, the massive conservation effort had reduced the amount of blowing soil by 65%.[tpl]Dubious|date=June 2011[/tpl] Nevertheless, the land failed to yield a decent living.  In the fall of 1939, after nearly a decade of dirt and dust, the drought ended, as regular rainfall finally returned to the region.
At the end of the drought, the programs which were implemented during these tough times helped to sustain a positive relationship between America's farmers and the federal government."A Cultural History of the United States – The 1930s". San Diego, California: Lucent Books, Inc., 1999, p.45.

==Long-term economic impact==

In many regions, over 75% of the topsoil was blown away by the end of the 1930s, but there was wide variation in the degree to which the land was degraded.  Aside from the short-term economic consequences caused by erosion, there were severe long-term economic consequences of the Dust Bowl.
By 1940, counties that had experienced the most significant levels of erosion saw a greater decline in agricultural land values. The per-acre value of farmland declined by 28% in high-erosion counties and 17% in medium-erosion counties, relative to land value changes in low-erosion counties.[tpl]cite web|last=Hornbeck|first= Richard| location = USA | title=The Enduring Impact of the American Dust Bowl: Short and Long-run Adjustments to Environmental Catastrophe| publisher= National Bureau of Economic Research|date=December 2009 | page= 3 | url = http://www.nber.org/papers/w15605.pdf| format = PDF | accessdate= March 1, 2011[/tpl]  Even over the long-term, the full agricultural value of the land often failed to recover.  In highly eroded areas, less than 25% of the original agricultural losses were recovered.  The economy adjusted predominantly through large relative population declines in more-eroded counties, both during the 1930s and through the 1950s.
The economic effects persisted, in part, because of farmers' failure to switch to more appropriate crops for highly eroded areas.  Because the amount of topsoil had been reduced, it would have been more productive to shift from crops and wheat to animals and hay.  During the Depression and through at least the 1950s, there was limited relative adjustment of farmland away from activities that became less productive in more-eroded counties.
Some of the failure to shift to more productive agricultural products may be related to ignorance about the benefits of changing land use.  A second explanation is a lack of availability of credit, caused by the high rate of failure of banks in the plains states.  Because banks failed in the Dust Bowl region with a higher rate of frequency than in the rest of the country, it was harder for farmers to gain access to the credit they needed to buy capital to shift crop production.[tpl]cite web| format = PDF | last= Landon-Lane|first= John| coauthors= Hugh Rockoff and Richard Steckel |title=Droughts, Floods, and Financial Distress in the United States|publisher=National Bureau of Economic Research|date=December 2009|page= 6|url= http://www.nber.org/papers/w15596.pdf |accessdate= March 1, 2011[/tpl]  Another reason is that profit margins to shift from a previously farmed crop to either animals or hay increased only slightly.  Therefore, even if they knew about the benefits of changing land usage, the incentive to switch immediately was relatively small.

==Influence on the arts==

The crisis was documented by photographers, musicians, and authors. Many were hired by various U.S. federal agencies during the Great Depression. The Farm Security Administration hired numerous photographers to document the crisis. This helped the careers of many artists, including Dorothea Lange.[tpl]cite web|title=Destitute Pea Pickers in California: Mother of Seven Children, Age Thirty-two, Nipomo, California. Migrant Mother|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/81/|publisher=World Digital Library|accessdate=February 10, 2013[/tpl]   She captured iconic images of the storms and migrant families, the most famous of which was a photograph entitled Destitute Pea Pickers in California. Mother of Seven Children., which depicted a gaunt-looking woman, Florence Owens Thompson, holding three of her children. This picture captured the horrors of the Dust Bowl and caused more people to be aware of the crisis of the country.
The work of independent artists, such as American novelist John Steinbeck's novels Of Mice and Men (1937) and The Grapes of Wrath (1939), and the music of folk singer Woody Guthrie, was also influenced by the crises of the Dust Bowl and the Depression.
Migrants leaving the Plains states took their music with them. Oklahoma migrants, in particular, were descended from rural Southerners and transplanted country music to California. Today, the "Bakersfield Sound" describes this blend, which developed after the migrants brought country music to the city. Their new music inspired a proliferation of country dance halls as far south as Los Angeles.
