The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) is a non-profit corporation created by an act of the United States Congress and funded by the United States federal government to promote public broadcasting. Between 15 and 20 percent of the aggregate revenues of all public broadcasting stations have been funded from federal sources, principally through the CPB.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cpb.org/stations/reports/revenue/2005PublicBroadcastingRevenue.pdf |title=Public Broadcasting Revenue Fiscal Year 2005 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-10-14[/tpl]  
The CPB was created on November 7, 1967, when U.S. president Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967. The new organization initially collaborated with the existing National Educational Television network. In 1969, the CPB talked to private groups to start the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS). In 1970, the CPB formed National Public Radio (NPR), a radio network consisting of public stations.
The CPB provides some funding for the PBS, NPR, and, to a lesser extent, for other broadcasters that are independent of those organizations. In more recent years, the CPB has started funding some Internet-based projects.

==Funding of and by the corporation==

The CPB's annual budget is composed almost entirely of an annual appropriation from Congress plus interest on those funds.[tpl]cite web |url= http://cpb.org/aboutcpb/#contentMain |title=About CPB |work=cpb.org |at=FINANCIAL INFORMATION |accessdate=October 13, 2012[/tpl] For fiscal year 2012, its appropriation was US$445.2 million, including $1M in interest earned). The distribution of these funds was as follows:Fiscal Year 2012 Operating Budget, Corporation for Public Broadcasting, accessed June 26, 2012

==Political composition of the CPB Board==

The CPB is governed by a board of directors consisting of nine members. They are selected by the President of the United States, confirmed by the Senate, and serve six-year terms. As of February 2011, the board was composed of three Republicans and three Democrats.Board of Directors of the CPB According to the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, the president cannot appoint persons of the same political party to more than five of the nine CPB board seats.[tpl]Contradiction-inline|date=September 2012[/tpl]
In 2004 and 2005, people from the PBS and NPR complained that the CPB was starting to push a conservative agenda.NPR's On the Media interview with Tomlinson, May 6, 2005NPR's On the Media follow-up, July 15, 2005 Board members replied that they were merely seeking balance. Polls of the PBS and NPR audiences in 2002 and 2003 indicated that few felt that the groups' news reports contained bias, and those that saw a slant were split as to which side they believed the reports favored.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl]
The charge of a conservative agenda came to a head in 2005. Kenneth Tomlinson, chair of the CPB board from September 2003 until September 2005, angered PBS and NPR supporters by unilaterally commissioning a conservative colleague to conduct a study of alleged bias in the PBS show NOW with Bill Moyers, and by appointing two conservatives as CPB Ombudsmen.CPB Memos Indicate Level of Monitoring, June 30, 2005 On November 3, 2005, Tomlinson resigned from the board, prompted by a report of his tenure by the CPB Inspector General, Kenneth Konz, requested by Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives. The report was made public on November 15. It states:
 We found evidence that the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) former Chairman violated statutory provisions and the Director’s Code of Ethics by dealing directly with one of the creators of a new public affairs program during negotiations with the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and the CPB over creating the show. Our review also found evidence that suggests “political tests” were a major criteria[tpl]sic[/tpl] used by the former Chairman in recruiting a President/Chief Executive Officer (CEO) for CPB, which violated statutory prohibitions against such practices.Corporation For Public Broadcasting, Office of Inspector General: Review of Alleged Actions Violating The Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, as Amended, Report No. EPB503-602, November 2006, page i 

==Objectivity and balance requirements==

The Public Broadcasting Act of 1967 requires the CPB to operate with a "strict adherence to objectivity and balance in all programs or series of programs of a controversial nature".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cpb.org/aboutpb/act/ |title=The Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, as amended |work=cpb.org |accessdate=October 13, 2012[/tpl] It also requires it to regularly review national programming for objectivity and balance, and to report on "its efforts to address concerns about objectivity and balance".
