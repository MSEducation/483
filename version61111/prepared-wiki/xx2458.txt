==Career==

Leary began working as a comedian in the Boston comedy scene of the 1980s at the underground club Play It Again Sam's. But his first real gig was at the Rascals Comedy Club as part of the TV show The Rascals Comedy Hour on October 18, 1990. He also wrote and appeared on a local comedy series, The Late, Late Show, hosted by his friend Lenny Clarke and written by Boston comedy writer Martin Olson. Leary and Clarke both spoke about their early affiliations and influences in the Boston comedy scene in the documentary film When Standup Stood Out (2006). It was during this time that he developed his stage persona. He also appeared in skits on the MTV game show Remote Control, playing such characters as Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones, the "brother" of co-host Colin Quinn, and artist Andy Warhol.
Leary first earned fame when he ranted about R.E.M. in an early 1990s MTV sketch. Several other commercials for MTV quickly followed, in which Leary would rant at high speeds about a variety of topics, playing off the then-popular and growing alternative scene. He released two records of his stand-up comedy: No Cure for Cancer (1993) and Lock 'n Load (1997). In late 2004, he released the EP Merry F#%$in' Christmas, which included a mix of new music, previously unreleased recordings, and some tracks from Lock 'n Load.
In 1993, his sardonic song about the stereotypical American male, "Asshole", achieved much notoriety.  However, this bit was allegedly stolen from Louie CK, discussed by Louie on an interview on the "Opie and Anthony Show". It was voted #1 in an Australian youth radio poll (the Triple J Hottest 100).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/hottest100_08/history/1993.htm |title=TripleJ Hottest 100 - 1993 |publisher=ABC Radio|location=Australia[/tpl] The song was used as part of the Holsten Pils series of ads in the UK, in which Leary was participating, with adapted lyrics criticizing a drunk driver.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkz12OslGhU |title=Denis Leary: 'He's An Asshole' - Anti-Drink Driving Campaign |publisher=YouTube |date=January 18, 2008 |accessdate=August 27, 2011[/tpl] The single was a minor hit there, peaking at No. 58 in the UK Singles Chart in January 1996.
Leary has appeared as an actor in over 40 movies, including The Sandlot, as Scott's stepfather Bill, Monument Ave., The Matchmaker, The Ref, Suicide Kings, Dawg, Wag the Dog, Demolition Man, Judgment Night, The Thomas Crown Affair, and Operation Dumbo Drop. He had a small part in Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers, playing a ranting inmate during a prison riot; his part was eventually cut, but can be seen on the Special Edition DVD. He has had the lead role in two television series, The Job and the FX cable-network series Rescue Me, of which he was also a co-creator. He played Tommy Gavin, a New York City firefighter dealing with alcoholism, family dysfunction and other issues in post-9/11 New York City. He received Emmy Award nominations in 2006 and 2007 for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for Rescue Me, and in 2008 for Outstanding Supporting Actor In A Miniseries Or A Movie for the HBO movie Recount.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/denis-leary |title=Denis Leary |publisher=Emmys.com |accessdate=December 1, 2012[/tpl] Leary was offered the role of Dignam in the 2006 film The Departed but turned it down due to scheduling conflicts with Rescue Me.
In addition, Leary has provided voices for characters in animated films, such as a fire-breathing dragon named Flame in the series The Agents, a pugnacious ladybug named Francis in A Bug's Life and a prehistoric saber-toothed tiger named Diego in the Ice Age film series. He has produced numerous movies, television shows, and specials through his production company, Apostle; these include Comedy Central's Shorties Watchin' Shorties, the stand-up special Denis Leary's Merry F#$%in' Christmas, and the movie Blow. As a Boston Red Sox fan, he narrated the official 2004 World Series film (Q Video/MLB Productions, 2004). In 2006, Leary and Lenny Clarke appeared on television during a Red Sox telecast and, upon realizing that Red Sox first baseman Kevin Youkilis is Jewish, delivered a criticism of Mel Gibson's antisemitic comments.[tpl]cite web | url=http://thetrack.bostonherald.com/moreTrack/view.bg?articleid=153220 | title=Leary & Clarke a big hit in Sox' out-of-control booth |last1=Fee | first1=Gayle | last2=Raposa |first2=Laura |date=August 17, 2006 | work=Boston Herald | accessdate=October 22, 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070929143727/http://thetrack.bostonherald.com/moreTrack/view.bg?articleid=153220  |archivedate = September 29, 2007[/tpl] As an ice hockey fan, Leary hosted the National Hockey League video NHL's Greatest Goals.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl] In 2003, he was the subject of the Comedy Central Roast of Denis Leary.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/leary_roast/index.jhtml|title=The Comedy Central Roast of Denis Leary Official Site -- Watch Denis Leary in the Hot Seat! |publisher=Comedy Central|accessdate=January 28, 2012[/tpl]

Leary describes himself as a Jack Kennedy Democrat with some conservative ideologies, such as support for the military. Leary told Glenn Beck, "I was a life-long Democrat, but now at my age, I've come to realize that the Democrats suck, and the Republicans suck, and basically the entire system sucks. But you have to go within the system to find what you want."[tpl]cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0707/04/gb.01.html|title=Honest Questions with Denis Leary|publisher=CNN|date=July 4, 2007|accessdate=April 26, 2010|first=Glenn|last=Beck[/tpl]
Leary has said of his religious beliefs, "I'm a lapsed Catholic in the best sense of the word. You know, I was raised with Irish parents, Irish immigrant parents. My parents, you know, prayed all the time, took us to Mass. And my father would sometimes swear in Gaelic. It doesn't get more religious than that. But, no, after a while, they taught us wrong. I didn't raise my kids with the fear of God. I raised my kids with the sense of, you know, to me, Jesus was this great guy...."

==Leary Firefighters Foundation==

On December 3, 1999, six firefighters from Leary's hometown of Worcester were killed in the Worcester Cold Storage Warehouse fire. Among the dead were Leary's cousin Jerry Lucey and his close childhood friend Lt. Tommy Spencer. In response, the comedian founded the Leary Firefighters Foundation. Since its creation in the year 2000, the foundation has distributed over $2.5 million (USD) to fire departments in the Worcester, Boston, and New York City areas for equipment, training materials, new vehicles, and new facilities. Leary won $125,000 for the foundation on the game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. Leary has close ties with 107.3/WAAF, which in 2000 released the station album Survive This! Part of the proceeds from this album were donated to the Leary Firefighters Foundation.
A separate fund run by Leary's foundation, the Fund for New York's Bravest, has distributed over $2 million to the families of the 343 firemen killed in the September 11 attacks in 2001 in addition to providing funding for necessities such as a new mobile command center, first responder training, and a high-rise simulator for the New York City Fire Department's training campus. As the foundation's president, Leary has been active in all of the fundraising, usually presenting large checks and donated equipment personally. The close relationship he has developed with the FDNY as well as with individual firefighters across the New York/New England area has resulted in Leary's most recent television show, Rescue Me, a comedy-drama on FX. In the pilot episode of the show, he is seen wearing a Leary Firefighter Foundation 9-11 Memorial T-shirt.
In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, Leary donated over a dozen boats to the New Orleans Fire Department to aid in rescue efforts in future disasters. The foundation also rebuilt entire NOLA firehouses.

==Controversy==

===Allegations of plagiarism===

For many years, Leary had been friends with fellow comedian Bill Hicks. When Leary's comedy album No Cure for Cancer was released, many people believed Leary had stolen Hicks' act and material. The friendship ended abruptly as a result.[tpl]cite book | title=Bill Hicks: Agent of Evolution |last1=Booth |first1=Kevin |last2=Bertin |first2=Michael | year=2005 | publisher=Harper Collins | isbn=0-00-719829-9[/tpl] In April 1993, the Austin Comedy News remarked on the similarities of Leary's performance, "Watching Leary is like seeing Hicks from two years ago. He smokes with the same mannerisms. (Hicks recently quit) He sports the same attitude, the same clothes. He touches on almost all of the same themes. Leary even invokes Jim Fixx." When asked about this, Hicks told the magazine, "I have a scoop for you. I stole his Leary's act. I camouflaged it with punchlines, and to really throw people off, I did it before he did".[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.gavinsblog.com/probill.htm | title=Profile: Bill Hicks | first=Doug |last=Stern |date=April 1993 | work=Austin Comedy News | accessdate=October 22, 2006[/tpl]
At least three stand-up comedians have gone on the record stating they believe Leary stole Hicks' material, comedic persona and attitude.[tpl]cite web | url=http://blog.joerogan.net/archives/92 | title=Carlos Mencia is a weak minded joke thief | first=Joe |last=Rogan | publisher=JoeRogan.net | date=September 27, 2005 | accessdate=December 21, 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite interview | last=Rogan | first=Joe | work=Playboy |date=October 2003[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.billhicks.com/darktimes/other/darktimes20/faq/faq.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060320081614/http://www.billhicks.com/darktimes/other/darktimes20/faq/faq.html | title=Dark Times: Bill Hicks: Frequently Asked Questions | first=Tim|last= McIntire | year=1998 | publisher=BillHicks.com | archivedate=October 11, 2006 | accessdate=October 28, 2006[/tpl] One similar routine was about the band Judas Priest, during which Hicks says, "I don't think we lost a cancer cure."[tpl]cite AV media | people=Hicks, Bill |year=1989 | title=Sane Man | medium=Stand-up comedy | location=USA | publisher=Roadrunner Records[/tpl]
During Leary's 2003 Comedy Central Roast, comedian Lenny Clarke, a friend of Leary's, said there was a carton of cigarettes backstage from Bill Hicks with the message, "Wish I had gotten these to you sooner." This joke was cut from the final broadcast.[tpl]cite news | last=Ziano III | first=Nick A. |title=Roasting a comic, they turn up the flames, gently | work=Boston Globe | url=http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/222/living/Roasting_a_comic_they_turn_up_the_flames_gently+.shtml | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030811054820/http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/222/living/Roasting_a_comic_they_turn_up_the_flames_gently+.shtml | archivedate=August 11, 2003 | date=August 10, 2003 [/tpl]
The feud is also mentioned in Cynthia True's biography American Scream: The Bill Hicks Story:
[tpl]bquote|Leary was in Montreal to host the "Nasty Show," at Club Soda, and Colleen was coordinating the talent so she was standing backstage when she heard Leary doing material that sounded incredibly similar to old Hicks riffs, including his perennial Jim Fixx joke: ("Keith Richards outlived Jim Fixx, the runner and health nut dude. The plot thickens."). When Leary came offstage, Colleen, more stunned than angry, said, "Hey, you know that's Bill Hicks' material! Do you know that's his material?" Leary stood there, stared at her without saying a word and briskly left the dressing room.[tpl]cite book | title=American Scream: The Bill Hicks Story | first=Cynthia |last=True | year=2002 | publisher=Harper Paperbacks | isbn=0-380-80377-1[/tpl][/tpl]
According to the book, True said upon hearing a tape of Leary's album No Cure for Cancer, "Bill was furious. All these years, aside from the occasional jibe, he had pretty much shrugged off Leary's lifting. Comedians borrowed, stole stuff and even bought bits from one another. Milton Berle and Robin Williams were famous for it. This was different. Leary had, practically line for line, taken huge chunks of Bill's act and recorded it."
In a 2008 appearance on The Opie and Anthony Show, comedian Louis CK claimed that Leary stole his "I'm an asshole" routine, which was then expanded upon and turned into a hit song by Leary.[tpl]cite video |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwhxqnCyoGo |title=Denis Leary ripped off "I'm An Asshole" from Louis CK |publisher=YouTube[/tpl] On a later episode of the same show, Leary challenged this assertion by claiming that he (Leary) co-wrote the song with Chris Phillips, ignoring CK's comment that he knows the song was written by Chris Phillips and the song was not what he was referencing.[tpl]cite video |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g81LCwrU-7k&feature=related |title=Denis Leary responds to Louis CK claiming he stole "I'm An Asshole" from him |work=Opie & Anthony Show |date=November 18, 2008 |accessdate=December 1, 2012 |publisher=YouTube[/tpl]

===Autism===

In his 2008 book Why We Suck: A Feel Good Guide to Staying Fat, Loud, Lazy and Stupid, Leary said:
In response to the controversy, Leary stated that the quote was taken out of context and that in that paragraph he had been talking about the trend of unwarranted overdiagnosis of autism, which he attributed to American parents seeking an excuse for behavioral problems and underperformance. Later, he apologized to parents with autistic children whom he had offended.
