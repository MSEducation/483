The initial line-up was Siddall on guitar and vocals with Lisa Harker on bass and Katie James on drums.Mason, Stewart "The Lodger Biography", allmusic, Macrovision Corporation After 3 sold-out limited 7"s ("Many Thanks For Your Honest Opinion" on Dance to the Radio, "Watching" on Double Dragon, and "Let Her Go" on Angular Records) and touring around the UK and Europe with bands such as The Long Blondes and The Research, the group released their debut album Grown-Ups, produced by Alan Smyth and James Ford, in June 2007 on Angular Records in the UK, Slumberland Records in the US, Fabtone in Japan and Speak N Spell in Australia.
