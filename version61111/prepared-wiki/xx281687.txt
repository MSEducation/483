The zoo received accreditation in the year 2000 from Canadian Association of Zoos and Aquariums, and remains the only accredited reptile zoo in Canada to date. It has also been a registered non-profit organization since 2009.

==Attractions==

The Indian River Reptile Zoo is host to more than 200 different reptiles. While some of the reptiles are of species which are native to Canada, there is also large number of species which are native to other parts of the world. The zoo is also known for its popular rattlesnake exhibit, which is also the largest in Canada.

==Conservation==

Although the zoo offers visitors the opportunity to see a wide range of reptiles, much of its focus is also on the preservation and conservation of all reptile species. This effort includes staffing of highly trained and passionate zoo keepers who help educate the public and spread awareness, as well as various ongoing conservation programs.
