The Fraser alphabet or Old Lisu Alphabet is an artificial script invented around 1915 by Sara Ba Thaw, a Karen preacher from Myanmar, and improved by the missionary James O. Fraser, to write the Lisu language. It is a single-case (unicameral) alphabet.
The alphabet uses uppercase letters from the Latin script, and rotated versions thereof, to write consonants and vowels. Tones and nasalization are written with Roman punctuation marks, identical to those found on a typewriter. Like the Indic abugidas, the vowel [tpl]IPA|a[/tpl] is not written. However, unlike those scripts, the other vowels are written with full letters.
The Chinese government recognized the alphabet in 1992 as the official script for writing in Lisu.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2007[/tpl]

==Consonants==

Note: You may need to download a Lisu capable Unicode font if not all characters display.

==Vowels==

For example, [tpl]angle bracket|ꓝ[/tpl] is [tpl]IPA|tsɑ̄[/tpl], while [tpl]angle bracket|ꓝꓰ[/tpl] is [tpl]IPA|tsē[/tpl].

==Tones==

Tones are written with standard punctuation. Lisu punctuation therefore differs from international norms: the comma is [tpl]angle bracket|꓾[/tpl] (hyphen period), and the full stop is [tpl]angle bracket|꓿[/tpl] (equal sign).
The tones [tpl]angle bracket|ꓸ[/tpl], [tpl]angle bracket|ꓹ[/tpl], [tpl]angle bracket|ꓺ[/tpl], [tpl]angle bracket|ꓻ[/tpl] may be combined with [tpl]angle bracket|ꓼ[/tpl] and [tpl]angle bracket|ꓽ[/tpl] as compound tones. However, the only one still in common use is [tpl]angle bracket|ꓹꓼ[/tpl].
The apostrophe indicates nasalization. It is combined with tone marks.
The understrike (optionally a low macron) indicates the Lisu "A glide", a contraction of [tpl]IPA|ɑ̂[/tpl] without an intervening glottal stop. The tone is not always falling, depending on the environment, but is written [tpl]angle bracket|ˍ[/tpl] regardless.

==Unicode==

The Fraser alphabet was added to the Unicode Standard in October, 2009 with the release of version 5.2.
The Unicode block for the Fraser alphabet, called Lisu, is U+A4D0–U+A4FF:
