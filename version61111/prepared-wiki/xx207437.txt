EA-3167 is a potent and long lasting anticholinergic deliriant drug, related to the chemical warfare agent 3-Quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB). It was developed under contract to Edgewood Arsenal during the 1960s as part of the US military chemical weapons program, in an attempt to develop non-lethal incapacitating agents. EA-3167 has identical effects to QNB, but is even more potent and longer lasting, with an effective dose when administered by injection of as little as 2.5μg/kg (i.e. 0.2 milligrams for an 80kg person), and a duration of 120-240 hours (5-10 days).[tpl] cite book | url = http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=740&page=195 | author = Wills H | chapter = Appendix I: Digest Report -- Anticholinergic Chemicals | title = Possible Long-Term Health Effects of Short-Term Exposure to Chemical Agents | volume = 1 | year = 1982 | editor = National Research Council (U.S.).
