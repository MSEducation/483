[[List of constitutions of Mexico]]

CATEGORIES: Mexican law, Constitutions of Mexico

Since declaring independence in 1810, Mexico has adopted a number of constitutions or other documents of basic law with constitutional effects. Not all these can be considered constitutions, and not all of them enjoyed universal application. Those  enacted in  1824, 1857, and 1917 are generally considered full-fledged, operational constitutions.
