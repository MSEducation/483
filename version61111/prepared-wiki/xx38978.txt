Georg Fabricius (23 April 1516 – 17 July 1571), born Georg Goldschmidt, was a Protestant German poet, historian and archaeologist.

==Life==

Fabricius was born in Chemnitz in Saxony and educated at Leipzig. Travelling in Italy with one of his pupils, he made an exhaustive study of the antiquities of Rome. He published the results in his Roma (1550), in which the correspondence between every discoverable relic of the old city and the references to them in ancient literature was traced in detail. In 1546 he was appointed rector of Saint Afra in Meissen.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.theodora.com/encyclopedia/f/georg_fabricius.html |title=Georg Fabricius |work=Encyclopædia Britannica 1911 |accessdate=23 April 2013[/tpl]
In 1549 Fabricius edited the first short selection of Roman inscriptions specifically focusing on legal texts. This was a key moment in the history of classical epigraphy: for the first time in print a humanist explicitly demonstrated the value of such archaeological remains for the discipline of law, and implicitly accorded texts inscribed in stone as authoritative status as those recorded in manuscripts.
In his sacred poems he affected to avoid every word with the slightest savour of paganism; and he blamed the poets for their allusions to pagan divinities.
Fabricius died at Meissen.
