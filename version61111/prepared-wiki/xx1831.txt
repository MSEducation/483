The Chief Minister of the Northern Territory is the head of government of the Northern Territory.  He is the equivalent of a Premier in a state.  
He is formally appointed by the Administrator, who in normal circumstances will appoint the head of whatever party holds the majority of seats in the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory. In times of constitutional crisis, the Administrator can appoint someone else as Chief Minister.  However, this has never occurred.
The incumbent Chief Minister of the Northern Territory is Adam Giles, representing the Country Liberal Party.
