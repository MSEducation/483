==Early career/Stiltskin==

Wilson started off in a band called Guaranteed Pure in the 1990, which featured himself along with Paul Holmes (keyboards), Steve Wilson (guitars), John Haimes (bass) and Chris Cavanagh (drums).http://rateyourmusic.com/artist/guaranteed_pure They released an album called Swing Your Bag, the title track of which was included on a compilation album on the label of Fish entitled The Funny Farm Project : Outpatients '93.http://www.worldofgenesis.com/Biography-RayWilson.htm He then joined Stiltskin; they released one album and had a number one hit in the UK with the single "Inside".

==Genesis==

Wilson is probably best known as the lead singer of Genesis from 1996 to 1998, after Phil Collins officially departed in March 1996. Founding Genesis members Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford were handed a CD of the Stiltskin album The Mind's Eye from Virgin Records executives. They were very impressed with Wilson's vocal abilities and had their manager, Tony Smith, call him for an audition. Wilson was officially announced as the new lead singer of Genesis in early June 1997. Their only album with Wilson, ...Calling All Stations..., was released that September and became a top 10 hit worldwide, except for the U.S. where it reached #54 on the Billboard 200 album charts. The album was re-issued in 2007. Genesis toured Europe in the winter and spring of 1998, but the American leg was cancelled due to low ticket sales.  After the commercial failure of the album, the band announced they would go on an extended hiatus. In May of 2001, during an exclusive interview with Dave Negrin for website WorldofGenesis.com, Wilson said, "They basically phoned me up and said, “Ray, we’re not continuing.” I’ve never really felt that I was out of the band as such; it’s just that the band doesn’t exist anymore (laughs).  When I heard that, it was just after the Cut tour, about a year and a half ago. I’ve read some articles saying that I was fired and stuff, but to be fair to them, they didn’t phone me up and say, “Ray, you’re fired. We’re going to carry on and we’re going to get somebody else to sing.” Or, “We’re going to carry on and get Phil back.” There was never any of that. They just said, “We’ve decided not to continue because the market doesn’t want us.” I think they didn’t want to completely close the door to ever doing anything again." Wilson, R. (2001, May 29).
