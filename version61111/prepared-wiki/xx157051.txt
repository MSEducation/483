==Background==

In an interview with the Houston Chronicle, Walker stated about the album, "There's no safety net in this music, I’m dangerous right now because I feel I've got nothing to lose. I'm coming out swinging."[ref]Clark, Michael D. Houston Chronicle 
For the record: `A Few Questions' from Clay Walker (26 June 2003)[/ref] In an interview with The Arizona Daily Star Walker said, "I feel like it is by far the most important album of my career, this is without a question the best record I've ever made. Everything just clicked for me in the studio, everywhere. It clicked in looking for the songs. The photo shoot went great. It just seemed like everything fell in place. It seemed natural."Burch Cathalena E. The Arizona Daily Star Clay has elements of platinum as well (27 June 2003)
In another interview prior to the album's release, Walker mentioned, "I think I enjoy myself even more now and I realize that it's important to make great music, the best you can, it's what the fans deserve."Prep-Nashville Notes Broadcast News (25 February 2004) Walker mentioned in an interview with Country Weekly, "This is the most introspective album I've ever made. It really gives people a good look at me - and what I'm thinking. I'm so proud of this record. I've had apprehensions on previous albums. I was fearful that people wouldn't like certain songs. I can honestly say I have no fears about any song on this CD. All of them fit me really well and there's not one thing I would do differently on any song. The album is absolutely the best I can do at this point in my life. I feel like I'm singing better than I ever have. There's a lot of maturity and strength in my voice."Holden, Larry Country Weekly Questions and Answers October 9th 2003
Walker told The Dallas Morning News, "I love soul music, one of my favorite songs of all time is Earl Thomas Conley's 'Holding Her and Loving You.' I recorded that on my Live, Laugh, Love album. That was the beginning of me finding myself in the studio. This record captures that. It embodies it from beginning to end. It's not just one song this time. I finally made a record that I can look back on and say I wouldn't change a ... thing. The lyrics are part of who I am. I really can't think of many lines in these songs that don't fit me."Tarradell, Mario The Dallas Morning News The molding of Clay A look at the things shaping Walker's outlook and career. (March 26, 2004) Walker told Country France, "The RCA album is by far the most diverse album that I’ve ever made and it gives people a really good look at what I’m about. I think this album probably symbolizes me best. This album is very special." He also stated, "In the new RCA album there’s a lot of emotion and a lot of my heart went into this album and it’s something that I think I’ll look back on in 10, 20 years and say, “I’m really proud of that particular one”. And you hope that each album you make is better than the last, but this one would definitely make a statement. It will be different from the albums that we made before in some ways. There are some songs that I think will definitely get a rise out of people."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.country-france.fr/VIP/ClayWalker/indexUS.html |title=Clay Walker - Interview exclusif |language=[tpl]fr icon[/tpl] |publisher=Country-france.fr |date= |accessdate=2011-08-03[/tpl]
During another interview with Country Weekly Walker stated, "I've had a great ride, but by no means do I feel like I'm finished. I've got a lot to prove. Great quarterbacks don't get good until their seventh or eighth year. So this is my seventh album. I'm thinking, 'Hey, I know the plays, I know the defenses -- I can throw it deep if I want to!" Walker also said, "The wolves will always eat the weak ones. But they better bring a big damn plate if they're gonna eat me!"Country Weekly Going Deep - Surviving MS and the turmoil of the music biz, Clay Walker is back and on top of his game (August 12, 2003)

==Critical reception==

Ralph Novak of People Magazine gave the album 2 and a half stars and wrote "The singer ponders a bit too much for his own good."Novak, Ralph. "A Few Questions (Music)." People 60.16 (2003): 54. Academic Search Complete. EBSCO. Web. 14 Apr. 2011.
Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the album a mixed review writing " A Few Questions is a great success, but at its core, it just doesn't feel like a Clay Walker album, even if it is likely the start of the second phase of Walker's career, the phase where he is no longer a new traditionalist and is now an unabashed radio guy."[tpl]cite web|last=Thomas |first=Stephen |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/a-few-questions-r655944/review |title=A Few Questions - Clay Walker |publisher=AllMusic |date=2003-09-09 |accessdate=2011-08-03[/tpl]
Mandy Davis of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch also gave the album a mixed review writing, "Walker picks some solid material that meshes well with his twangy voice on songs such as "I'm in the Mood for You" and "I Don't Want to Know." But with 13 cuts on the CD, mediocre tracks such as "Sweet Sun Angel" and "Heaven Leave the Light On" drag the album down.Davis, Mandy St. Louis Post-Dispatch CD Review - Clay Walker (11 September 2003) USA Today gave the album two stars out of five and wrote "With his track record of hits, why can't this guy find better material?"USA Today After five years, Seal breaks the surface again ; And June Carter Cash's final album blossoms (9 September 2003) Jack Leaver of The Grand Rapids Press gave the album two and a half stars and wrote "As Walker begins what appears to be a second phase of his career, longtime fans will welcome him back, and the singer should pick up a few new ones on the way."Leaver, Jack The Grand Rapids Press Dido's new tunes are fine, as far as they go (8 October 2003)
About.com gave the album a positive review and wrote, "It's been a while since Clay has been on top of the charts, and with the songs from "A Few Questions," I think that's just where we'll be seeing him once more."[tpl]cite web|url=http://countrymusic.about.com/cs/productreviews/gr/aaprafewquest.htm |title=A Few Questions - Clay Walker |publisher=Countrymusic.about.com |date=2011-02-24 |accessdate=2011-08-03[/tpl]  Dan MacIntosh of Country Standard Time gave the album a negative review and wrote, "Before putting this release out, Walker's people should have given him a few more musical challenges. As it stands, "A Few Questions" finds Clay Walker sleep walking through a series of dreamy, yet unmemorable, tracks."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/cdreview.asp?xid=565 |title=Clay Walker - A Few Questions |publisher=Countrystandardtime.com |date=2007-10-23 |accessdate=2011-08-03[/tpl] Mario Tarradell of The Dallas Morning News gave the album a B+ rating and wrote,  "He's stretching vocally during a batch of songs that explore spirituality, the limits of love and the simple life. Tried-and-true subjects, but Mr. Walker's committed vocal performances help keep them fresh and passionate. A Few Questions plays like Mr. Walker has most of the answers."Tarradell, Mario The Dallas Morning News CD Briefs (September 7, 2003) Editors at CMT wrote, "Is the record any good? Yeah, it sure is, in that polished, radio-ready, crowd-pleasing kind of way. But even that approach is easy to screw up. Of course, no comeback is complete without a rambunctious song about country life, which in this case would be "Countrified."CMT New Releases: Covering Cline's Classics (September 9, 2003)
