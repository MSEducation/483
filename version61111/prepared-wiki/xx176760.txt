==History==

In 1858, a community and gristmill was established about a mile and a half east of the present town of Shedd and called Boston, probably because one of the founders came from Boston, Massachusetts.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.oregon.gov/OPRD/PLANS/docs/masterplans/TMillsFinalPlanSept06Web.pdf |title=Thompson's Mills State Heritage Site Master Plan |publisher=Oregon Parks and Recreation Department |accessdate=2008-01-01[/tpl] Boston was platted in 1861 with a New England-style town square.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.registerguard.com/csp/cms/sites/dt.cms.support.viewStory.cls?cid=40107&sid=40&fid=2 |last=Sullivan |first=William |authorlink=William L.

Efforts to get the Oregon and California Railroad, which was being built south from Albany, to come through Boston Mills were unsuccessful. When the railroad was instead built through the nearby town of Shedd's Station in 1871, the post office was moved and the name changed to Shedds, after Captain Frank Shedd, on whose land the community was started. All of Boston's buildings, except the mill itself, were also moved west to the railroad. In 1899 the railroad changed the name of the station to Shedd, but the name of the post office didn't change until 1915.
East of Shedd at the former site of Boston Mills, on the Calapooia River, is the National Register of Historic Places-listed Boston Flour Mill (aka Thompson's Flouring Mill), Oregon's oldest continuously operating water powered mill, part of Thompson's Mills State Heritage Site.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.prd.state.or.us/news.php?id=988 |title=Newest state park to open |date=December 4, 2007 |publisher=Oregon Parks and Recreation Department |accessdate=2008-01-01[/tpl] It is one of the four remaining gristmills in the state, and one of only two mills still in operation.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bostonmill.org/ |title=Boston Mill Society |accessdate=2008-01-01[/tpl]
