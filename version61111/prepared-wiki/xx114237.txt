[[Sevenhill, South Australia]]

CATEGORIES: Towns in South Australia, Mid North (South Australia)

The town of Sevenhill (postcode 5453) is in the Clare Valley region of South Australia, approximately 130Â km north of Adelaide. It was settled by the Austrian Jesuit Fathers and Brothers in 1848. The name is taken from the reference to the seven hills of Rome.

==History==

The first settlers in the area were the Jesuits and the Prussian-born population who later established themselves at their property at Hill River, now adjoining Pikes Winery. Francis Weikert donated land for the first Jesuits to establish the current Saint Aloysius Church and Sevenhill Winery. Weikert is buried in the Sevenhill cemetery. It was from these first settlers that the vine rootlings were established, allowing the current winery industry to flourish in the Region.

==Railway==

A railway line was built from Riverton to Clare in 1919 and on to Spalding in 1922.  It closed in 1974 and the tracks were removed in the 1980s, but the alignment now carries the Riesling Trail bike route.

==The town today==

The Sevenhill township supports a hotel, Regional Cellar Door (showcasing wines from more than a dozen boutique producers, gourmet bakery, homewares shop, several bed and breakfast cottages, a CFS station and an antique shop.

The town's oval is found east of the main cross road and has toilet facilities. It supports a cricket team during the summer months and tennis facilities are also located here.
