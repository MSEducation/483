[[CNTN4]]

Contactin-4 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the CNTN4 gene.[tpl]cite journal | author = Yoshihara Y, Kawasaki M, Tamada A, Nagata S, Kagamiyama H, Mori K | title = Overlapping and differential expression of BIG-2, BIG-1, TAG-1, and F3: four members of an axon-associated cell adhesion molecule subgroup of the immunoglobulin superfamily | journal = J Neurobiol | volume = 28 | issue = 1 | pages = 51–69 |date=Mar 1996 | pmid = 8586965 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1002/neu.480280106 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Zeng L, Zhang C, Xu J, Ye X, Wu Q, Dai J, Ji C, Gu S, Xie Y, Mao Y | title = A novel splice variant of the cell adhesion molecule contactin 4 ( CNTN4) is mainly expressed in human brain | journal = J Hum Genet | volume = 47 | issue = 9 | pages = 497–9 |date=Aug 2002 | pmid = 12202991 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1007/s100380200073 [/tpl][tpl]cite web | title = Entrez Gene: CNTN4 contactin 4| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=152330| accessdate = [/tpl]

==Genomics==

The gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 3 (3p26.3). It is a single copy gene within the Watson (plus) strand, 957,399 bases in length and encodes a protein of  1026 amino acids (molecular weight 113.454 kDa)

==Clinical relevance==

Abnormal expression of this gene has been implicated in some cases of autism.http://www.newsdaily.com/stories/n18220544-autism-genes/ It has also been associated with cerebellar degeneration in spinocerebellar ataxia type 16.
