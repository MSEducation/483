While clearing a decades-old Hawaii firing range in 2005, workers found depleted uranium fins from training rounds from the formerly classified Davy Crockett recoilless gun tactical battlefield nuclear delivery system from the 1960s and 1970s.[ref]
[tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl][/ref] These training rounds had been forgotten because they were used in a highly classified program and had been fired before DU had become an item of interest, more than 20 years before the Gulf War.

===Production and availability===

Natural uranium metal contains about 0.71% U-235, 99.28% U-238, and about 0.0054% U-234. In order to produce enriched uranium, the process of isotope separation removes a substantial portion of the U-235 for use in nuclear power, weapons, or other uses. The remainder, depleted uranium, contains only 0.2% to 0.4% U-235. Because natural uranium begins with such a low percentage of U-235, enrichment produces large quantities of depleted uranium. For example, producing 1 kg of 5% enriched uranium requires 11.8 kg of natural uranium, and leaves about 10.8 kg of depleted uranium with only 0.3% U-235 remaining.
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) defines depleted uranium as uranium with a percentage of the 235U isotope that is less than 0.711% by weight (see 10 CFR 40.4). The military specifications designate that the DU used by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) contain less than 0.3% 235U (AEPI, 1995). In actuality, DoD uses only DU that contains approximately 0.2% 235U (AEPI, 1995).
Depleted Uranium is also produced by recycling 'spent' nuclear fuel,Depleted uranium WHO Fact sheet N°257, Revised January 2003 in which case it contains traces of Pu and NpPlutonium in DU Weapons, a Chronology Dr. Michael Repacholi, WHO and has therefore been called 'dirty DU'U.S. Dirty Bombs: Radioactive Gene Busting Munitions Spiked with Plutonium John M.

===Uranium hexafluoride===

Some depleted uranium produced is stored as uranium hexafluoride, a crystalline solid, (D)UF6, in steel cylinders in open air storage yards close to enrichment plants. Each cylinder holds up to 12.7 tonnes (or 14 short tons) of UF6. In the U.S. 560,000 tonnes of depleted UF6 had accumulated by 1993. In 2008, 686,500 tonnes in 57,122 storage cylinders were located near Portsmouth, Ohio and Paducah, Kentucky.How much depleted uranium hexafluoride is stored in the United States, anl.gov[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.ead.anl.gov/uranium/documents/index.cfm |title=Depleted UF6 Management Program Documents |publisher=Web.ead.anl.gov |date= |accessdate=4 September 2013[/tpl]
The storage of DUF6 presents environmental, health, and safety risks because of its chemical instability. When UF6 is exposed to water vapor in the air, it reacts with the moisture to produce UO2F2 (uranyl fluoride), a solid, and HF (hydrogen fluoride), a gas, both of which are highly soluble and toxic. The uranyl fluoride solid acts to plug the leak, limiting further escape of depleted UF6. Release of the hydrogen fluoride gas to the atmosphere is also slowed by the plug formation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.ead.anl.gov/uranium/faq/storage/faq21.cfm |title=What happens if a cylinder of uranium hexafluoride leaks? |publisher=Web.ead.anl.gov |date= |accessdate=4 September 2013[/tpl] Storage cylinders are regularly inspected for signs of corrosion and leaks, and are repainted and repaired as necessary.http://web.ead.anl.gov/uranium/pdf/DUF6MgmtOverviewFS.PDF, Overview of Depleted Uranium Hexafluoride Management Program
A tenfold jump in uranium prices has transformed approximately one-third of the U.S. depleted uranium inventory into an asset worth $7.6 billion, assuming DOE re-enriches the tails. This estimate is based on February 2008 market price for uranium and enrichment services, and DOE's access to sufficient uranium enrichment capacity.Agency review nuclear waste, Cibola County Beacon – News, April 3, 2008
There have been several accidents involving uranium hexafluoride in the United States, including one in which 32 workers were exposed to a cloud of UF6 and its reaction products. 1 person died, and while a few workers with higher exposure experienced short-term kidney damage (e.g., protein in the urine), none of them showed lasting damage from the exposure to uranium.[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.ead.anl.gov/uranium/faq/health/faq30.cfm |title=FAQ 30-Have there been accidents involving uranium hexafluoride? |publisher=Web.ead.anl.gov |date= |accessdate=4 September 2013[/tpl] The U.S. government has been converting DUF6 to solid uranium oxides for use or disposal.[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.ead.anl.gov/uranium/faq/storage/faq22.cfm |title=FAQ 22-What is going to happen to the uranium hexafluoride stored in the United States? |publisher=Web.ead.anl.gov |date= |accessdate=4 September 2013[/tpl] Such disposal of the entire DUF6 inventory could cost anywhere from $15 million to $450 million.[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.ead.anl.gov/uranium/faq/mgmt/faq27.cfm |title=FAQ 27-Are there any currently-operating disposal facilities that can accept all of the depleted uranium oxide that would be generated from conversion of DOE's depleted UF6 inventory? |publisher=Web.ead.anl.gov |date= |accessdate=4 September 2013[/tpl]

==Military applications==

Depleted uranium is very dense; at 19,050 kg/m³, it is 1.67 times as dense as lead, only slightly less dense than tungsten and gold, and 84% as dense as osmium or iridium, which are the densest known substances under standard (i.e., Earth-surface) pressures. Consequently a DU projectile of given mass has a smaller diameter than an equivalent lead projectile, with less aerodynamic drag and deeper penetration due to a higher pressure at point of impact. DU projectile ordnance is often inherently incendiary because of its pyrophoric property.US Dept. of Energy Handbook, "Primer on Spontaneous Heating and Pyrophoricity", Chapter "Uranium"

===Armor plate===

Because of its high density, depleted uranium can also be used in tank armor, sandwiched between sheets of steel armor plate. For instance, some late-production M1A1HA and M1A2 Abrams tanks built after 1998 have DU reinforcement as part of the armor plating in the front of the hull and the front of the turret, and there is a program to upgrade the rest (see Chobham armor).

===Nuclear weapons===

Depleted uranium is used as a tamper in fission bombs.

===Ammunition===

Most military use of depleted uranium has been as 30 mm caliber ordnance, primarily the 30 mm PGU-14/B armour-piercing incendiary round from the GAU-8 Avenger cannon of the A-10 Thunderbolt II used by the United States Air Force. 25 mm DU rounds have been used in the M242 gun mounted on the U.S. Army's Bradley Fighting Vehicle and the Marine Corp's LAV-25.
The U.S. Marine Corps uses DU in the 25 mm PGU-20 round fired by the GAU-12 Equalizer cannon of the AV-8B Harrier, and also in the 20 mm M197 gun mounted on AH-1 Cobra helicopter gunships. The United States Navy's Phalanx CIWS's M61 Vulcan Gatling gun used 20 mm armor-piercing penetrator rounds with discarding plastic sabots made using depleted uranium, later changed to tungsten.
Another use of depleted uranium is in kinetic energy penetrators, anti-armor rounds such as the 120 mm sabot rounds fired from the British Challenger 1, Challenger 2,McManners, Hugh, Gulf War One Real Voices From the Front Line, Ebury Publishing, 2010, ISBN 9780091935986 p91 M1A1 and M1A2 Abrams.Fahey, D. (2003) "Science or Science Fiction? Facts, Myths and Propaganda In the Debate Over Depleted Uranium Weapons", Table 1 on p. 13 Kinetic energy penetrator rounds consist of a long, relatively thin penetrator surrounded by a discarding sabot. Staballoys are metal alloys of depleted uranium with a very small proportion of other metals, usually titanium or molybdenum. One formulation has a composition of 99.25% by mass of depleted uranium and 0.75% by mass of titanium. Staballoys are approximately 1.67 times as dense as lead and are designed for use in kinetic energy penetrator armor-piercing ammunition. The US Army uses DU in an alloy with around 3.5% titanium.
According to 2005 research,[tpl]Cite journal|title=Embedded Weapons-Grade Tungsten Alloy Shrapnel Rapidly Induces Metastatic High-Grade Rhabdomyosarcomas in F344 Rats|url=http://www.ehponline.org/members/2005/7791/7791.html|author=Kalinich, J.F. et al.|date=June 2005|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=113|issue=6|doi=10.1289/ehp.7791|pmid=15929896|pmc=1257598[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl] at least some of the most promising tungsten alloys that have been considered as replacement for depleted uranium in penetrator ammunitions, such as tungsten-cobalt or tungsten-nickel-cobalt alloys, also possess extreme carcinogenic properties, which by far exceed those (confirmed or suspected) of depleted uranium itself: 100% of rats implanted with a pellet of such alloys developed lethal rhabdomyosarcoma within a few weeks.
Depleted uranium is favored for the penetrator because it is self-sharpening and pyrophoric. On impact with a hard target, such as an armored vehicle, the nose of the rod fractures in such a way that it remains sharp. The impact and subsequent release of heat energy causes it to disintegrate to dust and burn when it reaches air because of its pyrophoric properties. When a DU penetrator reaches the interior of an armored vehicle it catches fire, often igniting ammunition and fuel, killing the crew and possibly causing the vehicle to explode. DU is used by the U.S. Army in 120 mm or 105 mm cannons employed on the M1 Abrams tank. The Russian military has used DU ammunition in tank main gun ammunition since the late 1970s, mostly for the 115 mm guns in the T-62 tank and the 125 mm guns in the T-64, T-72, T-80, and T-90 tanks.
The DU content in various ammunition is 180 g in 20 mm projectiles, 200 g in 25 mm ones, 280 g in 30 mm, 3.5 kg in 105 mm, and 4.5 kg in 120 mm penetrators. DU was used during the mid-1990s in the U.S. to make hand grenades, cluster bombs, and land mines, but those applications have been discontinued, according to Alliant Techsystems.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl] The US Navy used DU in its 20 mm Phalanx CIWS guns, but switched in the late 1990s to armor-piercing tungsten.
It is thought that between 17 and 20 countries have weapons incorporating depleted uranium in their arsenals. They include the U.S., the UK, France, Russia, China, India, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Bahrain, Egypt, Kuwait, Pakistan, Thailand, Iraq and Taiwan.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2008[/tpl] Iran also has performed wide research on DU penetrators since 2001[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl]. DU ammunition is manufactured in 18 countries. Only the US and the UK have acknowledged using DU weapons.The International Legality of the Use of Depleted Uranium Weapons: A Precautionary Approach, Avril McDonald, Jann K. Kleffner and Brigit Toebes, eds. (TMC Asser Press Fall-2003)
In a three-week period of conflict in Iraq during 2003 it was estimated that over 1000 tons of depleted uranium munitions were used.Paul Brown (25 April 2003). "Gulf troops face tests for cancer". theguardian.com. Retrieved 29 August 2013.

===Legal status in weapons===

In 1996 the International Court of Justice (ICJ) gave an advisory opinion on the "legality of the threat or use of nuclear weapons".ADVISORY OPINION 1996 July 8; General List No.95 (req: UNGA). Cornnet.nl. Retrieved 16 January 2011. This made it clear, in paragraphs 54, 55 and 56, that international law on poisonous weapons—the Second Hague Declaration of 29 July 1899, Hague Convention IV of 18 October 1907 and the Geneva Protocol of 17 June 1925—did not cover nuclear weapons, because their prime or exclusive use was not to poison or asphyxiate. This ICJ opinion was about nuclear weapons, but the sentence "The terms have been understood, in the practice of States, in their ordinary sense as covering weapons whose prime, or even exclusive, effect is to poison or asphyxiate," also removes depleted uranium weaponry from coverage by the same treaties as their primary use is not to poison or asphyxiate, but to destroy materiel and kill soldiers through kinetic energy.

==Civilian applications==

Depleted uranium has a very high density and is primarily used as shielding material for other radioactive material, and as ballast. Examples include sailboat keels, as counterweights and as shielding in industrial radiography cameras.

===Shielding in industrial radiography cameras===

Industrial radiography cameras include a very high activity gamma radiation source (typically Ir-192 with an activity above 10 TBq). Depleted uranium is often used in the cameras as a shield to protect individuals from the gamma source. Typically the uranium shield is supported and enclosed in polyurethane foam for thermal, mechanical and oxidation protection.[ref]

===Coloring in consumer products===

Consumer product uses have included incorporation into dental porcelain, used for false teeth to simulate the fluorescence of natural teeth, and uranium-bearing reagents used in chemistry laboratories (e.g. uranyl acetate, used in analytical chemistry and as a stain in electron microscopy). Uranium (both depleted uranium and natural uranium) was widely used as a coloring matter for porcelain and glass in the 19th and early-to-mid-20th century. The practice was largely discontinued in the late 20th century. In 1999 concentrations of 10% depleted uranium were being used in "jaune no.17" a yellow enamel powder that was being produced in France by Cristallerie de Saint-Paul, a manufacturer of enamel pigments. The depleted uranium used in the powder was sold by Cogéma's Pierrelatte facility. In February 2000, Cogema discontinued the sale of depleted uranium to producers of enamel and glass.[ref]

===Trim weights in aircraft===

Aircraft that contain depleted uranium trim weights (such as the Boeing 747–100) may contain between 400 to 1,500 kg of DU. This application is controversial because the DU may enter the environment if the aircraft were to crash. The metal can also oxidize to a fine powder in a fire. Its use has been phased out in many newer aircraft. Boeing and McDonnell-Douglas discontinued using DU counterweights in the 1980s. Depleted uranium was released during the crash of El Al Flight 1862 on 4 October 1992, in which 152 kg was lost, but an extensive study concluded that there was no evidence to link depleted uranium from the plane to any health problems.[tpl]cite journal|author= Uijt de Haag P.

</ref>

===U.S. NRC general license===

U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulations at 10 CFR 40.25 establish a general license for the use of depleted uranium contained in industrial products or devices for mass-volume applications. This general license allows anyone to possess or use depleted uranium for authorized purposes. Generally, a registration form is required, along with a commitment to not abandon the material. Agreement states may have similar, or more stringent, regulations.

===Sailboat keel===

Pen Duick VI, a boat designed by André Mauric and used for racing, was equipped with a keel in depleted uranium. The benefit is that, due to the very high density of uranium, the keel could be thinner for a given weight, and so have less resistance than a normal keel. It was later replaced by a standard lead keel, and the use of uranium (or any other material denser than lead) was banned due to cost considerations.

===Sampling Calorimeters for detectors in high-energy particle physics===

Depleted uranium has been used in a number of sampling calorimeters (such as in the D0[tpl]citation|title=An Experiment at D0 to Study anti-Proton - Proton Collisions at 2-TeV: Design Report.[/tpl] and ZEUS[tpl]cite web|url=http://www-zeus.desy.de/bluebook/ch05/chapter2_4.html|title=The ZEUS detector: Status Report 1993[/tpl] detectors) in due to its high density and natural radioactivity.

==Health considerations==

Normal functioning of the kidney, brain, liver, heart, and numerous other systems can be affected by uranium exposure because, in addition to being weakly radioactive, uranium is a toxic metal, although less toxic than other heavy metals such as arsenic and mercury.[tpl]dead link|date=August 2013[/tpl] It is weakly radioactive but is 'persistently' so because of its long half-life. The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry states that: "to be exposed to radiation from uranium, you have to eat, drink, or breathe it, or get it on your skin." If DU particles do enter an individual, the type of danger presented—toxic vs. radiological—and the organ most likely to be affected depend on the solubility of the particles.[tpl]Harvnb|RSDUWG|2002a|p=1[/tpl]. Briefly, inhaled and insoluble means the DU particles will stick around in the lungs and attendant lymph nodes, presenting a radiological risk; highly soluble means those particles are off to the kidneys, where toxicity is the issue.
In military conflicts involving DU munitions, the major concern is inhalation of DU particles in aerosols arising from the impacts of DU-enhanced projectiles with their targets. When depleted uranium munitions penetrate armor or burn, they create depleted uranium oxides in the form of dust that can be inhaled or contaminate wounds. The Institute of Nuclear Technology-Radiation Protection of Attiki, Greece, has noted that "the aerosol produced during impact and combustion of depleted uranium munitions can potentially contaminate wide areas around the impact sites or can be inhaled by civilians and military personnel." The utilisation of DU in incendiary ammunition is controversial because of potential adverse health effects and its release into the environment.[ref]

The U.S. Department of Defense claims that no human cancer of any type has been seen as a result of exposure to either natural or depleted uranium.[ref]
</ref> Militaries have long had risk-reduction procedures for their troops to follow,<ref>[tpl]Harvnb|Zwijnenburg|2012[/tpl].</ref> and studies are in consistent agreement that veterans who used DU-enhanced munitions have not suffered, so far, from an increased risk of cancer (see the Gulf War and Balkans sections below). The effects of DU on civilian populations are, however, a topic of intense and ongoing controversy.
As early as 1997, British Army doctors warned the British MoD (Ministry of Defence) that exposure to depleted uranium increased the risk of developing lung, lymph and brain cancer, and recommended a series of safety precautions.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/jan/11/armstrade.world?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487 | publisher=theguardian.com | first=Richard | last=Norton-Taylor | title=MoD knew shells were cancer risk | date=11 January 2001|accessdate=29 August 2013[/tpl] According to a report issued summarizing the advice of the doctors, "Inhalation of insoluble uranium dioxide dust will lead to accumulation in the lungs with very slow clearance—if any. … Although chemical toxicity is low, there may be localised radiation damage of the lung leading to cancer." The report warns that "All personnel … should be aware that uranium dust inhalation carries a long-term risk … dust has been shown to increase the risks of developing lung, lymph and brain cancers." In 2003, the Royal Society called, again, for urgent attention to be paid to the possible health and environmental impact of depleted uranium, and added its backing to the United Nations Environment Programme's call for a scientific assessment of sites struck with depleted uranium.[tpl]Harvnb|Moszynski|2003[/tpl]. The article quotes Professor Brian Spratt of the Royal Society's DU working group: "It is highly unsatisfactory to deploy a large amount of material that is weakly radioactive and chemically toxic without knowing how much soldiers and civilians have been exposed to." In early 2004, the UK Pensions Appeal Tribunal Service attributed birth defect claims from a February 1991 Gulf War combat veteran to depleted uranium poisoning.Williams, M. (February 9, 2004) "First Award for Depleted Uranium Poisoning Claim," The Herald Online, (Edinburgh: Herald Newspapers, Ltd.)Campaign Against Depleted Uranium (Spring, 2004) "MoD Forced to Pay Pension for DU Contamination," CADU News 17 Also, a 2005 epidemiology review concluded: "In aggregate the human epidemiological evidence is consistent with increased risk of birth defects in offspring of persons exposed to DU." Studies using cultured cells and laboratory rodents continue to suggest the possibility of leukemogenic, genetic, reproductive, and neurological effects from chronic exposure.

===Chemical toxicity===

The chemical toxicity of depleted uranium is about a million times greater in vitro than its radiological hazard,[tpl]Harvnb|Miller|Stewart|Brooks|Shi|2002[/tpl]. with the kidney considered to be the main target organ.[tpl]Harvnb|RSDUWG|2002a|p=2[/tpl]. Health effects of DU are determined by factors such as the extent of exposure and whether it was internal or external. Three main pathways exist by which internalization of uranium may occur: inhalation, ingestion, and embedded fragments or shrapnel contamination.[tpl]Harvnb|Livengood|1996|p=3[/tpl]; [tpl]Harvnb|RSDUWG|2002a|p=19[/tpl]. Properties such as phase (e.g. particulate or gaseous), oxidation state (e.g. metallic or ceramic), and the solubility of uranium and its compounds influence their absorption, distribution, translocation, elimination and the resulting toxicity. For example, metallic uranium is less toxic compared to hexavalent uranium(VI) uranyl compounds such as uranium trioxide.«Gmelin Handbuch der anorganischen Chemie» 8th edition, English translation, Gmelin Handbook of Inorganic Chemistry, vol. U-A7 (1982) pp. 300–322.[tpl]Cite book|author=Naomi H. Harley, Earnest C. Foulkes, Lee H. Hilborne, Arlene Hudson and C.

Uranium is pyrophoric when finely divided. It will corrode under the influence of air and water producing insoluble uranium(IV) and soluble uranium (VI) salts. Soluble uranium salts are toxic. Uranium slowly accumulates in several organs, such as the liver, spleen, and kidneys. The World Health Organization has established a daily "tolerated intake" of soluble uranium salts for the general public of 0.5 µg/kg body weight, or 35 µg for a 70 kg adult.

Approximately 90 micrograms of natural uranium, on average, exist in the human body as a result of normal intake of water, food and air. Most is in the skeleton. The biochemistry of depleted uranium is the same as natural uranium.

===Radiological hazards===

The primary radiation danger from depleted uranium is due to alpha particles, which do not travel far through air, and do not penetrate clothing. Thus, the primary concern is internal exposure, due to inhalation, ingestion or shrapnel contamination. Available evidence suggests that this risk is small relative to the chemical hazard.
Surveying the veteran-related evidence pertaining to the Gulf War, a 2001 editorial in the BMJ concluded it was not possible to justify claims of radiation-induced lung cancer and leukaemia in veterans of that conflict.[tpl]Harvnb|McDiarmid|2001[/tpl]. While agreeing with the editorial's conclusion, a reply noted that its finding in the negative was guaranteed, given that "global dose estimates or results of mathematical modelling are too inaccurate to be used as dose values for an individual veteran", and that, as of April 2001, no practical method of measuring the expected small doses that each individual veteran would receive had been suggested.[tpl]Harvnb|Mould|2001[/tpl]. Mould's suggestion was electron paramagnetic resonance dosimetry using tooth enamel. He also wrote that the US National Institute of Standards and Technology was able, using this method, to measure doses as low as 20 mSv, and that, if it were asked to, the NIST would be able to get involved, meaning at least one centre could help undertake a screening programme for veterans. The author of the reply, a radiation scientist, went on to suggest a method that had been used several times before, including after the 1986 Chernobyl accident. Despite the widespread use of DU in the Iraq War, at least a year after the conflict began, testing for UK troops was still only in the discussion phase.[tpl]Harvnb|Greenberg|Iversen|Unwin|Hull|2004[/tpl], which found that perhaps a quarter of all UK troops would have been interested in undergoing DU-related monitoring, although "the desire for DU screening is more closely linked to current health status rather than plausible exposure to DU." Confusingly, [tpl]Harvnb|Moszynski|2003[/tpl] reports that "testing is now available to all troops that served in Iraq", and does not say if this is testing à la Mould.
 The Royal Society DU Working Group concluded in 2002 that there were "very low" health risks associated with the use of depleted uranium, though also ventured that, "in extreme conditions and under worst-case assumptions" lung and kidney damage could occur, and that in "worst-case scenarios high local levels of uranium could occur in food or water that could have adverse effects on the kidney."The study is mentioned by [tpl]Harvnb|Patel|2006[/tpl]. According to Patel, "the majority evidence and expert opinion on the lack of a clear association between depleted uranium are quite consistent". Similarly [tpl]Harvnb|Murphy|Greenberg|Bland|2009[/tpl]: "There is now a large body of evidence to suggest that, whatever the cause of the ill‐health experienced by Gulf War veterans, neither DU nor vaccinations are likely to have caused them." The Working Group study he mentions is [tpl]Harvnb|Royal Society DU Working Group|2002b[/tpl], which is a summary of the second part of the Working Group's look at the health effects of DU: Part 1: [tpl]Harvnb|RSDUWG|2001[/tpl]; Part 2: [tpl]Harvnb|RSDUWG|2002a[/tpl]. In 2003, the Royal Society issued another urgent call to investigate the actual health and environmental impact of depleted uranium. The same year, a cohort study of Gulf War veterans found no elevated risks of cancer generally, nor of any specific cancers in particular, though recommended follow up studies.[tpl]Harvnb|Macfarlane|Biggs|Maconochie|Hotopf|2003[/tpl]: "There is no current excess risk of cancer overall nor of site specific cancers in Gulf war veterans. Specific exposures during deployment have not resulted in a subsequent increased risk of cancer. The long latent period for cancer, however, necessitates the continued follow up of these cohorts."
 According to the World Health Organization, a radiation dose from it would be about 60% of that from purified natural uranium with the same mass; the radiological dangers are lower due to its longer half-life and the removal of the more radioactive isotopes. However, in a matter of a month or so, depleted uranium generates amounts of thorium-234 and protactinium-234, which emit beta particles at almost the same rate as that of the alpha particles from the uranium-238.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl]

===Gulf War syndrome and soldier complaints===

Since 1991, the year the Gulf War ended, veterans and their families voiced concern about subsequent health problems.[tpl]Harvnb|Murphy|1999[/tpl]. In 1999, assessment of the first 1,000 veterans involved in the Ministry of Defence's Gulf War medical assessment programme found "no evidence" of a single illness, physical or mental, that would explain the pattern of symptoms observed in the group.[tpl]Harvnb|Coker|Bhatt|Blatchley|Graham|1999[/tpl]: "As the veterans assessed by the programme were all self selected, the prevalence of illness in Gulf war veterans cannot be determined from this study. Furthermore, it is not known whether the veterans in this study were representative of sick veterans as a group." To recapitulate using [tpl]Harvnb|Murphy|1999[/tpl]: "Though Gulf War veterans' illnesses are real and sometimes disabling, they do not seem to constitute a unique illness." Nevertheless, in 1999, MEDACT petitioned for the WHO to conduct an investigation into illnesses in veterans and Iraqi civilians.[tpl]Harvnb|Stott|Holdstock|1999[/tpl]. A major 2006 review of peer-reviewed literature by a US Institute of Medicine committee concluded that, "because the symptoms vary greatly among individuals," they do not point to a syndrome unique to Gulf War veterans, though their report conceded that the lack of objective pre-deployment health data meant definitive conclusions were effectively impossible.[tpl]Harvnb|Charatan|2006[/tpl]. The quote is of Lynn Goldman, who chaired the IOM committee that carried out the review. [tpl]Harvnb|Iversen|Chalder|Wessely|2007[/tpl] notes that "despite clear evidence of an increase in symptom burden and a decrease in well being" among Gulf War veterans, "exhaustive clinical and laboratory based scientific research has failed to document many reproducible biomedical abnormalities in this group. Likewise, there has been no evidence of an increase in disease related mortality." Simon Wessely praised the IOM's review, and noted that despite its central conclusion that no novel syndrome existed, its other findings made it "equally clear that service in the Gulf war did aversely affect health in some personnel."[tpl]Harvnb|Charatan|2006[/tpl]. The quote is of Wessely himself. Aside from the lack of baseline data to guide analysis of the veterans' postwar health, because no detailed health screening was carried out when the veterans entered service, another major stumbling block with some studies, like the thousand-veteran one, is that the subjects are self selected, rather than a random sample, making general conclusions impossible.[tpl]Harvnb|Coker|Bhatt|Blatchley|Graham|1999[/tpl]; [tpl]Harvnb|Murphy|1999[/tpl].
 Increased rates of immune system disorders and other wide-ranging symptoms, including chronic pain, fatigue and memory loss, have been reported in over one quarter of combat veterans of the 1991 Gulf War.U.S. Research Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses (2004) "Scientific Progress in Understanding Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses: Report and Recommendations" Combustion products[tpl]Harvnb|Murphy|Greenberg|Bland|2009[/tpl]: "Metallic DU is weakly radioactive and therefore contact with unbroken skin is an extremely low risk to health. However, when a DU round strikes an armoured target, it undergoes spontaneous partial combustion resulting in a fine aerosol of largely insoluble uranium oxides. Presence of this aerosol elevates the risk of potentially chemotoxic or radiotoxic exposure via inhalation or ingestion". from depleted uranium munitions are being considered as one of the potential causes by the Research Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses, as DU was used in 30 mm and 25 mm cannon rounds on a large scale for the first time in the Gulf War. Veterans of the conflicts in the Persian Gulf, Bosnia and Kosovo have been found to have up to 14 times the usual level of chromosome abnormalities in their genes.[tpl]Cite news|author=Fleming, N. and Townsend, M. |date=11 August 2002 |url=http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2002/aug/11/uk.politicalnews |title=Gulf veteran babies 'risk deformities' |newspaper=The Observer|location=London|accessdate=29 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|author= Arfsten D.

Human epidemiological evidence is consistent with increased risk of birth defects in the offspring of persons exposed to DU. A 2001 study of 15,000 February 1991 U.S. Gulf War combat veterans and 15,000 control veterans found that the Gulf War veterans were 1.8 (fathers) to 2.8 (mothers) times more likely to have children with birth defects. After examination of children's medical records two years later, the birth defect rate increased by more than 20%:
[tpl]Quote| Dr. Kang found that male Gulf War veterans reported having infants with likely birth defects at twice the rate of non-veterans. Furthermore, female Gulf War veterans were almost three times more likely to report children with birth defects than their non-Gulf counterparts. The numbers changed somewhat with medical records verification. However, Dr. Kang and his colleagues concluded that the risk of birth defects in children of deployed male veterans still was about 2.2 times that of non-deployed veterans.[tpl]cite journal|author= Department of Veterans Affairs|year = 2003|title = Q's & A's – New Information Regarding Birth Defects|url = http://www1.va.gov/gulfwar/docs/GulfWarNov03.pdf|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060929095251/http://www1.va.gov/gulfwar/docs/GulfWarNov03.pdf|archivedate = 2006-09-29|format = PDF|journal = Gulf War Review|volume = 12|issue = 1| page = 10[/tpl] [/tpl]

The U.S. Army has commissioned ongoing research into potential risks of depleted uranium and other projectile weapon materials like tungsten, which the U.S. Navy has used in place of DU since 1993. Studies by the U.S. Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute conclude that moderate exposures to either depleted uranium or uranium present a significant toxicological threat.[tpl]Cite book|url=http://www.afrri.usuhs.mil/www/outreach/pdf/mcclain_NATO_2005.pdf | title=Status of Health Concerns about Military Use of Depleted Uranium and Surrogate Metals in Armor-Penetrating Munitions|author=D.

In 2003 Professor Brian Spratt FRS, chairman of the Royal Society's working group on depleted uranium, said: "The question of who carries out the initial monitoring and clean-up is a political rather than scientific question," and "the coalition needs to acknowledge that depleted uranium is a potential hazard and make in-roads into tackling it by being open about where and how much depleted uranium has been deployed."
A 2008 review of all relevant articles appearing in the peer-reviewed journals on MEDLINE through to the end of 2007, including multiple cohort studies of veterans, found no consistent evidence of excess risks of neoplasms that could have some link to DU, and that "the overall incidence of cancers is not increased in the cohort studies of Gulf war and Balkans veterans".[tpl]Harvnb|Lagorio|Grande|Martina|2008[/tpl].
Though a more comprehensive assessment is possible, a 2011 update on a cancer scare regarding Italian soldiers who had served in the Balkans found lower than expected incidence rates for all cancers, a finding "consistent with lacking evidence of an increased cancer incidence among troops of other countries deployed in the areas of Iraq, Bosnia, and Kosovo, where armour-penetrating depleted uranium shells have been used."[tpl]Harvnb|Peragallo|Urbano|Sarnicola|Lista|2011[/tpl]: "The excess of reported cases for this malignancy lymphoma in 2001–2002 was probably due to a peak that occurred in 2000 among the whole military; it is therefore unrelated to deployment in the Balkans, and probably represents a chance event."
One particular subgroup of veterans that may be at higher risk comprises those who have internally retained fragments of DU from shrapnel wounds. A laboratory study on rats produced by the Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute showed that, after a study period of 6 months, rats treated with depleted uranium coming from implanted pellets, comparable to the average levels in the urine of Desert Storm veterans with retained DU fragments, had developed a significant tendency to lose weight with respect to the control group.[tpl]Cite book|url=http://www.afrri.usuhs.mil/www/outreach/pdf/pellmar.pdf | title=Toxicological Evaluation of Depleted Uranium in Rats: Six Month Evaluation Point|author=T.

Substantial amounts of uranium were accumulating in their brains and central nervous systems, and showed a significant reduction of neuronal activity in the hippocampus in response to external stimuli. The conclusions of the study show that brain damage from chronic uranium intoxication is possible at lower doses than previously thought.

Since 2001, medical personnel at the Basra hospital in southern Iraq have reported a sharp increase in the incidence of child leukemia and genetic malformation among babies born in the decade following the Gulf War.

Yet, Pekka Haavisto, chairman of the UNEP DU projects stated, "The findings of this study stress again the importance of appropriate clean-up and civil protection measures in a post-conflict situation."Low-level DU contamination found in Bosnia and Herzegovina, UNEP calls for precaution United Nations Environment Programme, 25 March 2003. Retrieved 25 January 2009.
A team of Italian scientists from the University of Siena reported in 2005 that although DU was "clearly" added to the soil in the study area, "the phenomenon was very limited spatially and the total uranium concentrations fell within the natural range of the element in soils. Moreover, the absolute uranium concentrations indicate that there was no contamination of the earthworm species studied."[tpl]Harvnb|Di Lella|Nannoni|Protano|Riccobono|2005[/tpl]

===Contamination as a result of the Afghan War===

The Canadian Uranium Medical Research Centre obtained urine samples from bombed civilian areas in Jalalabad that showed concentrations of 80–400 ng/L of undepleted uranium, far higher than the typical concentration in the British population of ~5 ng/L.A.

===Studies indicating negligible effects===

Studies in 2005 and earlier have concluded that DU ammunition has no measurable detrimental health effects.
A 1999 literature review conducted by the Rand Corporation stated: "No evidence is documented in the literature of cancer or any other negative health effect related to the radiation received from exposure to depleted or natural uranium, whether inhaled or ingested, even at very high doses,"[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gulflink.osd.mil/library/randrep/du/cover.html|title="A Review of the Scientific Literature as it Pertains to Gulf War Illnesses," Rand Report, 1999.[/tpl] and a RAND report authored by the U.S. Defense department undersecretary charged with evaluating DU hazards considered the debate to be more political than scientific.Bernard D. Rostker Depleted Uranium, A Case Study of Good and Evil. RAND Corporation
A 2001 oncology study concluded that "the present scientific consensus is that DU exposure to humans, in locations where DU ammunition was deployed, is very unlikely to give rise to cancer induction". Former NATO Secretary General Lord Robertson stated in 2001 that "the existing medical consensus is clear. The hazard from depleted uranium is both very limited, and limited to very specific circumstances".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/docu/speech/2001/s010110a.htm |title=NATO Press Conference on Depleted Uranium |publisher=Nato.int |date= |accessdate=4 September 2013[/tpl]
A 2002 study from the Australian defense ministry concluded that "there has been no established increase in mortality or morbidity in workers exposed to uranium in uranium processing industries... studies of Gulf War veterans show that, in those who have retained fragments of depleted uranium following combat related injury, it has been possible to detect elevated urinary uranium levels, but no kidney toxicity or other adverse health effects related to depleted uranium after a decade of follow-up."Military medical aspects of depleted uranium munitions[tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl] Pier Roberto Danesi, then-director of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Seibersdorf +Laboratory, stated in 2002 that "There is a consensus now that DU does not represent a health threat".[ref]

The IAEA reported in 2003 that, "based on credible scientific evidence, there is no proven link between DU exposure and increases in human cancers or other significant health or environmental impacts," although "Like other heavy metals, DU is potentially poisonous. In sufficient amounts, if DU is ingested or inhaled it can be harmful because of its chemical toxicity. High concentration could cause kidney damage." The IAEA concluded that while depleted uranium is a potential carcinogen, there is no evidence that it has been carcinogenic in humans.
A 2005 study by Sandia National Laboratories' Al Marshall used mathematical models to analyze potential health effects associated with accidental exposure to depleted uranium during the 1991 Gulf War. Marshall's study concluded that the reports of cancer risks from DU exposure are not supported by his analysis nor by veteran medical statistics. Marshall also examined possible genetic effects due to radiation from depleted uranium.An Analysis of Uranium Dispersal and Health Effects Using a Gulf War Case Study[tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl], Albert C. Marshall, Sandia National Laboratories Chemical effects, including potential reproductive issues, associated with depleted uranium exposure were discussed in some detail in a subsequent journal paper.Marshall, A. C. Gulf war depleted uranium risks Journal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology 18, 95–108 (January 2008) | [tpl]doi|10.1038/sj.jes.7500551[/tpl]

===Atmospheric contamination as a result of military actions===

Elevated radiation levels consistent with very low level atmospheric depleted uranium contamination have been found in air samples taken by the UK Atomic Weapons Establishment at several monitoring sites in Britain. These elevated readings appear to coincide with Operation Anaconda in Afghanistan, and the Shock and Awe bombing campaign at the start of the Second Gulf War.[tpl]dead link|date=August 2013[/tpl][ref]C.

===Other contamination cases===

On October 4, 1992, an El Al Boeing 747-F cargo aircraft Flight 1862, crashed into an apartment building in Amsterdam. Local residents and rescue workers complained of various unexplained health issues which were being attributed to the release of hazardous materials during the crash and subsequent fires. Authorities conducted an epidemiological study in 2000 of those believed to be affected by the accident. The study concluded that there was no evidence to link depleted uranium (used as counterbalance weights on the elevators of the plane) to any of the reported health complaints.

===Safety and environmental issues===

About 95% of the depleted uranium produced until now is stored as uranium hexafluoride, (D)UF6, in steel cylinders in open air yards close to enrichment plants. Each cylinder contains up to 12.7 tonnes (or 14 US tons) of UF6. In the U.S. alone, 560,000 tonnes of depleted UF6 had accumulated by 1993. In 2005, 686,500 tonnes in 57,122 storage cylinders were located near Portsmouth, Ohio, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and Paducah, Kentucky.,[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.ead.anl.gov/uranium/faq/storage/faq16.cfm |title=FAQ 16-How much depleted uranium hexafluoride is stored in the United States? |publisher=Web.ead.anl.gov |date= |accessdate=21 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://web.ead.anl.gov/uranium/documents/index.cfm |title=Documents |publisher=Web.ead.anl.gov |date= |accessdate=21 August 2013[/tpl] The long-term storage of DUF6 presents environmental, health, and safety risks because of its chemical instability. When UF6 is exposed to moist air, it reacts with the water in the air and produces UO2F2 (uranyl fluoride) and HF (hydrogen fluoride), both of which are highly soluble and toxic. Storage cylinders must be regularly inspected for signs of corrosion and leaks. The estimated lifetime of the steel cylinders is measured in decades.Science-Based Stockpile Stewardship (Vol. 5, No. 2) » Institute for Energy and Environmental Research
There have been several accidents involving uranium hexafluoride in the United States.[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.ead.anl.gov/uranium/faq/health/faq30.cfm |title=FAQ 30-Have there been accidents involving uranium hexafluoride? |publisher=Web.ead.anl.gov |date= |accessdate=21 August 2013[/tpl] The vulnerability of DUF6 storage cylinders to terrorist attack is apparently not the subject of public reports. However, the U.S. government has been converting DUF6 to solid uranium oxides for disposal.[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.ead.anl.gov/uranium/faq/storage/faq22.cfm |title=FAQ 22-What is going to happen to the uranium hexafluoride stored in the United States? |publisher=Web.ead.anl.gov |date= |accessdate=21 August 2013[/tpl] Disposing of the whole DUF6 inventory could cost anywhere from 15 to 450 million dollars.[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.ead.anl.gov/uranium/faq/mgmt/faq27.cfm |title=FAQ 27-Are there any currently-operating disposal facilities that can accept all of the depleted uranium oxide that would be generated from conversion of DOE's depleted UF6 inventory? |publisher=Web.ead.anl.gov |date= |accessdate=21 August 2013[/tpl]
