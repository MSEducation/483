CATEGORIES: Government of Brazil, Lists of presidents, Politics of Brazil

The President of Brazil, officially the President of the Federative Republic of Brazil ([tpl]lang-pt|Presidente da República Federativa do Brasil[/tpl]), or simply the President of the Republic, is both head of state and head of government of the Federative Republic of Brazil. The president leads the executive branch of the federal government and is the commander-in-chief of the Brazilian Armed Forces. The presidential system was established in 1889, upon the proclamation of the republic in a military coup d'état against Emperor Dom Pedro II. Since then, Brazil had six constitutions, two dictatorships and three democratic periods. During these democratic periods, voting has always been compulsory. The Brazilian constitution of 1988, along with several constitutional amendments, establishes the requirements, powers, and responsibilities of the president, as well as the term of office and method of election.Constitution of the Federative Republic of Brazil, art. 15 and Chapter II

==Election process==

===Eligibility===

According to the 1988 Constitution, the president must be a native-born citizen of Brazil, be at least 35 years of age, be a resident in Brazil, be an elector, have all the electoral rights, and be inscribed in a political party (write-in candidates are forbidden).

===Term of office===

The presidential term of office is currently four years. The current length of the presidential term of office was adopted in 1994 by means of a constitutional amendment (review constitutional amendment number 5). From 1889 to 1937 and again from 1945 to 1997, the president was barred from immediate reelection. In 1997, however, the 16th amendment allowed a president to be elected any number of times, but not more than twice in a row. A former president, even one who already served two consecutive terms, can become a candidate for the presidency again, provided that he or she is not a candidate for the four-year period immediately succeeding the second term.
A vice-president or another officer in the line of succession who succeeds to the presidency or who serves, albeit briefly, as acting president during a certain presidential term (which all Brazilian vice-presidents do, given the Brazilian tradition of the vice-president becoming acting president during the president's travels abroad) can subsequently be elected to the presidency once only and the consecutive term limit already applies.
Although re-election to the same office is allowed once consecutively, Brazilian presidents cannot run for a different office while serving in the presidency. In order to be eligible as a candidate for a different office, per the federal constitution, a president of Brazil would need to resign his office six months before the date of the elections. The same rule applies to the governors of the states and to the mayors of the municipalities.

==Duties and powers==

As a republic with a presidential executive, Brazil grants significant powers to the president. He or she effectively controls the executive branch, represents the country abroad, and appoints the cabinet and, with the approval of the Senate, the judges for the Supreme Federal Tribunal. The president is also the commander-in-chief of the armed forces.
Presidents in Brazil also have significant lawmaking powers, exercised either by proposing laws to the National Congress, or else by using Medidas Provisórias (provisional measures), an instrument with the force of law that the president can enact in cases of urgency and necessity, except to make changes to some areas of law (provisional measures cannot be used to change criminal law, electoral law, tax law, among other cases). A provisional measure comes into effect immediately, before Congress votes on it, and remains in force for up to 60 days unless Congress votes to rescind it. This 60-day period can be extended once, up to a maximum of 120 days. If Congress, on the other hand, votes to approve the provisional measure, it becomes an actual law, with changes decided by the legislative branch. The provisional measure expires at the end of the 60-day period (or 120-day, in case of extension), or sooner, if rejected by one of the Houses of Congress.Constitution of the Federative Republic of Brazil, art. 62 as amended by constitutional amendment n. 32
Article 84 of the current constitution, determines that the president has the power to:

==Compensation and privileges of office==

The president earns a R$26,723 monthly salary, along with an undisclosed expense account to cover travel, goods and services while in office.Ajuste ainda não chegou aos gastos sigilosos ("Cuts have yet to be made to undisclosed expenses") Ministério do Planejamento.

Given that in Brazil all private and public sector employees and civil servants receive an additional compensation equivalent to one monthly salary after a year of work (this compensation is known as the thirtheenth salary), the President receives 13 payments of R$26,723 per year, resulting in an annual salary of R$347,400.
The Palácio do Planalto in Brasília is the official workplace of the president and the Palácio da Alvorada his/her official residence; he/she is entitled to use its staff and facilities.Palácio do Planalto Presidência da República.

In addition, the presidency of the republic also maintains the Jaburu Palace in Brasília for use by the Vice-President of the Republic as his official residence.
In the 2000s (decade), the federal government decided to establish Regional Offices of the Presidency of the Republic in certain key Brazilian cities. Those regional offices are not presidential residences, but they are fully staffed offices ready to receive the president and his ministers at any time, and they function as a presidential workplace when the President is in those cities. The first regional office of the presidency was established in the city of São Paulo, and is located at the Banco do Brasil building at the Paulista Avenue; the building also houses Banco do Brasil's regional headquarters in São Paulo. The presidency of the republic also maintains regional offices in Porto Alegre and in Belo Horizonte.

==Office-holders==

All presidents of Brazil bore the title President of the Republic. That title has been used by all the constitutions of Brazil since the proclamation of the Republic to refer to the head of the Executive Branch.
However, from the proclamation of the Republic in 1889 until 1937 the country was officially styled Republic of the United States of Brazil, and from 1937 to 1967 the country was styled simply The United States of Brazil, and thus the full title of the Presidents of the Republic from 1891 until 1967 --- that is, from Deodoro da Fonseca's inauguration as President (between 1889 and 1891 he served as Head of the Provisional Government) until the end of Humberto Castello Branco's term in 1967 --- was President of the Republic of the United States of Brazil. On March 15, 1967, the country's official name was changed to Federative Republic of Brazil. On that same date, Arthur da Costa e Silva was sworn in as President succeeding Castello Branco. Since Costa e Silva, therefore, all presidents of Brazil bear the full title of President of the Federative Republic of Brazil.
