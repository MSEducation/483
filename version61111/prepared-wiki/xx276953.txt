==Allegations==

Ghazi Fakir came into the news in July 2013 when a Superintendent of Police Jaisalmer Pankaj Chaudhary was transferred for reopening of the case file of notorious history sheeter Ghazi Fakir involved in cross-border smuggling and other anti-social activities on the India-Pakistan border since two decades. The charges against him range from running a cross border smuggling racket  to acting as an agent of Pakistan’s ISI.
The book also describes the clout of Gazi Fakir in politics and their role in releasing the spies caught by local police.
“In February 1984 the then Collector of Barmer district, CK Mathew had facilitated the arrest of one Mushtaq Ahmed of Burren-Ka-Tala under the National Securities Act. Though he claimed to be an Indian, he was carrying a Pakistani identity card. Subsequently it was found that he had undergone training in Lahore for espionage. When arrested Mushtaq was bold enough to assert that he could not be held for long. Sure enough, his words came true when he had to be released under pressure from top Congress (I) leaders in the region,” adds the book.
Older residents of Jaisalmer allege that Ghazi Fakir is an extremely influential leader in and around Jaisalmer, was engaged in smuggling and other unlawful activities along the India-Pakistan border. He is also known for his astute “election management skills.”[tpl]cite web|author=Mahim Pratap Singh |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/jaisalmer-sp-shunted-out-for-opening-congress-mlas-fathers-historysheet/article4988870.ece |title=Jaisalmer SP shunted out for opening Congress MLA's father's history-sheet |publisher=The Hindu |date= |accessdate=2013-08-08[/tpl]
There was major public outrage when SP Pankaj Chaudhary was shunted out for reopening the 48-year-old history sheet of Ghazi Fakir. A history sheet against him was opened in the Kotwali police station in Jaisalmer in July 1965, before it went missing in 1984. It was reopened in 1990, and again closed in early May 2011.
