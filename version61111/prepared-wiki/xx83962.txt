Zdeňka Vávrová (* 1945)http://www.skaw.sk/lovec-komet-Zdenka-Vavrova.htm  is a Czech astronomer.
She co-discovered periodic comet 134P/Kowal-Vávrová. She had observed it as an asteroid, which received the provisional designation 1983 JG, without seeing any cometary coma. However, later images by Charles T. Kowal showed a coma.
She has also discovered a number of asteroids. Asteroid 3364 Zdenka is named after her.http://books.google.com/books?id=KWrB1jPCa8AC&pg=PA280&dq=%22Zde%C5%88ka+V%C3%A1vrov%C3%A1%22&cd=1#v=onepage&q=&f=false ("Named for Zdeňka Vávrová for her 20 devoted years in the astrometric program at Klet")
