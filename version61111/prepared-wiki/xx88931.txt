[[Sîn-lēqi-unninni]]

CATEGORIES: Babylonian people, Epic of Gilgamesh, Ancient Near Eastern scribes

Sîn-lēqi-unninni was an incantation/exorcist priest (mashmashshu) who lived in Mesopotamia in the period between 1300 BC and 1000 BC. He is the compiler of the best preserved version of the Epic of Gilgamesh.  His name is listed in the text itself, which is unusual for works written in cuneiform. His version is known by its incipit, or first line  "Sha naqba īmuru" ("He who saw the deep" or "The one who saw the Abyss").  It is unknown how different his version is from the earlier texts.
The only time when Sin-liqe-unninni narrates the story in first person is in the prologue. His version includes Utnapishtim's story of the Flood in tablet XI and in tablet XII the Sumerian Gilgamesh, Enkidu and the Netherworld.
Sîn-lēqi-unninni's name means 'Sîn (the Moon God) is one who accepts my prayer'. It is also sometimes transcribed, albeit less probably, as 'Sîn-liqe-unninni', meaning 'O Sîn! Accept my prayer'.George, A.R. The Babylonian Gilgamesh Epic: Introduction, critical edition and cuneiform, p.27
