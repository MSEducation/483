Leland Stanford Junior University, commonly referred to as Stanford University, is a private research university in Stanford, California in northwestern Silicon Valley near Palo Alto. Its academic reputation, eminent alumni, influence, and wealth have made it one of the most prestigious universities in the world.[tpl]cite web|title=Stanford University|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/563120/Stanford-University|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=November 21, 2012|quote="Stanford University...one of the most prestigious in the country."[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Stanford University|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Stanford_University.aspx|publisher=Encyclopedia.com|quote="In 2002 Stanford University stood as one of the premier centers of higher learning and research in the country.

The university was founded in 1885 by Leland Stanford, former governor of and U.S. senator from California and leading railroad tycoon, and his wife, Jane Lathrop Stanford, in memory of their son, Leland Stanford, Jr., who died of typhoid fever two months before his 16th birthday in 1884; it opened on October 1, 1891. The university was established as a coeducational and non-denominational institution.

==History==

===Origins and early years (1885–1906)===

The university officially opened on October 1, 1891 to 555 students. On the university's opening day, Founding President David Starr Jordan (1851–1931) said to Stanford's Pioneer Class: "Stanford is hallowed by no traditions; it is hampered by none. Its finger posts all point forward."[tpl]cite web|title=Stanford Facts: The Founding of Stanford|url=http://facts.stanford.edu/founding.html[/tpl]  However, much preceded the opening and continued for several years until the death of the last Founder, Jane Stanford, in 1905 and the destruction of the 1906 earthquake.

====Foundation====

Stanford was founded by Leland Stanford, a railroad magnate, United States senator, and former California governor, together with his wife, Jane Lathrop Stanford. It is named in honor of their only child, Leland Stanford, Jr., who died in 1884 just before his 16th birthday. His parents decided to dedicate a university to their only son, and Leland Stanford told his wife, "The children of California shall be our children." The Stanfords visited Harvard's president, Charles Eliot, and asked how much it would cost to duplicate Harvard in California. Eliot replied that he supposed $5 million (in 1884 dollars; about $[tpl]formatprice|[tpl]Inflation|US|5000000|1884[/tpl][/tpl] today[tpl]Inflation-fn|US[/tpl]) would be enough.[tpl]cite web|title=Were Leland and Jane Stanford snubbed by the president of Harvard University? Did Leland Jr. attend Harvard before his death in an accident?|url=https://library.stanford.edu/spc/faq#snubbed[/tpl]
The university's Founding Grant of Endowment from the Stanfords was issued in November 1885.[tpl]cite web|url=https://wasc.stanford.edu/system/files/FoundingGrant_1.pdf|title=Stanford University - The Founding Grant with Amendments, Legislation,and Court Decrees|publisher=Stanford University|year=1987|accessdate=2013-12-30[/tpl] Besides defining the operational structure of the university, it made several specific stipulations:
"The Trustees ... shall have the power and it shall be their duty:
Though the trustees are in overall charge of the university, Leland and Jane Stanford as Founders retained great control until their deaths.
Despite the duty to have a co-educational institution in 1899 Jane Stanford, the remaining Founder, added to the Founding Grant the legal requirement that "the number of women attending the University as students shall at no time ever exceed five hundred". She feared the large numbers of women entering would lead the school to become "the Vassar of the West" and  felt that would not be an appropriate memorial for her son. In 1933 the requirement was reinterpreted by the trustees to specify an undergraduate male:female ratio of 3:1.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.godeke.org/News/SigmaRho_Chapter.htm|title= The Stanford Daily - Greek life: History of fraternities and sororities|date=November 12, 2004|accessdate=2014-01-06[/tpl] The "Stanford ratio" of 3:1 remained in place until the early 1960s. By the late 1960s the "ratio" was about 2:1 for undergraduates, but much more skewed at the graduate level, except in the humanities. In 1973 the University trustees successfully petitioned the courts to have the restriction formally removed.  As of 2005 the undergraduate enrollment is split nearly evenly between the sexes, though males outnumber females about 1.6:1 at the graduate level.[tpl]cite web|title=Undergraduate Profile: Stanford University Facts|url=http://facts.stanford.edu/academics/undergraduate-profile[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Graduate Profile: Stanford University Facts|url=http://facts.stanford.edu/academics/graduate-profile[/tpl]  In the same petition they also removed the prohibition of sectarian worship on campus (previous only non-denominational Christian worship in Stanford Memorial Church was permitted).

====Physical layout====

The Stanfords chose their country estate, Palo Alto Stock Farm, in northern Santa Clara County as the site of the university, so that the University is often called "the Farm" to this day.

The original "inner quad" buildings (1887–91) were designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, Francis A. Walker, Charles Allerton Coolidge, and Leland Stanford himself.  The cornerstone was laid on May 14, 1887 which would have been Leland Stanford Junior's nineteenth birthday.[ref]
 The web page includes a picture of the ceremony.
[/ref] In the summer of 1886, when the campus was first being planned, Stanford brought the president of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Francis Amasa Walker, and prominent Boston landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted westward for consultations. Olmsted worked out the general concept for the campus and its buildings, rejecting a hillside site in favor of the more practical flatlands. 
The Boston firm of Shepley, Rutan, and Coolidge were hired in the Autumn and Charles Allerton Coolidge then developed this concept in the style of his late mentor, Henry Hobson Richardson, in the Richardsonian Romanesque style, characterized by rectangular stone buildings linked by arcades of half-circle arches merged with the Californian  Mission Revival style desired by the Stanfords. However by 1889, Leland Stanford severed the connection with Olmsted and Coolidge and their work was continued by others.
The red tile roofs and solid sandstone masonry are distinctly Californian in appearance and famously complementary to the bright blue skies common to the region, and most of the subsequently erected buildings have maintained consistent exteriors.

====Early faculty and administration====

In Spring 1891, the Stanfords offered the presidency of their new university to the president of Cornell University, Andrew White, but he declined and recommended David Starr Jordan, the 40-year-old president of Indiana University Bloomington. Jordan's educational philosophy was a good fit with the Stanfords' vision of a non-sectarian, co-educational school with a liberal arts curriculum, and he accepted the offer.[tpl]cite journal|last=Johnston|first=Theresa|date=January–February 2010|title=Meet President Jordan|journal=Stanford Magazine|url=http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/2010/janfeb/features/jordan.html[/tpl] Jordan arrived at Stanford in June 1891 and immediately set about recruiting faculty for the university's planned October opening. With such a short time frame he drew heavily on his own acquaintance in academia; of the fifteen original professors, most came either from Indiana University or his alma mater Cornell. The 1891 founding professors included Robert Allardice in mathematics, Douglas Houghton Campbell in botany, Charles Henry Gilbert in zoology, George Elliott Howard in history, Oliver Peebles Jenkins in physiology and histology, Charles David Marx in civil engineering, Fernando Sanford in physics, and John Maxson Stillman in chemistry. The total initial teaching staff numbered about 35 including instructors and lecturers.[tpl]cite book|last=Clark|first=George A.|title=History of the New California, Chapter XIX, Stanford Universitiy|url=http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ca/state1/newca/newca19.html|year=1905|publisher=Lewis Publishing Company|location=New York, Chicago[/tpl] For the second (1892–93) school year, Jordan was able to add additional professors including Frank Angell (psychology), Leander M. Hoskins (mechanical engineering), Walter Miller (classics), George C. Price (zoology), and Arly B. Show (history). Most of these two founding groups of professors remained at Stanford until their retirement and were referred to as the "Old Guard".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/2000/julaug/departments/century_at_stanford.html|title=75 years ago (1925)|work=Century at Stanford|publisher=Stanford Magazine|url=http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ca/state1/newca/newca19.html|accessdate=June 20, 2012[/tpl]
Edward Alsworth Ross gained fame as a founding father of American sociology; in 1900 Jane Stanford fired him for radicalism and racism, unleashing a major academic freedom case.[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Mohr | first1 = James C. | year = 1970 | title = Academic Turmoil and Public Opinion: the Ross Case at Stanford | url = | journal = Pacific Historical Review | volume = 39 | issue = 1| pages = 39–61 | doi=10.2307/3638197[/tpl]

====Early finances====

When Leland Stanford died in 1893, the continued existence of the university was in jeopardy. A $15 million government lawsuit against Stanford's estate, combined with the Panic of 1893, made it extremely difficult to meet expenses. Most of the Board of Trustees advised that the University be closed temporarily until finances could be sorted out. However, Jane Stanford insisted that the university remain in operation. When the lawsuit was finally dropped in 1895, a university holiday was declared.[tpl]cite book | title=Stanford: The Story of a University | author=Mirrielees, Edith R. | year=1959 | publisher=G. P.

Crothers | author=Clausen, Henry C. | publisher=The George E. Crothers Trust | year=1967 | lccn=67017964 | pages=41–56[/tpl]
Jane Stanford's actions were sometimes eccentric. In 1897, she directed the board of trustees "that the students be taught that everyone born on earth has a soul germ, and that on its development depends much in life here and everything in Life Eternal".[tpl]cite book|last=Starr|first=Kevin|title=Americans and the California Dream|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=1973|page=329|chapter=Life Among the Best and Truest: David Starr Jordan and the Founding of Stanford University |isbn=0-19-501644-0[/tpl] She forbade students from sketching nude models in life-drawing class, banned automobiles from campus, and did not allow a hospital to be constructed so that people would not form an impression that Stanford was unhealthy. Between 1899 and 1905, she spent $3 million on a grand construction scheme building lavish memorials to the Stanford family, while university faculty and self-supporting students were living in poverty.
However, overall, Jane Stanford contributed significantly to the university. Faced with the possibility of financial ruin for the institution, she took charge of financial, administrative, and development matters at the university 1893–1905. For the next several years, she paid salaries out of her personal resources, even pawning her jewelry to keep the university going. In 1901, she transferred $30 million in assets, nearly all her remaining wealth, to the university;[tpl]cite news|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40A12FC3E5911738DDDA90994DA415B818CF1D3 |title=Stanford University Gets $30,000,000 |publisher=New York Times |date=December 10, 1901[/tpl] upon her death in 1905, she left the university nearly $4 million of her remaining $7 million. In total, the Stanfords donated around $40 million in assets to the university, over $1 billion in 2010 dollars.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=UhhKAAAAIBAJ&sjid=PiENAAAAIBAJ&pg=1757%2C3477578 |title=Stanford Estate Worth Seven Millions |publisher=The Evening News |date=April 5, 1905[/tpl]

===Post-Founders (1906–1941)===

The year after Jane Stanford's death, the 1906 San Francisco earthquake damaged parts of the campus and caused new financial and structural problems, though only two people on campus were killed. Some of the early construction, especially from the second phase between Leland Stanford's death in 1893 and Jane Stanford's death in 1905, was destroyed by the earthquake. The university retains the Quad, part of the Museum, the old Chemistry Building (which is not in use, has been boarded up since  1986, and was subsequently damaged in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake),[tpl]cite web|title=15 years after Loma Prieta earthquake, tardy temblor yields trove of data|url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2004/october13/Quakes-1013.html|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=20 December 2013[/tpl] and Encina Hall (then the men's undergraduate dormitory). The earthquake destroyed parts of the Main Quad, including the original iteration of Memorial Church and the gate that first marked the entrance of the school, as well as a partially built main library. Rebuilding on a somewhat less grandiose scale began immediately.
Jordan, the first president, stepped down in 1913 and was succeeded for two years by John Casper Branner.  Branner was followed by Ray Lyman Wilbur, who was president from 1916 until 1943, except when he took leave to serve as Secretary of the Interior under President Herbert Hoover. Hoover along with his wife, Lou Henry Hoover, were among the first graduates of Stanford.  Herbert Hoover was also a trustee of the university. The house they had built on campus as their own residence, Lou Henry Hoover House, became the University president's house after the death of Lou Henry Hoover in 1944.

===World War II and late 20th century===

After Ray Lyman Wilbur retired in 1943 in the midst of World War II, Donald Tresidder, president of the Board of Trustees, took over as president until his unexpected death in early 1948.  In 1949 Wallace Sterling became president (1949-1968) and he oversaw the rise of Stanford as a regional university to one of the most prestigious universities in the United States.   He was succeeded by Kenneth Pitzer from Rice University who lasted only 19 months having stepped in just as the university entered its most tumultuous period of student protests.  Richard Lyman, former provost, was president from 1971 until 1980; Donald Kennedy also a former provost was president from 1980 until 1992 when he resigned during the midst of a controversy over finances with the U.S. Government.   The Board of Trustees brought in an outsider, Gerhard Casper, from the University of Chicago who was president until 2000.

====High tech====

A powerful sense of regional solidarity accompanied the rise of Silicon Valley. From the 1890s, the university's leaders saw its mission as service to the West and shaped the school accordingly. At the same time, the perceived exploitation of the West at the hands of eastern interests fueled booster-like attempts to build self-sufficient indigenous local industry. Thus, regionalism helped align Stanford's interests with those of the area's high-tech firms for the first fifty years of Silicon Valley's development. The distinctive regional ethos of the West during the first half of the 20th century is an ingredient of Silicon Valley's already prepared environment, an ingredient that would-be replicators ignore at their peril.[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1093/es/khg025 | last1 = Adams | first1 = Stephen B. | year = 2003 | title = Regionalism in Stanford's Contribution to the Rise of Silicon Valley | url = | journal = Enterprise & Society | volume = 4 | issue = 3| pages = 521–543 [/tpl]
During the 1940s and 1950s, Frederick Terman, as dean of engineering and later as provost, encouraged faculty and graduates to start their own companies. He is credited with nurturing Hewlett-Packard, Varian Associates, and other high-tech firms, until what would become Silicon Valley grew up around the Stanford campus. Terman is often called "the father of Silicon Valley."Carolyn E. Tajnai, Fred Terman, The Father of Silicon Valley; 1985 netvalley.com background Terman encouraged William B. Shockley, co-inventor of the transistor, to return to his hometown of Palo Alto. In 1956 he established the Shockley Transistor Laboratory.[tpl]cite web|url=http://forum.stanford.edu/carolyn/valley_of_hearts|title=From the Valley of Heart's Delight to the Silicon Valley: A Study of Stanford University's Role in the Transformation|publisher=©Carolyn E.Tajnai|date=December 1996|accessdate=2014-01-16[/tpl]

====Biology====

The biological sciences department evolved rapidly from 1946 to 1972 as its research focus changed, due to the Cold War and other historically significant conditions external to academia. Stanford science went through three phases of experimental direction during that time. In the early 1950s the department remained fixed in the classical independent and self-directed research mode, shunning interdisciplinary collaboration and excessive government funding. Between the 1950s and mid-1960s biological research shifted focus to the molecular level. Then, from the late 1960s onward, Stanford's goal became applying research and findings toward humanistic ends. Each phase was preempted by larger social issues, such as the escalation of the Cold War, the launch of Sputnik, and public concern over medical abuses.[tpl]cite book|author=Eric J.; Vettel|title= Historical Studies in the Physical & Biological Sciences (The Protean Nature of Stanford University's Biological Sciences, 1946–1972)|year=2004|pages=95–113[/tpl]

====Physics====

In 1962 through 1970, negotiations took place between the Cambridge Electron Accelerator Laboratory (shared by Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology), the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, and the US Atomic Energy Commission over the proposed 1970 construction of the Stanford Positron Electron Asymmetric Ring (SPEAR). It would be the first US electron-positron colliding beam storage ring. Paris (2001) explores the competition and cooperation between the two university laboratories and presents diagrams of the proposed facilities, charts detailing location factors, and the parameters of different project proposals between 1967 and 1970. Several rings were built in Europe during the five years that it took to obtain funding for the project, but the extensive project revisions resulted in a superior design that was quickly constructed and paved the way for Nobel Prizes in 1976 for Burton Richter and in 1995 for Martin Perl.[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1525/hsps.2001.31.2.355 | last1 = Paris | first1 = Elizabeth | year = 2001 | title = Lords of the Ring: the Fight to Build the First U.S. Electron-positron Collider | url = | journal = Historical Studies in the Physical & Biological Sciences | volume = 31 | issue = 2| pages = 355–380 [/tpl]
During 1955–85, solid state technology research and development at Stanford University followed three waves of industrial innovation made possible by support from private corporations, mainly Bell Telephone Laboratories, Shockley Semiconductor, Fairchild Semiconductor, and Xerox PARC. In 1969 the Stanford Research Institute operated one of the four original nodes that comprised ARPANET, predecessor to the Internet.[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Lécuyer | first1 = Christophe | year = 2005 | title = What Do Universities Really Owe Industry?

====Civil rights====

Though Stanford has never officially prohibited the admission of black students, people of Asian descent, or Native Americans, it did not treat them equally with those considered as White. Discrimination also existed against non-Christians. (The first Black graduate was Ernest Houston Johnson in 1895 who received a degree in economics.)[ref]
</ref>
In 1957 the Board of Trustees adopted a policy stating:
 
 "The University is opposed to discriminatory racial and religious clauses and practices. Insofar as such clauses or practices presently exist, the University will work actively with student groups to eliminate them at the earliest possible date"
Though this was relatively easy for the housing the university directly controlled, it had to work with the fraternities which invite their own membership (no sororities existed on campus at this time).  In 1960, the Alpha Tau Omega chapter had its national charter revoked after refusing to retract the pledging of four Jewish students.[ref]
</ref>
And in 1962 Sigma Nu (Beta Chi chapter) seceded from the national organization over the national organization's continuing refusal to drop bans on "Negros and Orientals".[ref]
</ref>

As of late 1962 only the Kappa Alpha fraternity still officially discriminated due the national organization's rules.  However in April 1965 the local Sigma Chi chapter pledged Kenneth M. Washington and was suspended allegedly for violating rules on rituals.[ref]
</ref><ref name="sigmachiNYTB">
</ref>
Though Sigma Chi officially had removed its no whites policy in 1961 it had then instituted  requirements that all members had to be approved by a national committee and that pledges be socially acceptable to other members anywhere.  President Sterling then sent a letter to the presidents of all universities with Sigma Chi chapters supporting the local chapter and pointing out that University recognition of racially discriminatory groups could violate the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  The suspension continued until Kenneth Washington's poor grades required him to resign anyway from the chapter.  In November 1966 the Stanford chapter unanimously severed ties with the national fraternity.[ref]
</ref>

The university started actively recruiting minorities in the 1960s. The minorities started organizing and "in five years, students founded the six major community organizations: the Black Student Union (BSU) in 1967, the Asian American Students’ Association (AASA) and the Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan (MEChA) in 1969, the Stanford American Indian Organization (SAIO) in 1970, the Gay People’s Union in 1971 and the Women’s Collective in 1972."

====Government expenses controversy====

In the early 1990s, Stanford was investigated by the U.S. government over allegations that the university had inappropriately billed the government several million dollars for housing, personal expenses, travel, entertainment, fundraising and other activities unrelated to research, including a yacht and an elaborate wedding ceremony.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/13/us/us-seeks-refunds-of-research-costs.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm | work=The New York Times | first=Robert | last=Pear | title=U.S. Seeks Refunds Of Research Costs | date=January 13, 1992[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Folkenflik|first=David|title=What Happened to Stanford's Expense Scandal?|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1994-11-20/news/1994324051_1_stanford-incidental-expenses-auditors|newspaper=Baltimore Sun|date=November 20, 1994[/tpl] The scandal eventually led to the resignation of Stanford President Donald Kennedy in 1992.

===21st century===

Since 2000, Stanford has expanded dramatically. In February 2012, Stanford announced the conclusion of the Stanford Challenge. In a period of five years, Stanford raised $6.2 billion, exceeding its initial goal by $2 billion, making it the most successful university fundraising campaign in history.[tpl]cite news|title=Stanford Nets $6.2 billion in 5-year Campaign|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/09/stanford-university-nets-_n_1265100.html|publisher=The Huffington Post | date=February 9, 2012[/tpl] The funds will go towards 103 new endowed faculty appointments, 360 graduate student research fellowships, scholarships and financial aid, and the construction or renovation of 38 campus buildings. It enabled the construction of the world's largest facility dedicated exclusively to stem cell research, an entirely new campus for the business school, added dramatically to the law school, a brand-new engineering quad, created a new art and art history building, an on-campus concert hall, a new art museum, and a planned expansion of the medical school, among others.[tpl]cite web|title=Stanford Concludes Transformative Campaign|url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2012/february/stanford-challenge-concludes-020812.html[/tpl] In 2012, Stanford opened the Stanford Center at Peking University, a just-under [tpl]convert|400000|sqft|m2|adj=on[/tpl], three-story research center at the heart of Peking University. The ceremony featured remarks by U.S. Ambassador to China Gary Locke, Stanford President John Hennessy, and Peking University Party Chief Zhu Shanlu. Stanford became the first U.S. university to have its own building on a major Chinese University campus.[tpl]cite web|title=Stanford Center Opens in Beijing|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/cndy/2012-03/22/content_14885689.htm|publisher=China Daily[/tpl]
Other Stanford programs underwent notable expansion as well, such as the Stanford in Washington Program's creation of the Stanford in Washington Art Gallery in Woodley Park, Washington, D.C., and the Stanford in Florence program's move to Palazzo Capponi, a 15th-century Renaissance palace.[tpl]cite web|title=Stanford in Washington Art Gallery|url=http://siwgallery.stanford.edu/[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Hennessy Visits BOSP Florence|url=http://www.stanforddaily.com/2012/05/18/hennessy-visits-bosp-in-florence/[/tpl] The university completed the James H.

Clark.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/default/article/Simply-the-best-Stanford-s-Clark-Center-2571461.php |title=Simply the best / Stanford's Clark Center expertly blends traditional, modern design - SFGate |publisher=SFGate.com |date= October 13, 2003|accessdate=December 20, 2013 |first=John |last=King[/tpl]
In 2011, Stanford created the first PhD program in Stem cell science in the United States. The program is housed at Stanford Medical School.[tpl]cite web|title=Stanford creates first PhD program in stem cell science|url=http://med.stanford.edu/ism/2011/april/stem-phd.html|publisher=Stanford.edu[/tpl]
Undergraduate admission selectivity also increased, with the acceptance rate dropping from 13% for the class of 2004 to 5.07% for the class of 2018. Stanford's reputation, competitive admissions, and strong legacy of entrepreneurship have contributed to the East-West rivalry between Stanford and such institutions as Harvard University, Princeton University and Yale University.[tpl]cite web|title=Is Stanford Invading Harvard-Yale Turf?|url=http://www.yaleherald.com/archive/xxx/2000.11.16/features/front.html[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Grafton: Welcome to Princeford|url=http://dailyprincetonian.com/opinion/2009/10/grafton-welcome-to-princeford/[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Technology and Education|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2000/6/8/technology-and-education-pthe-salad-days/[/tpl]

==Campus==

===Main campus===

Stanford University is located on an [tpl]convert|8180|acre|ha|sing=on[/tpl] campus on the San Francisco Peninsula, in the northwest part of the Santa Clara Valley (Silicon Valley) approximately [tpl]convert|37|mi|km|0|sp=us[/tpl] southeast of San Francisco and approximately [tpl]convert|20|mi|km[/tpl] northwest of San Jose. The main campus is adjacent to Palo Alto, bounded by El Camino Real, Stanford Avenue, Junipero Serra Boulevard, and Sand Hill Road. The university also operates at several more remote locations (see below).
Stanford's main campus is a census-designated place within unincorporated Santa Clara County, although some of the university land (including the Stanford Shopping Center and the Stanford Research Park) is within the city limits of Palo Alto. The campus also includes much land in unincorporated San Mateo County (including the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve), as well as in the city limits of Menlo Park (Stanford Hills neighborhood), Woodside, and Portola Valley.[tpl]cite web |url=http://facts.stanford.edu/about/lands |title=The Stanford Lands|accessdate=December 20, 2013[/tpl] The United States Postal Service has assigned Stanford two ZIP codes: 94305 for campus mail and 94309 for P.O. box mail. It lies within area code 650.
The university campus was listed by Travel + Leisure in September 2011 as one of the most beautiful campuses in the United States[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.travelandleisure.com/articles/americas-most-beautiful-college-campuses/3|title=America's Most Beautiful College Campuses|publisher=Travel+Leisure|date= September 2011|accessdate=[/tpl] and by MSN as one of the most beautiful college campuses in the world.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.howzit.msn.com/gallery.aspx?cp-documentid=159476712&page=8|title=Stanford University - Most beautiful universities|publisher=MSN[/tpl]

===Other campuses===

Stanford currently operates or intends to operate in various locations outside of its main campus.

===Faculty residences===

One of the benefits of being a Stanford faculty member is the "Faculty Ghetto", where faculty members can live within walking or biking distance of campus.[tpl]cite web|title=Stanford Faculty Staff Housing|url=http://fsh.stanford.edu/index.shtml|accessdate=20 December 2013[/tpl] The Faculty Ghetto is composed of land owned entirely by Stanford. Similar to a condominium, the houses can be bought and sold but the land under the houses is rented on a 99-year lease. Houses in the "Ghetto" appreciate and depreciate, but not as rapidly as overall Silicon Valley values. However, it remains an expensive area in which to own property, and the average price of single-family homes on campus is actually higher than in Palo Alto. Stanford itself enjoys the rapid capital gains of Silicon Valley landowners, although by the terms of its founding the university cannot sell the land.

===Landmarks===

Contemporary campus landmarks include the Main Quad and Memorial Church, the Cantor Center for Visual Arts and art gallery, the Stanford Mausoleum and the Angel of Grief, Hoover Tower, the Rodin sculpture garden, the Papua New Guinea Sculpture Garden, the Arizona Cactus Garden, the Stanford University Arboretum, Green Library and the Dish. Frank Lloyd Wright's 1937 Hanna–Honeycomb House and the 1919 Lou Henry Hoover House are both listed on the National Historic Register.

Western Association of Schools and Colleges.[tpl]cite web|url=https://wasc.stanford.edu/ |title=WASC—Stanford Reaccreditation by WASC |publisher=Stanford University Registrar's Office |accessdate=December 20, 2013[/tpl]
Stanford has been among the most selective institutions in the world for many years, and beginning with the class of 2017, has become the most selective research university in the United States for undergraduates (even more so than Harvard). For the class of 2016, Stanford received 36,631 applications and accepted 2427 or 6.6%, the second lowest in the country.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.stanforddaily.com/2012/03/30/class-of-2016-admit-rate-at-historic-low/ | title=Class of 2016 admit rate at historic low | publisher=Stanford Daily | date=30 March 2012 | accessdate=16 April 2014 | author=Islani, Ellora[/tpl] Its most recent admit rate (for the class of 2018) further dropped to 5.07%, which was the lowest in the university's history.
Full-time undergraduate tuition was $42,690 for 2013–2014.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ucomm.stanford.edu/cds/2013 |title=Common Data Set |year=2013 |publisher=Stanford University |accessdate=December 20, 2013[/tpl] Stanford's admission process is need-blind for US citizens and permanent residents; while it is not need-blind for international students, 64% are on need-based aid, with an average aid package of $31,411. In 2012/13, the university awarded $126 million in need-based financial aid to 3,485 students, with an average aid package of $40,460.  Eighty percent of students are on some form of financial aid. Stanford's no-loan policy waives tuition, room, and board for most families with incomes below $60,000, and most families with incomes below $100,000 are not required to pay tuition (those with incomes up to $150,000 may have tuition significantly reduced).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/dept/finaid/undergrad/how/enhancements.html |title=Financial Aid—Enchancements for 2008–2009 |publisher=Stanford University |accessdate=November 27, 2008[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=December 2013[/tpl] 17% of students receive Pell Grants, a common measure of low-income students at a college.
The University is currently organized into seven academic schools.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/academics/schools.html |title=Stanford's Seven Schools |publisher=Stanford University |accessdate=December 20, 2013[/tpl] The schools of Humanities and Sciences (27 departments), Engineering (9 departments), and Earth Sciences (4 departments) have both graduate and undergraduate programs while the Schools of Law, Medicine, Education and Business have graduate programs only. Stanford follows a quarter system with Autumn quarter usually starting in late September and Spring Quarter ending in early June.

===Research centers and institutes===

The Stanford Office of the Vice Provost and Dean of Research oversees more than eighteen independent laboratories, centers, and institutes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://doresearch.stanford.edu/research-scholarship/interdisciplinary-laboratories-centers-and-institutes|title=Interdisciplinary Laboratories, Centers, and Institutes|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=2014-01-22[/tpl]
Other Stanford-affiliated institutions include the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (originally the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center), the Stanford Research Institute (a now independent institution which originated at the university), the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace (a major public policy think tank that attracts visiting scholars from around the world), and the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design (a multidisciplinary design school in cooperation with the Hasso Plattner Institute of University of Potsdam that integrates product design, engineering, and business management education). Unable to locate a copy in any of its libraries, the Soviet Union was obliged to ask the Hoover Institution for a microfilm copy of its original edition of the first issue of Pravda (dated March 5, 1917).[ref]

Stanford's dance community is one of the most vibrant in the country, with an active dance division in the Drama Department and over 30 different dance-related student groups, including the Stanford Band's Dollie dance troupe.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl] Perhaps most distinctive of all is its social and vintage dance community, cultivated by dance historian Richard Powers and enjoyed by hundreds of students and thousands of alumni. Stanford hosts monthly informal dances (called Jammix) and large quarterly dance events, including Ragtime Ball (fall), the Stanford Viennese Ball (winter), and Big Dance (spring). Stanford also boasts a student-run swing performance troupe called Swingtime and several alumni performance groups, including Decadance and the Academy of Danse Libre.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl]
The creative writing program brings young writers to campus via the Stegner Fellowships and other graduate scholarship programs. This Boy's Life author Tobias Wolff teaches writing to undergraduates and graduate students. Knight Journalism Fellows are invited to spend a year at the campus taking seminars and courses of their choice. There is also an extracurricular writing and performance group called the Stanford Spoken Word Collective, which also serves as the school's poetry slam team.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl]
Stanford also hosts various publishing courses for professionals. Stanford Professional Publishing Course, which was offered on campus since the late 1970s, brought together international publishing professionals to discuss changing business models in magazine and book publishing. It ended in 2009, although the tradition has continued at Yale with the Yale Publishing Course that began in 2010.

==Student life==

===Student body===

Stanford enrolled 7,061 undergraduate and 11,075 graduate students as of October 2013, and women comprised 47% of undergraduates and 41% of professional and graduate students. In the same academic year, the freshman retention rate was 99%.
As for comparison, Stanford awarded 1,715 undergraduate degrees, 2,278 Master's degrees, 764 doctoral degrees, and 366 professional degrees in the 2011–2012 school year. The four-year graduation rate in the class of 2011 is 76%, and the six-year rate is 96%. The relatively low four-year graduation rate is a function of the university's coterminal degree (or "coterm") program, which allows students to earn a Master's degree as an extension of their undergraduate program.[tpl]cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/college/highest-grad-rate |title=Best Colleges—Education—US News and World Report |publisher=Colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com |date=August 19, 2009 |accessdate=July 9, 2010[/tpl]

Most residences are co-ed; seven are all-male fraternities, three are all-female sororities, and there is also one all-female non-sorority house, Roth House. In most residences, men and women live on the same floor, but a few dorms are configured for men and women to live on separate floors (single-gender floors), including all Wilbur dorms except for Arroyo and Okada.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/dept/rde/shs/ugrad/wilbur.htm#junipero |title=Stanford University—Student Housing—Tour Undergraduate Housing |publisher=Stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=July 9, 2010[/tpl] Beginning in 2009–10, the University's housing plan anticipates that all freshmen desiring to live in all-freshman dorms will be accommodated. In the 2009–10 year, almost two-thirds of freshmen will be housed in Stern and Wilbur Halls. The one-third who requested four-class housing will be located in other dormitories throughout campus, including Florence Moore (FloMo).[tpl]cite web|url=http://parents.stanford.edu/newsletter/09fall/golder.html |title=Parents' Newsletter, Fall 2009—Golder looks to improve life and learning in the residences |publisher=Stanford University |accessdate=September 16, 2009[/tpl] In April 2008, Stanford unveiled a new pilot plan to test out gender-neutral housing in five campus residences, allowing males and females to live in the same room.

Another famous style of housing at Stanford is the co-ops. These houses feature cooperative living, where residents and eating associates each contribute work to keep the house running, such as cooking meals or cleaning shared spaces. The co-ops on campus are Chi Theta Chi, Columbae, Enchanted Broccoli Forest (EBF), Hammarskjöld (which is also the International Theme House), Kairos, Terra (the unofficial LGBT house),[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/resed/cgi-bin/row/terra/drupal/|title=About Terra|work=ResEd|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=August 22, 2013[/tpl] and Synergy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/dept/resed/Staff/StaffResources/StudentMgmt/CoOps.html |title=Residential Education—Cooperative Houses |publisher=Stanford University |accessdate=November 27, 2008[/tpl]
At any time, around 50 percent of the graduate population lives on campus. Now that construction has concluded on the new Munger graduate residence, this percentage has probably increased. First-year graduate students are guaranteed housing.

===Athletics===

Stanford currently has 36 varsity sports (18 female, 15 male, one coed), 19 club sports[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/dept/pe/cgi-bin/cardinalrec/clubsports/|title=Stanford Cardinal Recreation - Club Sports|publisher= Stanford University|accessdate=2014-02-04[/tpl] and 37 intramural sports—about 800 students participate in intercollegiate sports with an offer of about 300 athletic scholarships. The sports teams are now officially referred to as the "Stanford Cardinal", which is a "mascot" name adopted in 1972 after the abandonment of the previous "Indians" owing to racial insensitivity complained by Native American students, referring to the deep red color, not the cardinal bird. It is a member of the Pacific-12 Conference and the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation with the participation in the inter-collegiate NCAA's Division I FBS.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.norpacfieldhockey.com/ |title=NorPac |publisher=i2i Interactive |year=2007 |accessdate=June 8, 2007[/tpl]
Its traditional sports rival is Berkeley, the neighbor to the north in the East Bay. The winner of the annual "Big Game" between the Cal and Cardinal football teams gains custody of the Stanford Axe. The first "Big Game", played at Haight Street Park in San Francisco on March 19, 1892, established football on the west coast. Stanford won 14 to 10 in front of 8 thousand spectators. Stanford's football team played in the first Rose Bowl in 1902. However, the violence of the sport at the time, coupled with the post-game rioting of drunken spectators, led San Francisco to bar further "Big Games" in the city in 1905. In 1906, David Starr Jordan banned football from Stanford. The 1906–1914 "Big Game" contests featured rugby instead of football. Stanford football was resumed in 1919.[tpl]cite book|last=Starr|first=Kevin|title=Americans and the California Dream|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=1973|pages=336–338|chapter=Life Among the Best and Truest: David Starr Jordan and the Founding of Stanford University |isbn=0-19-501644-0[/tpl]

The Big Game Gaieties started in 1911 (when the Big Game was rugby) but did not acquire its present name until the 1920s when it also became part of Rams Head.  The tradition was dormant from 1968 until revived in 1976 and has run ever since.

===Religious life===

Students and staff at Stanford are of many different religions. The university has 
an Office for Religious Life whose mission is "to guide, nurture and enhance spiritual, religious and ethical life within the Stanford University community" by promoting enriching dialogue, meaningful ritual, and enduring friendships among people of all religious backgrounds. It is headed by a dean with the assistance of a senior associate dean and an associate dean.  
Stanford Memorial Church, located in the center of campus, has a Sunday University Public Worship service (UPW) usually in the "Protestant Ecumenical Christian" tradition where the Memorial Church Choir sings and a sermon is preached usually by one of the Stanford deans for Religious Life.  UPW sometimes has multifaith services.  In addition the church is used by the Catholic community and by some of the other Christian denominations at Stanford.  Weddings happen most Saturdays and the university has for over 20 years allowed blessings of same-gender relationships and now legal weddings.
In addition to the church, the Office for Religious Life has a Center for Inter-Religious Community, Learning and Experiences (CIRCLE) located on the third floor of Old Union. It offers a common room, an interfaith sanctuary, a seminar room, a student lounge area and a reading room, as well as offices housing a number of Stanford Associated Religions (SAR) member groups and the Senior Associate Dean and Associate Dean for Religious Life. Most though not all religious student groups belong to SAR. The SAR directory includes organizations that serve: atheist, Baha'i, Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Islam, Jewish, and Sikh though the groups vary year by year.
Some religions have a larger and more formal presence on campus in addition to the student groups; these include the Catholic Community at Stanford[ref]

The Catholic Community is a personal parish in the Diocese of San Jose and staffed by the Dominicans and lay leaders.
[/ref] and  Hillel at Stanford.

===Greek life===

Fraternities and sororities have been active on the Stanford campus since 1891, when the University first opened. In 1944, University President Donald Tresidder banned all Stanford sororities due to extreme competition.[tpl]cite web|url=http://chapters.kappakappagamma.org/betaeta/pages/our-chapter.php |title=Kappa Kappa Gamma |publisher=Chapters.kappakappagamma.org |date=April 26, 1944 |accessdate=July 9, 2010[/tpl] However, following Title IX, the Board of Trustees lifted the 33-year ban on sororities in 1977.Chi Omega – Nu Alpha – History. Cgi.stanford.edu. Retrieved on July 15, 2013. Stanford is now home to 29 Greek organizations, including 13 sororities and 16 fraternities, representing 13% of undergraduates. In contrast to many universities, nine of the ten housed Greek organizations live in University-owned houses, the exception being Sigma Chi, which owns its own house (but not the land) on The Row. Six chapters are members of the African American Fraternal and Sororal Association, 11 chapters are members of the Interfraternity Council, 6 chapters belong to the Intersorority Council, and 6 chapters belong to the Multicultural Greek Council.[tpl]cite web|url=http://osa.stanford.edu/greek/learn/whatis.htm |title=What is Greek Life @ Stanford? |publisher=Osa.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=July 9, 2010[/tpl]

===Student groups===

Stanford offers its students the opportunity to engage in over 650 groups.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/dept/uga/student/organizations/index.html |title=Student Organizations[/tpl] Groups are often, though not always, partially funded by the University via allocations directed by the student government organization, the ASSU. These funds include "special fees", which are decided by a Spring Quarter vote by the student body. Groups span from Athletic/Recreational (see section on Athletics), Careers/Pre-professional, Community Service, Ethnic/Cultural, Fraternities/Sororities, Health/Counseling, Media/Publications, Music/Dance/Creative Arts (see section on Arts), Political/Social Awareness to Religious/Philosophical.
Among publications the Stanford Daily is the daily newspaper serving Stanford University. Now an independent organization (to protect both it and the university from potential conflicts of interest) though located on campus,  it has been published since the University was founded in 1892. The student-run radio station, KZSU Stanford 90.1 FM, features freeform music programming, sports commentary, and news segments; it started in 1947 as an AM radio station.  Literary magazines such as the Leland Quarterly[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lelandquarterly.com/ |title=Leland Quarterly[/tpl] provide creative outlets.
Business oriented groups run from the immediately useful SUpost.com, an online marketplace for Stanford students and alumni, in partnership with Stanford Student Enterprises (SSE) to the Stanford Pre-Business Association[tpl]cite web|url=http://spba.stanford.edu |title=SPBA|accessdate=2014-02-16[/tpl] which is the largest business-focused undergraduate organization. The latter plays an instrumental role in establishing an active link between the industry, alumni, and student communities. Stanford Finance is a pre-professional organization aimed at mentoring students who want to enter a career in finance, through mentors and internships.  The Business Association of Stanford Entrepreneurial Students (BASES), is one of the largest professional organizations in Silicon Valley, with over 5,000 members. Its goal is to support the next generation of entrepreneurs.  Stanford Women In Business (SWIB) is an on-campus business organization consisting of over a board of 40 and 100 active members. Each year, SWIB organizes over 25 events and workshops, hosts a winter and spring conference, and provides mentorship and spring quarter internships.  StartX is a non-profilt startup accelerator for student and faculty-led startups"12% of Stanford has applied to StartX" http://startx.stanford.edu/#about that over 12% of the study body has applied to.  It is staffed primarily by students.
