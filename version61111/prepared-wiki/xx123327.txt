She endured a stern cultural upbringing, which ultimately fostered discipline and an inherent passion for the arts as a child, where she could freely express herself. "When I was in grade school, I wanted to become a concert pianist", Matiko said, who began playing piano at just four years of age. "I had always been taught to stifle my emotions, so if something upset me, I would go to my piano and play an angry concerto." In high school, she auditioned for the Young Americans where she was taught singing, dancing and performing in a conservatory setting.
She was an Environmental Engineering major at UCLA. While still in college, she auditioned for the first national tour of Miss Saigon,and suddenly her career path took a sharp detour. She traded an ROTC scholarship for the role of "Gigi/Mimi" when she was picked by producer Cameron Macintosh at her first professional audition for the First National tour of Miss Saigon. Thus, Matiko set out to travel the country. While on the road, she continued taking academic classes at community colleges, in addition to acting, singing and dancing courses. From the Berklee College of Music in Boston to the Cleveland Institute of Music, she sought out the best instructions in virtually every city. While on the road in Boston, within hour of watching THE JOY LUCK CLUB with fellow cast member Minae Noji (General Hospital), Matiko decided she wanted to be a film actress. After leaving Miss Saigon, Matiko returned to Los Angeles where she embarked on a rigorous regimen of acting lessons. "I feel I’ve been training like an Olympic athlete.", Matiko said.
In 2008, Matiko finished her degree from UCLA during the Hollywood Writer's Strike.
