[[Heat Rush]]

CATEGORIES: Beyoncé fragrances

Heat Rush  is a second fragrance endorsed by American singer Beyoncé Knowles. In February 2011, Knowles released the perfume as a sister scent to Heat. While Heat is billed as an "overtly sexy" fragrance, Heat Rush is intended to be more for daytime use.[tpl]cite web|author=Naughton, Julie |url=http://www.wwd.com/beauty-industry-news/beyonc-to-launch-heat-rush-scent-3339113 |title=Beyoncé to Launch Heat Rush Scent - Fragrance - Beauty |work=Women's Wear Daily|publisher=Fairchild Fashion Media |date=2010-10-15 |accessdate=2011-09-04[/tpl] Knowles' official parfum website describes Heat Rush intent and purpose, stating "Heat Rush shines, sparkles and excites the moment it touches the skin. Surrounded by a luminous fragrant aura, the woman who wears it feels instantly effervescent and alive. Sensual and bright, the scent lights up a room just as Beyoncé captivates with her presence."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.beyonceparfums.com/heat-rush |title=Heat Rush | Beyoncé Parfums |publisher=Beyonceparfums.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-07[/tpl]
According to Steve Mormoris, Senior Vice President of Marketing, Coty Beauty, "This fragrance is inspired by the bright and subtle sensuality that transcends every aspect of Beyoncé's life."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stylemagazine.com/introducing-beyonce-heat-rush/ |title=Introducing Beyoncé Heat Rush|work=Houston Style Magazine |date=2010-11-30 |accessdate=2011-09-10[/tpl] Knowles commented on the scent's "Rush" aspect stating: "I created Heat Rush to bring the feeling of warmth and sensuality to every woman who wears it. It’s feminine and sexy, fresh and beautiful."

==Design and conception==

New fragrance project working sessions took place backstage in Newcastle upon Tyne, England in November 2009.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.beyonceparfums.com/heat-rush/media/videos |title=Heat Rush | Beyoncé Parfums |publisher=Beyonceparfums.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-07[/tpl] During the new fragrance project working sessions, Knowles deciphered through different scents, later choosing a "Sunset Cocktail Mod 5" scent because it made her feel "as though a breeze were coming through the room" and seemed "like more of a risk." In an interview with Perfumer, Honorine Blanc declared that "a woman in love with Heat Rush is in control of her personality and sensuality." Blanc revealed that the orange color was very important to the fragrance's bottle design, for its vibrancy and energy that it adds to the scent, and added that Knowles' sensuality as well as sexuality inspired the perfume's re-release. Blanc also commented that the construction of the scent's bottle is very important, for it needed to find the right balance where everything works together. Blanc took on an appreciation for Knowles while working with her, stating that her drive is what inspired her to work on the fragrance more. She stated:
 
 Beyoncé, she lives her passion. She's so sensual, and she's so powerful. And she puts it out there, she's not afraid of it. She's very involved in the fragrance. She knows what she wants. I always had more feedback from her; I always had to have more signature and stronger all the time.

Heat Rush is a fruity floral fragrance that is luminous and vibrant with a dewy delicacy at the same time.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.beyonceparfums.com/heat-rush/fragrance |title=Heat Rush | Beyoncé Parfums |publisher=Beyonceparfums.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-07[/tpl] It is set to capture Knowles' bright sensuality; it is "young, fresh, and joyful." In the fragrance's top notes, Heat Rush instantly captures attention with sparkling top notes of passion fruit, blood orange and brazilian cherry. The scent's heart notes are set to embody Knowles' ultra-feminine side with a delicate floral bouquet built upon a carefully blended combination of yellow tiger orchid, mango blossom and orange hibiscus. The scent finishes in its base notes with a subtle and alluring hints of teak wood, honey amber and a Musk accord that is inspired by the sunsets in Brazil. As stated by Knowles, "Heat is a spicier scent and is bursting with the Red Vanilla Orchid. Heat Rush is fresher and lighter and the Yellow Tiger Orchid is the top note in the fragrance. I love them both for different reasons but they both feature my favorite flower, which is the orchid."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.teenvogue.com/beauty/celebrity-beauty/2011-03/beyonce-knowles-fragrance-interview?slide=8|title=Beyoncé Knowles on Her New Fragrance, Body Image, and Her Upcoming Album|work=Teen Vogue|publisher=Condé Nast Publications|first=Phillip|last=Picardi|page=8|issn=1540-2215|date=March 2011|accessdate=2013-05-30[/tpl] She further stated that "It may be too much like fruit. Everyone's not gonna like it, but I like it... It's too safe... It's sexy, I like it". Heat Rush is presented in a "sophisticated and dazzling" bright orange flacon. The shapely, feminine base narrows to an elegant gold top with 'Heat' emblazoned on its center. The fragrance itself is a golden hue that mimics the color of the sun. This theme is continued throughout the outer packaging accompanied by warm-toned accents, as described by the Houston's Style Magazine[tpl]'[/tpl]s staff members.
