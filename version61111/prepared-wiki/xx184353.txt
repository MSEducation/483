[[2007–08 Derby County F.C. season]]

CATEGORIES: Derby County F.C. seasons, English football clubs 2007–08 season

The 2007–08 season was Derby County's 109th season in the Football League, their 65th season in the top division of English football and their first season in the top flight since the 2001–02 season. They were promoted after beating West Bromwich Albion 1–0 in the 2007 Championship play-off final.
After a very poor start to the season, manager Billy Davies left the club on 26 November to be replaced by former Wigan Athletic manager Paul Jewell. Jewell failed to turn things around for Derby and the club spent most of the season at the foot of the table, recording a club and top-flight record run of 32 league games without a win.
Derby were officially relegated on 29 March after their 2–2 home draw with fellow strugglers Fulham and Birmingham City's 3–1 victory over Manchester City left them 19 points away from safety with only 6 games left. This made Derby the first club in Premiership history to be relegated in March and only the second in post-war English Football league history.[tpl]cite news |first=Phil |last=McNulty |title=Derby 2–2 Fulham |url=http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/7309363.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=29 March 2008 |accessdate=2008-03-29 [/tpl] They also accumulated the league's lowest points total since the introduction of 3 points for a win with just 11 points, as well as the record for the fewest wins in a Premier League season with just 1 victory in 38 games. 

==Review==

Despite producing a reasonably good performance in a 2–2 draw against Portsmouth on the opening day of the season, followed by a narrow 1–0 defeat away to Sven-Göran Eriksson's Manchester City (the only two games which Derby spent outside the bottom three), Derby made an overall-disastrous start to the Premier League season. Following their 6–0 defeat to Liverpool on 1 September, Irish bookmakers Paddy Power decided to pay out on the club to be relegated after just five games of the new season.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Power+ready+to+pay+out+on+Rams+falling.-a0168224148 |title=Power ready to pay out on Rams falling | first=Mark | last=Langdon |publisher=Racing Post |date=1 September 2007|accessdate=9 November 2013[/tpl] The poor start saw fans accuse Gadsby and the board of failing to invest properly in players for the club.

After taking just 6 points from 14 matches, with their only win being a 1–0 victory over future strugglers Newcastle United, Davies left by mutual consent after a meeting with Adam Pearson, taking nearly all of his newly assembled backroom staff with him.Bily Davies leaves Derby by mutual consent Times online The club had just been beaten 2–0 at home to Chelsea and were rooted to the bottom of the table.

Within two days of Davies's dismissal, on 26 November, Derby appointed highly-rated former Wigan Athletic manager Paul Jewell.Paul Jewell appointed Derby manager Telegraph He initially appointed Stan Ternent as his assistant but, when Ternant left to become Huddersfield Town manager in April, Jewell moved to appoint Chris Hutchings[tpl]cite news| title = Hutchings set to take Derby role| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/derby_county/7364460.stm| publisher = BBC Sport| date = 24 April 2008| accessdate = 2008-04-24[/tpl] who had been his assistant at both Bradford City and Wigan. Jewell's first match in charge was a 1–0 defeat away at Sunderland on 1 December, the winning goal coming in stoppage time. Although performances improved under Jewell, results didn't. The team developed a habit of conceding late goals and following the defeat to Sunderland, Derby conceded late winners or equalisers in seven games between late December and late January, dropping seven points from games they had been winning or drawing. Many at the club had in fact already accepted relegation by the end of December.
Jewell was busy in the January transfer window, selling several players and bringing eight new players in, namely Everton defender Alan Stubbs, Argentine striker Emanuel Villa,[tpl]cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Rams sign Argentine striker Villa |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/derby_county/7166848.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=4 January 2008[/tpl] ex-England international defender Danny Mills on loan from Manchester City, Blackburn midfielder Robbie Savage,[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/blackburn_rovers/7166114.stm|title=Savage completes switch to Derby |date=9 January 2008|publisher=BBC Sport[/tpl] French winger Laurent Robert, Tottenham's Egyptian midfielder Hossam Ghaly on loan,[tpl]cite news| title = Hossam Ghaly recruited for Derby’s rescue effort| url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/premier_league/article3168714.ece| publisher = Timesonline.co.uk	| date = 1 November 2007 | location=London| first1=Gary| last1=Jacob| first2=Peter| last2=Lansley| first3=Nick| last3=Szczepanik[/tpl] Gençlerbirliği's Mile Sterjovski[tpl]cite news| title = Derby complete Sterjovski signing| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/derby_county/7180692.stm| publisher = BBC Sport	| date = 24 January 2007[/tpl] and Rangers goalkeeper Roy Carroll.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/derby_county/7258258.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|title=Carroll Extends Derby Stay|date=22 February 2008[/tpl]
