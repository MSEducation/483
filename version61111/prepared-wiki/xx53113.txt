Quirks & Quarks (Quirks) is the award-winning Canadian weekly science news program heard over CBC Radio One of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC).
Airing since October 8, 1975, Quirks & Quarks is consistently rated among the most popular CBC programs, attracting over 500,000 listeners each Saturday from 12:00 to 13:00.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/quirks/summary.htm |title=CBC Radio : Quirks & Quarks : About the Show|accessdate=2008-10-14 |work= |publisher=CBC Radio |date= |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080624201838/http://www.cbc.ca/quirks/summary.htm  |archivedate = 2008-06-24[/tpl] The show is also heard on Sirius Satellite Radio.

In 2005, Quirks became the first major CBC show available as a podcast. Since the program began, it has won more than 80 national and international journalism awards, including the prestigious Walter Sullivan Award (twice) and the Science Writing Award from the American Institute of Physics (twice). http://www.cbc.ca/quirks/awards/
