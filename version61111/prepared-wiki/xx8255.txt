[[Motel]]

CATEGORIES: Motels, Hotel types, Tourist accommodations

A motor hotel, or motel for short (also known as motor inn, motor court, motor lodge, tourist lodge, cottage court, auto camps, tourist home, tourist cabins, auto cabins, cabin camps, cabin court, or auto court), is a hotel designed for motorists, and usually has a parking area for motor vehicles. Entering dictionaries after World War II, the word motel, coined in 1925 as a portmanteau of motor and hotel or motorists' hotel, referred initially to a type of hotel consisting of a single building of connected rooms whose doors faced a parking lot and, in some circumstances, a common area; or a series of small cabins with common parking. Motels are often privately owned, though motel chains do exist.
As the provincial highways and the United States highway system began to develop in the 1920s, long-distance road journeys became more common, and the need for inexpensive, easily accessible overnight accommodation sited close to the main routes led to the growth of the motel concept. Motels peaked in popularity in the 1960s with rising car travel, only to decline in response to competition from the newer chain hotels which became commonplace at highway interchanges as traffic was bypassed onto newly constructed freeways.

==Architecture==

Motels differ from hotels in their location along highways, as opposed to the urban cores favored by hotels, and their orientation to the outside (in contrast to hotels, whose doors typically face an interior hallway). Motels almost by definition include a parking lot, while older hotels were not usually built with automobile parking in mind.
Because of their low-rise construction, the number of rooms which would fit on any given amount of land was low compared to the high-rise urban hotels which had grown around railway stations. This was not an issue in an era where the major highways became Main Street in every town along the way and inexpensive land at the edge of town could be developed with motels, car lots, filling stations, lumber yards, amusement parks, roadside diners, drive-in restaurants and theatres and countless other small roadside businesses. The automobile brought mobility, and the motel could appear anywhere on the vast network of two-lane highways.

===Layout===

Motels are typically constructed in an "I"-, "L"-, or "U"-shaped layout that includes guest rooms; an attached manager's office; a small reception; in most motels, a swimming pool; and in some cases, a small diner. A motel was typically single-story with rooms opening directly onto a parking lot, making it easy to unload suitcases from a vehicle.[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/motel |title= Motel |publisher= The Free Dictionary By Farlex |accessdate=2012-06-28[/tpl] A second story, if present, would face onto a balcony served by multiple stairwells.
The post-war motels, especially in the early 1950s to late 1960s, sought more visual distinction, often featuring eye-catching colorful neon signs which employed themes from popular culture, ranging from Western imagery of cowboys and Indians to contemporary images of spaceships and atomic era iconography. U.S. Route 66 is the most popular example of the "neon era". Many of these signs remain fully intact to this day.

===Room types===

In some motels, a handful of rooms would be larger and contain kitchenettes or apartment-like amenities; these rooms were marketed at a higher price as "efficiencies" as their occupants could prepare food themselves instead of incurring the cost of eating all meals in restaurants. Rooms with connecting doors (so that two standard rooms could be combined into one larger room) also commonly appeared in both hotels and motels. A few motels (particularly in Niagara Falls, Ontario, where a motel strip extending from Lundy's Lane to the falls has long been marketed to newlyweds) would offer "honeymoon suites" with extra amenities such as whirlpool baths.

==History==

The first campgrounds for automobile tourists were constructed in the late 1910s. Before that, tourists who couldn't afford to stay in a hotel either slept in their cars or pitched their tents in fields alongside the road. These were called auto camps. The modern campgrounds of the 1920s and 1930s provided running water, picnic grounds and restroom facilities. They also kept those pesky "tin can tourists" out of the farmer's fields.

===Auto camps and courts===

Auto camps predated motels by a few years, established in the 1920s as primitive municipal camp sites where travelers pitched their own tents.[tpl]cite news|publisher=Los Angeles Times|title=Hanlon before the Council is favoring a site just outside the city limits for an auto tourist camp|date=February 8, 1923[/tpl] As demand increased, for-profit commercial camps gradually displaced public camp grounds.
Until the first travel trailers became available in the 1930s, auto tourists adapted their cars by adding beds, makeshift kitchens and roof decks. The next step up from the travel trailer was the cabin camp, a primitive but permanent group of structures. During the Great Depression, landholders whose property fronted onto roads in U.S. highway or provincial highway systems built cabins to convert unprofitable land to income; some opened tourist homes. The (usually single-story) buildings for a roadside motel or cabin court were quick and simple to construct, with plans and instructions readily available in how-to and builder's magazines.
Expansion of highway networks would continue unabated through the depression as governments attempted to create employment but the roadside cabin camps were primitive, basically just auto camps with small cabins instead of tents.
The 1935 City Directory for San Diego, California, lists "motel"-type accommodations under Tourist Camps.  One initially could stay in the Depression-era cabin camps for less than a dollar per night but small comforts were few and far between.
Travelers in search of modern amenities soon would find them at cottage courts and tourist courts. The price was higher but the cabins had electricity, indoor bathrooms and occasionally a private garage or carport. They were arranged in attractive clusters or a U-shape. Often, these camps were part of a larger complex containing a filling station, a café and sometimes a corner store. Facilities like the Rising Sun Auto Camp in Glacier National Park and Blue Bonnet Court in Texas were "Mum-and-Pop" facilities on the outskirts of towns that were as quirky as their owners. Auto camps continued in popularity through the Depression years and after World War II, their popularity finally starting to diminish with increasing land costs and changes in consumer demands.
In contrast, though they remained small independent operations, motels quickly adopted a more homogenized appearance and were designed from the start to cater purely to motorists.

===Tourist homes===

In town, tourist homes were private residences advertising rooms for auto travelers. Unlike boarding houses, guests at tourist homes were usually just passing through.[tpl]cite book|author1=John A.

The Negro Motorist Green Book (1936–64) listed lodgings, restaurants, fuel stations, liquor stores, barber and beauty salons without racial restrictions; the smaller Directory of Negro Hotels and Guest Houses in the United States (1939, US Travel Bureau) specialized in accommodations. Segregation of US tourist accommodation would legally be ended by the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and by a court ruling in Heart of Atlanta Motel v. United States affirming that Congress' powers over interstate commerce extend to regulation of local incidents (such as racial discrimination in a motel serving interstate travelers) which might substantially and harmfully affect that commerce.

===Early motels===

The motel concept originated with the Motel Inn of San Luis Obispo, originally called the Milestone Mo-Tel, which was constructed in 1925 by Arthur Heineman (although some earlier motels that dated to 1915 have been discovered). In conceiving of a name for his hotel, Heineman abbreviated motor hotel to mo-tel after he could not fit the words "Milestone Motor Hotel" on his rooftop.[tpl]cite web| url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=1697701&date=19930425| title=The World's First Motel Rests Upon Its Memories| last=Jackson| first=Kristin| date=April 25, 1993| publisher=Seattle Times| accessdate=April 2, 2008[/tpl] Many other businesses followed in its footsteps and started building their own auto camps.
Combining the individual cabins of the tourist court under a single roof yielded the motor court or motor hotel. A handful of motor courts were beginning to call themselves motels, a term coined in 1926. Many of these early motels are still popular and are in operation, as in the case of the 3V Tourist Court[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.themagnoliacafe.net/magnolia3vtouristcourts.html|title=3V Tourist Court[/tpl] in St. Francisville, Louisiana, built in 1938.
During the Great Depression, those still traveling (including business travelers and traveling salespeople) were under pressure to manage travel costs by driving (instead of taking trains) and staying in the new roadside motels and courts instead of more costly established downtown hotels where bell captains, porters and other personnel would all expect a tip for service.
In the 1940s, most construction ground to a near-halt as workers, fuel, rubber and transport were pulled away from civilian use for the war effort. What little construction did take place was typically near military bases where every habitable cabin was pressed into service to house soldiers and their families.
The post-war 1950s would usher in a building boom on a massive scale. By 1947, there would be approximately 22,000 motor courts in operation in the US alone; a typical 50-room motel in that era cost $3000 per room in initial construction costs, compared to $12,000 per room for metropolitan city hotel construction.[tpl]cite news| url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=nQwEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT135 | title=Coin-ops find motor courts increasingly fertile field| publisher=Billboard (Magazine)| date=March 31, 1947|page=136[/tpl] By 1950 there would be 50,000 motels serving half of the 22 million US vacationers; by 1951 motels would surpass hotels in consumer demand.[tpl]cite book| url=http://www.waterwinterwonderland.com/motels.aspx| title=Home Away From Home: Motels in America| author=John Margolies| publisher=Bulfinch Press, Little Brown and Co.| isbn=0821221620| date=November 1995[/tpl]
Many motels began advertising on colorful neon signs that they had air cooling (a early term for "air conditioning") during the hot summers or were "heated by steam" during the cold winters. A handful used novelty architecture such as wigwams or teepees or used decommissioned rail cars to create a Red Caboose Motel in which each "Caboose Motel" or "Caboose Inn" cabin is an individual rail car.[tpl]cite news| url=http://travel.usatoday.com/destinations/10great/story/2012-06-28/10-great-places-to-stay-at-a-vintage-motel/55902438/1 |title=10 great places to stay at a vintage motel| author1=Doug Kirby| author2=Larry Bleiberg| publisher=USA Today| date=June 28, 2012[/tpl]

===Expansion===

The 1950s and 1960s was the pinnacle of the motel industry in the United States and Canada. As older mom-and-pop motor hotels began adding newer amenities such as swimming pools or color TV (a luxury in the 1960s), motels were built in wild and impressive designs. In-room gimmicks such as the coin-operated Magic Fingers vibrating bed were briefly popular; introduced 1958, these were largely removed in the 1970s due to vandalism of the coin boxes. The American Hotel Association (which had briefly offered a Universal Credit Card in 1953 as forerunner to the modern American Express card) became the American Hotel & Motel Association in 1963.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ahla.com/content.aspx?id=4072|title=AH&LA history of lodging|publisher=American Hotel Association[/tpl]
As many motels vied for their place on busy highways, the beach-front motel instantly became a success. In major beachfront cities such as Miami, Florida, rows of colorful motels such as the Castaways, in all shapes and sizes, became commonplace.

===Guidebooks===

The original motels were small, locally owned businesses which grew around two-lane highways which were Main Street in every town along the way. As independents, the quality of accommodation varied widely from one lodge to another; while a minority of these properties were inspected or rated by automobile associations (AAA and CAA have published maps and tour book directories of restaurants and rooms since 1917), no consistent standard stood behind the "sanitized for your protection" banner. There was no real access to national advertising for local motels and no nationwide network to facilitate reservation of a room in a distant city.
The main roads into major towns therefore became a sea of orange or red neon proclaiming VACANCY (and later COLOR TV, air conditioning or a pool) as competing operators vied for precious visibility on crowded highways. Other venues for advertising were local tourist bureaux and the picture postcards provided for free use by clients.[tpl]cite web| url=http://digital-collections.columbuslibrary.org/cml_search_results.php?CISOOP1=exact&CISOFIELD1=CISOSEARCHALL&CISOROOT=/memory&CISOBOX1=Motels| title=Digital Archives| publisher=Columbus (OH) Metropolitan Library[/tpl] finds 22 entries for "motels" on US 40, mostly archived picture postcards bearing advertisements like "40 Winks Motel -- within city limits of Columbus, Ohio. 100% fire proof construction. Restaurant and service station open 24 hours daily. Every room has the following: air conditioning - telephone - radio - Beauty Rest box springs and mattresses - private baths. Phone DOuglas 3615." (The '40 Winks Restaurant' and adjacent filling station are now long gone; the remainder of this property was shut down for one year in 2005 per [tpl]cite news|url=http://beta.wosu.org/news/2012/01/23/some-east-side-residents-say-neglected-motel-hinders-area-progress |title=Some East Side Residents Say Neglected Motel Hinders Area Progress |publisher=WOSU Public Media |date=2012-01-23 |accessdate=2012-08-15[/tpl] due to ongoing code violations.) 
A rating in the Directory of Motor Courts and Cottages by the American Automobile Association was just one of many credentials eagerly sought by independent motels of the era. Regional guides (such as Official Florida Guide by A. Lowell Hunt or Approved Travelers Motor Courts) and the food/lodging guidebooks published by restaurant reviewer Duncan Hines (Adventures in Good Eating, 1936 and Lodging for a Night, 1938) were also valued endorsements.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/duncan-hines/lodging-for-a-night-hci.shtml|author=Duncan Hines|title=Lodging for a night|publisher=Adventures in Good Eating Inc, Bowling Green, Ky, Telephone 1219|year=1940|edition=3rd[/tpl] (archive.org)

===Referral chains===

The referral chain in lodging originated in the early 1930s, originally serving to promote cabins and tourist courts. A predecessor of the modern "franchise chain" model, a referral chain was a group of independent motel owners in which each member lodge would voluntarily meet a set of standards and each property would promote the others. Each property would proudly display the group's name alongside its own.
United Motor Courts, founded 1933 by a group of motel owners in the southwestern US, published a guidebook until the early 1950s.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=VBljswTLaIEC&pg=PA317 |title=The Great Depression in America: a cultural encyclopedia|author= William and Nancy Young|pages=315–318|publisher=Greenwood|date=March 30, 2007|isbn=978-0313335204[/tpl] A splinter of this now-defunct group, Quality Courts, began as a referral chain in 1941, but was converted to a franchised operation (Quality Inn) in the 1960s.Jakle, Sculle, Rogers, p. 162 Budget HostJakle, p. 149 and Best Value Inn are also referral chains.
The Best Western Motels (1947) was a similar referral chain of independent western US motels. It remains in operation as a member-owned chain, although the modern Best Western operation shares many of the characteristics (such as centralised purchasing and reservation systems) of the later franchise systems.

===Ownership chains===

The earliest motel chains, proprietary brands for multiple properties built with common architecture, were born in the 1930s. The first of these were ownership chains, in which a small group of people owned and operated all of the motels under one common brand.
Alamo Plaza Hotel Courts, founded 1929 in East Waco, Texas, was the first such chain with seven motor courts by 1936 and more than twenty by 1955.[tpl]cite web| title=Torrance, Edgar Lee (1893-1971)| publisher=The Handbook of Texas Online| url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/onthemove/collection/object_582.html[/tpl][tpl]cite web| title=Alamo Plaza| publisher=highwayhost.org| url=http://www.highwayhost.org/AlamoPlaza/alamoplaza1.htm[/tpl] With Simmons furniture, Beautyrest mattresses on every bed and telephones in every room, the Alamo Plaza rooms were marketed as "tourist apartments" under a slogan of "Catering to those who care."
In 1935, building contractor Scott King opened King's Motor Court in San Diego, renaming the original property Travelodge in 1939 after having built two dozen more simple motel-style properties in five years on behalf of various investors. He incorporated and expanded the entire chain under the TraveLodge banner after 1946.[tpl]cite book|title=The Motel in America| author=John A. Jakle |author2=Keith A. Sculle |author3=Jefferson S.

In 1937, Harlan Sanders opened a motel and restaurant as Sanders Court and Café alongside a fuel station in Corbin, Kentucky; a second location was opened in Asheville, North Carolina, but expansion as a motel chain was not pursued further.[tpl]cite web| title=KFC| publisher=roadsidearchitecture.com| url=http://www.agilitynut.com/eateries/kfc.html[/tpl][tpl]cite web| title=Harland Sanders Museum and Café| publisher=Corbin KY tourism| url=http://www.corbinkytourism.com/sandersKFC.htm[/tpl]

===Franchise chains===

In 1951, residential developer Kemmons Wilson returned to Memphis disillusioned by motels encountered on a family road trip to Washington, D.C. In each city, rooms varied from well-kept to filthy, few had a swimming pool, no on-site restaurant meant a few miles driving to buy dinner, and (while the room itself was $8 to $10) motor courts charged $2 extra per child, substantially increasing costs of a family vacation.[tpl]cite web| title=Holiday Inns: Annoyed by the inflexible pricing at America's motels, Kemmons Wilson lodged his business at the intersection where the baby boom met the open road| publisher=Fortune Small Business| author=Paul Lukas, Maggie Overfelt| date=April 1, 2003| url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fsb/fsb_archive/2003/04/01/341009/index.htm[/tpl] He would build his own motel at 4941 Summer Avenue on the main highway (US 70) from Memphis to Nashville, adopting a name from a 1942 musical film Holiday Inn about a fictional lodge only open on public holidays. Every new Holiday Inn would have TV, air conditioning, a restaurant and a pool; all would meet a long list of standards. Originally a motel chain, Holiday Inn was first to deploy an IBM-designed national room reservations system in 1965 and opened its 1000th location by 1968.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/725061/Happy-birthday-Holiday-Inn.html| publisher=The Telegraph (UK)| title=Happy birthday Holiday Inn| author=John Simpson| date=11 Sep 2002[/tpl]
In 1954 a 60-room motor hotel in Flagstaff, Arizona, opened as the first Ramada (Spanish for "a shaded resting place"). The Twin Bridges Motor Hotel, established 1957 near Washington as a member of Quality Courts, became the first Marriott in 1959, expanding from motel to hotel in 1962.
For individual motel owners, a franchise chain provided an automated central reservation system and a nationally recognized brand which assured consumers that rooms and amenities met a consistent minimum standard. This came at a cost; franchise fees, marketing fees, reservation fees and royalty fees were not reduced during times of economic recession, leaving most of the business risk with the franchisee while franchise corporations profited. Some franchise contracts restricted the franchisee's ability to sell the business as a going concern or leave the franchise group without penalty.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=r_nxcSS1TfUC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA92 |title=Life Behind the Lobby: Indian American Motel Owners and the American Dream |author=Pawan Dhingra |page=92 |date=2012-04-25 |accessdate=2012-08-15[/tpl]
For the chain, the franchise model allowed a higher level of product standardization and quality control than was possible as a referral chain model while allowing expansion beyond the maximum practical size of a tightly-held ownership chain.
In some cases, loosely-knit ownership chains (such as Travelodge) and referral chains (such as Quality Courts, founded 1939 by seven motel operators as a non-profit referral system) were converted to franchise systems.
Quality Courts (1939) and The Best Western Motels (1947) were both originally referral chains and largely marketed together (as Quality Courts were predominantly eastern) until the 1960s. Both built national supply chain and reservation systems while aggressively removing properties not meeting minimum standards. In 1963, their paths diverged. Quality Courts became Quality Inn, abandoning its former co-operative structure to become a for-profit corporation, use shareholder capital to build entirely company-owned locations and require its members to become franchisees, while Best Western retained its original member-owned status as a marketing co-operative.

===Motorway era===

With the introduction of chains, independent motels started to decline. The emergence of freeways bypassing existing highways (such as the Interstate Highway System in the US) caused older motels further away from the new roads to became abandoned as they lost clientele to motel chains built along the new road's offramps.
Some entire roadside towns were abandoned. Amboy, California (population 700) had grown as a U.S. Route 66 rest stop and would decline with the highway as the opening of Interstate 40 in 1973 bypassed the village entirely. The ghost town and its 1938 Roy's Motel and Café were allowed to decay for years and used by film makers in a weathered and deteriorated state.
Even the original 1952 Holiday Inn Hotel Courts in Memphis closed by 1973 and was eventually demolished,[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/travel/americas/room-at-the-holiday-inn-how-an-american-icon-was-reinvented-for-the-21st-century-1897256.html| title=Room at the Holiday Inn: How an American icon was reinvented for the 21st century| author=Harriet O'Brien| publisher=The Independent (UK)| date=13 February 2010[/tpl] as I-40 bypassed US 70 and the chain repositioned itself as a mid-price hotel brand. The Twin Bridges Marriott was demolished for parkland in 1990.
Many independent 1950s-era motels would remain in operation, often sold to new owners or renamed, but continued their steady decline as clients were lost to the chains. Often the building's design, as traditionally little more than a long row of individual bedrooms with outside corridors and no kitchen or dining hall, left it ill-suited to any other purpose.

===Market segmentation===

In the 1970s and 1980s, independent motels were losing ground to chains such as Motel 6 and Ramada, existing roadside locations were increasingly bypassed by freeways and the development of the motel chain led to a blurring of motel and hotel.
While family-owned motels with as few as five rooms could still be found, especially along older highways, these were forced to compete with a proliferation of Economy Limited Service chains. ELS hotels typically do not offer cooked food or mixed drinks; they may offer a very limited selection of continental breakfast foods but have no restaurant, bar or room service.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sup.org/pages.cgi?isbn=0804778833;item=Excerpt_from_the_Introduction_pages;page=15 |title=Life Behind the Lobby: Indian American Motel Owners and the American Dream |author=Pawan Dhingra |page=15 |date= |accessdate=2012-08-15[/tpl]
Journey's End Corporation (founded 1978 in Belleville, Ontario), built two-story hotel buildings with no on-site amenities to compete directly in price with existing motels. Rooms were comparable to a good hotel but there was no pool, restaurant, health club or conference center. There was no room service[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/11/business/real-estate-a-no-frills-hotel-rises-in-manhattan.html| title=Real Estate; A No-Frills Hotel Rises in Manhattan| author=Shawn G. Kennedy| date=January 11, 1989| publisher=New York Times[/tpl] and generic architectural designs varied little between cities. The chain targeted "budget-minded business travelers looking for something between the full-service luxury hotels and the clean-but-plain roadside inns", but largely drew individual travellers from small towns who traditionally supported small roadside motels.
International chains quickly followed this same pattern. Choice Hotels created Comfort Inn as an economy limited service brand in 1982. New limited-service brands from existing franchisors provided market segmentation; by using a different trademark and branding, major hotel chains could build new limited-service properties near airports and freeways without undermining their existing mid-price brands. Creation of new brands also allowed chains to circumvent the contractual minimum distance protections between individual hoteliers in the same chain. Franchisors placed multiple properties under different brands at the same motorway exit, leading to a decline in revenue for individual franchisees. An influx of newly concocted brands became a key factor in a boom in new construction which ultimately led to market saturation.
By the 1990s, Motel 6 and Super 8 were built with inside corridors (so were nominally hotels) while other former motel brands (including Ramada and Holiday Inn) had become mid-price hotel chains. Some individual franchisees built new hotels with modern amenities alongside or in place of their former Holiday Inn motels; by 2010 the mid-range hotel with the indoor pool was the standard required to remain Holiday Inn.

===Decline===

In many once-prime locations, independent motels which thrived in the 1950s and 1960s were being squeezed out by the 1980s as they were forced to compete with growing chains with a much larger number of rooms at each property. Many were left stranded on former two-lane main highways which had been bypassed by motorways or declined as original owners retired and subsequent proprietors neglected maintenance of buildings and rooms. As these were low-end properties even in their heyday, most are now showing their age.
In Canada the pattern was most visible in the densely populated Windsor-Quebec Corridor, both in urban locations like Toronto's Kingston Road motel strip and in awkward rural locations formerly on the main road. Many remote stretches of Trans-Canada Highway remain unbypassed by motorway and some independent motels survive. In the US, the Interstate highway system was bypassing US Highways nationwide. The best-known example was the complete removal of U.S. Route 66 from the US highway system in 1985 after it was bypassed (mostly by Interstate 40). US 66 was particularly problematic as the old route number was often moved to the new road as soon as the bypasses were constructed, while Highway Beautification Act restrictions left existing properties with no means to obtain signage on the newly constructed Interstate. Some motels were demolished, converted to private residences or used as storage space while others have been left to slowly fall apart.[tpl]cite news|last=Juozapavicius|first=Justin|title=Route 66 motels endangered|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/travel/hotels/2007-05-19-route66_N.htm|newspaper=USA Today|date=2007-05-19[/tpl]
In many towns, maintenance and renovation of existing properties would stop as soon as word was out that an existing highway was the target of a proposed bypass; this decline would only accelerate after the new road opened. Attempts by owners to compete for the few remaining clients on a bypassed road by lowering prices typically only worsened the decline by leaving no funds to invest in improving or properly maintaining the property; accepting clients who would have been formerly turned away also led to crime problems in cities.
By 1976 the term "cockroach motel" was well-established; a slogan for Black Flag's trademark "Roach Motel" bug traps would be paraphrased as "they check in, but they don't check out" to refer to these declining properties.Nancy White's 1993 "Senator Lawson at the Motel Cucaracha" (03:45) adopts this modified tag line as part of the song's chorus
In declining urban areas (like Kingston Road in Scarborough, Ontario), the remaining low-end motels from the two-lane highway era are often seen as seedy places for the homeless, prostitution and drugs[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/home-and-garden/real-estate/article1282406.ece| title=It's check-out time for Scarborough's storied motel strip| author=Dave LeBlanc| publisher=Globe and Mail| date=Sep 10, 2009[/tpl] as vacant rooms in now-bypassed areas are often rented by social-service agencies to house refugees, abuse victims and families awaiting social housing. Conversely, some areas which were merely roadside suburbs in the 1950s are now valuable urban land on which original structures are being removed through gentrification and the land used for other purposes. Toronto's Lake Shore Boulevard strip in Etobicoke was bulldozed to make way for condominiums.
In some cases, historic properties have been allowed to slowly decay. The Motel Inn of San Luis Obispo, which (as the Milestone Motor Hotel) was the first to use the "motel" name, sits incomplete with what is still standing left boarded up and fenced off at the side of U.S. Route 101; a 2002 restoration proposal[tpl]cite web| title=Motel Inn restoration proposal (2002, never implemented)| year=2002| publisher=King Ventures (Apple Farm Inn)| url=http://www.kingventures.net/applfrm_motinn/restore_rehab.htm[/tpl] never came to fruition.[tpl]cite news| url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2006-08-15/news/0608150234_1_motel-inn-arthur-heineman-milestone-mo-tel| title=World's first motel a sight worth saving| publisher=Chicago Tribune| date=August 15, 2006| author=Eric Zorn[/tpl]
Alamo Plaza Hotel Courts, the first motel chain, was sold off in pieces as the original owners retired. Most of its former locations on the US Highway system have declined beyond repair under subsequent ownership or no longer exist. One 1941 property still stands on U.S. Route 190 in Baton Rouge, Louisiana with its Alamo Plaza Restaurant now gone, its pool filled in, its original color scheme painted over, its front desk behind bulletproof glass and its rooms infested with roaches, vermin and a clientele engaged in enough criminal activity that police are summoned daily.[tpl]cite news| title=After dark, it gets ugly| author=Chuck Hustmyre| date=October 25, 2007| publisher=225 Baton Rouge| url=http://www.225batonrouge.com/news/2007/oct/25/after-dark-it-gets-ugly[/tpl] Other Alamo sites in Chattanooga,[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.chattanoogan.com/2010/8/17/182093/Remembering-the-Alamo-Plaza-Hotel-and.aspx| title=Memories: Remembering the Alamo Plaza Hotel and Courts| date=August 17, 2010| author=Harmon Jolley| publisher=The Chattanoogan[/tpl] Memphis[tpl]cite news| title=Remembering the Alamo — Plaza, That Is| author=Vance Lauderdale| publisher=Memphis Magazine| date=Dec 1, 2008| url=http://www.memphisflyer.com/AskVanceBlog/archives/2008/12/01/remembering-the-alamo-plaza-that-is[/tpl] and Dallas[tpl]cite news| title=Alamo Plaza, an Oak Cliff landmark, falls to wrecking ball today| author=Tom Benning| publisher=The Dallas Morning News| date=December 14, 2010| url=http://www.dallasnews.com/news/community-news/dallas/headlines/20101214-alamo-plaza-an-oak-cliff-landmark-falls-to-wrecking-ball-today.ece[/tpl] have simply been demolished.
In the year 2000, the American Hotel-Motel Association removed 'motel' from its name after considerable market research, and is now the American Hotel and Lodging Association. The association felt that the term 'lodging' more accurately reflects the large variety of different style hotels, including luxury and boutique hotels, suites, inns, budget, and extended stay hotels.

===Modernization===

In the late 20th century, a majority of motels in the United States came under the ownership of people of Indian descent, particularly Gujaratis[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/04/magazine/a-patel-motel-cartel.html?pagewanted=all| title=A Patel Motel Cartel?| last=Varadarajan| first=Tunku| date=July 4, 1999| publisher=New York Times| accessdate=September 1, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3177054.stm| title=America's Patel Motels| last=Dublish| first=Chhavi| date=October 10, 2003| publisher=BBC News| accessdate=February 16, 2012[/tpl] as the original "mom and pop" owners retired from the motel industry and sold their properties. However, some families still kept their motels, and to this day, one can find a motel that is owned by the same family who built and ran it originally (i.e. the Maples Motel in Sandusky, Ohio) with a subsequent generation continuing the family business.[tpl]cite book|title=Life Behind the Lobby: Indian American Motel Owners and the American Dream|author=Pawan Dhingra|isbn=978-0804778831|year=2012[/tpl]
Amenities offered have also changed, with motels that once touted color television as a luxury now emphasizing wireless internet, flatscreen television, pay-per-view or in-room movies, microwave ovens and minibar fridges in rooms which may be reserved online using credit cards and secured against intruders with key cards which expire as soon as a client checks out.Traditionally, motels used a [tpl]cite web|title=metal key on a preprinted plastic tag|url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/25373834@N08/2559442515/in/photostream/[/tpl] with the motel's address, room number and "return postage guaranteed — drop in any mailbox". Anyone finding a lost or stolen key had full access to the room, a security issue. In many cases, independent motels have needed to add amenities simply to remain competitive with franchise chains which are taking an increasing market share. Some long-time independent motels have had to join existing low-end chains to remain viable; these properties are known as "conversions" and do not use the standardized architecture which once defined many franchise brands.
While many former motel chains have become hotel chains and some have entirely left the low-end of the market, a handful of national franchise brands (Econo Lodge, Travelodge, Knights Inn) remain available to owners of existing motels with the original drive-up-to-room motor court architecture. The Magnuson Hotels alliance, founded 2003 to group various existing independent off-brand motels and hotels under one national reservation system,http://www.hotelnewsnow.com/Article/1875/Magnuson-reports-more-loan-approvals-reservation-growth does accept "properties with external corridors" in the lowest of its three tiered brands, M-Star.
However, even though most of these establishments that were previously called motels may still look like motels, most are now called hotels, inns or lodges.

===Revitalization and preservation===

Much original 1950s roadside infrastructure on now-bypassed US Highways had fallen into decline or was being razed for development. The National Trust for Historic Preservation named the Wildwoods Shore motel district in New Jersey in its 2006 list of America's Most Endangered Historic Places and included the Historic Route 66 Motels from Illinois to California on its 2007 list.[tpl]cite web| title=National Trust Names Historic Route 66 Motels One of America's 11 Most Endangered Historic Places: Treasured "Mother Road" Motels Meet the Wrecking Ball or are Forgotten and Abandoned| date=June 14, 2007| url=http://www.preservationnation.org/about-us/press-center/press-releases/2007/national-trust-names-historic-1.html| publisher=National Trust for Historic Preservation[/tpl]
Preservationists have sought to list endangered properties on various federal or state historic registries, although in many cases a historic listing gives a building little or no protection from alteration or demolition.
The Oakleigh Motel in Oakleigh, Victoria, Australia, constructed using Googie architecture during the 1956 Summer Olympics as one of the first motels in the state, was added to the Victorian Heritage Register in 2009.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.dpcd.vic.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/47280/Oakleigh_Motel_Report_final.pdf| title=Oakleigh Motel, final report| publisher=Heritage Council, Victoria, Australia[/tpl] The building was gutted by developers in 2010 for a row house development; only the outer shell remains original.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.adonline.id.au/buildings/oakleigh-motel| title=Oakleigh Motel| publisher=Melbourne Buildings (blog)| author=Adam Dimech| date=November 19, 2011[/tpl]

====US Route 66====

The plight of U.S. Route 66, whose disappearance from the map in 1985 turned places like Glenrio, Texas and Amboy, California into overnight ghost towns, has captured public attention. In 1987, Angel Delgadillo and a group of fifteen businesspeople established the first Route 66 association in Seligman, Arizona, obtaining the first "Historic Route 66" designation for a stretch of Arizona State Route 66 from Kingman to Seligman. Route 66 associations established for all eight US states on 66 advocate preservation and restoration of motels, businesses and roadside infrastructure of the neon era. In 1999, the National Route 66 Preservation Bill allocated $10 million in matching fund grants to individuals, corporations and communities preserving or restoring historic properties along the route.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.national66.org/about-us/ |title=About us |publisher=National Historic Route 66 Federation |date= |accessdate=2012-08-15[/tpl]
Long-neglected 1930s through 1950s roadside diners, filling stations and other abandoned highway infrastructure became a target for historic preservation as the road popularized through John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath and Bobby Troup's "(Get Your Kicks On) Route 66" was marketed not as transportation infrastructure but as a tourism destination in its own right.
To many small towns bypassed by Interstate highways, embracing 1950s nostalgia and historic restoration brings in badly needed tourism dollars to restore sagging local economies. Many vintage motels, some dating to the cabin court era of the 1930s, have been renovated, restored and added to the US National Register of Historic Places or to local and state listings.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/route66/listofsites66.html| title=Discover Our Shared Heritage Travel Itinerary: Route 66| publisher=US National Park Service[/tpl] While a handful were repurposed as either low-income housing, boutique hotels, apartments or commercial/office space, many were simply restored as motels.
While some modern amenities such as wi-fi Internet and flatscreen television may appear in the newly restored rooms, the exterior architecture and neon highway signage would be meticulously restored to original designs.[tpl]cite web| url=http://route66news.com/category/motels| title=Route 66 News| author=Ron Warnick[/tpl] By 2012, U.S. Route 66 travellers were spending $38 million/year visiting historic places and museums in communities on the former highway, with $94 million annually invested in heritage preservation;[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/dalebuss/2012/03/28/americans-still-getting-their-kicks-along-route-66| author=Dale Buss| publisher=Forbes| date=March 28, 2012| title=Americans Are Still Getting Their Kicks Along Route 66[/tpl] The Motels of Route 66 was announced as an upcoming documentary film.[tpl]cite web| url=http://themotelsofroute66.com| title=The Motels of Route 66 (documentary)| author=Simon Cantlon| publisher=Paper Moon Films[/tpl]

==International variations==

The early motels were built in the southwestern United States as a replacement for the tourist camps and tourist cabins which had grown around the US highway system. In Australia and New Zealand, motels have followed largely the same path of development as in Canada and the United States. The first Australian motels include the West End Motel in Ballina, New South Wales (1937) and the Penzance Motel in Eagle Hawk, Tasmania (1939).[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.builtheritage.com.au/downloads/motel1.pdf| title=Australia's first motels| publisher=Mo (Vol 10 No 2)| author=Simon Reeves[/tpl]
Motels gained international popularity in countries such as Thailand, Germany, and Japan but in some countries the term "motel" now connotes either a low-end hotel (such as Hotel Formule 1 in Europe) or a no-tell motel.

===Canada===

As in the US, the initial 1930s roadside accommodations were primitive tourist camps, with over a hundred campgrounds listed in Ontario alone on one 1930 provincial road map.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.ontarioroadmaps.ca/index.php/official-ontario-maps/official-ontario-road-maps/29-official-ontario-road-maps/official-ontario-road-map/16-1930-1931-official-road-map-of-ontario | title=Official Government Road Map of Ontario| publisher=Ontario Department of Public Highways, Queen's Park, Toronto| year=1930[/tpl] While most of these provided access to the most basic of amenities (like picnic tables, playgrounds, toilet facilities and supplies), fewer than a quarter offered cottages in the pre-Depression era, and the vast majority required travelers bring their own tents. In Canada's climate, these sites were effectively unusable outside the high season.
Because cabins and camps were ill-suited to a Canadian winter, the number and variety of motels grew dramatically after World War II, peaking just before freeways such as Ontario Highway 401 opened in the 1960s. By the 1980s, motels were losing ground rapidly to franchises such as Journey's End Corporation and the US-based chains. Due to Canada's climate and short tourist season (which begins at Victoria Day continuing to Labour Day or Thanksgiving) any outdoor swimming pool would be usable for little more than two months of the year and independent motels would operate at a loss or close during the off-season.
Much of Canada's population is crowded into a few small southern regions. While the Windsor-Québec corridor was bypassed by motorways relatively early, sending former independent motels on the former two-lane highways into steep decline, in more sparsely populated regions (including much of Northern Ontario) thousands of kilometers of mostly two-lane Trans-Canada Highway remain undisturbed as the road makes its lengthy journey westward through tiny, distant and isolated communities.

===Europe===

The original concept of a motel as a motorist's hotel which grew up around the highways of the 1920s is of American origin. The term appears to have initially had the same meaning in other countries, but has since been used in many places to refer either to a budget-priced hotel with limited amenities or a love hotel, depending on the country and language. The division between motel and hotel, like elsewhere, has been blurred, so many of these are low-end hotels.
In France, motel-style chain accommodations of up to three stories (with exterior hallways and stairwells) are marketed as "one-star hotels". The Louvre Hôtels chain operates Première Classe (1 star) as a market segmentation brand in this range, using other marques for higher or mid-range hotels. The use of "motel" to identify any budget-priced roadhouse hotel (Rasthaus, Raststätte) also exists in the German language; some French chains operating in Germany (such as Accor's Hotel Formule 1) offer automated registration and small, Spartan rooms at reduced cost.
In Portuguese, "motel" (plural: "motéis") commonly refers not to the original drive-up accommodation house for motorists but to an "adult motel" or love hotel with amenities such as jacuzzi baths, in-room pornography, candles and oversize or non-standard-shaped beds in various honeymoon-suite styles. These rooms are available for as little as four hours, and minors are excluded from these establishments."Motéis de Portugal" ("Motels of Portugal", www.moteisdeportugal.com) is a listing of what elsewhere would be classed as adult motels; see also "Motel" (in Portuguese) in that language's Wikipedia. (The Portuguese-language term "rotel" had brief usage in 1970s Rio de Janeiro, Brazil for a similar concept, ro- for rooms through which clients rotate in a matter of hours instead of overnight.)
A similar association of "motel" to short-stay hotels with reserved parking and luxury rooms which can be rented by couples for a few hours has begun to appear in Italy, where the market segment has shown significant growth since the 1990s and become highly competitive.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.repubblica.it/2009/08/sezioni/cronaca/alberghi-a-ore/alberghi-a-ore/alberghi-a-ore.html| title=Privacy e comfort, così torna l'albergo a ore (Privacy and comfort, back to the hotel by the hour)| publisher=la Repubblica, Rome| author=Jenner Meletti| date=August 21, 2009[/tpl]

===South America===

In Central and South America, a "motel" (in Mexico, "Motel de paso") is an establishment often associated with extramarital encounters and rented typically for a few hours (15 minutes to 12 hours). In Ecuador, any establishment with the title "Motel" is related to extramarital encounters; in Argentina and Peru these hotels for couples are called "albergue transitorio" ("temporary shelter") and offered for anything from a few hours to overnight, with décor based on amenities such as dim lights, a jacuzzi and a king-size bed. In other Spanish-speaking countries these establishments have other slang names like "mueble", "amueblado" ("furniture", "furnished rental") or "telo".
In the Dominican Republic, "cabins" (named for their cabin-like shape) have all these amenities (such as jacuzzi, oversize bed and HDTV) but generally do not have windows, and have private parking for each room individually. Registration is handled not in a conventional manner but, upon entering the room, by delivering a bill with the registration through a small window that does not allow eye contact to ensure greater discretion."Motel" (in Spanish) in the Spanish-language Wikipedia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.motelesRD.com|title=Moteles RD[/tpl], a directory of motels from the Dominican Republic; these appear to be mostly love hotels.
The connotations of "motel" as adult motel or love hotel in both the Spanish and Portuguese languages can be awkward for US-based chains accustomed to using the term in its original meaning,[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/travel/hotels/2003-12-02-motels_x.htm| title=Old-style motels fading out| agency=Associated Press| publisher=USA Today| date=December 3, 2003[/tpl] although this issue is diminishing as chains (such as Super 8 Motels) increasingly drop the word "motel" from their corporate identities at home.

==Crime and illicit activity==

Many auto camps were used as havens and hide-outs for criminals of the 1920s; Bonnie and Clyde had a shootout in the infamous Red Crown Tourist Court near Kansas City on July 20, 1933. A 1940 American Magazine article attributed to J. Edgar Hoover denounced the tourist courts as bases of operation for gangs of desperadoes, claiming that "a large number of roadside cottage groups appear to be not tourist camps but assignation camps" and alleging that "marijuana sellers have been found around such places."
[tpl]quote|There is today a new home of crime in America, a new home of disease, bribery, corruption, crookedness, rape, white slavery, thievery and murder. There are few major cases in the FBI involving an extended pursuit in which the roadside crime-nest is not responsible for some form of easy lawlessness, for providing convenient hide-outs, for concealing criminals through loose registration regulations... a majority of the 35,000 tourist camps in the U.S. threaten the peace and welfare of the communities upon which these camps have fastened themselves and all of us who form the motoring public. Many of them are not only hide-outs and meeting places, but actual bases of operations from which gangs of desperadoes prey upon the surrounding territory... The files of the FBI are loaded with instances of gangsters who have hidden out in unregulated tourist camps, while officers combed the country for them. There is no regular checking of the registers by detectives — often there are no registers at all, or merely ledgers filled with indiscriminate scrawls and an endless repetition of 'John Smith and wife'... Hence the terse order that goes out daily to law-enforcement agencies when criminals are on the loose: 'KEEP CLOSE WATCH ON TOURIST CAMPS!'[tpl]cite news| author=Courtney Ryley Cooper| title=Camps of Crime| publisher=American Magazine| date=February 1940| page=14[/tpl][/tpl]
Ultimately, efforts to curb the unconstrained growth of tourist courts were futile as motor courts (as motels were called in the 1930s and 1940s) grew in number and popularity.
Motels have served as a haven for fugitives in the past as the anonymity and a simple registration process helped fugitives to remain ahead of the law. Several changes have reduced the capacity of motels to serve this purpose. In many jurisdictions, regulations now require motel operators to obtain ID from clients and meet specific record-keeping requirements. Credit card transactions, which in the past were more easily approved and took days to report, are now approved or declined on the spot and are instantly recorded in a database, thereby allowing law enforcement access to this information.
Motels which allow a room to be rented inexpensively for less than one full night's stay or which allow a couple not wishing to be seen together publicly to enter a room without passing through the office or lobby area have been nicknamed "no-tell motels" due to their long association with adultery.[tpl]cite news| title=Motel Memories: Once Upon A Time, Hanging Out At Tucson's No-Tel Motel Must've Been Quite A Trip| author=Dave Devine| publisher=Tucson Weekly| url=http://www.tucsonweekly.com/tw/10-09-97/feat.htm| date=October 9, 1997[/tpl] Even where rooms were rented overnight to middle-class travelers (and not locals or extended-stay clients) there have been ongoing problems with theft of motel property by travelers; everything from waterbeds to television sets to bedspreads and pillows have routinely gone missing in what one 1970s Associated Press report labelled "highway robbery".[tpl]cite news| title=Boom in motels brings thievery| author=Merv Block, The Associated Press| publisher=Palm Beach Post| page=B4| date=August 4, 1972| url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1964&dat=19720804&id=jDxHAAAAIBAJ&sjid=zSwNAAAAIBAJ&pg=1324,1393313[/tpl]
Motels/hotels with low rates sometimes serve as housing for people who are not able to afford an apartment or have recently lost their home and need somewhere to stay until further arrangements are made.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-16280951|title=American families shelter in motels as homelessness worsens| publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation| date=December 20, 2011[/tpl] Motels catering to long-term stays occasionally have kitchenettes or efficiencies, or a motel room with a kitchen. While conventional apartments are more cost-effective with better amenities, tenants unable to pay first and last month's rent in advance or undesirable to residential landlords due to unemployment, criminal records or credit problems do seek low-end residential motels due to perceived lack of viable short-term options.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/Change-may-be-coming-to-Aurora-Avenue-North-1275899.php| title=Change may be coming to Aurora Avenue North: Future looks brighter for downtrodden strip| author=Levi Pulkkinen| publisher=Seattle P-I| date=June 8, 2008 [/tpl]
Some motels in low-income areas have been plagued with drug activity, street prostitution or other crime. In some cases, correctional officials have temporarily placed newly paroled convicts into motels if upon release they do not yet have anywhere to stay.[tpl]cite news| title=Police: Months of problems, violence at Aurora motels| author=Casey McNerthney| date=August 24, 2009| publisher=Seattle P-I| url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/Police-Months-of-problems-violence-at-Aurora-1305905.php[/tpl] These motels would have daily to monthly rates.
According to the Center for Problem-Oriented Policing, [tpl]quote|In the 1930s and 1940s, individually owned and operated motels offered travelers an eclectic, economical array of relatively safe lodging options. In the 1950s, corporations such as Holiday Inn and Howard Johnson's sought to capitalize on the growing national travel market by offering consumers brand-name, standardized lodging. The interstate highways built in the 1950s and 1960s favored the chains by essentially re-routing motorists away from the older, independent establishments, many of which were located along ageing roads that ran parallel to—but were difficult to access from—the new interstates. In some cases, major motel chains built their properties right at the interstate exits; motorists seeking independent motels had to bypass the chains and venture farther from the interstate to find them. The smaller, non-chain motels had difficulty competing with the large national chains under these circumstances. To survive economically, they began catering to the lower end of the market; some turned into adult motels, while others served as housing for low-income people. Unable to afford upkeep, many of the formerly quaint motels deteriorated and became havens for crime and disorder.[tpl]cite web| title=Disorder at Budget Motels| author=Karin Schmerler| publisher=Center for Problem-Oriented Policing| year=2005| url=http://www.popcenter.org/problems/budget_motels[/tpl][/tpl]
The annual number of calls for service to police departments per room ("CFS/room") as a metric has been used to identify motels with poor surveillance of visitors, inadequate staff or management unwilling to pro-actively exclude known or likely problem tenants from their clientele. Motels implementing lax security in bad neighborhoods may attract problems such as disturbances (including guests who will not leave or pay), robbery, auto theft and theft from rooms or vehicles, vandalism, public intoxication and alcoholism, drug dealing or clandestine methamphetamine laboratories, fighting, street gang activity, pimping and street prostitution or sexual assaults.

==Film, TV and stage depictions==

The Bates Motel is an important part of Psycho, a 1959 novel by Robert Bloch, and Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 film, Psycho. Film sequels, Psycho II and Psycho III, also feature the motel, as does the 1987 television movie Bates Motel. The motel makes appearances in Psycho IV: The Beginning, but is not featured as much as in previous films. The Bates Motel returned to prominence in the 1998 remake of the original film, as well as the 2013 reboot and prequel, Bates Motel. In the 2010 Halloween TV special Scared Shrekless, Puss in Boots tells a cautionary tale about the Boots Motel.
The scenario of an isolated motel being operated by a serial killer, whose guests subsequently become victims, has been exploited in a number of other horror films, notably Motel Hell (1980) and Mountaintop Motel Massacre (1986). More recently, the genre has been revived with such films as Mayhem Motel (2001), Murder Inn (2005), Vacancy (2007), and its direct-to-video prequel, Vacancy 2: The First Cut (2009).
Several of these horror films also incorporate the sub-theme of voyeurism, whereby the motel owner spies on (or even films) the sexual exploits of the guests. This plays on the long-established connotations of motels and illicit sexual activity, which has itself formed the basis for numerous other films, variously representing the thriller, comedy, teen film, and sexploitation genres. Stephen C. Apostolof's Motel Confidential (1967) and the porn film Motel for Lovers (1970) were two notable early examples. More recent manifestations include Paradise Motel (1985), Talking Walls (1987), Desire and Hell at Sunset Motel (1991), and the Korean films Motel Cactus (1997) and The Motel (2005).
In countless other films and TV series, the motel—invariably depicted as an isolated, rundown, and seedy establishment—has served as the setting for sordid events often involving equally sordid characters. Examples include Pink Motel (1982), Motel Blue 19 (1993), Backroad Motel (2001), Stateline Motel (2003), Niagara Motel (2006), and Motel 5150 (2008).
In TV's The Simpsons, the Sleep Eazy Motel signage displays its name with missing neon lighting segments, "Sleep-Eazy Motel", a sleazy motel advertising hourly rates and adult movies. The cockroach motel and no-tell motel stereotypes continue with various motels in the series, including the Happy Earwig Motel and Worst Western.
In the film Sparkle Lite Motel (2006) and the TV miniseries The Lost Room (2006), the motel made forays into the realms of science fiction. In the Pixar animation Cars (2006), a clientele of solely anthropomorphic vehicles requires all hotels be motels where clients drive directly to their rooms; clever allusions to real Route 66 motels on the US National Register of Historic Places abound.

A long-defunct "Glenn Rio Motel" recalls Route 66 ghost town Glenrio, New Mexico and Texas, now a national historic district on the state line. Glenrio once boasted the "First Motel in Texas" (as seen when arriving from New Mexico) or "Last Motel in Texas" (the same motel, its signage viewed from the opposite side).[tpl]cite news|author=Josh Burton |url=http://amarillo.com/stories/040107/new_7204588.shtml |title=Glenrio resurrected |publisher=Amarillo Globe-News |date=2007-04-01 |accessdate=2012-06-23[/tpl]
In literature, Ian Fleming's The Spy Who Loved Me (1962) depicts a French-Canadian Vivienne Michel as a clerk minding the doomed Dreamy Pines Motor Court in the Adirondack Mountains of New York State. Unlike most of Fleming's work, this storyline does not appear in any of the James Bond films.
In computer gaming, Murder Motel was an on-line text game by Sean D. Wagle, hosted on various dial-up bulletin board systems (1980s, originally Color64, ported to various other platforms). The object was for each player to attempt to brutally kill all fellow guests in each room of a motel using a variety of weapons.Murder Motel (BBS door game), R2games.com
In theatre, the seedy motel room has been the setting for two-hander plays such as Same Time, Next Year (1975) and Bug (2006). Both were later adapted as films. Broadway musicals have also paid homage to the lowbrow reputation of motel culture, demonstrated by songs such as 'The No-Tel Motel' from Prettybelle and 'At the Bed-D-by Motel' from Lolita, My Love.
