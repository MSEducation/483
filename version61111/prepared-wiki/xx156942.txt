"I Give You Give" is the name of a 1995 single by the British pop group Five Star, and was their last new UK single for more than five years without the help of any record labels, except their own, Tent Records Inc. The single failed to chart in the UK.
The single was released in three different colour sleeves: Blue, Orange and White. The video features four members of the band dancing in yellow high visibility jackets, though lead singer Denise was unable to dance as she was pregnant with her second child.
