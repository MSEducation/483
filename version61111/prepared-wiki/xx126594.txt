Oscarito (August 16, 1906 in Málaga, Spain - August 4, 1970 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) was the stage name of Brazilian actor and comedian Oscar Lorenzo Jacinto de la Imaculada Concepción Teresa Diaz. Oscarito was born to a family of circus comedians. His first film was Voz do Carnaval (1933), which also featured Carmen Miranda. He became a sought actor for chanchadas. He reached his ultimate fame with the comic duo he formed with fellow actor Grande Otelo in films directed by Carlos Manga. 
In the fifties and early sixties his movies were so famous that the lines to buy tickets, many times, extended for several blocks.
Oscarito was a very simple man. Even being the biggest Brazilian movie star at the time he didn't make a lot of money. At home he was funnier than in his roles, always joking, making faces, telling jokes. To visit with Oscarito was like watching a movie with no end.
He had a son, José Carlos (drum player) and a daughter, Mirian Thereza (actress and writer).
He loved Brazil, becoming a citizen as soon as he could. His favorite places in the world were Rio de Janeiro and São Lourenço, small town in the countryside of Minas Gerais, famous for its mineral waters.
Oscarito died of a heart attack, at home, whiles joking and making his family laugh as he always did.
Many of his movies were re-released in DVD. Among them: Carnaval Atlantida, Aviso aos Navegantes, O Homen do Sputnik, Matar ou Correr, De Vento em Poupa, Os Dois Ladroes, Esse Milhão e' Meu.
