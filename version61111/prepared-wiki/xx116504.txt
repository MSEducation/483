Bradwell nuclear power station is a disused Magnox power station located on the Dengie peninsula at the mouth of the River Blackwater, Essex.

==History==

Construction of the power station, which was undertaken by a consortium involving Clarke Chapman, Head Wrightson, C. A. Parsons & Co., A. Reyrolle & Co., Strachan & Henshaw and Whessoe and known as the Nuclear Power Plant Company ('NPPC'),The UK Magnox and AGR Power Station Projects began in December 1957 and electricity generation started in 1962. It had two Magnox reactors with a design output of 300 (MW) of net electrical output although this was reduced to 242 megawatts (MW) net electrical in total.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.magnoxsouthsites.com/about-us/our-sites/bradwell/facts-and-figures |title=Bradwell - Facts and figures |publisher=Magnox Ltd |accessdate=7 February 2011[/tpl] as a result of the discovery of breakaway oxidation of mild steel components inside the reactor vessel.  Its peak output, achieved in the early 1960s, was nearly 10% above the design value. On a typical day it could supply enough electricity to meet the needs of three towns the size of Chelmsford, Colchester and Southend put together. The reactors were supplied by The Nuclear Power Group ('TNPG') and the 9 turbines & 12 Gas Circulators by C. A. Parsons & Co.Nuclear Power Plants in the UK - England(6 Main Turbines supplying power to the grid, 3 Auxiliaries Turbines, one for each reactor for driving the gas circulators with one standby auxiliary turbine).
Bradwell was built on the edge of a former World War II airfield, one and a half miles from the Essex coastline. Its location was deliberately chosen as the land had minimal agricultural value, offered easy access, was geologically sound and had an unlimited source of cooling water from the North Sea.
In 1999, it was announced that the station would cease operation in 2002 – the first UK station to be closed on a planned basis. On 28 March 2002 Lord Braybrooke, Lord Lieutenant of Essex, unveiled a plaque to mark the cessation of electricity generation and the beginning of the decommissioning stage.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1898254.stm|title=Nuclear Power Plant Closes|publisher=BBC Online|date=28 March 2002[/tpl]
Bradwell was one of the sites being considered by British Energy for redevelopment in a new round of nuclear reactors.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7115002.stm|title=British Energy eyes nuclear sites|publisher=BBC Online|date=27 November 2007[/tpl]
On 18 October 2010, the British government announced that Bradwell was one of the eight sites it considered suitable for future nuclear power stations.[tpl]cite news|title=Nuclear power: Eight sites identified for future plants|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11564152|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=18 October 2010|date=18 October 2010[/tpl]
On 23 June 2011, the British government announced that Bradwell was one of eight sites to be opened as nuclear facilities by 2025.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]

==Safety record==

In 1966, twenty natural uranium fuel rods were stolen from  Bradwell.[tpl]cite book|url=http://www.natcapsolutions.org/publications_files/BrittlePower/BrittlePower_Parts123.pdf|title=Brittle Power|author=Amory B. Lovins & L. Hunter Lovins|isbn=0-931790-49-2|publisher=Brick House Publishing Company|page=146[/tpl] The rods were stolen for their scrap value by Harold Arthur Sneath, a worker at the plant. The theft was discovered by the local police when a van driven by Dennis Patrick Hadley, who was  transporting the rods to their final destination, was stopped due to its defective steering. The rods were recovered and, in the subsequent court case, Sneath and Hadley were bound over for five years, fined £100 each, and were required to contribute to the costs of the court case. Neither were said to have understood the consequences of the theft.[tpl]cite news |title= Uranium theft not sinister |author= | url= |location= Essex record office |newspaper= Burnham on Crouch and Dengie Hundred Advertiser |date= February 1967 |accessdate= 25 March 2011[/tpl]
On 22 January 2011, a fire broke out during the decommissioning work as titanium condenser tubes were being cut up. No radiation was released from this fire.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-12255014 | work=BBC News | title=Bradwell nuclear power station hit by fire | date=21 January 2011[/tpl]
