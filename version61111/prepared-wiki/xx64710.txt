[[Hungarian alphabet]]

CATEGORIES: Latin alphabets, Hungarian language

The Hungarian alphabet is an extension of the Latin alphabet used for writing the Hungarian language.
One sometimes speaks of the smaller and greater Hungarian alphabets, depending on whether or not the letters Q, W, X, Y are listed, which can only be found in foreign words and traditional orthography of names. Also, in Northern Hungary people use Ä instead of Á because of their accent, but in today's modern Hungarian they write letter Ä as Á.
The 44 letters of the greater Hungarian alphabet are:

==Description==

Each sign shown above counts as a letter in its own right in Hungarian.  Some, such as the letter ó and ő, are inter-filed with the letter preceding it; whereas others, such as ö, have their own place in collation rather than also being inter-filed with o.
While long vowels count as different letters, long (or geminate) consonants do not.  Long consonants are marked by duplication: e.g. <tt>, <gg>, <zz> (ette 'he ate (det.obj.)', függ 'it hangs', azzal 'with that'). For the di- and tri-graphs a simplification rule normally applies (but not when the compound is split at the end of a line of text due to hyphenation): only the first letter is duplicated: e.g.
<sz>+<sz>→<ssz> (asszony 'woman'), 
<ty>+<ty>→<tty>  (hattyú 'swan'),
<dzs>+<dzs>→<ddzs> (briddzsel 'with bridge (card game)').   
An exception is made at the joining points of compound words, for example: je'gygy'űrű 'engagement ring' (jegy + gyűrű) not *jeggyűrű.

==Pronunciation==

Hungarian orthography's principles include being phonemic along with being traditional, etymological and simplifying.  Therefore most words can be read out correctly, if one knows the pronunciation of the letters.
The pronunciation of Hungarian letters which follows is that of standard Hungarian.
The letter ë is not part of the Hungarian alphabet as standard Hungarian language does not distinguish the two kind of e sounds which are pronounced differently in 6 out of the 10 Hungarian dialects and is pronounced as ö in 1 dialect. This letter was used first in 1770 by György Kalmár, but has never been officially part of the Hungarian alphabet, however linguists use this letter to distinguish the two e sounds of some dialects.

===Historic spellings used in names===

Old spellings used in some Hungarian names and their modern correspondents include the following:
Examples: 
An extreme example is the name Dessewffy, which is pronounced as if spelled Dezsőfi.

==Capitalisation==

The di- and the trigraphs are capitalised in names and at the beginning of sentences by capitalising the first glyph of them only.
In abbreviations and when writing with all capital letters, however, one capitalises the second (and third) character as well.
Thus ("The Rules of Hungarian Orthography", a book edited by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences):

==Alphabetical ordering (collation)==

While the characters with diacritical marks are considered separate letters, vowels that differ only in length are treated the same when ordering words. Therefore, for example, the pairs O/Ó and Ö/Ő are not distinguished in ordering, but Ö follows O. In case two word are merely differentiated by an accented letter, the one without the accent is put before the other one. (The same is the situation with lower and upper-case letters: in aphabetical ordering, varga is followed by Varga.)
The polygraphic consonant signs are treated as single letters.
The simplified geminates of multigraphs (see above) such as <nny>, <ssz> are collated as <ny>+<ny>, <sz>+<sz> etc., if they are double geminates, rather than co-occurrences of a single letter and a geminate.
Similar 'ambiguities', which can occur with compounds (which are highly common in Hungarian) are dissolved and collated by sense.
These rules make Hungarian alphabetic ordering algorithmically difficult (one has to know the correct segmentation of a word to sort it correctly), was a problem for computer software development. The program called Hunspell is a good spell checker, designed specifically for the Hungarian language.

==Keyboard layout==

The Hungarian keyboard layout is German-based (QWERTZ). This layout allows direct access to every character in the Hungarian alphabet.
 
The letter "Í" is often placed left of the space key, leaving the width of the left Shift key intact.
