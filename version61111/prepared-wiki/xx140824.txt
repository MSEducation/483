==Plot==

Trappist monk Boris Androvski (Charles Boyer) feels enormous pressure at having to keep his vows as a monk, so he flees his monastery. Yet he is the only one who knows the secret recipe of the monastery's famous liqueur, a recipe passed down from one generation of monks to another. Meanwhile, heiress Domini Enfilden (Marlene Dietrich) is newly freed from her own prison of caring for her just deceased father and also seeks the exotic open spaces of the North African desert to nurture her soul.
Androvski and Domini meet, fall in love, and are married by the local priest, after which the newlyweds are whisked off into the scorching desert, a trip that the local sand diviner has forecast will bring happiness and a bad end. Domini is unaware of Androvski's past as a monk.
When a lost patrol of French legionnaires finds its way into camp, one of their number recognizes the liqueur he is served. The truth comes out, and a guilt-ridden Boris decides to return to the monastery, parting from his wife.
