==History==

The school which was originally called Park College was founded in 1875 by John A. McAfee on land donated by George S. Park with its initial structure being the stone hotel Park owned on the bluff above the Missouri River.
The original concept called for students to receive free tuition and board in exchange for working up to half day in the college’s farm, electrical shop or printing plant.  According to the terms of the arrangement if the “Parkville Experiment” did not work out within five years, the college grounds were to revert to Park.Centennial History of Missouri: (the Center State) One Hundred Years in the Union, 1820-1921  By Walter Barlow Stevens –1921 – S.J. Clarke Publishing – Page 41 (available on print.google.com)
There were 17 students in the first school year and in the first graduation class there were five women. McAfee led until his death in 1890. His son Lowell M. McAfee became the second president of Park until stepping down in 1913. The first international student at Park University arrived in 1880 from Japan.
The defining landmark of the campus is Mackay Hall, named after Carroll County, Illinois banker Duncan Mackay who donated $25,000 in materials for the structure shortly before his death.Decatur Daily Dispatch - Among Our Neighbors - 1890-09-11  The building was constructed using limestone mined on the campus grounds and built with the labor of students. Construction began in 1883 and was finished by 1893.  Today the building is the main focal point of the campus and dominates the hillside, overlooking the town of Parkville.  It is on the National Register of Historic Places.
