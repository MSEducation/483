The Toyota Auris is a compact hatchback which shares the same E150 platform with the Corolla for the three- and five door first generation, and a compact five-door hatchback and station wagon called the Touring Sports using the E180 platform for the latest generation. The name "Auris" is based on the Latin word for "gold", aurum.
In Europe, Toyota positioned the Auris as the replacement of Corolla hatchback, while the notchback sedan continued with the Corolla nameplate. It is not sold in North America, as the larger Toyota Matrix takes its place in the lineup.
The more luxurious Auris was also called the Toyota Blade in Japan. The Auris succeeds the Toyota Allex in Japan and the Corolla RunX. Toyota Australia and Toyota New Zealand resisted suggestions from Toyota Japan to adopt the new European Auris name for the Corolla.[tpl]cite web | first = Byron | last = Mathioudakis | date = 2007-05-18 | url = http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/story2/717B57155FCCC688CA2572DF00015D7A | title = First drive: All-new Corolla steps up a grade | work = GoAuto | publisher = John Mellor | accessdate = 2009-07-19[/tpl]
