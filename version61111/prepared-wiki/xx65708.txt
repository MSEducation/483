Roderick Raynor "Rod" Paige (born June 17, 1933) served as the 7th United States Secretary of Education from 2001 to 2005. Paige, who grew up in Mississippi, moved from classroom teacher to college dean and school superintendent to be the first African American to serve as the nation's education chief.  
Paige was sitting with George W. Bush at the Emma E. Booker Elementary School in Sarasota, Florida, when Bush received the news that a second plane had hit the World Trade Center in the September 11, 2001 attacks.
On November 15, 2004, Paige announced his resignation after overseeing the President's education agenda for four years. White House domestic policy adviser Margaret Spellings was nominated as his successor. The U.S. Senate confirmed her on January 20, 2005 after Bush's inauguration for a second term.

==Early life==

Born in Monticello, Mississippi, Paige is the son of public school educators. He earned a bachelor's degree from Jackson State University in Jackson, Mississippi and a Master's degree and a Doctor of Physical Education degree from Indiana University Bloomington.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl] He also holds an honorary doctoral degree from the University of Houston, which was presented to him in 2000.

==Career==

Dr. Paige served in the United States Navy from 1955 to 1957.  Dr. Paige then taught health and physical education and coached at Hinds Agricultural High School and what is now Utica Junior College (located on the same campus) in Utica, MIssissippi from 1957 to 1963. From 1964 to 1968, Paige served as head football coach at Jackson State University, compiling a record of 25 wins, 19 losses and 2 ties. Most notably, he recruited and coached Lem Barney who went on to a successful career with the Detroit Lions and is in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.Hall, Drew. "Detroit Lions Hall of Famer Lem Barney's NFL Debut" Examiner (May 6, 2013) From 1971 to 1975, Paige served as head football coach at Texas Southern University, and served as the university's athletic director from 1971 to 1980.[tpl]fact|date=October 2011[/tpl]
Paige first moved to Houston in the 1970s and settled in the Brentwood subdivision. He spearheaded a move to excise a dump from the edge of the community. The Texas Supreme Court eventually sided with the residents.Frey, Jennifer. "Bush's School Master." The Washington Post. March 8, 2001. C01 Style. Retrieved on October 26, 2011.
Dr. Paige was a teacher at Texas Southern University from 1980 to 1984 and became the Dean of the College of Education in 1984, where he served until 1994.  Dr. Paige also established the university's Center for Excellence in Urban Education, a research facility that concentrates on issues related to instruction and management in urban school systems.
As a trustee and an officer of the Board of Education of the Houston Independent School District (HISD) from 1989 to 1994, Paige coauthored the board's 'A Declaration of Beliefs and Visions', a statement of purpose and goals for the school district that called for fundamental reform through decentralization, a focus on instruction, accountability at all levels, and development of a core curriculum. A Declaration of Beliefs and Visions was the catalyst that launched the ongoing, comprehensive restructuring of HISD.  As an HISD trustee, Dr. Paige led the board to launch a municipal-style, accredited police department at HISD with police officers certified by the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement Officers Standards and Education. Dr. Paige’s board of education launched that effort to provide better school safety, and the HISD police department remains the only school district police department in the country to earn accreditation from the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.houstonisd.org/HISDConnectDS/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=3215cf2557601310VgnVCM10000028147fa6RCRD&vgnextchannel=1e236a23fcc4d210VgnVCM10000028147fa6RCRD |title=Seven New Police Sergeants Sworn in at HISD |publisher=Houston Independent School District |date=July 11, 2011 |accessdate=October 31, 2011[/tpl] 
Paige became the superintendent of schools of HISD in 1994. As superintendent, Paige created the Peer Examination, Evaluation, and Redesign (PEER) program, which solicits recommendations from business and community professionals for strengthening school support services and programs. He launched a system of charter schools that have broad authority in decisions regarding staffing, textbooks, and materials. He saw to it that HISD paid teachers salaries competitive with those offered by other large Texas school districts. Superintendent Paige made HISD the first school district in the state to institute performance contracts modeled on those in the private sector, whereby senior staff members' continued employment with HISD is based on their performance. He also introduced teacher incentive pay, which rewards teachers for raising test scores.
While he was superintendent, Dr. Paige led the district to enter into contracts with private schools to use them to teach some HISD students rather than placing those students into overcrowded public schools. Under Dr. Paige's leadership, HISD contracted with three private schools that were certified by the Texas Education Agency to teach HISD students so their parents didn’t have to bus them to schools across the city. 
Many touted the "Houston Miracle" accomplished under Paige where student test scores rose under his leadership.  Later much of the "Houston Miracle" was found to be bogus, the result of cheating. See the story "The 'Texas Miracle'" from CBS News.  http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-500164_162-591676.html
Dr. Paige served as the United States Secretary of Education from 2001 to 2005 under President George W. Bush.  The landmark No Child Left Behind education law that set new accountability standards nationwide was developed with Secretary Paige’s help and passed the Congress with his support, and it was Secretary Paige’s Department of Education that implemented the law. The Bush White House’s development of the principles of No Child Left Behind drew in part on the successes of the Houston Independent School District under Dr. Paige’s leadership. As secretary, he traveled around the country working with school district leaders and states to implement the law.
Under Secretary Paige, the department earned “clean” audits from Ernst and Young for three consecutive years. Prior to 2001, the Education Department had achieved only one clean audit in its history, and that audit was by the Department's Office of Inspector General.

Secretary Paige proposed successful amendments to the regulations implementing Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 to provide more flexibility for educators to establish single-sex classes and schools at the elementary and secondary levels.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www2.ed.gov/news/pressreleases/2002/05/05082002.html |title=Secretary Paige Announces Intent to Provide More Flexibility Regarding Single-Sex Classes and Schools |date=May 8, 2002|accessdate=October 31, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/t9-guidelines-ss.html?exp=2|title=Guidelines regarding Single Sex Classes and Schools|publisher=Office for Civil Rights |accessdate=October 31, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www2.ed.gov/news/pressreleases/2004/03/03032004.html |title=Department to Provide More Educational Options for Parents |publisher=.ed.gov |date=March 3, 2004 |accessdate=October 31, 2011[/tpl]
Paige once referred to the National Education Association, the nation's largest teachers union, as a "terrorist organization."[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.boston.com/2004-02-24/news/29201432_1_nea-education-secretary-rod-paige-terrorist-organization |title=Education chief calls union 'terrorist' group |publisher=The Boston Globe |agency=Associated Press |date=February 24, 2004 |accessdate=October 31, 2011[/tpl]
