Winter Carols is a Christmas album by the British/American folk rock band Blackmore's Night, released in the United Kingdom on October, 2006 and in the United States on November 7, 2006. It was their sixth studio albums. The cover artwork for this album, painted by Karsten Topelmann, is an adaptation of a street in Rothenburg ob der Tauber, Germany, in line with the band's heavy Renaissance influence. The same street is portrayed in the cover of Blackmore's Night's second studio album, Under a Violet Moon. In the cover of "Winter Carols" the street is painted as winter time, whereas Under a Violet Moon's cover takes place on apparently a summer night.
On December 2006, Winter Carols entered at #7 on USA Billboard New Age Charts.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ritchieblackmore.com/ritchie_bio.html |work=The Official Ritchie Blackmore and Blackmores Night Website |title=Ritchie Blackmore Bio |accessdate=2011-03-16[/tpl]
