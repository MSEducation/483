[[Tube riding]]

CATEGORIES: Surfing, Surfing terminology

Tube riding is a term used by surfers to describe riding well inside the curve or barrel of a finely-shaped breaking wave. Under the right conditions, waves in some areas form a moving "tube" or cylinder as they break, for example, see the Banzai Pipeline in Hawaii.   
The most straightforward way to tube ride is by body surfing.  A body surfer may ride the waves on his belly without a board and thus he can relatively easily access the tube, even on a moderately small wave that is barreling.  It is also possible to tube ride using a boogie board, a surfboard, and other wave riding tools. However, tube riding is an advanced skill, and many surfers spend years and even lifetimes surfing without ever really getting "tubed" — the term used for being inside the barrel of the wave.
