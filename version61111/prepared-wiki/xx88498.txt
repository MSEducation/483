The Foundation for Research on Economics and the Environment (FREE), based in Bozeman, Montana, is an American think-tank that promotes free-market environmentalism. FREE emphasizes reliance on market mechanisms and private property rights, rather than on environmental regulation, for protection of the environment. Its chairperson, John Baden, a past member of the National Petroleum Council, stresses decentralization: a shift of control from what he calls "Green platonic despots" in the federal government to "local interests".More environmental Gore, John Baden, April 26, 1999  Citing conservation efforts such as those involving the Rocky Mountain Elk, Pheasants Forever, and Trout Unlimited, Baden asserts that the ideas FREE promotes have become "the norm among progressive, intellectually honest and successful environmentalists".What was once radical now becoming mainstream, John Baden, May 9, 2001, originally published in the Bozeman Daily Chronicle.
