The Papanicolaou test (abbreviated as Pap test, known earlier as Pap smear, cervical smear, or smear test) is a method of cervical screening used to detect potentially pre-cancerous and cancerous processes in the endocervical canal (transformation zone) of the female reproductive system. Unusual findings are often followed up by more sensitive diagnostic procedures, and, if warranted, interventions that aim to prevent progression to cervical cancer. The test was invented by and named after the prominent Greek doctor Georgios Papanikolaou.
In taking a Pap smear, a speculum is used to open the vaginal canal and allow the collection of cells from the outer opening of the cervix of the uterus and the endocervix.  The cells are examined under a microscope to look for abnormalities.  The test aims to detect potentially pre-cancerous changes (called cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or cervical dysplasia), which are caused by sexually transmitted human papillomaviruses. The test remains an effective, widely used method for early detection of pre-cancer and cervical cancer.  The test may also detect infections and abnormalities in the endocervix and endometrium.
In general, in countries where Pap smear screening is routine, it is recommended that females who have had sex seek regular Pap smear testing. Guidelines on frequency vary from every three to five years.[tpl]cite web| author = U.S. Preventive Services Task Force | year = 2003 | url = http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/3rduspstf/cervcan/cervcanrr.htm | title = Screening for Cervical Cancer: Recommendations and Rationale.

==Types of screening==

In addition, Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) test may be performed either as indicated for abnormal Pap results, or in some cases dual testing is done, where both a Pap smear and HPV test are done.

==Indications==

Screening guidelines vary from country to country.  In general, screening starts about the age of 20 or 25 and continues until about the age of 50 or 60.[tpl]cite journal | author = Strander B | title = At what age should cervical screening stop? | journal = Brit Med J | volume = 338 | pages = 1022–23 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19395422 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.b809 [/tpl]  Screening is typically recommended every three to five years, as long as results are normal.
Women should wait a few years after they first have intercourse before they start screening, and should not be screened before age 21. American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and others recommend starting screening at age 21 (since that is a few years after initial sex for most American women).[tpl]cite journal| url=http://journals.lww.com/jlgtd/PublishingImages/ASCCP%20Guidelines.pdf | title = American Cancer Society, American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology, and American Society for Clinical Pathology Screening Guidelines for the Prevention and Early Detection of Cervical Cancer | author = Saslow, D, et al. | journal = Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease | volume = 16 | number = 3 | year = 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author =  | title = ACOG Committee on Gynecologic Practice; Routine Pelvic Examination and Cervical Cytology Screening, Opinion #413 | journal = Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 113 | issue = 5 | pages = 1190–1193 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19384150 | doi = 10.1097/AOG.0b013e3181a6d022 [/tpl]  Many other countries wait until age 25 or later to start screening.  For instance, some parts of Great Britain start screening at age 25. ACOG's general recommendation is that women age 30-65 have an annual well-woman examination, that they not get annual pap tests, and that they do get pap tests at three-year intervals.[ref][tpl]Cite journal|author1 =  American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists |author1-link = American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists |date = |title = Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher = American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists |work = Choosing Wisely: an initiative of the ABIM Foundation |page = |url = http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/american-college-of-obstetricians-and-gynecologists/ |accessdate = August 1, 2013|postscript = [tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl] [/tpl], which cites
Most women who contract HPV do so soon after becoming sexually active.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=November 2010[/tpl] It takes an average of a year, but can take up to four years, for a woman's immune system to control the initial infection.  Screening during this period may show this immune reaction and repair as mild abnormalities, which are usually not associated with cervical cancer, but could cause the woman stress and result in further tests and possible treatment.  Cervical cancer usually takes time to develop, so delaying the start of screening a few years poses little risk of missing a potentially precancerous lesion.  For instance, screening women under age 25 does not decrease cancer rates under age 30.[tpl]cite journal| author = Sasieni, P; Castanon, A; Cuzick, J; Snow, J; | title = Effectiveness of Cervical Screening with Age: Population based Case-Control Study of Prospectively Recorded Data | journal = BMJ | volume = 339| pages = 2968–2974 | year = 2009 | doi=10.1136/bmj.b2968[/tpl]
There is little or no benefit to screening women who have not had sexual contact.  For example, United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends waiting at least three years after first sex.  HPV can be transmitted in sex between women, so women who have only had sex with other women should be screened, although they are at somewhat lower risk for cervical cancer.[tpl]cite journal | author = Marrazzo JM, Koutsky LA, Kiviat NB, Kuypers JM, Stine K | title = Papanicolaou test screening and prevalence of genital human papillomavirus among women who have sex with women | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 91 | issue = 6 | pages = 947–952 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11392939 | pmc = 1446473 | doi = 10.2105/AJPH.91.6.947 [/tpl]
Guidelines on frequency of screening vary—typically every three to five years for those who have not had previous abnormal smears.  Some older recommendations suggested screening as frequently as every one to two years, however there is little evidence to support such frequent screening; annual screening has little benefit but leads to greatly increased cost and many unnecessary procedures and treatments.  It has been acknowledged since before 1980 that most women can be screened less often.[tpl]cite journal| quote = ACS and others have recommended, since before 1980, that conventional cytology can be safely performed up to every three years for most women. | author = Smith, RA; et al.| title = American Cancer Society Guideline for the Early Detection of Cervical Neoplasia and Cancer | volume = 52 | issue = 1 | pages = 8–22 | year = 2002 [/tpl]  In some guidelines, frequency depends on age; for instance in Great Britain, screening is recommended every 3 years for women under 50, and every 5 years for those over.
Screening should stop about age 65 unless there is a recent abnormal tests or disease.  There is probably no benefit screening women aged 60 or over whose previous tests have been negative.[tpl]cite journal | author = Sasieni P, Adams J, Cuzick J | title = Benefit of cervical screening at different ages: evidence from the UK audit of screening histories | journal = Br J Cancer | volume = 89 | issue = 1 | pages = 88–93 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12838306 | pmc = 2394236 | doi = 10.1038/sj.bjc.6600974 [/tpl]  If a woman's last three Pap results were normal, she can stop at age 65, according to the USPSTF, ACOG, ACS and ASCP; England's NHS says 64.
There is no need to continue screening after a complete hysterectomy for benign disease.
Pap smear screening is still recommended for those who have been vaccinated against HPV, since the vaccines do not cover all of the HPV types that can cause cervical cancer.  Also, the vaccine does not protect against HPV exposure before vaccination.
Women with a history of endometrial cancer should discontinue routine pap tests. Further tests are unlikely to detect recurrence of cancer but are likely to give false positive results, which would lead to unnecessary further testing.
More frequent Pap smears may be needed to follow-up after an abnormal Pap smear, or after treatment for abnormal Pap or biopsy results, or after treatment for cancer.

==Procedure==

For best results, a Pap test should not occur when a woman is menstruating.  However, Pap smears can be performed during a woman's menstrual period, especially if the physician is using a liquid-based test; if bleeding is extremely heavy, endometrial cells can obscure cervical cells, and it is therefore inadvisable to have a Pap smear if bleeding is excessive.
Obtaining a pap smear should not cause pain,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ourbodiesourselves.org/publications/cbclex5b.asp |title=Excerpts from Changing Bodies, Changing Lives |publisher=Our Bodies Ourselves |date= |accessdate=2013-07-02[/tpl] but it can if the patient has certain untreated vaginal problems such as cervical stenosis or vaginismus, or if the person performing it is too harsh, or uses the wrong size speculum. The patient should speak up if they are in pain. Many women experience spotting or mild diarrhea afterward.
Many health care providers are under the false impression that only sterile water, or no lubricant at all, should be used to lubricate the speculum. This may result in unnecessary discomfort. A number of studies have shown that using a small amount of water-based gel lubricant does not interfere with, obscure, or distort the PAP smear. Further, cytology is not affected nor some STD testing.[tpl]cite web|title=The Effect of Using Water-based Gel Lubricant During a Speculum Exam On Pap Smear Results|url=http://commons.pacificu.edu/pa/190/|work=School of Physician Assistant Studies|publisher=Pacific University|accessdate=4 February 2012|author=Wright, Jessica L.|year=2010[/tpl]
The health care worker begins by inserting a speculum into the woman's vagina, which spreads the vagina open and allows access to the cervix. The health care provider then collects a sample of cells from the outer opening or os of the cervix by scraping it with an Aylesbury spatula. An endocervical brush is rotated in the central opening of the cervix.  The cells are placed on a glass slide and taken to the laboratory to be checked for abnormalities.
A  plastic-fronded broom is sometimes used in place of the spatula and brush. The broom is not as good a collection device, since it is much less effective at collecting endocervical material than the spatula and brush.[ref]
[tpl]cite journal | author = Martin-Hirsch P, Lilford R, Jarvis G, Kitchener HC | title = Efficacy of cervical-smear collection devices: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Lancet | volume = 354 | issue = 9192 | pages = 1763–1770 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10577637 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(99)02353-3 [/tpl][/ref] The broom is used more frequently with the advent of liquid-based cytology, although either type of collection device may be used with either type of cytology.
The sample is stained using the Papanicolaou technique, in which tinctorial dyes and acids are selectively retained by cells. Unstained cells cannot be seen with a light microscope. Papanicolaou chose stains that highlighted cytoplasmic keratinization, which actually has almost nothing to do with the nuclear features used to make diagnoses now.
In some cases, a computer system may prescreen the slides, indicating those that do not need examination by a person or highlighting areas for special attention.  The sample is then usually screened by a specially trained and qualified cytotechnologist using a light microscope. The terminology for who screens the sample varies according to the country; in the UK, the personnel are known as cytoscreeners, biomedical scientists (BMS), advanced practitioners and pathologists. The latter two take responsibility for reporting the abnormal sample which may require further investigation.

===Automated analysis===

In the last decade, there have been successful attempts to develop automated, computer image analysis systems for screening.[tpl]cite journal | author = Biscotti CV, Dawson AE, Dziura B, Galup L, Darragh T, Rahemtulla A, Wills-Frank L | title = Assisted primary screening using the automated ThinPrep Imaging System | journal = Am.

==Results==

In screening a general or low-risk population, most Pap results are normal.
In the United States, about 2–3 million abnormal Pap smear results are found each year.[ref]
