[[Path-ordering]]

Here p is a permutation that orders the parameters by value:
For example:

==Examples==

If an operator is not simply expressed as a product, but as a function of another operator, we must first perform a Taylor expansion of this function. This is the case of the Wilson loop, which is defined as a path-ordered exponential to guarantee that the Wilson loop encodes the holonomy of the gauge connection. The parameter σ that determines the ordering is a parameter describing the contour, and because the contour is closed, the Wilson loop must be defined as a trace in order to be gauge-invariant.

==Time ordering==

Explicitly we have
Since the operators depend on their location in spacetime (i.e. not just time) this time-ordering operation is only coordinate independent if operators at spacelike separated points commute. Note that the time-ordering is usually written with the time argument increasing from right to left.
In general, for the product of n field operators [tpl]nowrap|A1(t1), …, An(tn)[/tpl] the time-ordered product of operators are defined as follows:
where the sum runs all over p's and over the symmetric group of n degree permutations and
The S-matrix in quantum field theory is an example of a time-ordered product. The S-matrix, transforming the state at [tpl]nowrap|t [tpl]=[/tpl] −∞[/tpl] to a state at [tpl]nowrap|t [tpl]=[/tpl] +∞[/tpl], can also be thought of as a kind of "holonomy", analogous to the Wilson loop. We obtain a time-ordered expression because of the following reason:
We start with this simple formula for the exponential
Now consider the discretized evolution operator
Note that the evolution operators over the "past" time intervals appears on the right side of the product. We see that the formula is analogous to the identity above satisfied by the exponential, and we may write
