Reichsjustizamt was under the jurisdiction of the Reichskanzler or Imperial Chancellor as Department IV from 1875 until 1 January 1877 when it became independent. Under Reichsjustizamt were the Imperial Court, the Imperial Bar, and the Imperial Patent Office. An Undersecretary of State managed the Reichsjustizamt.
