==History==

The fair was founded in 1994, and held for three seasons at the Butler County Fairgrounds, while the organizers searched for a suitable property.  The present site, an abandoned farm which had subsequently been strip mined and landscaped, was selected for its ideal location and setting, and first hosted the fair in the summer of 1997.[tpl]cite news|last=Zemba|first=Liz|title=Organizers put abrupt end to Pittsburgh Renaissance Festival|url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/s_460373.html|accessdate=31 December 2010|newspaper=TRIBUNE-REVIEW|date=July 2, 2006 [/tpl] In 2006 the fair was canceled due to lack of financing.[tpl]cite news|title=Poor attendance forces cancellation of renaissance festival|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06184/703051-42.stm|accessdate=31 December 2010|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=July 3, 2006[/tpl] However, a year later, the fair was purchased by Rocky Mountain Festivals[tpl]cite news|last=McCaffrey|first=Kate |title=Stage Preview: Medieval merriment makes a comeback in West Newton  |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07235/811278-325.stm|accessdate=31 December 2010|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=August 23, 2007[/tpl] and was reopened under the direction of the company's CEO.[tpl]cite news|last=Carter|first=Alice T. |title=Pittsburgh Renaissance Festival gets rebirth|url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/dailycourier/news/s_524961.html|accessdate=31 December 2010|newspaper=Tribune-Review|date=August 30, 2007[/tpl]
