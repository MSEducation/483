==History==

It was in operation as educational gymnasium for Lutheran clergy until 1817.Encyklopedia PWN "Gdańskie Gimnazjum Akademickie" It was one of the most developed educational centers in Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. It also was the site of Collegium Medicum-one of the first associations of doctors in Polish-controlled territories.
In the 16th century, as many cities in Prussia became Lutheran, the population began to seek a Lutheran education. The University of Königsberg in neighbouring Ducal Prussia, founded in 1544, was not big enough to educate all the new Protestant clerics and administrators needed for the newly Lutheran state in addition to arrivals from the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, so local Latin schools in the Commonwealth were upgraded. The future home of the Gymnasium would be the former Franciscan monastery turned into a school. In 1539, a Schola DantiscanaReinhard Golz, Wolfgang Mayrhofer: Luther and Melanchthon in the Educational Thought of Central and Eastern Europe, 1998, ISBN 3-8258-3490-5 http://books.google.com/books?id=bK6GwNEbgK0C&pg=PA147&vq=Schola&source=gbs_search_s&sig=EUxOZ4bjVppZ_qmKYjbYP2ZUdAw program was started by Andreas Aurifaber. In 1558 Johann Hoppe founded a secular gymnasium that would become the Academic Gymnasium Danzig. Achatius Curaeus (1531–1594), from the University of Wittenberg, was made the first rector, but due to the theological conflicts between Gnesio-Lutherans and Philippists, he soon left.
In 1580, the school received the title Academic Gymnasium. Along with similar schools in Elbing and Thorn (now Elblag, Torun), the gymnasium transformed the province of Royal Prussia into a center of classical studies in the 16th century.Urban Latin schools were remodelled into institutions of higher learning; from the middle of the sixteenth century, the three academic Gymnasia in Danzig, Thorn and Elbing transformed Royal Prussia into a centre of classical studies - Karin Friedrich: The Other Prussia: Royal Prussia, Poland and Liberty, 1569-1772 http://books.google.com/books?id=3pdTHkGcs1wC&pg=PA72&vq=Academic+Gymnasia+Prussia&source=gbs_search_s&sig=57hE4cMxgibq-eSHzkhZx9fUu9U
In 1817, when Danzig was part of the Kingdom of Prussia, it was changed to a municiple gymnasium and named Städtisches Gymnasium Danzig (City High School of Danzig), in contrast to the earlier the (royal) Königliches Gymnasium. The Academic Gymnasium Danzig was in operation until March 1945, when Danzig fell to the Red Army. Subsequently the city, as Gdańsk, became part of Poland.
