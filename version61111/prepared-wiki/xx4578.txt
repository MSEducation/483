==Early life==

Harry was born at St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, London, England, on 15 September 1984.[tpl]cite news|title=Princess Di gives birth to boy|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=V19GAAAAIBAJ&sjid=yjENAAAAIBAJ&pg=1677,1656508&dq=princess+diana&hl=en|accessdate=31 May 2013|newspaper=The Evening News|date=16 September 1984|agency=Associated Press|location=London[/tpl] He was baptised on 21 December 1984 at St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie. His godparents were The Duke of York (his paternal uncle); Lady Sarah Armstrong-Jones (his paternal cousin once removed); Lady Vestey; Mrs William Bartholomew; Bryan Organ; and Gerald Ward, a former officer in the Household Cavalry.[tpl]cite web|url=http://users.uniserve.com/~canyon/christenings.htm#Christenings |title=Royal Christenings|publisher=Yvonne's Royalty Home Page|accessdate=31 July 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Smith|first=Terry|coauthors=Rosemary Thorpe-Tracey|title=A Windsor War|journal=People|date=14 January 1985|volume=23|issue=2|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20089686,00.html|accessdate=6 June 2013[/tpl]
Diana wanted Harry and his older brother William to have a broader range of experiences than previous royal children and took them to venues that ranged from Disney World and McDonald's to AIDS clinics and shelters for the homeless.[tpl]Cite journal|url=http://www.people.com/people/prince_harry/biography|title=Prince Harry|journal=People|accessdate=15 October 2008[/tpl] Harry began to accompany his parents on official visits at an early age; his first overseas royal tour was with his parents to Italy in 1985.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/personalprofiles/theprinceofwales/atwork/supportingthequeen/countriesvisited/index.html|title=The Prince of Wales > At Work > Countries Visited|publisher=Clarence House|accessdate=15 October 2008[/tpl]
Harry's parents divorced in 1996, and his mother died following a car accident in Paris the following year. Harry and William were staying with their father at Balmoral at the time, and the Prince of Wales told his sons about their mother's death.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/conspiracy_files/6217366.stm|title=Timeline: How Diana Died|work=BBC|date=30 August 1997|accessdate=11 April 2008|location=London[/tpl] At his mother's funeral, Harry, then 12, accompanied his father, brother, paternal grandfather, and maternal uncle, Earl Spencer in walking behind the funeral cortège from Kensington Palace to Westminster Abbey.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/6/newsid_2502000/2502307.stm|title=BBC ON THIS DAY – 6–1997: Diana's funeral watched by millions|work=BBC|date=6 September 1997|location=London|accessdate=26 March 2009[/tpl]

==Education==

Like his father and brother, Harry was educated at independent schools. He started at Jane Mynors' nursery school and the pre-preparatory Wetherby School, both in London.[tpl]cite news|title=Prince William in pictures|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/royalty/8371264/Prince-William-in-pictures.html?image=4|accessdate=23 July 2013|newspaper=The Telegraph|location=London|date=18 March 2011[/tpl] Following this, he attended Ludgrove School, and, after passing the entrance exams, was admitted to Eton College, where he studied geography, art history, and art at A-Level. The decision to place Harry at Eton went against the Windsor family tradition of sending children to Gordonstoun (Harry's grandfather, father, two uncles, and two cousins all attended); it did make Harry follow in the Spencer family footsteps, as both Diana's father and brother had attended Eton.
In June 2003, Harry completed his education at Eton with two A-Levels[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/4634031.stm|title=What is it like at Eton College?|date=4 July 2005|publisher=BBC News|location=London|accessdate=11 October 2009[/tpl] (achieving a grade B in art and D in Geography) having decided to drop history of art after AS level.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/3150649.stm|title=Prince Harry's A-level results|date=14 August 2003|work=BBC News|location=London|accessdate=11 October 2009[/tpl] He excelled in sports, particularly polo and rugby union.[tpl]Cite news|title=A Royal Brush with the Olympics|url=http://www.bbcamerica.com/london-games/photos/a-royal-brush-with-the-olympics/#67|date=July–August 2012|publisher=BBC America|quote=He's not an Olympian, but Prince Harry is a top tier athlete, playing competitive polo and rugby.

Harry was presented with his flying brevet (wings) by his father on 7 May 2010 at a ceremony at the Army Air Corps Base (AAC), Middle Wallop.

==Royal duties==

At the age of 21, Harry was appointed as a Counsellor of State and began his duties in that capacity when the Queen was attending the 2005 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Malta. The following year, Harry was in Lesotho to visit again Mants'ase Children's Home near Mohale's Hoek, which he first toured in 2004 and, along with Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, launched Sentebale: The Princes' Fund for Lesotho, a charity to aid children orphaned by HIV/AIDS. He has granted his patronage to organisations including WellChild, Dolen Cymru, and MapAction. To aid Sentebale, and the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund and Centrepoint, Harry and his brother organised the Concert for Diana at Wembley Stadium, on 1 July 2007.
Sport has been a way that Harry has helped charities and other organisations, such as training as a Rugby Development Officer for the Rugby Football Union in 2004 and coaching students in schools to encourage them to learn the sport. He has participated in polo matches, like his brother and father, to raise money for charitable causes.
On 6 January 2009, the Queen granted Harry and William their own royal household. It has three main staff members, supported by a "small" team. Sir David Manning, the former British ambassador to Washington, is a part-time adviser to the princes. Previously, William and Harry's affairs had been handled by the office of their father at Clarence House in central London. The new household released a statement, complete with their own cyphers at the top, announcing that they have established their own office at nearby St James's Palace to look after their public, military and charitable activities. Harry's cypher is similar to his brother's, but with an H in a shade of blue similar to that used by his mother. In September 2009, William and Harry set up The Foundation of Prince William and Prince Harry to enable the princes to take forward their charitable ambitions. The foundation is the culmination of the princes' charitable lives so far.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/newsandgallery/focus/the_foundation_of_prince_william_and_prince_harry_570302665.html |title=The Foundation of Prince William and Prince Harry |publisher=princeofwales.gov.uk |date=2 October 2011 |accessdate=7 February 2012[/tpl]

Rumours have persisted that Harry might be the son of James Hewitt, with whom his mother had an affair, but this has been refuted by Hewitt and others, who point out that Harry was born before the affair began.[tpl]#tag:ref|The rumours are supposedly based on a similarity of hair colour; however, red hair is a known Spencer family trait. Hewitt told the press in 2002, "There really is no possibility whatsoever that I am Harry's father. I can absolutely assure you that I am not…I can understand the interest but Harry was already walking by the time my relationship with Diana began. Admittedly the red hair is similar to mine and people say we look alike. I have never encouraged these comparisons and although I was with Diana for a long time I must state once and for all that I'm not Harry's father."

==Titles, styles, honours and arms==

===Titles and styles===

Harry's full style and title is His Royal Highness Prince Henry Charles Albert David of Wales, but he is almost always called Prince Harry. As a British prince he uses the name of the area over which his father holds title, i.e., Wales, as a territorial suffix in lieu of surname. Past precedent is that such surnames are dropped from usage in adulthood, after which either title alone or Mountbatten-Windsor is used when necessary. Harry continues to use Wales as his surname for military purposes and is known as Captain Harry Wales in such contexts.[tpl]Cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/prince-harry/8455766/Prince-Harry-promoted-to-captain-in-Army.html |last=Nikkhah |first=Roya |title=Prince Harry promoted to captain in Army |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=17 April 2011 |accessdate=12 June 2011 |location=London[/tpl] If his father succeeds to the throne, Harry's style will become His Royal Highness The Prince Henry. Traditionally, sons of the reigning monarch and of the Prince of Wales receive a dukedom immediately prior to marriage, the most recent being Prince William, who became Duke of Cambridge.
