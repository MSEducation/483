</ref> The cryotron works on the principle that [[magnetic field]]s destroy superconductivity. This simple device consists of two superconducting wires ( e.g. tantalum and niobium) with different critical temperature (Tc). The cryotron was invented by [[Dudley Allen Buck]] of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Lincoln Laboratory.
