Copp's Hill Terrace is an historic terrace and park between Commercial and Charter Streets west of Jackson Avenue on Copp's Hill in Boston, Massachusetts near Copp's Hill Burying Ground.
A landscaped arrangement of granite steps, knee-walls and banisters with cast-iron parapets ascending to a large plaza overlooking Commercial Street and the Mystic River, the terrace was designed in the 1890s by landscape architect Charles Eliot of Olmsted, Olmsted and Eliot, and built by Boston contractor Perkins & White.  From the terrace, a large crowd observed the destruction wrought by Boston's Great Molasses Flood of 1919.
Copp's Hill Terrace was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.
