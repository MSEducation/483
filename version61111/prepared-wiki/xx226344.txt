[[Telephone numbers in Namibia]]

Country Code: +264 
International Call Prefix: 00 
Trunk Prefix: 0
Namibia's telephone numbering plan was originally devised when the country, then known as South West Africa, was under South African administration, and integrated into the South African telephone numbering plan.
Area codes beginning with 06 were  allocated to Namibia, including Walvis Bay, a South African exclave, which was not transferred to Namibian sovereignty until 1994.
Following Namibia's independence in 1990, direct dialing between Namibia and South Africa was discontinued, and calls were classed as international. Consequently, subscribers were required to use the international access code and country calling code, omitting the trunk code 0. Namibia had already been allocated its own country code by the International Telecommunication Union, +264.
