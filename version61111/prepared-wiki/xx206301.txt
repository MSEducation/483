William Bowie Stewart Campbell Sawers (1844 – 19 May 1916) was a Scottish-born Australian politician. Born in Stirlingshire in Scotland, where he was educated, he migrated to Australia in 1865, becoming a grazier with large holdings. In 1885 he was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as the member for Bourke, holding the seat until 1886; later, in 1898, he was elected to the seat of Tamworth. In 1901 he resigned from the Legislative Assembly in order to contest the first federal election as the Protectionist candidate for New England; he won narrowly. He was defeated in 1903 by a Free Trade candidate. Sawers died in 1916.[tpl]cite web|last=Carr|first=Adam|title=Australian Election Archive|work=Psephos, Adam Carr's Election Archive|url=http://psephos.adam-carr.net/countries/a/australia|year=2008|accessdate=2008-05-24[/tpl][tpl]cite web| title=Mr William Bowie Stewart Campbell Sawers (1844 - 1916) |publisher=Parliament of New South Wales|url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/members.nsf/1fb6ebed995667c2ca256ea100825164/1bb86bf64992d5a4ca256e58001041e1 |accessdate=16 February 2010[/tpl]
