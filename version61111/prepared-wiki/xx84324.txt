The Carolina Cobras were an expansion franchise in the Arena Football League. The team was formed prior to the 2000 season, which endured a player strike.
The team was originally based in Raleigh, North Carolina, but moved to Charlotte following its second season.
==History== 
They played their home games in Raleigh, North Carolina, at the Raleigh Entertainment & Sports Arena (now called the PNC Arena) prior to the 2003 season. The team was based in the Charlotte Coliseum through 2004. Coaching staff included: Ed Khayat, John Gregory, Ron Selesky, Ray Jauch, Rich Salzer. On September 20, 2004, prior to the arrival of the NBA's Charlotte Bobcats, the league announced the termination of this franchise; its players were made available to the other AFL teams in a dispersal draft.

==Legacy==

The Cobras' legacy in Charlotte was actually meant to fill open dates at the Charlotte Coliseum when the Charlotte Hornets moved to New Orleans, Louisiana. But when the Bobcats began play, however, the Cobras had to make way.
