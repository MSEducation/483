Songs from the Road is a posthumous released live blues album by Jeff Healey. It was released in July, 2009. This album was released over a year after his death, and contains hits and covers.  As noted by one reviewer, "...the blind musician will be remembered best for playing searing guitar on his lap, looking like a pedal steel guitar man gone mad. Songs from the Road...captures Healey's gift for energizing rock and blues tunes with powerful, sometimes blistering guitar work.  It's a talent that occasionally sneaks up on the listener."Dennis Smith, Review of Songs From The Road; Toronto Blues Music Examiner, as reprinted at www.stonyplainrecords.com.
