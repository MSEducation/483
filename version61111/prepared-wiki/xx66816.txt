The Triborough Bridge, renamed the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge in 2008, and sometimes referred to as the RFK Triborough Bridge, is a complex of three separate bridges in New York City, United States, carrying Interstate 278 and New York State Route 900G. Spanning the Harlem River, the Bronx Kill, and the Hell Gate (a strait of the East River), the bridges connect the boroughs of Manhattan, Queens, and the Bronx via Randalls and Wards Islands, which are joined by landfill.
The bridge is owned and operated by the MTA Bridges and Tunnels, part of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.

==History==

Plans for connecting Manhattan, Queens and the Bronx were first announced by Edward A. Byrne, chief engineer of the New York City Department of Plant and Structures, in 1916.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/M108F/ |title=Triboro Plaza |publisher=New York City Department of Parks & Recreation |accessdate=February 25, 2010[/tpl] While such a bridge complex's construction had long been recommended by local officials, the project failed receive funding until 1925, when the city appropriated money for surveys, test borings and structural plans.
Construction began on Black Friday in 1929, but soon the Triborough project's outlook began to look bleak. Othmar Ammann, who had collapsed the original design's two-deck roadway into one, requiring lighter towers, and thus, lighter piers, saving $10 million on the towers alone, was enlisted again to help guide the project. Using New Deal money, it was resurrected in the early 1930s by Robert Moses, who created the Triborough Bridge Authority to fund, build and operate it.  The completed structure was opened to traffic on July 11, 1936.
The total cost of the bridge was more than $60 million, one of the largest public works projects of the Great Depression, more expensive even than the Hoover Dam.[tpl]cite news |title=Reappraising a Landmark Bridge, and the Visionary Behind It |first=Sam |last=Roberts |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/11/nyregion/11bridge.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=July 11, 2006 |accessdate=February 25, 2010[/tpl] The structure used concrete from factories from Maine to Mississippi. To make the formwork for pouring the concrete, a whole forest on the Pacific Coast was cut down.[tpl]cite book |last=Caro |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Caro |title=The Power Broker |publisher=Vintage Books |location=New York |year=1974 |isbn=0-394-72024-5 |page=386[/tpl]

At some point in the past, a sign on the bridge informed travelers, "In event of attack, drive off bridge," New York Times columnist William Safire wrote in 2008. The "somewhat macabre sign", he wrote, must have "drawn a wry smile from millions of motorists."[tpl]cite news |last=Safire |first=William | authorlink=William Safire |title=On Language: Dead End |newspaper=The New York Times |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/13/magazine/13wwln-safire-t.html |date=July 13, 2008 |accessdate=December 4, 2008[/tpl]

On May 5, 2010, the New York City Police Department closed the bridge and sent in the bomb squad to investigate a U-Haul truck from which a man had reportedly fled. This investigation came days after a failed attempt at a car bombing in Times Square. A short time later, the NYPD deemed this incident nonthreatening and reopened the bridge.[tpl]cite news |title=New York shuts Triborough Bridge after truck found abandoned |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/05/AR2010050505680.html |newspaper=The Washington Post |agency=Reuters |date=May 5, 2010 |accessdate=August 27, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=RFK/Triborough Bridge turns 75 |first=Georgia |last=Panagi |url=http://queenscourier.com/2011/rfktriborough-bridge-turns-75-14561/ |newspaper=Queens Courier |date=July 13, 2011 |accessdate=December 5, 2011[/tpl]

==Usage==

The toll revenues from the Triborough Bridge pay for a portion of the public transit subsidy for the New York City Transit Authority and the commuter railroads.[tpl]cite news |title=F.Y.I. |first=Jennifer |last=Steinhauer |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/13/nyregion/fyi-155438.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=February 13, 1994 |accessdate=February 25, 2010[/tpl] The bridge carries approximately 200,000 vehicles per day.
The bridge has sidewalks in all three legs where the TBTA officially requires bicyclists to walk their bicycles across[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mta.info/bandt/regs.pdf |format=PDF |title=Rules and Regulations Governing the Use of the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority Facilities |date=October 1, 2003 |publisher=MTA Bridges & Tunnels |at=Section 1022.1(e) |accessdate=February 20, 2010[/tpl] due to safety concerns.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mta.info/bike/index.html#bandt |title=MTA Bike & Ride |publisher=Metropolitan Transportation Authority |accessdate=February 20, 2010[/tpl] However, the signs stating this requirement have been usually ignored by bicyclists,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/pdf/bike/masterpl.pdf |format=PDF |title=New York City Bicycle Master Plan |date=May 1997 |publisher=New York City Department of City Planning |page=16 |accessdate=February 20, 2010[/tpl] while the New York City Government has recommended that the TBTA should reassess this kind of bicycling ban.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/pdf/bike/masterpl.pdf |format=PDF |title=New York City Bicycle Master Plan |date=May 1997 |publisher=New York City Department of City Planning |page=57 |accessdate=February 20, 2010[/tpl] Stairs on the [tpl]convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] Queens leg impede handicapped access.  The Queens stairway along the southern side was demolished at the beginning of the 21st century, thus isolating that walkway, but the ramp of the Wards Island end of the walkway along the northern side was improved in 2007.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl] The two sidewalks of the Bronx span are connected to only one ramp at the Randalls Island end.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl]
