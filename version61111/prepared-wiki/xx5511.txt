==Demographic trends==

Official estimates put the population of Kazakhstan at 16,500,000 as of April 2011, of which 46% is rural and 54% urban population.http://www.stat.kz/p_perepis/Pages/n_04_02_10.aspx, Statistical Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan [tpl]ru icon[/tpl] The 2009 population estimate is 6.8% higher than the population reported in the last census from January 1999 (slightly less than 15 million). These estimates have been confirmed by the 2009 population census, and this means that the decline in population that began after 1989 has been arrested and reversed.
The proportion of men makes up 48.3%, the proportion of women 51.7%. The proportion of Kazakhs makes up 63.6%, Russians 23.7%, Uzbeks 2.9%, Ukrainians 2.1%, Uygur 1.4%, Tatars 1.3%, Germans 1.1%, others 3.9%.
The population of Kazakhstan increased steadily from 6.1 million in the 1939 census to 16.5 million in the 1989 census. Official estimates indicate that the population continued to increase after 1989, peaking out at 17 million in 1993 and then declining to 15 million in the 1999 census. The downward trend continued through 2002, when the estimated population bottomed out at 14.9 million, and then resumed its growth.Population dynamics and ethnic composition of Kazakhstan in the second half of the 20th century, Demoscope Weekly, No. 103-104, 3–16 March 2003 [tpl]ru icon[/tpl]  Significant amounts of Russians returned to Russia.  Kazakhstan underwent significant urbanization during the first 50 years of the Soviet era, as the share of rural population declined from more than 90% in the 1920s to less than 50% since the 1970s.

===Population of Kazakhstan 1939-2009===

As of 2003, there were discrepancies between Western sources regarding the population of Kazakhstan. United States government sources, including the CIA World Fact Book and the US Census Bureau International Data Base, listed the population as 15,340,533,CIA Factbook (Kazakhstan) Retrieved on May 2, 2008 while the World Bank gave a 2002 estimate of 14,794,830.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2008[/tpl] This discrepancy was presumably due to difficulties in measurement caused by the large migratory population in Kazakhstan, emigration, and low population density - only about 5.5 persons per km² in an area the size of Western Europe.

===Total fertility rate===

Total fertility rate by regions of Kazakhstan: Mangystau - 3,80, South Kazakhstan - 3,71, Kyzylorda - 3,42, Atyrau - 3,29, Jambyl - 3,20, Aqtobe - 2,70, Almaty (province) - 2,65, Almaty (city) - 2,65, City of Astana -	2,44, West Kazakhstan -	2,29, Aqmola - 2,19, East Kazakhstan - 2,07, Qaragandy - 2,04, Pavlodar - 1,98, North Kazakhstan - 1,72, Qostanay - 1,70, Republic of Kazakhstan - 2,65. Thus it can be seen that fertility rate is higher in more traditionalist and religious south and west, and lower in the north and east, where the percentage of Slavic and German population is still relatively high.http://www.stat.kz/digital/naselsenie/Pages/default.aspx
According to the Kazakhstan Demographic and Health Survey in 1999, the TFR for Kazakhs was 2.5 and that for Russians was 1.38. TFR in 1989 for Kazakhs & Russians were 3.58 and 2.24 respectively.Kazakhstan: Demographic and Health Survey, 1999 - Final Report, Chapter 4: Fertility

==Ethnic groups==

===History of ethnic composition===

At the beginning end of the 19th century Kazakhstan was part of Russian Empire, and despite tsarist policies of russian settlement, indigenous ethnic group - kazakhs were constituting overwhelming majority of the territory population. However in early 20th century, under Soviet rule, kazakhs saw their biggest depopulation due to major famines of 1920s and 1930s, which were caused by Collectivization in the Soviet Union.
Significant Russian immigration has also taken place in 1950-1960s, due to Soviet Virgin Lands Campaign and Space Program during the Khrushchev era.[tpl]cite news |last=Greenall |first=Robert |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4420922.stm |title=Russians left behind in Central Asia |publisher=BBC News |date=23 November 2005 |accessdate=9 September 2013[/tpl] In the late 1930s thousands of other ethnic group living in different parts of Soviet Union were deported to Kazakhstan, altering it's ethnic composition. Among them were Koreans  that were deported to Central Asia. These people are now known as Koryo-saram.
According to the 2009 census there are two dominant ethnic groups in Kazakhstan, they are ethnic Kazakhs (63.1%)  and ethnic Russians (23.7%) with a wide array of other groups represented, including Ukrainians, Uzbeks, Germans, Chechens, Koreans, and Uyghurs - that is, virtually any group that has ever come under the Russian sphere of influence. This diverse demography is due to the country's central location and its historical use by Russia as a place to send colonists, dissidents, and minority groups from its other frontiers through population transfer in the Soviet Union. From the 1930s until the 1950s, both Russian opposition (and such Russians accused of being part of the opposition) and certain minorities (esp. Volga Germans, Poles, Ukrainians, Crimean Tatars, Kalmyks) had been interned in labor camps often merely due to their heritage or beliefs, mostly on collective orders by Joseph Stalin. This makes Kazakhstan one of the few places on Earth where normally-disparate Germanic, Indo-Iranian, Koreans, Chechen, and Turkic groups live together in a rural setting and not as a result of modern immigration. Most of the population speaks Russian; only half of ethnic Kazakhs speak Kazakh fluently, although it is enjoying a renaissance. Both Kazakh and Russian languages have official status.
After the fall of the Soviet Union, a large portion of Russian and Tatar population emigrated to Russia, and much of the Ukrainian population left for Russia or Ukraine. The German population of Kazakhstan proceeded to emigrate en masse during the 1990s http://people.freenet.de/Wolf/1993aengl.html, as Germany is willing to repatriate them. Also much of the smaller Greek minority took the chance to repatriate to Greece. Some groups have fewer good options for emigration but because of the economic situation are also leaving at rates comparable to the rest of the former Eastern Bloc. Kazakhstan has also received a small but significant number of Uzbek, Kyrgyz, and Tajik immigrants in the past decade, although not as many as Russia; the number of Kyrgyz more than doubled between the 1999 and 2009 censuses, while Tajiks rose by nearly 50%.
