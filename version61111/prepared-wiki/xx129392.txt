Charles Shoebridge is a writer, broadcaster, and unaffiliated authority on security, intelligence, terrorism and crime issues.
A graduate of history and politics, and of the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, he served for almost two decades (until 2000) in diverse front-line policing and military roles, specialising in counter-terrorism and intelligence operations.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl] Prior to his service at Scotland Yard and elsewhere with the Metropolitan Police, he also worked in counter terrorism as a commissioned officer in the British Army.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]
In August 2000 he won £300,000 in an out-of-court settlement with the Metropolitan Police after he was wrongly accused of indecently assaulting a female colleague. He had been suspended as a result of the allegation. His alleged victim had been one of three women officers who had lodged a complaint of bullying against him. Shoebridge's mental and physical health had deteriorated as a result of the allegations and he 'suffered from sweating, bouts of crying, pain in the back of his neck and a loss of interest in sex'.Daily Telegraph, 18 August 2000
After retirement he worked as a pundit, making numerous TV, radio and newspaper contributions, including as one of the host presenters of the television series Crisis Command. This work, however came to an abrupt end. In 2005 Shoebridge took legal action against the Metropolitan Police, claiming that senior Scotland Yard officials unlawfully used their influence with the media to have him denied work.http://shoebridge-v-metpolice.info/index.htmlSky News denied that it had been influenced by the Metropolitan Police by pulling Shoebridge off the air. Shoebridge was described as "not very good" on Sky's contacts database. Sky News said the real reasons Mr Shoebridge was dropped was "because staff personally disliked him, with one branding him "a creep", and that he lacked knowledge on all the topics he was willing to talk about."The Guardian, 17 March 2005 In December 2005 he was vindicated and awarded £52,146 in damages and loss of earnings.http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/4554310.stm
