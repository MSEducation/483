Camp Bud Schiele is one of the premier Boy Scout camps of the Southern Region. Summer camp programs were first officially held on the reservation in 1981 and was called Camp Natomi. In 1982 Camp Bud Schiele opened as we know it today. 
The reservation is settled in rural Rutherford County, North Carolina, and easily accessible from both Highway 64 and 221. Prior to Camp Bud Schiele the Piedmont Council #420 held its summer camps at the Schiele Scout Reservation in Tryon, North Carolina.
