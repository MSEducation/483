Newberry National Volcanic Monument was designated on November 5, 1990, to protect the area around the Newberry Volcano in the United States.  It was created within the boundaries of the Deschutes National Forest and is managed by the U.S. Forest Service. It includes [tpl]convert|50000|acre|ha[/tpl] of lakes, lava flows, and spectacular geologic features in central Oregon. 

==Description==

The highest point within the monument is the summit Paulina Peak [tpl]convert|7985|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl], (2,434 m), with views of the Oregon Cascades and the high desert.   Paulina Peak may be accessed by road during the summer months, and as the road is both steep and rough, with hairpin turns towards the summit, trailers or long vehicles are discouraged. The summit area of Newberry Volcano holds two alpine lakes full of trout, East Lake and Paulina Lake. 
The park is also home to Lava River Cave, Oregon's longest known lava tube, just south of Bend. The cave is easily accessed by U.S. Highway 97 and may be explored by lantern.Lava River Cave from NWsource.com
Lava Butte, a [tpl]convert|500|ft|m|adj=on[/tpl] cinder cone, is located next to U.S. Highway 97 south of Bend, next to the Lava Lands Visitor Center. The visitor center is under renovation, and is typically open during the summer. 
The monument also features a Lava Cast Forest, which is accessible via a [tpl]convert|9|mi|km|adj=on[/tpl] dirt road from U.S. Highway 97. 
The Big Obsidian Flow, created 1,300 years ago, covers [tpl]convert|700|acre|km2[/tpl]. The black, shiny obsidian field is easily accessible from good roads within the caldera, or a trail that traverses the flow.
