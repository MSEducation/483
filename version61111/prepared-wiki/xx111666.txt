[[Property of Baire]]

CATEGORIES: Descriptive set theory, Determinacy

The family of sets with the property of Baire forms a σ-algebra. That is, the complement of an almost open set is almost open, and any countable union or intersection of almost open sets is again almost open.  Since every open set is almost open (the empty set is meager), it follows that every Borel set is almost open.
If a subset of a Polish space has the property of Baire, then its corresponding Banach-Mazur game is determined.  The converse does not hold; however, if every game in a given adequate pointclass Γ is determined, then every set in Γ has the property of Baire. Therefore it follows from projective determinacy, which in turn follows from sufficient large cardinals, that every projective set (in a Polish space) has the property of Baire.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl]
It follows from the axiom of choice that there are sets of reals without the property of Baire.  In particular, the Vitali set does not have the property of Baire.[tpl]harvtxt|Oxtoby|1980[/tpl], p. 22.  Already weaker versions of choice are sufficient: the Boolean prime ideal theorem implies that there is a nonprincipal ultrafilter on the set of natural numbers; each such ultrafilter induces, via binary representations of reals, a set of reals without the Baire property.[ref]
