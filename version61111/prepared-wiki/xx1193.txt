[[Context-sensitive language]]

CATEGORIES: Formal languages

In theoretical computer science, a context-sensitive language is a formal language that can be defined by a context-sensitive grammar.  That is one of the four types of grammars in the Chomsky hierarchy.

==Computational properties==

Computationally, a context-sensitive language is equivalent with a linear bounded nondeterministic Turing machine, also called a linear bounded automaton. That is a non-deterministic Turing machine with a tape of only kn cells, where n is the size of the input and k is a constant associated with the machine. This means that every formal language that can be decided by such a machine is a context-sensitive language, and every context-sensitive language can be decided by such a machine.
This set of languages is also known as NLINSPACE or NSPACE(O(n)), because they can be accepted using linear space on a non-deterministic Turing machine.[ref]
