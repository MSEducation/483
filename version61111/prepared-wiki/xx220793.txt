[[Chesed Shel Emes]]

CATEGORIES: Bereavement in Judaism

Chesed Shel Emes was established in 1930 as a non-profit organization with a mandate to prepare members of the Jewish community for burial according to Orthodox tradition.
Each person is treated with the same consideration and respect. No one is refused service due to financial hardship. Chesed Shel Emes is an independent, community based organization. Men and women are carefully chosen and trained as volunteer members of the Chevra Kadisha (Holy Society). Their purpose is to dutifully and lovingly prepare the dead for burial, an act of true loving kindness.Home - Chesed Shel Emes
