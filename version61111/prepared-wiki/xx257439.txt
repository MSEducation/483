Albert Sherman Osborn is considered the father of the science of questioned document examination in North America.
His seminal book Questioned Documents was first published in 1910 and later heavily revised as a second edition in 1929. Other publications, including The Problem of Proof (1922), The Mind of the Juror (1937) and Questioned Document Problems (1944), were widely acclaimed by both the legal profession and by public and private laboratories concerned with matters involving questioned documents.
Osborn is also known for founding the American Society of Questioned Document Examiners (ASQDE) on September 2, 1942. In 1913 Osborn began inviting select practitioners to informal educational gatherings hosted in his home and those meetings eventually led to formation of the ASQDE.  He became the society's first president and was involved intimately with the discipline and Society until his death four years later.
In the film J. Edgar (2011), Osborn is played by actor Denis O'Hare.
