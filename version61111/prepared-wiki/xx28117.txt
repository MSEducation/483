The MMR vaccine is an immunization vaccine against measles, mumps, and rubella (also called German measles). It is a mixture of live attenuated viruses of the three diseases, administered via injection. It was first developed by Maurice Hilleman while at Merck.[tpl]cite book |author=Offit PA |title=Vaccinated: One Man's Quest to Defeat the World's Deadliest Diseases |location=Washington, DC |publisher=Smithsonian |isbn=0-06-122796-X |year=2007 [/tpl]
A licensed vaccine to prevent measles first became available in 1963, an improved measles vaccine in 1968. Vaccines for the mumps and rubella (German measles) became available in 1967 and 1969, respectively. The three vaccines (for mumps, measles, and rubella) were combined in 1971 to become the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine.Measles: Questions and Answers, Immunization Action Coalition.
The MMR vaccine is generally administered to children around the age of one year, with a second dose before starting school (i.e. age 4/5). The second dose is a dose to produce immunity in the small number of persons (2–5%) who fail to develop measles immunity after the first dose. In the United States, the vaccine was licensed in 1971 and the second dose was introduced in 1989.[tpl]cite journal |author= Banatvala JE, Brown DW |title=Rubella |journal=Lancet |volume=363 |issue=9415 |pages=1127–37 |year=2004 |pmid=15064032 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(04)15897-2[/tpl]
It is widely used around the world; since introduction of its earliest versions in the 1970s, over 500 million doses have been used in over 60 countries.  As with all vaccinations, long-term effects and efficacy are subject to continuing study.  The vaccine is sold by Merck as M-M-R II, GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals as Priorix, Serum Institute of India as Tresivac, and Sanofi Pasteur as Trimovax.
It is usually considered a childhood vaccination. However, it is also recommended for use in some cases of adults with HIV.[tpl]cite web |url=http://depts.washington.edu/hivaids/initial/case4/discussion.html |title=Case 4: Discussion - Appropriate Vaccinations - Initial Evaluation - HIV Web Study |work= |accessdate=[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00053391.htm |title=Measles, Mumps, and Rubella -- Vaccine Use and Strategies for Elimination of Measles, Rubella, and Congenital Rubella Syndrome and Control of Mumps: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) |work= |accessdate=[/tpl]

==Effectiveness==

Before the widespread use of a vaccine against measles, its incidence was so high that infection with measles was felt to be "as inevitable as death and taxes."[tpl]cite journal |author=Babbott FL Jr, Gordon JE |title=Modern measles |journal=Am J Med Sci |volume=228 |issue=3 |pages=334–61 |year=1954 |pmid=13197385[/tpl] Today, the incidence of measles has fallen to less than 1% of people under the age of 30 in countries with routine childhood vaccination.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2008[/tpl] Reported cases of measles in the United States fell from hundreds of thousands to tens of thousands per year following introduction of the vaccine in 1963. Increasing uptake of the vaccine following outbreaks in 1971 and 1977 brought this down to thousands of cases per year in the 1980s. An outbreak of almost 30,000 cases in 1990 led to a renewed push for vaccination and the addition of a second vaccine to the recommended schedule. Fewer than 200 cases have been reported each year since 1997, and the disease is no longer considered endemic.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Summary of notifable diseases—United States, 1993 Published October 21, 1994 for Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 1993; 42 (No. 53)Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Summary of notifable diseases—United States, 2007 Published July 9, 2009 for Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 2007; 56 (No. 53)Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The benefit of measles vaccination in preventing illness, disability, and death has been well documented. The first 20 years of licensed measles vaccination in the U.S. prevented an estimated 52 million cases of the disease, 17,400 cases of intellectual disability, and 5,200 deaths.[tpl]cite journal |author=Bloch AB, Orenstein WA, Stetler HC et al. |title=Health impact of measles vaccination in the United States |journal=Pediatrics |volume=76 |issue=4 |pages=524–32 |year=1985 |pmid=3931045[/tpl] During 1999–2004, a strategy led by the World Health Organization and UNICEF led to improvements in measles vaccination coverage that averted an estimated 1.4 million measles deaths worldwide.[tpl]cite journal |journal= MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep |year=2006 |volume=55 |issue=9 |pages=247–9 |title= Progress in reducing global measles deaths, 1999–2004 |author= Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) |pmid=16528234 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5509a8.htm[/tpl]
Measles is endemic worldwide. Although it was declared eliminated from the U.S. in 2000, high rates of vaccination and good communication with persons who refuse vaccination is needed to prevent outbreaks and sustain the elimination of measles in the U.S. Of the 66 cases of measles reported in the U.S. in 2005, slightly over half were attributable to one unvaccinated individual who acquired measles during a visit to Romania.[tpl]cite journal |journal= MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep |year=2006 |volume=55 |issue=50 |pages=1348–51 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5550a2.htm |title= Measles—United States, 2005 |author= Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) |pmid=17183226[/tpl] This individual returned to a community with many unvaccinated children. The resulting outbreak infected 34 people, mostly children and virtually all unvaccinated; 9% were hospitalized, and the cost of containing the outbreak was estimated at $167,685. A major epidemic was averted due to high rates of vaccination in the surrounding communities.[tpl]cite journal |author=Parker AA, Staggs W, Dayan GH et al. |title=Implications of a 2005 measles outbreak in Indiana for sustained elimination of measles in the United States |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=355 |issue=5 |pages=447–55 |year=2006 |pmid=16885548 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa060775[/tpl]
Mumps is another viral disease of childhood that was once very common.  If mumps is acquired by a male who is past puberty, a possible complication is bilateral orchitis which can in some cases lead to sterility.
thumb|Rubella fell sharply when immunization was introduced.  Rubella, otherwise known as German measles, was also very common before the advent of widespread vaccination. The major risk of rubella is in pregnancy. If a pregnant woman is infected, her baby may contract congenital rubella from her, which can cause significant congenital defects.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.immunizationinfo.org/vaccineInfo/vaccine_detail.cfv?id=24 |accessdate=2007-09-02 |date=2006-09-25 |title= Rubella vaccine information |publisher= National Network for Immunization Information[/tpl]
All three diseases are highly contagious.
The combined MMR vaccine was introduced to induce immunity less painfully than three separate injections at the same time, and sooner and more efficiently than three injections given on different dates.
In 2012, the Cochrane Library published a systematic review of scientific studies. Its authors concluded, "Existing evidence on the safety and effectiveness of MMR vaccine supports current policies of mass immunisation aimed at global measles eradication and in order to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with mumps and rubella."

==Development, formulation and administration==

The component viral strains of MMR vaccine were developed by propagation in animal and human cells.  The live viruses require animal or human cells as a host for production of more virus.
For example, in the case of mumps and measles viruses, the virus strains were grown in embryonated hens' eggs and chick embryo cell cultures.  This produced strains of virus which were adapted for the hens egg and less well-suited for human cells.  These strains are therefore called attenuated strains.  They are sometimes referred to as neuroattenuated because these strains are less virulent to human neurons than the wild strains.
The Rubella component, Meruvax, is propagated using a human cell line (WI-38, named for the Wistar Institute) derived in 1961 from embryonic lung tissue.
MMR II is supplied freeze-dried (lyophilized) and contains live viruses.  Before injection it is reconstituted with the solvent provided.
The MMR vaccine is administered by a subcutaneous injection.The second dose may be given as early as one month after the first dose. The second dose is a dose to produce immunity in the small number of persons (2–5%) who fail to develop measles immunity after the first dose. In the U.S. it is done before entry to kindergarten because that is a convenient time.[tpl]cite web |url=http://cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/combo-vaccines/mmr/faqs-mmr-hcp.htm |title= MMR vaccine questions and answers |year=2004 |accessdate=2008-05-28 |publisher= Centers for Disease Control and Prevention[/tpl]

==Safety==

Adverse reactions, rarely serious, may occur from each component of the MMR vaccine. 10% of children develop fever, malaise and a rash 5–21 days after the first vaccination; 5% develop temporary joint pain.[tpl]cite journal|journal=BMJ |year=2001 |volume=323 |issue=7303 |pages=32 |title= 10-minute consultation: MMR immunisation |author= Harnden A, Shakespeare J |pmid=11440943 |doi=10.1136/bmj.323.7303.32 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/323/7303/32|pmc=1120664[/tpl] Older women appear to be more at risk of joint pain, acute arthritis, and even (rarely) chronic arthritis.[tpl]cite journal |journal=Vaccine |year=2005  |volume=23 |issue=30 |pages=3876–86 |title= Consequence or coincidence?

The number of reports on neurologic disorders is very small, other than evidence for an association between a form of the MMR vaccine containing the Urabe mumps strain and rare adverse events of aseptic meningitis, a transient mild form of viral meningitis.[tpl]cite book |title= Adverse Events Associated with Childhood Vaccines: Evidence Bearing on Causality |year=1994 |isbn=0-309-07496-7 |chapter=Measles and mumps vaccines |chapterurl=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=2138&page=131 |publisher= National Academy Press |author= Institute of Medicine[/tpl] The UK National Health Service stopped using the Urabe mumps strain in the early 1990s due to cases of transient mild viral meningitis, and switched to a form using the Jeryl Lynn mumps strain instead.[tpl]cite journal |journal= Eur J Pediatr |year=1994 |volume=153 |issue=6 |pages=467–8 |title=Withdrawal of a mumps vaccine |author= Colville A, Pugh S, Miller E, Schmitt HJ, Just M, Neiss A |pmid=8088305 |doi=10.1007/BF01983415[/tpl] The Urabe strain remains in use in a number of countries; MMR with the Urabe strain is much cheaper to manufacture than with the Jeryl Lynn strain,[tpl]cite journal |journal= Int J Epidemiol |year=2002 |volume=31 |issue=5 |pages=983–4 |title= Commentary: Ongoing debate over the safety of the different mumps vaccine strains impacts mumps disease control |author= Fullerton KE, Reef SE |url=http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/31/5/983 |pmid=12435772 |doi=10.1093/ije/31.5.983[/tpl] and a strain with higher efficacy along with a somewhat higher rate of mild side effects may still have the advantage of reduced incidence of overall adverse events.
The Cochrane Library review found that, compared to placebo, MMR vaccine was associated with fewer upper respiratory tract infections, more irritability, and a similar number of other adverse effects. The review also found several problems in the quality of MMR vaccine safety studies, and recommended the adoption of standardized definitions of adverse events. The review's abstract concludes, "The design and reporting of safety outcomes in MMR vaccine studies, both pre- and post-marketing, are largely inadequate. The evidence of adverse events following immunisation with the MMR vaccine cannot be separated from its role in preventing the target diseases."[tpl]cite journal |author=Demicheli V, Rivetti A, Debalini MG, Di Pietrantonj C |title=Vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella in children |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume=2 |issue= |pages=CD004407 |year=2012 |pmid=22336803 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004407.pub3[/tpl]
Naturally acquired measles often occurs with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP, a purpuric rash and an increased tendency to bleed that resolves within two months in children). Between 1 in 25,000 and 1 in 40,000 children are thought to acquire ITP in the six weeks following an MMR vaccination, which is a higher rate than found in unvaccinated populations. ITP below the age of 6 years is generally a mild disease, rarely having long-term consequences.[tpl]cite journal |author=Sauvé LJ, Scheifele D |title=Do childhood vaccines cause thrombocytopenia? |journal=Paediatr Child Health |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=31–2 |date=January 2009 |pmid=19436461 |pmc=2661332 |doi= |url=[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Black, C., Kaye, J.

===Autism claims===

In the UK, the MMR vaccine was the subject of controversy after publication of a 1998 paper by Andrew Wakefield et al. reporting a study of twelve children who had bowel symptoms along with autism or other disorders, including cases where onset was believed by the parents to be soon after administration of MMR vaccine.[tpl]cite journal |author= Wakefield A, Murch S, Anthony A et al. |title= Ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia, non-specific colitis, and pervasive developmental disorder in children |journal=Lancet |volume=351 |issue=9103 |pages=637–41 |year=1998 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(97)11096-0 |pmid=9500320 |url=http://briandeer.com/mmr/lancet-paper.htm |accessdate=2007-09-05[/tpl][tpl]Retracted|intentional=yes[/tpl] In 2010, Wakefield's research was found by the General Medical Council to have been "dishonest",[tpl]cite news |title= Andrew Wakefield found 'irresponsible' by GMC over MMR vaccine scare |first= Sarah |last= Boseley |newspaper= The Guardian|date= 28 January 2010|url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2010/jan/28/andrew-wakefield-mmr-vaccine | location=London[/tpl] and The Lancet fully retracted the original paper.[tpl]cite journal |author= |title=Retraction—Ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia, non-specific colitis, and pervasive developmental disorder in children |journal=Lancet |volume=375 |issue=9713 |pages=445 |date=February 2010 |pmid=20137807 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(10)60175-4 |laysource=BBC News |laydate=2010-02-02 |laysummary=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/health/8493753.stm |last1= The Editors Of The Lancet [/tpl] The research was declared fraudulent in 2011 by the British Medical Journal.[tpl]cite journal |year= 2011 |pages= c7452–c7452 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.c7452 |issue= jan05 1 |volume= 342:c7452|title= Wakefield’s article linking MMR vaccine and autism was fraudulent |author= Godlee F, Smith J, Marcovitch H  |journal = BMJ |pmid=21209060[/tpl] Several subsequent peer-reviewed studies have failed to show any association between the vaccine and autism.

==MMRV vaccine==

The MMRV vaccine, a combined measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccine, has been proposed as a replacement for the MMR vaccine to simplify administration of the vaccines.[tpl]cite journal |journal= Pediatr Infect Dis J |year=2007 |volume=26 |issue=7 |pages=632–8 |title= Increasing coverage and efficiency of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine and introducing universal varicella vaccination in Europe: a role for the combined vaccine |author= Vesikari T, Sadzot-Delvaux C, Rentier B, Gershon A |doi=10.1097/INF.0b013e3180616c8f |pmid=17596807[/tpl] Preliminary data indicate a rate of fever-induced seizure of 9 per 10,000 vaccinations with MMRV, as opposed to 4 per 10,000 for separate MMR and varicella injections; U.S. health officials therefore do not express a preference for use of MMRV vaccine over separate injections.[tpl]cite journal |author= Klein NP, Yih WK, Marin M et al. |title= Update: recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) regarding administration of combination MMRV vaccine |journal= MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep |volume=57 |issue=10 |pages=258–60 |year=2008 |pmid=18340332 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5710a3.htm[/tpl]
