====Women's prayer at the Wall====

Until 2013, non-Orthodox prayer was not allowed at the Wall due to the regulations of the Law of the Holy Places, and thus women who prayed using tallits and tefillin were often arrested and given restraining orders keeping them away.http://www.jpost.com/National-News/Pending-deal-with-Women-of-the-Wall-would-annul-regulations-banning-non-Orthodox-practice-at-Kotel-346510 Then in April 2013, Judge Moshe Sobel of the Jerusalem District Court ruled that as long as there is no other appropriate area for pluralistic prayer, women should be allowed to pray according to non-Orthodox customs at the Wall.http://www.jpost.com/National-News/Pending-deal-with-Women-of-the-Wall-would-annul-regulations-banning-non-Orthodox-practice-at-Kotel-346510 As of 2014, negotiations are ongoing with a view to creating an area for pluralistic prayer at the Wall, and officially nullifying the regulations that disallowed non-Orthodox prayer there.http://www.jpost.com/National-News/Pending-deal-with-Women-of-the-Wall-would-annul-regulations-banning-non-Orthodox-practice-at-Kotel-346510 Women of the Wall has been campaigning for "women's free prayer at the Western Wall" since 1988.http://womenofthewall.org.il/about/mission-statement/http://womenofthewall.org.il/about/history/

====Mourning the Temple's Destruction====

According to Jewish Law, one is obligated to grieve and rend one's garment upon visiting the Western Wall and seeing the desolate site of the Temple.Moed Katan 26a; Orach Chaim 561; Yoreh Deah 340 Bach (17th century) explicitly mentions the "Kotel ha-Ma'aravi" when expounding how one could encounter the ruins of the Temple before the ruins of Jerusalem.Bayit Chadash Orach Chaim 561. (He contends that the city itself is in such a state of disrepair that once a person has reached the hills surrounding Jerusalem, he can immediately view the Western Wall) Today, some scholars are of the view that rending one's garments is not applicable since Jerusalem is under Jewish sovereignty. Others disagree, citing that the Temple Mount itself is controlled by the Muslim waqf and the State of Israel has no power to remove the mosques which sit upon it. Furthermore, the mosques' very existence on the site of the Temple should increase one's feeling of distress. If one hasn’t seen the Wall for over 30 days, in order to avoid tearing one's shirt, the custom is to visit on the Sabbath, including Friday afternoons, or Saturday evenings if dressed in Sabbath finery, or on festivals.Minchas Shlomo Vol. 1, Ch. 73. See also: Tearing keriah for Jerusalem[tpl]dead link|date=May 2011[/tpl]; Ask the Rabbi: Kosel Keriah A person who has not seen the Wall within the last 30 days should recite:
 "Our Holy Temple, which was our glory, in which our forefathers praised You, was burned and all of our delights were destroyed".Epstein, Donneal. Halachos for the Traveler, Feldheim 2000, Pg. 70. ISBN 1-58330-439-8. 
The Bach cites Likutim which instructs that "when one sees the Gates of Mercy which are situated in the Western Wall, which is the wall King David built, he should recite:
 Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken her bars: her king and her princes are among the nations: the law is no more; her prophets also find no vision from the Lord" – Book of Lamentations 2:9 

====Prayer notes====

There is a much publicised practice of placing slips of paper containing written prayers into the crevices of the Wall. The earliest account of this practice is recorded in Sefer Tamei Ha-minhagim U’mekorei Ha-dinim and involves Rabbi Chaim ibn Attar, (d. 1743).Sperling, Avraham Yitzchak (1999). Sefer Tamei Ha-minhagim U’mekorei Ha-dinim; Inyanei Hilula D’Rashbi, p. 270. Jerusalem: Shai Le-morah Publishing. More than a million notes are placed each year[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1826734,00.html |title=Obama's Private Prayer 'Leaked' |work=Time |date=July 25, 2008 |accessdate=August 19, 2009[/tpl] and the opportunity to e-mail notes is offered by a number of organisations.[ref]

====Sanctity of the Wall====

There is much debate among Jewish codifiers about whether it is permitted to place one's fingers inside the cracks of the Wall. Those who warn against such action hold that the breadth of the Wall constitutes part of the Temple Mount itself and therefore retains holiness. Others hold that the Wall stands outside the given measurements of the Temple area and therefore there is no concern about inserting one's fingers into the crevices.See Avnei Nezer Yoreh Deah 450 In the past, visitors, based upon various scriptural verses, would drive nails into the cracks and paint their Hebrew names on the Wall. These practices stopped after rabbinic consensus determined that such actions compromised the sanctity of the Wall. Another practice also existed whereby pilgrims or those intending to travel abroad would hack off a chip from the Wall or take some of the sand from between its cracks as a good luck charm or memento. In the late 19th century the question was raised as to whether this was permitted and a long responsa appeared in the Jerusalem newspaper Havatzelet in 1898. It concluded that even if according to Jewish Law it was permitted, the practices should be stopped as it constituted a desecration. More recently the Yalkut Yosef rules that it is forbidden to remove small chips of stone or dust from the Wall, although it is permissible to take twigs from the vegetation which grows in the Wall for an amulet, as they contain no holiness.[ref]
