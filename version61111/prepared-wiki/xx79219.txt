Central Greece ([tpl]lang-el|Στερεά Ελλάδα[/tpl], Stereá Elláda; formerly [tpl]lang|grc|Χέρσος Ἑλλάς[/tpl], Chérsos Ellás), colloquially known as Roúmeli (Ρούμελη), is a traditional geographic region of Greece. Its territory is divided among the modern administrative regions of Central Greece and Attica, and the regional unit of Aetolia-Acarnania in West Greece. Although Attica, including the entire metropolitan area of Athens, is traditionally considered part of Central Greece, it has been administered as a separate region since 1987.

==Etymology==

The region has traditionally been known as Roúmeli (Ρούμελη), a name deriving from the Turkish word Rumelia or Rumeli, meaning "the land of the Rum Romans, i.e. the Byzantine Greeks". The official name Stereá Elláda ("Continental" or "Mainland" Greece), derives from the juxtaposition with the Peloponnese peninsula across the Corinthian Gulf, and the fact that these two territories formed the independent Greek state in 1832.
