Roanoke (formerly Big Lick) is an independent city in the southern U.S. state of Virginia. As of the 2010 census, the population was 97,032.[tpl]cite web|title=State & County QuickFacts|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/51/51770.html|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 6, 2014[/tpl] It is located in the Roanoke Valley of the Roanoke Region of Virginia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.roanoke.org |title=Roanoke Region of Virginia |publisher=Roanoke.org |date= |accessdate=2009-08-27[/tpl]
Roanoke is the largest municipality in Southwest Virginia, and is the principal municipality of the Roanoke Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), which had a 2010 population of 308,707. It is composed of the independent cities of Roanoke and Salem, and the counties of Botetourt, Craig, Franklin and Roanoke. Bisected by the Roanoke River, Roanoke is the commercial and cultural hub of much of Southwest Virginia and portions of Southern West Virginia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.roanoke.org/roanokeregionaltradearea |title=Roanoke Regional Trade Area |publisher=Roanoke.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-11[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newportmedia.com/maps/countyinfo.php?m=67 |title=Roanoke-Lynchburg DMA Map |publisher=newportmedia.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-11[/tpl]

==History==

===Incorporation===

The town first called Big Lick was established in 1852 and chartered in 1874.  It was named for a large outcropping of salt which drew the wildlife to the site near the Roanoke River.[tpl]cite web|url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~HYPER/VAGuide/roanoke.html |title=Roanoke |publisher=Xroads.virginia.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-08-27[/tpl]  In 1882 it became the town of Roanoke, and in 1884 it was chartered as the independent city of Roanoke.  The name Roanoke is said to have originated from an Algonquian word for shell "money".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lost-colony.com/trade.html |title=Trade Items as Transfer of Money |publisher=Lost-colony.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-27[/tpl]  This was also the name of the river that bisected it (probably where shells had come from) and the county.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.visitroanokeva.com/displayinfo.asp?TOPIC=3&NID=173 |title=Roanoke Virginia |publisher=Visitroanokeva.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-27[/tpl]  The city grew frequently through annexation through the middle of the twentieth century.[tpl]cite web|url=http://dls.state.va.us/lrc/charters/ROANOKE.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - ROANOKE.DOC |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2009-08-27[/tpl] The last annexation was in 1976.  The state legislature has since prohibited cities from annexing land from adjacent counties.  Roanoke's location in the Blue Ridge Mountains, in the middle of the Roanoke Valley between Maryland and Tennessee, made it the transportation hub of western Virginia and contributed to its rapid growth.

===Colonial influence===

During colonial times the site of Roanoke was an important hub of trails and roads.  The Great Wagon Road, one of the most heavily travelled roads of eighteenth century America, ran from Philadelphia through the Shenandoah Valley to the future site of the City of Roanoke, where the Roanoke River passed through the Blue Ridge.  The Roanoke Gap proved a useful route for immigrants to settle the Carolina Piedmont region. At Roanoke Gap, another branch of the Great Wagon Road, the Wilderness Road, continued southwest to Tennessee.

===Railroads and coal===

In the 1850s, Big Lick became a stop on the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad (V&T) which linked Lynchburg with Bristol on the Virginia-Tennessee border.
After the American Civil War (1861–1865), William Mahone, a civil engineer and hero of the Battle of the Crater, was the driving force in the linkage of 3 railroads, including the V&T, across the southern tier of Virginia to form the Atlantic, Mississippi & Ohio Railroad (AM&O), a new line extending from Norfolk to Bristol, Virginia in 1870. However, the Financial Panic of 1873 wrecked the AM&O's finances. After several years of operating under receiverships, Mahone's role as a railroad builder ended in 1881 when northern financial interests took control. At the foreclosure auction, the AM&O was purchased by E.W. Clark & Co., a private banking firm in Philadelphia which controlled the Shenandoah Valley Railroad then under construction up the valley from Hagerstown, Maryland. The AM&O was renamed Norfolk and Western Railway (N&W).
Frederick J. Kimball, a civil engineer and partner in the Clark firm, headed the new line and the new Shenandoah Valley Railroad. For the junction for the Shenandoah Valley and the Norfolk and Western roads, Kimball and his board of directors selected the small Virginia village called Big Lick, on the Roanoke River. Although the grateful citizens offered to rename their town "Kimball", at his suggestion, they agreed to name it Roanoke after the river. As the N&W brought people and jobs, the Town of Roanoke quickly became an independent city in 1884. In fact, Roanoke became a city so quickly that it earned the nickname "Magic City".
Kimball's interest in geology was instrumental in the development of the Pocahontas coalfields in western Virginia and West Virginia.  He pushed N&W lines through the wilds of West Virginia, north to Columbus, Ohio and Cincinnati, Ohio, and south to Durham, North Carolina and Winston-Salem, North Carolina. This gave the railroad the route structure it was to use for more than 60 years.
The Virginian Railway (VGN), an engineering marvel of its day, was conceived and built by William Nelson Page and Henry Huttleston Rogers. Following the Roanoke River, the VGN was built through the City of Roanoke early in the twentieth century. It  merged with the N&W in 1959.
The opening of the coalfields made N&W prosperous and Pocahontas bituminous coal world-famous. Transported by the N&W and neighboring Virginian Railway (VGN), local coal fueled half the world's navies.  Today it stokes steel mills and power plants all over the globe.
The Norfolk & Western was famous for manufacturing steam locomotives in-house. It was N&W's  Roanoke Shops that made the company known industry-wide for its excellence in steam power. The Roanoke Shops, with its workforce of thousands, is where the famed classes A, J, and Y6 locomotives were designed, built, and maintained.  New steam locomotives were built there until 1953, long after diesel-electric had emerged as the motive power of choice for most North American railroads.  About 1960, N&W was the last major railroad in the United States to convert from steam to diesel power.
The presence of the railroad also made Roanoke attractive to manufacturers.  American Viscose opened a large rayon plant in Southeast Roanoke in October 1917.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oldchesterpa.com/viscose.htm |title=American Viscose Corp., Marcus Hook, PA |publisher=OldChesterPa |date= |accessdate=2009-08-27[/tpl]  This plant closed in 1958, leaving 5,000 workers unemployed.  When N&W converted to diesel, 2,000 railroad workers were laid off.http://www3.roanoke.com/roatimes/special_sections/southeast/day2_side.html

==Government==

Roanoke has a weak mayor-city manager form of government. The city manager is responsible for the day to day operation of the city's government and has the authority to hire and fire city employees. The mayor has little, if any, executive authority and essentially is the "first among equals" on the city council. The mayor, however, has a bully pulpit as Roanoke media frequently cover the mayor's appearances and statements. The current mayor of Roanoke is David A. Bowers and the current city manager is Christopher P. Morrill. City council has six members, not counting the mayor, all of whom are elected on an at-large basis. A proposal for a ward based council, in which the mayor and vice mayor would continue to be elected at-large, was rejected by Roanoke voters in 1997, but ward system advocates still contend that the at-large system results in a disproportionate number of council members coming from affluent neighborhoods and that electing some or all council members on a ward basis would result in a more equal representation of all areas of the city. The four year terms of city council members are staggered, so there are biannual elections. The candidate who receives the most votes is designated the vice mayor for the following two years.
The city's African-American and professional class voting blocs have made the Democratic Party the city's leading party in recent years.
Independent candidate David A. Bowers, a former Democrat, defeated incumbent Democrat Nelson Harris for Mayor in the May 2008 election with 53% of the vote. In both the 2000 election, Republican Ralph K. Smith and in the 2004 election Nelson Harris won with less than 40% of the vote in competitive three way races.
In the May 2008 council elections, Democrats Court Rosen, Anita Price, and Sherman Lea defeated a slate of loosely allied independent city council candidates including incumbent Brian Wishneff. In the May 2006 council elections, a slate of three former Democrats running on an independent slate backed by Harris defeated the candidates of the Democratic and Republican parties. This election ended the city's long running debate about the fate of Victory Stadium.
Roanoke is represented by two members of the Virginia House of Delegates, Sam Rasoul (D-11th) and Chris Head (R-17th), and one member of the Virginia Senate, John Edwards (D-21st). Former Roanoke mayor Ralph Smith won the 2007 election in the neighboring 22nd Senate district after defeating incumbent Brandon Bell for the Republican nomination in the primary election and Democrat Michael Breiner in the general election.
The City of Roanoke lies within the 6th Congressional District of Virginia, which also includes Lynchburg and much of the Shenandoah Valley. Current representative Bob Goodlatte resides in Roanoke County; many of those who have held the seat lived in or near Roanoke. The 9th Congressional District of Virginia, represented by Morgan Griffith of neighboring Salem, has traditionally covered southwest Virginia but has expanded into parts of Salem, Roanoke County and counties to the north of Roanoke to make up for population losses in the rest of the district. Robert Hurt represents much of the area to south and east of Roanoke, including nearby Franklin County, in the 5th Congressional District of Virginia, which also stretches north to Charlottesville.

==Politics==

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of [tpl]convert|42.9|sqmi|1[/tpl], of which [tpl]convert|42.5|sqmi|1[/tpl] is land and [tpl]convert|0.3|sqmi|1[/tpl] (0.8%) is water.[tpl]GR|1[/tpl]
Roanoke is located in the valley and ridge province of Virginia immediately west of the Blue Ridge Mountains and east of the Allegheny Mountains
Within the city limits is Mill Mountain, which stands detached from surrounding ranges. Its summit features the Roanoke Star, Mill Mountain Zoo, the Discovery Center interpretive building, and an overlook of the Roanoke Valley. The Appalachian Trail runs through the northern section of Roanoke County several miles north of the city, while the Blue Ridge Parkway runs just to the south of the city.  Carvins Cove, the second-largest municipal park in America at [tpl]convert|12700|acre|km2|sing=on[/tpl], lies in northeast Roanoke County and southwest Botetourt County.[tpl]dead link|date=June 2013[/tpl]  Smith Mountain Lake is several miles southeast of the city.  The Jefferson National Forest is nearby.  Roanokers and visitors to the area enjoy hiking, mountain biking, cross-country running, canoeing, kayaking, fly fishing, and other outdoor pursuits.
The city is located in the North Fork of Roanoke winemaking region.  The "North Fork of Roanoke" appellation is a designated American Viticultural Area, recognizing the unique grape growing conditions present in the area.  Valhalla Vineyards is located just outside the city limits of Roanoke.
The Roanoke River flows through the city of Roanoke.  Some stretches of the river flow through parks and natural settings, while others flow through industrial areas.  Several tributaries join the river in the city, most notably Peters Creek, Tinker Creek, and Mud Lick Creek.

===Climate===

Though located along the Blue Ridge Mountains at elevations exceeding [tpl]convert|900|ft|-1|abbr=on[/tpl], Roanoke lies in the humid subtropical climate zone (Köppen Cfa), with four distinct, but generally mild, seasons. Extremes in temperature have ranged from [tpl]convert|105|°F[/tpl] on August 21, 1983 down to [tpl]convert|−12|°F|0[/tpl] on December 30, 1917, though neither [tpl]convert|100|°F|0[/tpl]+ or sub-[tpl]convert|0|°F|0[/tpl] occurs in most years. More typically, the area records an average of 15 nights with lows at or below [tpl]convert|20|°F|0[/tpl] and 25 days with [tpl]convert|90|°F|0[/tpl]+ temperatures annually.
Based on the 1981−2010 period, the city averages [tpl]convert|16.3|in|cm|0[/tpl] of snow per winter. Roanoke experienced something of a snow drought in the 2000s until December 2009 when [tpl]convert|17|in|cm[/tpl] of snow fell on Roanoke in a single storm.[tpl]cite web|last=Ballisty |first=Tim |url=http://www.weather.com/outlook/weather-news/news/articles/winter-storm-aiming-for-mid-atlantic_2009-12-17 |title=Snow Totals Adding Up from Blizzard 2009 |publisher=weather.com |date=2013-01-14 |accessdate=2013-06-12[/tpl] The snowiest winter was 1986–1987 when [tpl]convert|72.9|in|cm|0[/tpl] fell, and the largest single storm dumped approximately three feet (0.9 m) from December 16−18, 1890.
Flooding is the primary weather related hazard faced by Roanoke.  Heavy rains, most frequently from remnants of a hurricane, drain from surrounding areas to the narrow Roanoke Valley.  The most recent significant flood was in the fall of 2004, caused by the remains of Hurricane Ivan.  The most severe flooding in the city's history occurred on November 4, 1985 when heavy storms from the remnants of Hurricane Juan stalled over the area.  Ten people drowned in the Roanoke Valley, and others were saved by rescue personnel.
Many residents complain that they are prone to allergies because of pollen from trees in the surrounding mountains.  Most famously, the family of Wayne Newton moved from Roanoke to the dry climate of Phoenix, Arizona because of his childhood asthma and allergies.http://waynenewton.com/biography2.html[tpl]Dead link|date=August 2009[/tpl]  However, there have not been clinical studies to establish that these conditions are more prevalent in Roanoke than other cities with similar vegetation and climate.
 

==Neighborhoods==

Within its boundaries, Roanoke is divided into 49 individually defined neighborhoods.

==Transportation==

===Roads===

Interstate 581 is the primary north-south roadway through the city.  It is also the only interstate highway as Interstate 81 passes north of the city limits.  Interstate 581 is a concurrency with U.S. Route 220, which continues as the Roy L. Webber Expressway from downtown Roanoke, where the I-581 designation ends, south to State Route 419.  Route 220 connects Roanoke to Martinsville, Virginia and Greensboro, North Carolina.  The proposed Interstate 73 would generally parallel Route 220 between Roanoke and Greensboro and would likely be a concurrency with I-581 through the city.  The primary east-west roadway is U.S. Route 460, named Melrose Avenue and Orange Avenue.  Route 460 connects Roanoke to Lynchburg.  U.S. Route 11 passes through the city, primarily as Brandon Avenue and Williamson Road, which was a center of automotive based commercial development after World War II.  Other major roads include U.S. Route 221, State Route 117 (known as Peters Creek Road), and State Route 101 (known as Hershberger Road).  The Blue Ridge Parkway also briefly runs adjacent to the city border.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/archive/blri/vamap.htm |title=Parkway in Virginia |publisher=Nps.gov |date= |accessdate=2009-08-27[/tpl]
Roanoke is divided into four quadrants: Northwest (NW), Northeast (NE), Southwest (SW), and Southeast (SE).  The mailing address for locations in Roanoke includes the two letter quadrant abbreviation after the street name.  For example, the Center in the Square[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.centerinthesquare.org/index.php |title=Center in the Square |publisher=Center in the Square |date= |accessdate=2013-06-12[/tpl] complex in downtown Roanoke has the address "1 Market Square SE."

===Airports===

Roanoke Regional Airport is located in the northern part of the city and is the primary passenger and cargo airport for Southwest Virginia.

===Rail===

Ironically for a city known for its rail history, Roanoke has not had passenger rail service since 1979.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.roanoke.com/news/wb/170238 |title=Can passenger rail return to Roanoke? |publisher=Roanoke.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-27[/tpl] Amtrak stops in Lynchburg and Clifton Forge, Virginia. Roanoke would be a stop in the proposed Transdominion Express passenger rail system currently under study by the Commonwealth of Virginia.  In the meantime, a bus service, the Smart Way Connector, aligns with the Amtrak schedule to connect riders to the Kemper Street Station in Lynchburg.
Roanoke remains a major hub in Norfolk Southern's freight rail system. In 2006, the railroad announced plans to construct an intermodal rail yard in the community of Lafayette, Virginia of neighboring Montgomery County; however, opposition by local residents prompted Norfolk Southern to consider other potential sites. In 2007, former Roanoke mayor David A. Bowers urged Roanoke to offer a site for the yard. Shortly thereafter, neighboring Salem proposed a site in an industrial area of the city. In 2008, Norfolk Southern determined that the Lafayette location was the only practical site.  The Commonwealth of Virginia may also upgrade Norfolk Southern's rail line parallel to Interstate 81 from Roanoke through the Shenandoah Valley to encourage more freight to be shipped by rail.

===Buses===

The Valley Metro bus system serves the city of Roanoke and surrounding areas.  Nearly all routes originate or terminate at the Campbell Court bus station in downtown Roanoke, which is also served by Greyhound.  Valley Metro also offers bus service to Blacksburg, Christiansburg, Lynchburg, and Virginia Tech via the Smart Way and Smart Way Connector services.  In addition, several free shuttles connect local colleges to Downtown Roanoke.  The Ferrum Express runs between Ferrum College in nearby Rocky Mount and downtown Roanoke, while the Hollins Express connects to Hollins University in Roanoke County.

===Transportation Demand Management===

Roanoke City is served by RIDE Solutions, a regional transportation demand management agency that provides carpool matching, bicycle advocacy, transit assistance, and telework assistance to businesses and citizens in the region.

==Demographics==

As of the census[tpl]GR|8[/tpl] of 2000, there were 94,911 people, 42,003 households, and 24,235 families residing in the city.  The population density in 2000 was 2,213.2 people per square mile (854.6/km²). There were 45,257 housing units at an average density of 1,055.3 per square mile (407.5/km²).

About 12.9% of families and 15.9% of the population were below the poverty line, including 24.4% of those under age 18 and 11.3% of those age 65 or over.

==Crime==

The studies of Dr. Isaac Van Patten, a criminologist from Radford University discovered that Roanoke’s rates of rape and aggravated assault were the highest in the state of Virginia in 2004. Roanoke had seen a total increase in violent crimes from 1985 until 2003, surpassing every Virginia city, only Portsmouth had seen a larger increase in crime. Van Patten is not suggesting that Roanoke's overall violent crime rate was the highest in the state over the 18-year period, just that it saw the largest total increase.[tpl]cite news|author=Reed Williams |url=http://www.roanoke.com/news/roanoke/wb/50916 |title=Why is Roanoke so dangerous? |publisher=Roanoke.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-27[/tpl]  According to the FBI data, the crime rates in Roanoke for murder, rape, aggravated assault and motor vehicle theft all decreased from 2006 to 2007, while the rates of robberies and burglaries increased. In 2007, Roanoke was ranked as Virginia’s second most dangerous city; in 2008 the city was ranked as the fifth worst city in Virginia.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.roanoke.com/news/roanoke/wb/185782 |title=Local police question FBI's "dangerous cities" crime data |publisher=Roanoke.com |date=2008-11-28 |accessdate=2009-08-27[/tpl]

===Gangs===

The presence of genuine gang activity in Roanoke is a strongly debated subject.  While some neighborhoods have gang-like organizations, many of which are engaged in drug distribution, like the Lincoln Terrace Posse and Villa Heights 1,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/ndic/pubs07/797/cocaine.htm |title=Cocaine – Virginia Drug Threat Assessment |publisher=Usdoj.gov |date=2001-11-20 |accessdate=2009-08-27[/tpl] some law enforcement officers say that they are "mostly for show" as compared to the more militant and dangerous gangs that have a presence in multiple cities.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.wsls.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=WSLS%2FMGArticle%2FSLS_BasicArticle&c=MGArticle&cid=1149189134218&path=!news!localnews |title=Roanoke’s Special Street Crimes Unit | WSLS 10 |publisher=Wsls.com |date=2006-07-13 |accessdate=2009-08-27[/tpl]
Part of the argument in favor of acknowledging Roanoke's neighborhood groups as gangs comes from state politicians, like former attorney general Jerry Kilgore, part of it comes from the groups themselves who actively proclaim their legitimate existence as criminal and violent gangs in a DVD released for sale in the local area. In 2007, a DVD titled "Real Talk" appeared in Roanoke convenience stores depicting gang life in Roanoke. The 95-minute video includes references to the "Lincoln Terrace Posse" ("LTP"), "Villa Heights", and "Southwest" ("SW"). The local NAACP president, while outraged by the content of the DVD, disagreed that there were "full-fledged" gangs in Roanoke and felt that the presence of a camera played a big part in encouraging the behavior displayed.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.roanoke.com/news/roanoke/wb/xp-30694 |title=DVD purports to show gang life in Roanoke |publisher=Roanoke.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-27[/tpl]

==Education==

The local public school division is Roanoke City Public Schools.
The two general enrollment public high schools in Roanoke City are Patrick Henry High School, located in the Raleigh Court area, and William Fleming High School, located in Northwest Roanoke.  The six public middle schools in Roanoke City are Woodrow Wilson, James Madison Middle School, and Stonewall Jackson, that feed into Patrick Henry High School; and Lucy Addison, William Ruffner, and James Breckinridge, that feed into William Fleming High School.[tpl]Dead link|date=August 2009[/tpl] The Noel C.

Two four-year private institutions are situated in neighboring localities – Roanoke College in the city of Salem, and Hollins University in Roanoke County. Virginia Tech is located in neighboring Montgomery County.  It has opened a higher education center in downtown Roanoke in cooperation with other colleges and universities, and the Virginia Tech Foundation owns the Hotel Roanoke. Virginia Tech is also opening a new medical school in South Roanoke in cooperation with Carilion Clinic, the regional non-profit health care organization based in Roanoke.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.vtnews.vt.edu/story.php?relyear=2007&itemno=5 |title=Virginia Tech, Carilion will create joint medical school in Roanoke |publisher=Vtnews.vt.edu |date=2007-01-03 |accessdate=2009-08-27[/tpl]  Virginia Western Community College is located in the city of Roanoke, as is the Jefferson College of Health Sciences.

==Economy==

Roanoke's economy developed around the Norfolk and Western Railroad, with a strong emphasis on manufacturing. Roanoke's economic history also includes Sun Belt characteristics as it was once a center for the garment industry.  Surrounding areas have traditionally relied on traditional industries of the rural South such as textiles and furniture manufacturing, which have lost jobs to offshore outsourcing. Despite Virginia's being a right to work state, unions have traditionally represented workers at many large employers in the Roanoke area and southwest Virginia.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2009[/tpl]
Roanoke was formerly the headquarters of Norfolk and Western Railway until its merger with the Southern Railway created the Norfolk Southern Railway in 1982.  Norfolk Southern continues to operate its marketing headquarters and some maintenance facilities in Roanoke. Wachovia Bank, then known as First Union, acquired Roanoke based Dominion Bank in 1993 and maintains an operations and customer service center in Roanoke.  Other firms have been acquired by companies headquartered elsewhere, including such as Roanoke Electric Steel and architectural and engineering firm Hayes, Seay, Mattern and Mattern, (HSMM) which has been acquired by the multi-national conglomerate AECOM.  Roanoke's rates of economic and population growth have been less than the state and national averages since the 1960s.  The immediate Roanoke area has a low unemployment rate, but a brain drain of workers unable to find satisfactory employment and underemployment are sometimes cited as  explanations.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gatewayva.com/biz/virginiabusiness/magazine/yr2002/sept02/roanoke.shtml |title=Virginia Business Online: No mountain retreat |publisher=Gatewayva.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-27 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071016160916/http://gatewayva.com/biz/virginiabusiness/magazine/yr2002/sept02/roanoke.shtml |archivedate = October 16, 2007[/tpl]
The City of Roanoke has created initiatives to address the brain drain of the region such as a database to match job seekers who wish to reside in the Roanoke area with employers looking for candidates.  Additionally, a career and lifestyle fair has been held shortly after Christmas in recent years to show the professional and social opportunities in the area to those visiting family for the holidays.
Also, organizations of young professionals such as Valley Forward and Newva Connects have emerged.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2009[/tpl]
However, Roanoke's economy has areas of strength. The city is the health care and retail hub of a large area, driving the expansion of Carilion Health System and Valley View Mall.  Advance Auto Parts is headquartered in Roanoke and has expanded through the acquisition of other chains to become one of the largest auto parts retailers in the country.  Norfolk Southern remains a major employer. FreightCar America hired several hundred persons to assemble rail cars in shops leased from Norfolk Southern and has closed a plant in Johnstown, Pennsylvania in part because of the lower costs for the Roanoke facility.

Center in the Square was opened in downtown Roanoke on December 9, 1983 near the city market as part of the city's downtown revitalization effort.  The Center, a converted warehouse, houses the History Museum of Western Virginia, which contains exhibits and artifacts related to the area's history and has a library of materials available to scholars and the public.  The Center also houses the Science Museum of Western Virginia and the Hopkins Planetarium.  The Science Museum maintains a permanent installation of neon sign art featuring the work of local Mark Jamison, the subject of Slash Coleman's PBS special "The Neon Man and Me."[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2009[/tpl]
Formerly housed in Center in the Square, the Taubman Museum of Art has now vacated the Center and opened a new facility at 110 Salem Avenue SE.  The art museum features nineteenth and twentieth century American art, contemporary and modern art, decorative arts, and works on paper, and presents exhibitions of both regional and national significance.  The new  [tpl]convert|75000|sqft|m2|sing=on[/tpl] facility was designed by Los Angeles based architect Randall Stout, who earlier in his career worked under Frank Gehry.  The new space opened on November 8, 2008.  The facility's design sparked debate in the community between those who feel it is a bold, refreshing addition to Roanoke and those who feel its unusual, irregular design featuring sharp angles contrasts too strongly with the existing buildings.  Some are also concerned about the facility's cost at a time when many Roanoke area artistic organizations face financial challenges. The Taubman Family, which established Advance Auto Parts contributed $15.2 million to the project. As a result, the museum was renamed The Taubman Museum of Art.

==Sports==

===Professional===

The 1971–1972 Virginia Squires of the ABA were the only major league sports team to regularly play home games in Roanoke.  During the 1971–1972 season, the Squires split home games between Richmond, Norfolk, Hampton Roads, and Roanoke.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.remembertheaba.com/Virginia-Squires.html |title=Virginia Squires |publisher=Remember the ABA |date= |accessdate=2009-08-27[/tpl]  Julius Erving played his professional rookie season with the Squires in 1971–1972.
Minor league baseball has been more successful in building and maintaining a fan base than have the Roanoke Valley's other minor league sports teams.  In the 1940s and early 1950s, Roanoke was home to a class B farm team of the Boston Red Sox.  Since 1955, neighboring Salem has hosted the local minor league baseball team, currently the Salem Red Sox of the high Class A Carolina League.  The team had previously been affiliated with the Houston Astros and Colorado Rockies and known as the Avalanche until becoming an affiliate of the Boston Red Sox, whose ownership group purchased the Avalanche in 2007, for the 2009 season.
Minor league hockey has a history in the Roanoke Valley dating to the 1960s.  It reached a zenith of popularity in the mid- to late-1990s with the Roanoke Express of the ECHL.  The team's attendance declined due to a lack of post-season success and management turmoil.  The Express folded  after the 2003–2004 season.
The 2005–2006 revival by the UHL's Roanoke Valley Vipers failed after one season.  The team had a losing record and the midwestern-based league was unable to rekindle the interest of the local fanbase.  The team was formed to provide a travel partner for a UHL franchise in Richmond which also folded after the 2005–2006 season.
The Roanoke Dazzle of the NBDL and the Roanoke Steam of the af2 (Arena Football) folded after never developing consistent followings.  The Dazzle's attendance was similar to other inaugural franchises in the league.  It was one of the last two teams to remain in its original city.  Over the years, Roanoke has also had teams in soccer and men's and women's semi-professional football.

===Amateur===

====College====

For a number of years, Roanoke, with Richmond and Norfolk, was one of the nominally neutral sites for the annual basketball game between the Virginia Cavaliers and Virginia Tech Hokies.  During most of the 1970s through 1990s, the University of Virginia dominated the rivalry and as such tended to have significantly greater fan representation, despite Roanoke's closer proximity to Virginia Tech's home in Blacksburg.  In the late 1990s, the schools started holding these games in their own campus facilities.
The Virginia Tech Hokies ice hockey team has used the Roanoke Civic Center as its regular season home venue, from 2006 to the present season.http://www.icehockey.org.vt.edu/directions.htm  In 2010, the Roanoke College ice hockey team began using the Roanoke Civic Center as its home venue as well.[tpl]dead link|date=June 2013[/tpl]
From the 1940s through the late 1960s, Roanoke's Victory Stadium hosted an annual Thanksgiving Day game between Virginia Tech and the Virginia Military Institute and other high profile college football games.
