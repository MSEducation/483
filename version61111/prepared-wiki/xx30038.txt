Lake Constance (German: Bodensee) is a lake on the Rhine at the northern foot of the Alps, and consists of three bodies of water: the Obersee ("upper lake"), the Untersee ("lower lake"), and a connecting stretch of the Rhine, called the Seerhein.
The lake is situated in Germany, Switzerland and Austria near the Alps. Specifically, its shorelines lie in the German federal states of Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg, the Austrian federal state of Vorarlberg, and the Swiss cantons of Thurgau and St. Gallen. The Rhine flows into it from the south following the Austro-Swiss frontier.
Lake Constance was first mentioned by the Roman geographer Pomponius Mela about 43 AD. He noted that the Rhine flows through two lakes, and gave them the Latin names Lacus Venetus (Obersee) and Lacus Acronius (Untersee). Pliny the Elder used the name Lacus Brigantinus, after the Roman city of Brigantium (today Bregenz). The lake is also colloquially known as the Swabian SeaGordon McLachlan.

The freshwater lake sits at [tpl]convert|395|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] above sea level and is Central Europe's third largest, after Lake Balaton and Lake Geneva. It is [tpl]convert|63|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] long, and at its widest point, nearly [tpl]convert|14|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl]. It covers approximately [tpl]convert|571|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl] of total area.Image #432, Flying Camera Satellite Images 1999, Lloyd Reeds Map Collection, McMaster University Library. The greatest depth is [tpl]convert|252|m|ft[/tpl] in the middle of the eastern part (Obersee). Its volume is approximately [tpl]convert|1e10|m3|cuyd|abbr=on[/tpl]. The lake has four parts: the main section, called Obersee, [tpl]convert|476|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl]; the north section, Überlinger See, [tpl]convert|61|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl]; the west section, Untersee, [tpl]convert|63|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl]; and the northwest section, the Zeller See and Gnadensee. The regulated Rhine flows into the lake in the southeast, through the Obersee, the city of Konstanz and the Untersee and flows out near Stein am Rhein. Lake Constance provides fresh water to many cities in south Germany.
Lake Constance was formed by the Rhine Glacier during the ice age and is a zungenbecken lake. The Rhine, the Bregenzer Ache, and the Dornbirner Ache carry sediments from the Alps to the lake, thus gradually decreasing the depth and coast line extension of the lake in the southeast.
The lake was frozen in the years 1077 (?), 1326 (partial), 1378 (partial), 1435, 1465 (partial), 1477 (partial), 1491 (partial?), 1517 (partial), 1571 (partial), 1573, 1600 (partial), 1684, 1695, 1709 (partial), 1795, 1830, 1880 (partial), and 1963.
Approximately [tpl]convert|1000|t|ST|lk=on[/tpl] of fish were caught by 150 professional fishermen in 2001 which was below the previous ten year average of [tpl]convert|1200|t|ST[/tpl] per year. The Lake Constance trout (Salmo trutta) was almost extinct in the 1980s due to pollution, but thanks to protective measures has made a significant return. Lake Constance was the home of the now extinct species of trout Salvelinus profundus.IUCN Red list as well as of the Lake Constance whitefish (Coregonus gutturosus).Red List - Volume 1: Vertebrates (2009) - General assessment for the vertebrate groups
The lake itself is an important drinking water source for southwestern Germany, called Bodensee-Wasserversorgung ("Lake Constance Water Supply")."Bodensee-Wasserversorgung", German language Wikipedia.

==Name==

After the Council of Constance, the latin speaking Catholic world gave the lake its current international name. It was derived from the city name Constantia (latin name of Konstanz), that, in turn, was named after a Roman emperor (either Constantius Chlorus or his grandson Constantius II). The German name, Bodensee, derives on the other hand from the town name Bodman (today's Bodman-Ludwigshafen) that is situated at a nearby branch of the lake just some 8 km north-west of Konstanz.

==International borders==

Lake Constance is the only area in Europe where no borders exist, because there is no legally binding agreement as to where the borders lie between Switzerland, Germany and Austria. Therefore the lake has to be considered not as common area, but as area which does not belong to any country.[tpl]cite book| url= http://books.google.de/books?id=V01T5VI4nZ4C&pg=PA233&lpg=PA233&dq=kahn+deutsche+staatsgrenzen&source=bl&ots=PdxTeHxs0c&sig=ose9KRF2RrQlBB2ave0RTFp6lok&hl=de&ei=3XJGSty4JtKPsAb37Zwm&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1 | title = Die deutschen Staatsgrenzen: rechtshistorische Grundlagen und offene Rechtsfragen ("The German national borders: legal-historical foundations and open legal questions") | author = Daniel-Erasmus Kahn | publisher= Oxford University Press | year= 2004 | isbn=9783161484032 [/tpl]  This area does not include the shore, but the lake outside the 25-meter isobath. However, Switzerland holds the view that the border runs through the middle of the lake, Austria is of the opinion that the lake stands in law all the states on its banks, and Germany holds an ambiguous opinion. Legal questions pertaining to ship transport and fishing are regulated in separate treaties.
Naturally, disputes arise. One concerns a houseboat which was moored in two states (ECJ c. 224/97 Erich Ciola); another concerns the rights to fish in the Bay of Bregenz. In relation to the latter, an Austrian family was of the opinion that it alone had the right to fish in broad portions of the bay. However, this was accepted neither by the Austrian courts nor by the organs and courts of the other states.David Mark and Barry Smith, et al., Bizarre Shapes: 100 Geographic Monsters.
