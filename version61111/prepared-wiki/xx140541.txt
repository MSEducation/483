===With The Hold Steady===

He moved to New York City in the fall of 2001, after Lifter Puller broke up, for a change and because he and his wife knew people there.http://www.pulsetc.com/article.php?sid=963 Kate Siver, 'The Hold Steady: Ex-Lifter Puller Members Return from NYC Exile as the Hold Steady', The Pulse of the Twin Cities, Wednesday 10 March @ 15:12:06 He has said that lyrically, with The Hold Steady, he's been trying to produce a more positive, coherent, story-based message, in a natural way that he could imagine someone saying.

===Work with other artists===

Craig Finn provided his voice to Titus Andronicus's second album, The Monitor.  He is the voice of Walt Whitman at the very end of their song "A Pot in Which to Piss"

He worked with Minneapolis rapper P.O.S on the song "Safety In Speed (Heavy Metal)" which was released on the 2006 album Audition. Always close to the Twin Cities music scene, he also contributed to Minnesota musician Mark Mallman's song "You're Never Alone in New York" on the 2009 album Invincible Criminal.
In between Lifter Puller and The Hold Steady, he did a project with Mr. Projectile known as The Brokerdealer, a techno styled group. They released two unnamed EPs on http://www.thebrokerdealer.net/. This website has shut down, but the songs are still floating around the Internet.
In 2010 he co-wrote, with Chris Cheney, the title track from The Living End's 2011 album, The Ending Is Just The Beginning Repeating, while Cheney was in New York. After working together, Cheney called Finn "a hell of a lyricist".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gibson.com/en-us/Lifestyle/News/living-end-0606-2011/ |title=The Living End Sets New CD Release Date |publisher=Gibson.com |date=2008-06-24 |accessdate=2012-01-05[/tpl]

==Lyrical style==

Finn is most notable for his third-person narrative lyrical style, wherein he frequently makes reference to literature, pop culture, adolescence, partying, religion and drugs. Both with Lifter Puller and The Hold Steady, Finn's songs often follow a storytelling format that features recurring characters and locations, with Ybor City, Fla., and the Twin Cities having special prominence.
Particularly in later Hold Steady albums, Finn's songs have explored the darker aspects of his characters' party-centric lifestyles. Finn told an interviewer in 2012: "Artistically, I have always been really interested in the hangover; not just the celebration and the confetti but also the puke in the gutter." http://pitchfork.com/news/45124-craig-finn-talks-new-solo-album-new-hold-steady-material/ Finn has said that "irony is certainly not something I want to be accused of," instead hoping to bring "honesty and sincerity" through his songwriting.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.reax3.dreamhosters.com/articles/view/the_hold_steady_interview_with_craig_finn-447 |title=reax magazine :: music + culture Â» Articles |publisher=Reax3.dreamhosters.com |date=2008-01-19 |accessdate=2012-01-05[/tpl] Although his stories involve violence and heavy drug use, Finn states his songwriting is not very personal or "confessional".[tpl]dead link|date=January 2012[/tpl]
Finn's lyrics have been a frequent point of praise for The Hold Steady[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/holdsteady/staypositive |title=Stay Positive Reviews, Ratings, Credits, and More at Metacritic |publisher=Metacritic.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-05[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/holdsteady/boysandgirlsinamerica |title=Boys And Girls In America Reviews, Ratings, Credits, and More at Metacritic |publisher=Metacritic.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-05[/tpl] with Uncut Magazine describing his style as "narratives driven less by the wordy exposition of yore than acute observation, devastating detail, by turns exclamatory, epigrammatic and grainily authentic."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/music/the_hold_steady/reviews/9194 |title=The Hold Steady - Boys And Girls In America - Review |publisher=Uncut.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-01-05[/tpl]

==Influences==

Finn has indicated that some of his greatest lyrical influences include Blake Schwarzenbach from Jets to Brazil and Jawbreaker as well as Bruce Springsteen.By Jason, 'Keep it Steady', BigYawn.net In a Guardian article, he described The Replacements' Let It Be as his "favorite ever record."[tpl]cite news| url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/filmandmusic/story/0,,2076446,00.html | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Craig | last=Finn | title=I was no longer a loser | date=2007-05-10[/tpl]
He found The Doors' L.A. Woman to be influential in a different manner. As he told the same newspaper: "The music meanders, and Morrison was more like a drunk asshole than an intelligent poet. The worst of the worst is the last song, Riders on the Storm: 'There's a killer on the road/ His brain is squirming like a toad' - that's surely the worst line in rock'n'roll history. He gave the green light to generations of pseuds."[tpl]cite news| url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/filmandmusic/story/0,,2102907,00.html | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Paul | last=Lester | title=Sgt Pepper must die! | date=2007-06-14[/tpl] He is also a huge fan of Drive-By Truckers.
