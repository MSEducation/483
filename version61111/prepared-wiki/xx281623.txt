He resigned from UW to run for governor but returned in 1987 as vice president for development and alumni affairs. Thereafter, he was elevated to his terminal position of UW vice president for institutional advancement. After retirement in 1997, Simpson remained in Laramie and taught history on an adjunct basis at UW and was in 1999 and 2000 the Milward Simpson Distinguished Visiting Professor, named for his father.
The Simpson Fund has financed various speakers of different backgrounds and disciplines to UW, including former United States Secretary of State James A. Baker, III, former United States Secretary of the Interior James G. Watt, U.S. President Gerald R. Ford, Jr., and ABC journalist Sam Donaldson.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uwyo.edu/pols/simpson-fund/|title=Milward L.

In 2009, he was inducted for "Special Achievement" into the UW Athletics Hall of Fame.

==Short political career==

During his four-year stint in the legislature, Simpson was a member of the House Appropriations Committee. Two years after leaving the state House, he waged a hard-fought race for governor but fell short. UW history professor Phil Roberts suggested that the principal reason that Pete Simpson may have lost that race to Mike Sullivan was that Alan Simpson was already serving in his secont term in the U.S. Senate: "There are a number of people that speculate because there already was a Simpson in the Senate, they probably wanted just one Simpson at a time."[tpl]cite web|url=http://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/wyoming-s-simpson-family-out-of-public-office-but-probably/article_20cb1170-cac9-52e2-9f69-3087d5cfbb87.html| title=Jeremy Pelzer, Wyoming's Simpson family out of public office, but probably not for long : There's no Simpson in public office now, but don't expect that to last long, January 1, 2011|publisher=Casper Star-Tribune|accessdate=August 9, 2013[/tpl] Roberts said that family names have been less important in Wyoming politics than in other states with prominent political families. That view will be tested in 2014, when Liz Cheney, daughter of former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney, challenges Alan Simpson's Senate successor, Mike Enzi in the Republican primary.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wyomingnews.com/articles/2013/07/16/breaking_news/01break_07-16-13.txt|title=Cheney, Enzi announce Senate runs|publisher=Wyoming Tribune-Eagle|accessdate=July 17, 2013[/tpl]

==Retirement==

Simpson and his wife, the former Lynne Alice Livingston (born c. 1940), left Laramie c. 2011 to return to their native Cody. The couple married c. 1960. Their younger son, Peter K.  Simpson, Jr., is an actor in New York City for Blue Man Group.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uwyo.edu/profiles/notable-alumni/simpson-peter-jr.html|title=Pete Simpson, Jr.: Cast member, New York City production of the Blue Man Group|publisher=uwyo.edu|accessdate=November 1, 2012[/tpl] In 2010, he appeared at UW as Prince Hamlet in a theatre production of the Shakespearean play, with Pete Simpson cast as the Ghost of Hamlet's father. The junior Simpson recalls, with "the ghost and son scene, ... I could feel an energy shift in the room. It was hard not to get misty eyed."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wyomingnews.com/articles/2010/04/07/entertainment/01ent_04-05-10.txt|title=Karen Cotton, Hamlet at the University of Wyoming: Father and son share the stage in UW production, April 25, 2010|publisher=Wyoming Tribune-Eagle|accessdate=August 9, 2013[/tpl]
The older son, Milward Allen Simpson (born 1962), is the director of the Wyoming Department of State Parks and Cultural Resources, first under Democratic Governor Dave Freudenthal and under current Republican Governor Matt Mead. This Milward Simpson had been mentioned as a potential Democratic candidate for governor at the same time that his cousin, Colin Simpson, sought the Republican nomination against Matt Mead for the office that the Simpsons' paternal grandfather held from 1955 to 1959, before both had been born.[tpl]cite web|url=http://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/article_e021b7c0-15da-11df-bd36-001cc4c03286.html|title=Milward Simpson says he won't run for governor, February 9, 2010|publisher=trib.com|accessdate=November 1, 2012[/tpl]Milward Allen Simpson said that his political values as a Democrat are identical to those that his grandfather "instilled in us -– is that it's important to be who you are and stand up for what you believe in, and be honest and truthful. ... It doesn't really matter what your party stripe is, if you love the state and you want to serve it, that's what you've got to do. ... Blood's much thicker than partisan politics."
