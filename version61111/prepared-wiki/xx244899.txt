In 1972, he graduated as a fighter pilot in the 4th Air Brigade ( [tpl]lang-es|IV Brigada Aérea[/tpl] ) at El Plumerillo, Mendoza flying Morane-Saulnier MS-760 Paris and North American F-86 Sabres.

====Aircraft====

The A-4P Skyhawk (called A-4B by the Argentines) were bought from the US Navy inventory in 1966 and at the time of the war were painted  green/brown topsides with light blue undersides heavily faded colours. Yellows identity markings were also added during the conflict.
These aircraft provided outstanding performance and availability even in the harsh operating conditions of the South Atlantic with most of them returning from missions with some form of battle damage and were patched up and pressed back into service within matter of hours. Because of this, pilots used to change airframes between sorties.
In spite of using two 295-gallon drop tanks they needed aerial refueling twice during missions. The ordnance used during the conflict were one British-made 1000 lb Mk 17 bomb or four Spanish-made 500 lb retarding tail Expal-Explosivos Alaveses (named BRP). American  500 lb retarding tail Mark 82 bombs ("Snake Eye") were also available but used infrequently. The aircraft were also armed with two 20 mm cannons but without any air-to-air missile, Radar warning receiver or chaff for self-defence.

===Later career===

He later became Chief of the Weapons Test Center ( [tpl]lang-es| Centro de Ensayos de Armamentos y Sistemas Operativos[/tpl] ) at Cordoba and passed a Master on Strategy at the USAF Air War College, before becoming Director of INAC ([tpl]lang-es|Instituto Nacional de Aviación Civil[/tpl]), the Argentine civil aviation school
He retired from the Air Force on April 2, 2001 as a Comodoro (USAF equivalent: Colonel and RAF equivalent: Group Captain )
