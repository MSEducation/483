CATEGORIES: Neighborhoods of Belgrade

Istočne Kapije ([tpl]lang-sr|Источне Капије[/tpl], Eastern City Gates) are three large residential buildings situated near the E-75 motorway which runs through Belgrade. These buildings "guard" the eastern gates of the city while Genex Tower guards its western side; both of these were built in 1980 in brutalist style. The eastern Portal complex contains three buildings each being 99 meters tall, making them among the most prominent structures along the Belgrade skyline.
