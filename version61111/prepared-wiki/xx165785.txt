===Notes===

The song "Indigo Children" appears to refer to the New Age concept of indigo children. This song also serves as the background for Maynard's Caduceus website.
The title "REV 22:20" is a direct reference to the epilogue of The Book of Revelation, chapter 22, verse 20: "He who testifieth these things saith, Yea: I come quickly. Amen: come, Lord Jesus."[tpl]cite web|title=The Revelation to Saint John|url= http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2022:20&version=ASV[/tpl] most likely making a sexual innuendo about the evolution of the language used in scripture.
