[[LRG1]]

Leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein 1 is a protein which in humans is encoded by the  gene LRG1.[tpl]cite web | title = Entrez Gene: LRG1 leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein 1| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=116844| accessdate = [/tpl]

==Function==

The leucine-rich repeat (LRR) family of proteins, including LRG1, have been shown to be involved in protein-protein interaction, signal transduction, and cell adhesion and development. LRG1 is expressed during granulocyte differentiation.[tpl]cite journal | author = O'Donnell LC, Druhan LJ, Avalos BR | title = Molecular characterization and expression analysis of leucine-rich alpha2-glycoprotein, a novel marker of granulocytic differentiation | journal = J.

LRG1 has been shown to be involved in promoting neovascularization (new blood vessel growth) through causing a switch in transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) signaling in endothelial cells. LRG1 binds to the accessory receptor endoglin and promotes signaling via the ALK1-Smad1/5/8 pathway.[tpl]cite journal | author = Wang X, Abraham S, McKenzie JA, Jeffs N, Swire M, Tripathi VB, Luhmann UF, Lange CA, Zhai Z, Arthur HM, Bainbridge JW, Moss SE, Greenwood J | title = LRG1 promotes angiogenesis by modulating endothelial TGF-β signalling | journal = Nature | volume = 499 | issue = 7458 | pages = 306–11 |date=July 2013 | pmid = 23868260 | doi = 10.1038/nature12345 [/tpl]

==Application==

Levels of the LRG protein are markedly elevated in acute appendicitis and therefore could be used as a diagnostic aid.[tpl]cite web | url = http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2009/06/a-urine-test-for-appendicitis/ | title = A urine test for appendicitis? | author = Vargas IM | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = 2009-06-23 | format = | work = HarvardScience Press Release | publisher = Harvard College | pages = | language = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | quote = | accessdate = 2009-06-25[/tpl]
LRG1 may be a potential therapeutifc target for the treatment of diseases where there is aberrant neovascularization.
