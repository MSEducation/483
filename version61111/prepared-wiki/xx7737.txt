CATEGORIES: Metabolism, Underwater diving physiology

Metabolism (from [tpl]lang-el|μεταβολή[/tpl] metabolē, "change") is the set of life-sustaining chemical transformations within the cells of living organisms. These enzyme-catalyzed reactions allow organisms to grow and reproduce, maintain their structures, and respond to their environments. The word metabolism can also refer to all chemical reactions that occur in living organisms, including digestion and the transport of substances into and between different cells, in which case the set of reactions within the cells is called intermediary metabolism or intermediate metabolism.
Metabolism is usually divided into two categories. Catabolism, that breaks down organic matter and harvests energy by way of cellular respiration, and anabolism that uses energy to construct components of cells such as proteins and nucleic acids.
The chemical reactions of metabolism are organized into metabolic pathways, in which one chemical is transformed through a series of steps into another chemical, by a sequence of enzymes. Enzymes are crucial to metabolism because they allow organisms to drive desirable reactions that require energy that will not occur by themselves, by coupling them to spontaneous reactions that release energy. Enzymes act as catalysts that allow the reactions to proceed more rapidly. Enzymes also allow the regulation of metabolic pathways in response to changes in the cell's environment or to signals from other cells.
The metabolic system of a particular organism determines which substances it will find nutritious and which poisonous. For example, some prokaryotes use hydrogen sulfide as a nutrient, yet this gas is poisonous to animals.[tpl]cite journal |author=Friedrich C |title=Physiology and genetics of sulfur-oxidizing bacteria |journal=Adv Microb Physiol |volume=39 |issue= |pages=235–89 |year=1998 |pmid=9328649 |doi=10.1016/S0065-2911(08)60018-1 |series=Advances in Microbial Physiology |isbn=9780120277391[/tpl] The speed of metabolism, the metabolic rate, influences how much food an organism will require, and also affects how it is able to obtain that food.
A striking feature of metabolism is the similarity of the basic metabolic pathways and components between even vastly different species.[tpl]cite journal |author=Pace NR |title=The universal nature of biochemistry |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=98 |issue=3 |pages=805–8 |date=January 2001 |pmid=11158550 |pmc=33372 |doi=10.1073/pnas.98.3.805 |bibcode=2001PNAS...98..805P[/tpl] For example, the set of carboxylic acids that are best known as the intermediates in the citric acid cycle are present in all known organisms, being found in species as diverse as the unicellular bacterium Escherichia coli and huge multicellular organisms like elephants.[tpl]cite journal |author=Smith E, Morowitz H |title=Universality in intermediary metabolism |pmc=516543 |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=101 |issue=36 |pages=13168–73 |year=2004 |pmid=15340153 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0404922101 |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15340153|bibcode = 2004PNAS..10113168S [/tpl] These striking similarities in metabolic pathways are likely due to their early appearance in evolutionary history, and retained because of their efficacy.[tpl]cite journal |author=Ebenhöh O, Heinrich R |title=Evolutionary optimization of metabolic pathways.

==Key biochemicals==

Most of the structures that make up animals, plants and microbes are made from three basic classes of molecule: amino acids, carbohydrates and lipids (often called fats). As these molecules are vital for life, metabolic reactions either focus on making these molecules during the construction of cells and tissues, or by breaking them down and using them as a source of energy, by their digestion. These biochemicals can be joined together to make polymers such as DNA and proteins, essential macromolecules of life.

===Amino acids and proteins===

Proteins are made of amino acids arranged in a linear chain joined together by peptide bonds. Many proteins are enzymes that catalyze the chemical reactions in metabolism. Other proteins have structural or mechanical functions, such as those that form the cytoskeleton, a system of scaffolding that maintains the cell shape.[tpl]cite journal |author=Michie K, Löwe J |title=Dynamic filaments of the bacterial cytoskeleton |journal=Annu Rev Biochem |volume=75 |issue= |pages=467–92 |year=2006 |pmid=16756499 |doi=10.1146/annurev.biochem.75.103004.142452[/tpl] Proteins are also important in cell signaling, immune responses, cell adhesion, active transport across membranes, and the cell cycle.[tpl]cite book | last = Nelson | first = David L. | coauthors = Michael M. Cox | title = Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry | publisher = W. H. Freeman and company | year = 2005 | location = New York | pages = 841 | isbn = 0-7167-4339-6[/tpl] Amino acids also contribute to cellular energy metabolism by providing a carbon source for entry into the citric acid cycle (tricarboxylic acid cycle),[tpl]cite journal |author=Kelleher, J,Bryan 3rd, B, Mallet,R, Holleran, A, Murphy, A, and Fiskum, G |title=Analysis of tricarboxylic acid-cycle metabolism of hepatoma cells by comparison of 14CO2 ratios |journal=Biochem J |volume= 246 |issue=3 |pages=633–639 |year=1987  |pmid=6752947 |pmc=346906[/tpl] especially when a primary source of energy, such as glucose, is scarce, or when cells undergo metabolic stress.[tpl]cite journal |author=Hothersall, J and Ahmed, A |title= Metabolic fate of the increased yeast amino acid uptake subsequent to catabolite derepression |journal=J Amino Acids |volume= 2013 |pages=e461901 |year=2013 |pmid=23431419 |doi=10.1155/2013/461901 |pmc=3575661[/tpl]

===Lipids===

Lipids are the most diverse group of biochemicals. Their main structural uses are as part of biological membranes both internal and external, such as the cell membrane, or as a source of energy. Lipids are usually defined as hydrophobic or amphipathic biological molecules but will dissolve in organic solvents such as benzene or chloroform.[tpl]cite journal |author=Fahy E, Subramaniam S, Brown H, Glass C, Merrill A, Murphy R, Raetz C, Russell D, Seyama Y, Shaw W, Shimizu T, Spener F, van Meer G, VanNieuwenhze M, White S, Witztum J, Dennis E |title=A comprehensive classification system for lipids |url=http://www.jlr.org/cgi/content/full/46/5/839 |journal=J Lipid Res |volume=46 |issue=5 |pages=839–61 |year=2005 |pmid=15722563 |doi=10.1194/jlr.E400004-JLR200[/tpl] The fats are a large group of compounds that contain fatty acids and glycerol; a glycerol molecule attached to three fatty acid esters is called a triacylglyceride.[tpl]cite web | title=Nomenclature of Lipids |publisher=IUPAC-IUB Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature (CBN) | url=http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iupac/lipid/ |accessdate=2007-03-08[/tpl] Several variations on this basic structure exist, including alternate backbones such as sphingosine in the sphingolipids, and hydrophilic groups such as phosphate as in phospholipids. Steroids such as cholesterol are another major class of lipids.[tpl]cite journal |author=Hegardt F |title=Mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase: a control enzyme in ketogenesis |pmc=1220089 |journal=Biochem J |volume=338 |issue=Pt 3 |pages=569–82 |year=1999 |pmid=10051425 |doi=10.1042/0264-6021:3380569[/tpl]

===Carbohydrates===

Carbohydrates are aldehydes or ketones, with many hydroxyl groups attached, that can exist as straight chains or rings. Carbohydrates are the most abundant biological molecules, and fill numerous roles, such as the storage and transport of energy (starch, glycogen) and structural components (cellulose in plants, chitin in animals). The basic carbohydrate units are called monosaccharides and include galactose, fructose, and most importantly glucose. Monosaccharides can be linked together to form polysaccharides in almost limitless ways.[tpl]cite journal |author=Raman R, Raguram S, Venkataraman G, Paulson J, Sasisekharan R |title=Glycomics: an integrated systems approach to structure-function relationships of glycans |journal=Nat Methods |volume=2 |issue=11 |pages=817–24 |year=2005 |pmid=16278650 |doi=10.1038/nmeth807[/tpl]

===Nucleotides===

The two nucleic acids, DNA and RNA are polymers of nucleotides, each nucleotide composed of a phosphate group, a ribose sugar group, and a nitrogenous base.  Nucleic acids are critical for the storage and use of genetic information, and its interpretation through the processes of transcription and protein biosynthesis. This information is protected by DNA repair mechanisms and propagated through DNA replication. Many viruses have an RNA genome, for example HIV, which uses reverse transcription to create a DNA template from its viral RNA genome.[tpl]cite journal |author=Sierra S, Kupfer B, Kaiser R |title=Basics of the virology of HIV-1 and its replication |journal=J Clin Virol |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=233–44 |year=2005 |pmid=16198625 |doi=10.1016/j.jcv.2005.09.004[/tpl] RNA in ribozymes such as spliceosomes and ribosomes is similar to enzymes as it can catalyze chemical reactions. Individual nucleosides are made by attaching a nucleobase to a ribose sugar. These bases are heterocyclic rings containing nitrogen, classified as purines or pyrimidines. Nucleotides also act as coenzymes in metabolic group transfer reactions.[tpl]cite journal |author=Wimmer M, Rose I |title=Mechanisms of enzyme-catalyzed group transfer reactions |journal=Annu Rev Biochem |volume=47 |issue= |pages=1031–78 |year=1978 |pmid=354490 |doi=10.1146/annurev.bi.47.070178.005123[/tpl]

===Coenzymes===

Metabolism involves a vast array of chemical reactions, but most fall under a few basic types of reactions that involve the transfer of functional groups.[tpl]cite journal |author=Mitchell P |title=The Ninth Sir Hans Krebs Lecture. Compartmentation and communication in living systems. Ligand conduction: a general catalytic principle in chemical, osmotic and chemiosmotic reaction systems |journal=Eur J Biochem |volume=95 |issue=1 |pages=1–20 |year=1979 |pmid=378655 |doi=10.1111/j.1432-1033.1979.tb12934.x[/tpl] This common chemistry allows cells to use a small set of metabolic intermediates to carry chemical groups between different reactions. These group-transfer intermediates are called coenzymes. Each class of group-transfer reactions is carried out by a particular coenzyme, which is the substrate for a set of enzymes that produce it, and a set of enzymes that consume it. These coenzymes are therefore continuously made, consumed and then recycled.[tpl]cite journal |author=Dimroth P, von Ballmoos C, Meier T |title=Catalytic and mechanical cycles in F-ATP synthases: Fourth in the Cycles Review Series |pmc=1456893 |journal=EMBO Rep |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=276–82 |date=March 2006 |pmid=16607397 |doi=10.1038/sj.embor.7400646[/tpl]
One central coenzyme is adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the universal energy currency of cells. This nucleotide is used to transfer chemical energy between different chemical reactions. There is only a small amount of ATP in cells, but as it is continuously regenerated, the human body can use about its own weight in ATP per day. ATP acts as a bridge between catabolism and anabolism, with catabolic reactions generating ATP and anabolic reactions consuming it. It also serves as a carrier of phosphate groups in phosphorylation reactions.
A vitamin is an organic compound needed in small quantities that cannot be made in  cells. In human nutrition, most vitamins function as coenzymes after modification; for example, all water-soluble vitamins are phosphorylated or are coupled to nucleotides when they are used in cells.[tpl]Cite book | last1 = Coulston | first1 = Ann | last2 = Kerner | first2 = John | last3 = Hattner | first3 = JoAnn | last4 = Srivastava | first4 = Ashini | contribution = Nutrition Principles and Clinical Nutrition | title = Stanford School of Medicine Nutrition Courses | publisher = SUMMIT | year = 2006 [/tpl] Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a derivative of vitamin B3 (niacin), is an important coenzyme that acts as a hydrogen acceptor. Hundreds of separate types of dehydrogenases remove electrons from their substrates and reduce NAD+ into NADH. This reduced form of the coenzyme is then a substrate for any of the reductases in the cell that need to reduce their substrates.[tpl]cite journal |author=Pollak N, Dölle C, Ziegler M |title=The power to reduce: pyridine nucleotides – small molecules with a multitude of functions |journal=Biochem J |volume=402 |issue=2 |pages=205–18 |year=2007 |pmid=17295611 |doi=10.1042/BJ20061638 |pmc=1798440[/tpl] Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide exists in two related forms in the cell, NADH and NADPH. The NAD+/NADH form is more important in catabolic reactions, while NADP+/NADPH is used in anabolic reactions.

===Minerals and cofactors===

Inorganic elements play critical roles in metabolism; some are abundant (e.g. sodium and potassium) while others function at minute concentrations. About 99% of a mammal's mass is made up of the elements carbon, nitrogen, calcium, sodium, chlorine, potassium, hydrogen, phosphorus, oxygen and sulfur.[tpl]cite journal |author=Heymsfield S, Waki M, Kehayias J, Lichtman S, Dilmanian F, Kamen Y, Wang J, Pierson R |title=Chemical and elemental analysis of humans in vivo using improved body composition models |journal=Am J Physiol |volume=261 |issue=2 Pt 1 |pages=E190–8 |year=1991 |pmid=1872381[/tpl] Organic compounds (proteins, lipids and carbohydrates) contain the majority of the carbon and nitrogen; most of the oxygen and hydrogen is present as water.
The abundant inorganic elements act as ionic electrolytes. The most important ions are sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, chloride, phosphate and the organic ion bicarbonate. The maintenance of precise ion gradients across cell membranes maintains osmotic pressure and pH.[tpl]cite journal |author=Sychrová H |title=Yeast as a model organism to study transport and homeostasis of alkali metal cations |url=http://www.biomed.cas.cz/physiolres/pdf/53%20Suppl%201/53_S91.pdf |format=PDF|journal=Physiol Res |volume=53 Suppl 1 |issue= |pages=S91–8 |year=2004 |pmid=15119939[/tpl] Ions are also critical for nerve and muscle function, as action potentials in these tissues are produced by the exchange of electrolytes between the extracellular fluid and the cell's fluid, the cytosol.[tpl]cite journal |author=Levitan I |title=Modulation of ion channels in neurons and other cells |journal=Annu Rev Neurosci |volume=11 |issue= |pages=119–36 |year=1988 |pmid=2452594 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ne.11.030188.001003[/tpl] Electrolytes enter and leave cells through proteins in the cell membrane called ion channels. For example, muscle contraction depends upon the movement of calcium, sodium and potassium through ion channels in the cell membrane and T-tubules.[tpl]cite journal |author=Dulhunty A |title=Excitation-contraction coupling from the 1950s into the new millennium |journal=Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol |volume=33 |issue=9 |pages=763–72 |year=2006 |pmid=16922804 |doi=10.1111/j.1440-1681.2006.04441.x[/tpl]
Transition metals are usually present as trace elements in organisms, with zinc and iron being most abundant of those.[tpl]cite journal |author=Mahan D, Shields R |title=Macro- and micromineral composition of pigs from birth to 145 kilograms of body weight |url=http://jas.fass.org/cgi/reprint/76/2/506 |journal=J Anim Sci |volume=76 |issue=2 |pages=506–12 |year=1998 |pmid=9498359[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Husted S, Mikkelsen B, Jensen J, Nielsen N |title=Elemental fingerprint analysis of barley (Hordeum vulgare) using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, isotope-ratio mass spectrometry, and multivariate statistics |journal=Anal Bioanal Chem |volume=378 |issue=1 |pages=171–82 |year=2004 |pmid=14551660 |doi=10.1007/s00216-003-2219-0[/tpl] These metals are used in some proteins as cofactors and are essential for the activity of enzymes such as catalase and oxygen-carrier proteins such as hemoglobin.[tpl]cite journal |author=Finney L, O'Halloran T |title=Transition metal speciation in the cell: insights from the chemistry of metal ion receptors |journal=Science |volume=300 |issue=5621 |pages=931–6 |year=2003 |pmid=12738850 |doi=10.1126/science.1085049|bibcode = 2003Sci...300..931F [/tpl] Metal cofactors are bound tightly to specific sites in proteins; although enzyme cofactors can be modified during catalysis, they always return to their original state by the end of the reaction catalyzed. Metal micronutrients are taken up into organisms by specific transporters and bind to storage proteins such as ferritin or metallothionein when not in use.[tpl]cite journal |author=Cousins R, Liuzzi J, Lichten L |title=Mammalian zinc transport, trafficking, and signals |url=http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/281/34/24085 |journal=J Biol Chem |volume=281 |issue=34 |pages=24085–9 |year=2006 |pmid=16793761 |doi=10.1074/jbc.R600011200[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Dunn L, Rahmanto Y, Richardson D |title=Iron uptake and metabolism in the new millennium |journal=Trends Cell Biol |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=93–100 |year=2007 |pmid=17194590 |doi=10.1016/j.tcb.2006.12.003[/tpl]

==Catabolism==

Catabolism is the set of metabolic processes that break down large molecules. These include breaking down and oxidizing food molecules. The purpose of the catabolic reactions is to provide the energy and components needed by anabolic reactions. The exact nature of these catabolic reactions differ from organism to organism and organisms can be classified based on their sources of energy and carbon (their primary nutritional groups), as shown in the table below. Organic molecules are used as a source of energy by organotrophs, while lithotrophs use inorganic substrates and phototrophs capture sunlight as chemical energy. However, all these different forms of metabolism depend on redox reactions that involve the transfer of electrons from reduced donor molecules such as organic molecules, water, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide or ferrous ions to acceptor molecules such as oxygen, nitrate or sulfate.[tpl]cite journal |author=Nealson K, Conrad P |title=Life: past, present and future |journal=Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci |volume=354 |issue=1392 |pages=1923–39 |year=1999 |pmid=10670014 |pmc=1692713 |doi=10.1098/rstb.1999.0532 |url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10670014 [/tpl] In animals these reactions involve complex organic molecules that are broken down to simpler molecules, such as carbon dioxide and water. In photosynthetic organisms such as plants and cyanobacteria, these electron-transfer reactions do not release energy, but are used as a way of storing energy absorbed from sunlight.[tpl]cite journal |author=Nelson N, Ben-Shem A |title=The complex architecture of oxygenic photosynthesis |journal=Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol |volume=5 |issue=12 |pages=971–82 |year=2004 |pmid=15573135 |doi=10.1038/nrm1525[/tpl]
The most common set of catabolic reactions in animals can be separated into three main stages. In the first, large organic molecules such as proteins, polysaccharides or lipids are digested into their smaller components outside cells. Next, these smaller molecules are taken up by cells and converted to yet smaller molecules, usually acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), which releases some energy. Finally, the acetyl group on the CoA is oxidised to water and carbon dioxide in the citric acid cycle and electron transport chain, releasing the energy that is stored by reducing the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) into NADH.

===Digestion===

Macromolecules such as starch, cellulose or proteins cannot be rapidly taken up by cells and must be broken into their smaller units before they can be used in cell metabolism. Several common classes of enzymes digest these polymers. These digestive enzymes include proteases that digest proteins into amino acids, as well as glycoside hydrolases that digest polysaccharides into simple sugars known as monosaccharides.
Microbes simply secrete digestive enzymes into their surroundings,[tpl]cite journal |author=Häse C, Finkelstein R |title=Bacterial extracellular zinc-containing metalloproteases |journal=Microbiol Rev |volume=57 |issue=4 |pages=823–37 |date=December 1993 |pmid=8302217 |pmc=372940 |url=http://mmbr.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=8302217 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Gupta R, Gupta N, Rathi P |title=Bacterial lipases: an overview of production, purification and biochemical properties |journal=Appl Microbiol Biotechnol |volume=64 |issue=6 |pages=763–81 |year=2004 |pmid=14966663 |doi=10.1007/s00253-004-1568-8[/tpl] while animals only secrete these enzymes from specialized cells in their guts.[tpl]cite journal |author=Hoyle T |title=The digestive system: linking theory and practice |journal=Br J Nurs |volume=6 |issue=22 |pages=1285–91 |year=1997 |pmid=9470654[/tpl] The amino acids or sugars released by these extracellular enzymes are then pumped into cells by active transport proteins.[tpl]cite journal |author=Souba W, Pacitti A |title=How amino acids get into cells: mechanisms, models, menus, and mediators |journal=JPEN J Parenter Enteral Nutr |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=569–78 |year=1992 |pmid=1494216 |doi=10.1177/0148607192016006569[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Barrett M, Walmsley A, Gould G |title=Structure and function of facilitative sugar transporters |journal=Curr Opin Cell Biol |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=496–502 |year=1999 |pmid=10449337 |doi=10.1016/S0955-0674(99)80072-6[/tpl]

===Energy from organic compounds===

Carbohydrate catabolism is the breakdown of carbohydrates into smaller units. Carbohydrates are usually taken into cells once they have been digested into monosaccharides.[tpl]cite journal |author=Bell G, Burant C, Takeda J, Gould G |title=Structure and function of mammalian facilitative sugar transporters |journal=J Biol Chem |volume=268 |issue=26 |pages=19161–4 |year=1993 |pmid=8366068[/tpl] Once inside, the major route of breakdown is glycolysis, where sugars such as glucose and fructose are converted into pyruvate and some ATP is generated.[tpl]cite journal |author=Bouché C, Serdy S, Kahn C, Goldfine A |title=The cellular fate of glucose and its relevance in type 2 diabetes |url=http://edrv.endojournals.org/cgi/content/full/25/5/807 |journal=Endocr Rev |volume=25 |issue=5 |pages=807–30 |year=2004 |pmid=15466941 |doi=10.1210/er.2003-0026[/tpl] Pyruvate is an intermediate in several metabolic pathways, but the majority is converted to acetyl-CoA and fed into the citric acid cycle. Although some more ATP is generated in the citric acid cycle, the most important product is NADH, which is made from NAD+ as the acetyl-CoA is oxidized. This oxidation releases carbon dioxide as a waste product. In anaerobic conditions, glycolysis produces lactate, through the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase re-oxidizing NADH to NAD+ for re-use in glycolysis. An alternative route for glucose breakdown is the pentose phosphate pathway, which reduces the coenzyme NADPH and produces pentose sugars such as ribose, the sugar component of nucleic acids.
Fats are catabolised by hydrolysis to free fatty acids and glycerol. The glycerol enters glycolysis and the fatty acids are broken down by beta oxidation to release acetyl-CoA, which then is fed into the citric acid cycle. Fatty acids release more energy upon oxidation than carbohydrates because carbohydrates contain more oxygen in their structures.
Amino acids are either used to synthesize proteins and other biomolecules, or oxidized to urea and carbon dioxide as a source of energy.[tpl]cite journal |author=Sakami W, Harrington H |title=Amino acid metabolism |journal=Annu Rev Biochem |volume=32 |issue= |pages=355–98 |year=1963 |pmid=14144484 |doi=10.1146/annurev.bi.32.070163.002035[/tpl] The oxidation pathway starts with the removal of the amino group by a transaminase. The amino group is fed into the urea cycle, leaving a deaminated carbon skeleton in the form of a keto acid. Several of these keto acids are intermediates in the citric acid cycle, for example the deamination of glutamate forms α-ketoglutarate.[tpl]cite journal |author=Brosnan J |title=Glutamate, at the interface between amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism |url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/content/full/130/4/988S |journal=J Nutr |volume=130 |issue=4S Suppl |pages=988S–90S |year=2000 |pmid=10736367[/tpl] The glucogenic amino acids can also be converted into glucose, through gluconeogenesis (discussed below).[tpl]cite journal |author=Young V, Ajami A |title=Glutamine: the emperor or his clothes? |url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/content/full/131/9/2449S |journal=J Nutr |volume=131 |issue=9 Suppl |pages=2449S–59S; discussion 2486S–7S |year=2001 |pmid=11533293[/tpl]

==Energy transformations==

===Oxidative phosphorylation===

In oxidative phosphorylation, the electrons removed from organic molecules in areas such as the protagon acid cycle are transferred to oxygen and the energy released is used to make ATP. This is done in eukaryotes by a series of proteins in the membranes of mitochondria called the electron transport chain. In prokaryotes, these proteins are found in the cell's inner membrane.[tpl]cite journal |author=Hosler J, Ferguson-Miller S, Mills D |title=Energy Transduction: Proton Transfer Through the Respiratory Complexes |journal=Annu Rev Biochem |volume=75 |issue= |pages=165–87 |year=2006 |pmid=16756489 |doi=10.1146/annurev.biochem.75.062003.101730 |pmc=2659341[/tpl] These proteins use the energy released from passing electrons from reduced molecules like NADH onto oxygen to pump protons across a membrane.[tpl]cite journal |author=Schultz B, Chan S |title=Structures and proton-pumping strategies of mitochondrial respiratory enzymes |journal=Annu Rev Biophys Biomol Struct |volume=30 |issue= |pages=23–65 |year=2001 |pmid=11340051 |doi=10.1146/annurev.biophys.30.1.23[/tpl]
Pumping protons out of the mitochondria creates a proton concentration difference across the membrane and generates an electrochemical gradient.[tpl]cite journal |author=Capaldi R, Aggeler R |title=Mechanism of the F(1)F(0)-type ATP synthase, a biological rotary motor |journal=Trends Biochem Sci |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=154–60 |year=2002 |pmid=11893513 |doi=10.1016/S0968-0004(01)02051-5[/tpl] This force drives protons back into the mitochondrion through the base of an enzyme called ATP synthase. The flow of protons makes the stalk subunit rotate, causing the active site of the synthase domain to change shape and phosphorylate adenosine diphosphate – turning it into ATP.

===Energy from light===

The energy in sunlight is captured by plants, cyanobacteria, purple bacteria, green sulfur bacteria and some protists. This process is often coupled to the conversion of carbon dioxide into organic compounds, as part of photosynthesis, which is discussed below. The energy capture and carbon fixation systems can however operate separately in prokaryotes, as purple bacteria and green sulfur bacteria can use sunlight as a source of energy, while switching between carbon fixation and the fermentation of organic compounds.[tpl]cite journal |author=van der Meer M, Schouten S, Bateson M, Nübel U, Wieland A, Kühl M, de Leeuw J, Sinninghe Damsté J, Ward D |title=Diel Variations in Carbon Metabolism by Green Nonsulfur-Like Bacteria in Alkaline Siliceous Hot Spring Microbial Mats from Yellowstone National Park |journal=Appl Environ Microbiol |volume=71 |issue=7 |pages=3978–86 |date=July 2005 |pmid=16000812 |pmc=1168979 |doi=10.1128/AEM.71.7.3978-3986.2005 |url=http://aem.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16000812 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Tichi M, Tabita F |title=Interactive Control of Rhodobacter capsulatus Redox-Balancing Systems during Phototrophic Metabolism |journal=J Bacteriol |volume=183 |issue=21 |pages=6344–54 |year=2001 |pmid=11591679 |pmc=100130 |doi=10.1128/JB.183.21.6344-6354.2001 |url=http://jb.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11591679[/tpl]
In many organisms the capture of solar energy is similar in principle to oxidative phosphorylation, as it involves the storage of energy as a proton concentration gradient. This proton motive force then drives ATP synthesis. The electrons needed to drive this electron transport chain come from light-gathering proteins called photosynthetic reaction centres or rhodopsins. Reaction centers are classed into two types depending on the type of photosynthetic pigment present, with most photosynthetic bacteria only having one type, while plants and cyanobacteria have two.[tpl]cite journal |author=Allen J, Williams J |title=Photosynthetic reaction centers |journal=FEBS Lett |volume=438 |issue=1–2 |pages=5–9 |year=1998 |pmid=9821949 |doi=10.1016/S0014-5793(98)01245-9[/tpl]
In plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, photosystem II uses light energy to remove electrons from water, releasing oxygen as a waste product. The electrons then flow to the cytochrome b6f complex, which uses their energy to pump protons across the thylakoid membrane in the chloroplast. These protons move back through the membrane as they drive the ATP synthase, as before. The electrons then flow through photosystem I and can then either be used to reduce the coenzyme NADP+, for use in the Calvin cycle, which is discussed below, or recycled for further ATP generation.[tpl]cite journal |author=Munekage Y, Hashimoto M, Miyake C, Tomizawa K, Endo T, Tasaka M, Shikanai T |title=Cyclic electron flow around photosystem I is essential for photosynthesis |journal=Nature |volume=429 |issue=6991 |pages=579–82 |year=2004 |pmid=15175756 |doi=10.1038/nature02598|bibcode = 2004Natur.429..579M [/tpl]

==Anabolism==

Anabolism is the set of constructive metabolic processes where the energy released by catabolism is used to synthesize complex molecules. In general, the complex molecules that make up cellular structures are constructed step-by-step from small and simple precursors. Anabolism involves three basic stages. Firstly, the production of precursors such as amino acids, monosaccharides, isoprenoids and nucleotides, secondly, their activation into reactive forms using energy from ATP, and thirdly, the assembly of these precursors into complex molecules such as proteins, polysaccharides, lipids and nucleic acids.
Organisms differ in how many of the molecules in their cells they can construct for themselves. Autotrophs such as plants can construct the complex organic molecules in cells such as polysaccharides and proteins from simple molecules like carbon dioxide and water. Heterotrophs, on the other hand, require a source of more complex substances, such as monosaccharides and amino acids, to produce these complex molecules. Organisms can be further classified by ultimate source of their energy: photoautotrophs and photoheterotrophs obtain energy from light, whereas chemoautotrophs and chemoheterotrophs obtain energy from inorganic oxidation reactions.

===Carbon fixation===

Photosynthesis is the synthesis of carbohydrates from sunlight and carbon dioxide (CO2). In plants, cyanobacteria and algae, oxygenic photosynthesis splits water, with oxygen produced as a waste product. This process uses the ATP and NADPH produced by the photosynthetic reaction centres, as described above, to convert CO2 into glycerate 3-phosphate, which can then be converted into glucose. This carbon-fixation reaction is carried out by the enzyme RuBisCO as part of the Calvin – Benson cycle.[tpl]cite journal |author=Miziorko H, Lorimer G |title=Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase |journal=Annu Rev Biochem |volume=52 |issue= |pages=507–35 |year=1983 |pmid=6351728 |doi=10.1146/annurev.bi.52.070183.002451[/tpl] Three types of photosynthesis occur in plants, C3 carbon fixation, C4 carbon fixation and CAM photosynthesis. These differ by the route that carbon dioxide takes to the Calvin cycle, with C3 plants fixing CO2 directly, while C4 and CAM photosynthesis incorporate the CO2 into other compounds first, as adaptations to deal with intense sunlight and dry conditions.[tpl]cite journal |author=Dodd A, Borland A, Haslam R, Griffiths H, Maxwell K |title=Crassulacean acid metabolism: plastic, fantastic |url=http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/53/369/569 |journal=J Exp Bot |volume=53 |issue=369 |pages=569–80 |year=2002 |pmid=11886877 |doi=10.1093/jexbot/53.369.569[/tpl]
In photosynthetic prokaryotes the mechanisms of carbon fixation are more diverse. Here, carbon dioxide can be fixed by the Calvin – Benson cycle, a reversed citric acid cycle,[tpl]cite journal |author=Hügler M, Wirsen C, Fuchs G, Taylor C, Sievert S |title=Evidence for Autotrophic CO2 Fixation via the Reductive Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle by Members of the ɛ Subdivision of Proteobacteria |journal=J Bacteriol |volume=187 |issue=9 |pages=3020–7 |date=May 2005 |pmid=15838028 |pmc=1082812 |doi=10.1128/JB.187.9.3020-3027.2005 |url=http://jb.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15838028[/tpl] or the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA.[tpl]cite journal |author=Strauss G, Fuchs G |title=Enzymes of a novel autotrophic CO2 fixation pathway in the phototrophic bacterium Chloroflexus aurantiacus, the 3-hydroxypropionate cycle |journal=Eur J Biochem |volume=215 |issue=3 |pages=633–43 |year=1993 |pmid=8354269 |doi=10.1111/j.1432-1033.1993.tb18074.x[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Wood H |title=Life with CO or CO2 and H2 as a source of carbon and energy |url=http://www.fasebj.org/cgi/reprint/5/2/156 |journal=FASEB J |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=156–63 |year=1991 |pmid=1900793[/tpl] Prokaryotic chemoautotrophs also fix CO2 through the Calvin – Benson cycle, but use energy from inorganic compounds to drive the reaction.[tpl]cite journal |author=Shively J, van Keulen G, Meijer W |title=Something from almost nothing: carbon dioxide fixation in chemoautotrophs |journal=Annu Rev Microbiol |volume=52 |issue= |pages=191–230 |year=1998 |pmid=9891798 |doi=10.1146/annurev.micro.52.1.191[/tpl]

===Carbohydrates and glycans===

In carbohydrate anabolism, simple organic acids can be converted into monosaccharides such as glucose and then used to assemble polysaccharides such as starch. The generation of glucose from compounds like pyruvate, lactate, glycerol, glycerate 3-phosphate and amino acids is called gluconeogenesis. Gluconeogenesis converts pyruvate to glucose-6-phosphate through a series of intermediates, many of which are shared with glycolysis. However, this pathway is not simply glycolysis run in reverse, as several steps are catalyzed by non-glycolytic enzymes. This is important as it allows the formation and breakdown of glucose to be regulated separately, and prevents both pathways from running simultaneously in a futile cycle.[tpl]cite journal |author=Boiteux A, Hess B |title=Design of glycolysis |journal=Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci |volume=293 |issue=1063 |pages=5–22 |year=1981 |pmid=6115423 |doi=10.1098/rstb.1981.0056|bibcode = 1981RSPTB.293....5B [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Pilkis S, el-Maghrabi M, Claus T |title=Fructose-2,6-bisphosphate in control of hepatic gluconeogenesis.

Although fat is a common way of storing energy, in vertebrates such as humans the fatty acids in these stores cannot be converted to glucose through gluconeogenesis as these organisms cannot convert acetyl-CoA into pyruvate; plants do, but animals do not, have the necessary enzymatic machinery.[tpl]cite journal |author=Ensign S |title=Revisiting the glyoxylate cycle: alternate pathways for microbial acetate assimilation |journal=Mol Microbiol |volume=61 |issue=2 |pages=274–6 |year=2006 |pmid=16856935 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2958.2006.05247.x[/tpl] As a result, after long-term starvation, vertebrates need to produce ketone bodies from fatty acids to replace glucose in tissues such as the brain that cannot metabolize fatty acids.[tpl]cite journal |author=Finn P, Dice J |title=Proteolytic and lipolytic responses to starvation |journal=Nutrition |volume=22 |issue=7–8 |pages=830–44 |year=2006 |pmid=16815497 |doi=10.1016/j.nut.2006.04.008[/tpl] In other organisms such as plants and bacteria, this metabolic problem is solved using the glyoxylate cycle, which bypasses the decarboxylation step in the citric acid cycle and allows the transformation of acetyl-CoA to oxaloacetate, where it can be used for the production of glucose.[tpl]cite journal |author=Kornberg H, Krebs H |title=Synthesis of cell constituents from C2-units by a modified tricarboxylic acid cycle |journal=Nature |volume=179 |issue=4568 |pages=988–91 |year=1957 |pmid=13430766 |doi=10.1038/179988a0|bibcode = 1957Natur.179..988K [/tpl]
Polysaccharides and glycans are made by the sequential addition of monosaccharides by glycosyltransferase from a reactive sugar-phosphate donor such as uridine diphosphate glucose (UDP-glucose) to an acceptor hydroxyl group on the growing polysaccharide. As any of the hydroxyl groups on the ring of the substrate can be acceptors, the polysaccharides produced can have straight or branched structures.[tpl]cite journal |author=Rademacher T, Parekh R, Dwek R |title=Glycobiology |journal=Annu Rev Biochem |volume=57 |issue= |pages=785–838 |year=1988 |pmid=3052290 |doi=10.1146/annurev.bi.57.070188.004033[/tpl] The polysaccharides produced can have structural or metabolic functions themselves, or be transferred to lipids and proteins by enzymes called oligosaccharyltransferases.[tpl]cite journal |author=Opdenakker G, Rudd P, Ponting C, Dwek R |title=Concepts and principles of glycobiology |url=http://www.fasebj.org/cgi/reprint/7/14/1330 |journal=FASEB J |volume=7 |issue=14 |pages=1330–7 |year=1993 |pmid=8224606[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=McConville M, Menon A |title=Recent developments in the cell biology and biochemistry of glycosylphosphatidylinositol lipids (review) |journal=Mol Membr Biol |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=1–16 |year=2000 |pmid=10824734 |doi=10.1080/096876800294443[/tpl]

===Fatty acids, isoprenoids and steroids===

Fatty acids are made by fatty acid synthases that polymerize and then reduce acetyl-CoA units. The acyl chains in the fatty acids are extended by a cycle of reactions that add the acyl group, reduce it to an alcohol, dehydrate it to an alkene group and then reduce it again to an alkane group. The enzymes of fatty acid biosynthesis are divided into two groups, in animals and fungi all these fatty acid synthase reactions are carried out by a single multifunctional type I protein,[tpl]cite journal |author=Chirala S, Wakil S |title=Structure and function of animal fatty acid synthase |journal=Lipids |volume=39 |issue=11 |pages=1045–53 |year=2004 |pmid=15726818 |doi=10.1007/s11745-004-1329-9[/tpl] while in plant plastids and bacteria separate type II enzymes perform each step in the pathway.[tpl]cite journal |author=White S, Zheng J, Zhang Y |title=The structural biology of type II fatty acid biosynthesis |journal=Annu Rev Biochem |volume=74 |issue= |pages=791–831 |year=2005 |pmid=15952903 |doi=10.1146/annurev.biochem.74.082803.133524[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Ohlrogge J, Jaworski J |title=Regulation of fatty acid synthesis |journal=Annu Rev Plant Physiol Plant Mol Biol |volume=48 |issue= |pages=109–136 |year=1997 |pmid=15012259 |doi=10.1146/annurev.arplant.48.1.109[/tpl]

===Proteins===

Organisms vary in their ability to synthesize the 20 common amino acids. Most bacteria and plants can synthesize all twenty, but mammals can only synthesize eleven nonessential amino acids, so nine essential amino acids must be obtained from food. Some simple parasites, such as the bacteria Mycoplasma pneumoniae, lack all amino acid synthesis and take their amino acids directly from their hosts.[tpl]cite journal |author=Himmelreich R, Hilbert H, Plagens H, Pirkl E, Li BC, Herrmann R |title=Complete sequence analysis of the genome of the bacterium Mycoplasma pneumoniae |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume=24 |issue=22 |pages=4420–49 |date=November 1996 |pmid=8948633 |pmc=146264 |doi= 10.1093/nar/24.22.4420|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC146264/?tool=pubmed[/tpl] All amino acids are synthesized from intermediates in glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, or the pentose phosphate pathway. Nitrogen is provided by glutamate and glutamine. Amino acid synthesis depends on the formation of the appropriate alpha-keto acid, which is then transaminated to form an amino acid.[tpl]cite book | last = Guyton | first = Arthur C. | coauthors = John E.

Amino acids are made into proteins by being joined together in a chain of peptide bonds. Each different protein has a unique sequence of amino acid residues: this is its primary structure. Just as the letters of the alphabet can be combined to form an almost endless variety of words, amino acids can be linked in varying sequences to form a huge variety of proteins. Proteins are made from amino acids that have been activated by attachment to a transfer RNA molecule through an ester bond. This aminoacyl-tRNA precursor is produced in an ATP-dependent reaction carried out by an aminoacyl tRNA synthetase.[tpl]cite journal | author = Ibba M, Söll D | title = The renaissance of aminoacyl-tRNA synthesis | url=http://www.molcells.org/home/journal/include/downloadPdf.asp?articleuid={A158E3B4-2423-4806-9A30-4B93CDA76DA0} | journal = EMBO Rep | volume = 2 | issue = 5 | pages = 382–7 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11375928 | doi=10.1093/embo-reports/kve095 | pmc=1083889[/tpl] This aminoacyl-tRNA is then a substrate for the ribosome, which joins the amino acid onto the elongating protein chain, using the sequence information in a messenger RNA.[tpl]cite journal |author=Lengyel P, Söll D |title=Mechanism of protein biosynthesis |pmc=378322 |journal=Bacteriol Rev |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=264–301 |year=1969 |pmid=4896351[/tpl]

==Xenobiotics and redox metabolism==

All organisms are constantly exposed to compounds that they cannot use as foods and would be harmful if they accumulated in cells, as they have no metabolic function.

A related problem for aerobic organisms is oxidative stress.[tpl]cite journal |author=Davies K |title=Oxidative stress: the paradox of aerobic life |journal=Biochem Soc Symp |volume=61 |issue= |pages=1–31 |year=1995 |pmid=8660387[/tpl] Here, processes including oxidative phosphorylation and the formation of disulfide bonds during protein folding produce reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide.[tpl]cite journal |author=Tu B, Weissman J |title=Oxidative protein folding in eukaryotes: mechanisms and consequences |url=http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/164/3/341 |journal=J Cell Biol |volume=164 |issue=3 |pages=341–6 |year=2004 |pmid=14757749 |doi=10.1083/jcb.200311055 |pmc=2172237[/tpl] These damaging oxidants are removed by antioxidant metabolites such as glutathione and enzymes such as catalases and peroxidases.[tpl]cite journal |author=Sies H |title=Oxidative stress: oxidants and antioxidants |url=http://ep.physoc.org/cgi/reprint/82/2/291.pdf |format=PDF|journal=Exp Physiol |volume=82 |issue=2 |pages=291–5 |year=1997 |pmid=9129943[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Vertuani S, Angusti A, Manfredini S |title=The antioxidants and pro-antioxidants network: an overview |journal=Curr Pharm Des |volume=10 |issue=14 |pages=1677–94 |year=2004 |pmid=15134565 |doi=10.2174/1381612043384655[/tpl]

==Thermodynamics of living organisms==

Living organisms must obey the laws of thermodynamics, which describe the transfer of heat and work. The second law of thermodynamics states that in any closed system, the amount of entropy (disorder) will tend to increase. Although living organisms' amazing complexity appears to contradict this law, life is possible as all organisms are open systems that exchange matter and energy with their surroundings. Thus living systems are not in equilibrium, but instead are dissipative systems that maintain their state of high complexity by causing a larger increase in the entropy of their environments.[tpl]cite journal |author=von Stockar U, Liu J |title=Does microbial life always feed on negative entropy? Thermodynamic analysis of microbial growth |journal=Biochim Biophys Acta |volume=1412 |issue=3 |pages=191–211 |year=1999 |pmid=10482783 |doi=10.1016/S0005-2728(99)00065-1[/tpl] The metabolism of a cell achieves this by coupling the spontaneous processes of catabolism to the non-spontaneous processes of anabolism. In thermodynamic terms, metabolism maintains order by creating disorder.[tpl]cite journal |author=Demirel Y, Sandler S |title=Thermodynamics and bioenergetics |journal=Biophys Chem |volume=97 |issue=2–3 |pages=87–111 |year=2002 |pmid=12050002 |doi=10.1016/S0301-4622(02)00069-8[/tpl]

==Regulation and control==

As the environments of most organisms are constantly changing, the reactions of metabolism must be finely regulated to maintain a constant set of conditions within cells, a condition called homeostasis.[tpl]cite journal |author=Albert R |title=Scale-free networks in cell biology |url=http://jcs.biologists.org/cgi/content/full/118/21/4947 |journal=J Cell Sci |volume=118 |issue=Pt 21 |pages=4947–57 |year=2005 |pmid=16254242 |doi=10.1242/jcs.02714[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Brand M |title=Regulation analysis of energy metabolism |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/200/2/193 |journal=J Exp Biol |volume=200 |issue=Pt 2 |pages=193–202 |year=1997 |pmid=9050227[/tpl] Metabolic regulation also allows organisms to respond to signals and interact actively with their environments.[tpl]cite journal |author=Soyer O, Salathé M, Bonhoeffer S |title=Signal transduction networks: topology, response and biochemical processes |journal=J Theor Biol |volume=238 |issue=2 |pages=416–25 |year=2006 |pmid=16045939 |doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2005.05.030[/tpl] Two closely linked concepts are important for understanding how metabolic pathways are controlled. Firstly, the regulation of an enzyme in a pathway is how its activity is increased and decreased in response to signals. Secondly, the control exerted by this enzyme is the effect that these changes in its activity have on the overall rate of the pathway (the flux through the pathway).[tpl]cite journal |author=Salter M, Knowles R, Pogson C |title=Metabolic control |journal=Essays Biochem |volume=28 |issue= |pages=1–12 |year=1994 |pmid=7925313[/tpl] For example, an enzyme may show large changes in activity (i.e. it is highly regulated) but if these changes have little effect on the flux of a metabolic pathway, then this enzyme is not involved in the control of the pathway.[tpl]cite journal |author=Westerhoff H, Groen A, Wanders R |title=Modern theories of metabolic control and their applications (review) |journal=Biosci Rep |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=1–22 |year=1984 |pmid=6365197 |doi=10.1007/BF01120819[/tpl]
There are multiple levels of metabolic regulation. In intrinsic regulation, the metabolic pathway self-regulates to respond to changes in the levels of substrates or products; for example, a decrease in the amount of product can increase the flux through the pathway to compensate. This type of regulation often involves allosteric regulation of the activities of multiple enzymes in the pathway.[tpl]cite journal |author=Fell D, Thomas S |title=Physiological control of metabolic flux: the requirement for multisite modulation |journal=Biochem J |volume=311 |issue=Pt 1 |pages=35–9 |year=1995 |pmid=7575476 |pmc=1136115[/tpl] Extrinsic control involves a cell in a multicellular organism changing its metabolism in response to signals from other cells. These signals are usually in the form of soluble messengers such as hormones and growth factors and are detected by specific receptors on the cell surface.[tpl]cite journal |author=Hendrickson W |title=Transduction of biochemical signals across cell membranes |journal=Q Rev Biophys |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=321–30 |year=2005 |pmid=16600054 |doi=10.1017/S0033583506004136[/tpl] These signals are then transmitted inside the cell by second messenger systems that often involved the phosphorylation of proteins.[tpl]cite journal |author=Cohen P |title=The regulation of protein function by multisite phosphorylation—a 25 year update |journal=Trends Biochem Sci |volume=25 |issue=12 |pages=596–601 |year=2000 |pmid=11116185 |doi=10.1016/S0968-0004(00)01712-6[/tpl]
A very well understood example of extrinsic control is the regulation of glucose metabolism by the hormone insulin.[tpl]cite journal |author=Lienhard G, Slot J, James D, Mueckler M |title=How cells absorb glucose |journal=Sci Am |volume=266 |issue=1 |pages=86–91 |year=1992 |pmid=1734513 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0192-86[/tpl] Insulin is produced in response to rises in blood glucose levels. Binding of the hormone to insulin receptors on cells then activates a cascade of protein kinases that cause the cells to take up glucose and convert it into storage molecules such as fatty acids and glycogen.[tpl]cite journal |author=Roach P |title=Glycogen and its metabolism |journal=Curr Mol Med |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=101–20 |year=2002 |pmid=11949930 |doi=10.2174/1566524024605761[/tpl] The metabolism of glycogen is controlled by activity of phosphorylase, the enzyme that breaks down glycogen, and glycogen synthase, the enzyme that makes it. These enzymes are regulated in a reciprocal fashion, with phosphorylation inhibiting glycogen synthase, but activating phosphorylase. Insulin causes glycogen synthesis by activating protein phosphatases and producing a decrease in the phosphorylation of these enzymes.[tpl]cite journal |author=Newgard C, Brady M, O'Doherty R, Saltiel A |title=Organizing glucose disposal: emerging roles of the glycogen targeting subunits of protein phosphatase-1 |url=http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/reprint/49/12/1967.pdf |format=PDF|journal=Diabetes |volume=49 |issue=12 |pages=1967–77 |year=2000 |pmid=11117996 |doi=10.2337/diabetes.49.12.1967[/tpl]

==Evolution==

The central pathways of metabolism described above, such as glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, are present in all three domains of living things and were present in the last universal ancestor.[tpl]cite journal |author=Romano A, Conway T |title=Evolution of carbohydrate metabolic pathways |journal=Res Microbiol |volume=147 |issue=6–7 |pages=448–55 |year=1996 |pmid=9084754 |doi=10.1016/0923-2508(96)83998-2[/tpl] This universal ancestral cell was prokaryotic and probably a methanogen that had extensive amino acid, nucleotide, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism.[tpl]cite journal |author=Koch A |title=How did bacteria come to be? |journal=Adv Microb Physiol |volume=40 |pages=353–99 |year=1998 |pmid=9889982 |doi=10.1016/S0065-2911(08)60135-6 |series=Advances in Microbial Physiology |isbn=978-0-12-027740-7[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Ouzounis C, Kyrpides N |title=The emergence of major cellular processes in evolution |journal=FEBS Lett |volume=390 |issue=2 |pages=119–23 |year=1996 |pmid=8706840 |doi=10.1016/0014-5793(96)00631-X[/tpl] The retention of these ancient pathways during later evolution may be the result of these reactions having been an optimal solution to their particular metabolic problems, with pathways such as glycolysis and the citric acid cycle producing their end products highly efficiently and in a minimal number of steps. Mutation changes that affect non-coding DNA segments may merely affect the metabolic efficiency of the individual for whom the mutation occurs.C.Michael Hogan. 2010. Mutation. ed. E.Monosson and C.J.Cleveland. Encyclopedia of Earth. National Council for Science and the Environment. Washington DC
The first pathways of enzyme-based metabolism may have been parts of purine nucleotide metabolism, while previous metabolic pathways were a part of the ancient RNA world.[tpl]cite journal |author=Caetano-Anolles G, Kim HS, Mittenthal JE |title=The origin of modern metabolic networks inferred from phylogenomic analysis of protein architecture |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=104 |issue=22 |pages=9358–63 |year=2007 |pmid=17517598 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0701214104 |pmc=1890499|bibcode = 2007PNAS..104.9358C [/tpl]
Many models have been proposed to describe the mechanisms by which novel metabolic pathways evolve. These include the sequential addition of novel enzymes to a short ancestral pathway, the duplication and then divergence of entire pathways as well as the recruitment of pre-existing enzymes and their assembly into a novel reaction pathway.[tpl]cite journal |author=Schmidt S, Sunyaev S, Bork P, Dandekar T |title=Metabolites: a helping hand for pathway evolution? |journal=Trends Biochem Sci |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=336–41 |year=2003 |pmid=12826406 |doi=10.1016/S0968-0004(03)00114-2[/tpl] The relative importance of these mechanisms is unclear, but genomic studies have shown that enzymes in a pathway are likely to have a shared ancestry, suggesting that many pathways have evolved in a step-by-step fashion with novel functions created from pre-existing steps in the pathway.[tpl]cite journal |author=Light S, Kraulis P |title=Network analysis of metabolic enzyme evolution in Escherichia coli |journal=BMC Bioinformatics |volume=5|pages=15 |year=2004 |pmid=15113413 |doi=10.1186/1471-2105-5-15 |pmc=394313[/tpl] [tpl]cite journal |author=Alves R, Chaleil R, Sternberg M |title=Evolution of enzymes in metabolism: a network perspective |journal=J Mol Biol |volume=320 |issue=4 |pages=751–70 |year=2002 |pmid=12095253 |doi=10.1016/S0022-2836(02)00546-6[/tpl] An alternative model comes from studies that trace the evolution of proteins' structures in metabolic networks, this has suggested that enzymes are pervasively recruited, borrowing enzymes to perform similar functions in different metabolic pathways (evident in the MANET database)[tpl]cite journal |author=Kim HS, Mittenthal JE, Caetano-Anolles G|title=MANET: tracing evolution of protein architecture in metabolic networks |journal=BMC Bioinformatics|volume=7 |pages=351 |year=2006 |pmid=16854231|doi=10.1186/1471-2105-7-351 |pmc=1559654[/tpl] These recruitment processes result in an evolutionary enzymatic mosaic.[tpl]cite journal |author=Teichmann SA, Rison SC, Thornton JM, Riley M, Gough J, Chothia C|title=Small-molecule metabolsim: an enzyme mosaic |journal=Trends Biotechnol|volume=19 |issue=12 |pages=482–6 |year=2001 |pmid=11711174|doi=10.1016/S0167-7799(01)01813-3[/tpl] A third possibility is that some parts of metabolism might exist as "modules" that can be reused in different pathways and perform similar functions on different molecules.[tpl]cite journal |author=Spirin V, Gelfand M, Mironov A, Mirny L |title=A metabolic network in the evolutionary context: Multiscale structure and modularity |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=103 |issue=23 |pages=8774–9 |date=June 2006 |pmid=16731630 |pmc=1482654 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0510258103 |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16731630|bibcode = 2006PNAS..103.8774S [/tpl]
As well as the evolution of new metabolic pathways, evolution can also cause the loss of metabolic functions. For example, in some parasites metabolic processes that are not essential for survival are lost and preformed amino acids, nucleotides and carbohydrates may instead be scavenged from the host.[tpl]cite journal |author=Lawrence J |title=Common themes in the genome strategies of pathogens |journal=Curr Opin Genet Dev |volume=15 |issue=6 |pages=584–8 |year=2005 |pmid=16188434 |doi=10.1016/j.gde.2005.09.007[/tpl] [tpl]cite journal |author=Wernegreen J |title=For better or worse: genomic consequences of intracellular mutualism and parasitism |journal=Curr Opin Genet Dev |volume=15 |issue=6 |pages=572–83 |year=2005 |pmid=16230003 |doi=10.1016/j.gde.2005.09.013[/tpl] Similar reduced metabolic capabilities are seen in endosymbiotic organisms.[tpl]cite journal |author=Pál C, Papp B, Lercher M, Csermely P, Oliver S, Hurst L |title=Chance and necessity in the evolution of minimal metabolic networks |journal=Nature |volume=440 |issue=7084 |pages=667–70 |year=2006 |pmid=16572170 |doi=10.1038/nature04568|bibcode = 2006Natur.440..667P [/tpl]

==Investigation and manipulation==

Classically, metabolism is studied by a reductionist approach that focuses on a single metabolic pathway. Particularly valuable is the use of radioactive tracers at the whole-organism, tissue and cellular levels, which define the paths from precursors to final products by identifying radioactively labelled intermediates and products.[tpl]cite journal |author=Rennie M |title=An introduction to the use of tracers in nutrition and metabolism |journal=Proc Nutr Soc |volume=58 |issue=4 |pages=935–44 |year=1999 |pmid=10817161 |doi=10.1017/S002966519900124X[/tpl] The enzymes that catalyze these chemical reactions can then be purified and their kinetics and responses to inhibitors investigated. A parallel approach is to identify the small molecules in a cell or tissue; the complete set of these molecules is called the metabolome. Overall, these studies give a good view of the structure and function of simple metabolic pathways, but are inadequate when applied to more complex systems such as the metabolism of a complete cell.[tpl]cite journal |author=Phair R |title=Development of kinetic models in the nonlinear world of molecular cell biology |journal=Metabolism |volume=46 |issue=12 |pages=1489–95 |year=1997 |pmid=9439549 |doi=10.1016/S0026-0495(97)90154-2[/tpl]
An idea of the complexity of the metabolic networks in cells that contain thousands of different enzymes is given by the figure showing the interactions between just 43 proteins and 40 metabolites to the right: the sequences of genomes provide lists containing anything up to 45,000 genes.[tpl]cite journal |author=Sterck L, Rombauts S, Vandepoele K, Rouzé P, Van de Peer Y |title=How many genes are there in plants (... and why are they there)? |journal=Curr Opin Plant Biol |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=199–203 |year=2007 |pmid=17289424 |doi=10.1016/j.pbi.2007.01.004[/tpl] However, it is now possible to use this genomic data to reconstruct complete networks of biochemical reactions and produce more holistic mathematical models that may explain and predict their behavior.[tpl]cite journal |author=Borodina I, Nielsen J |title=From genomes to in silico cells via metabolic networks |journal=Curr Opin Biotechnol |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=350–5 |year=2005 |pmid=15961036 |doi=10.1016/j.copbio.2005.04.008[/tpl] These models are especially powerful when used to integrate the pathway and metabolite data obtained through classical methods with data on gene expression from proteomic and DNA microarray studies.[tpl]cite journal |author=Gianchandani E, Brautigan D, Papin J |title=Systems analyses characterize integrated functions of biochemical networks |journal=Trends Biochem Sci |volume=31 |issue=5 |pages=284–91 |year=2006 |pmid=16616498 |doi=10.1016/j.tibs.2006.03.007[/tpl] Using these techniques, a model of human metabolism has now been produced, which will guide future drug discovery and biochemical research.[tpl]cite journal |author=Duarte NC, Becker SA, Jamshidi N, et al. |title=Global reconstruction of the human metabolic network based on genomic and bibliomic data |journal=Proc.

==History==

The term metabolism is derived from the Greek Μεταβολισμός – "Metabolismos" for "change", or "overthrow".[tpl]cite web | title=Metabolism |publisher=The Online Etymology Dictionary | url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=metabolism |accessdate=2007-02-20[/tpl] The history of the scientific study of metabolism spans several centuries and has moved from examining whole animals in early studies, to examining individual metabolic reactions in modern biochemistry.  The first controlled experiments in human metabolism were published by Santorio Santorio in 1614 in his book Ars de statica medicina.[tpl]cite journal |author=Eknoyan G |title=Santorio Sanctorius (1561–1636) – founding father of metabolic balance studies |journal=Am J Nephrol |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=226–33 |year=1999 |pmid=10213823 |doi=10.1159/000013455[/tpl] He described how he weighed himself before and after eating, sleep, working, sex, fasting, drinking, and excreting. He found that most of the food he took in was lost through what he called "insensible perspiration".
In these early studies, the mechanisms of these metabolic processes had not been identified and a vital force was thought to animate living tissue.Williams, H. S. (1904) A History of Science: in Five Volumes. Volume IV: Modern Development of the Chemical and Biological Sciences Harper and Brothers (New York) Retrieved on 2007-03-26 In the 19th century, when studying the fermentation of sugar to alcohol by yeast, Louis Pasteur concluded that fermentation was catalyzed by substances within the yeast cells he called "ferments". He wrote that "alcoholic fermentation is an act correlated with the life and organization of the yeast cells, not with the death or putrefaction of the cells."[tpl]cite journal |author=Dubos J.|year=1951 |title= Louis Pasteur: Free Lance of Science, Gollancz.

This proved that the organic compounds and chemical reactions found in cells were no different in principle than any other part of chemistry.
It was the discovery of enzymes at the beginning of the 20th century by Eduard Buchner that separated the study of the chemical reactions of metabolism from the biological study of cells, and marked the beginnings of biochemistry.Eduard Buchner's 1907 Nobel lecture at http://nobelprize.org Accessed 2007-03-20 The mass of biochemical knowledge grew rapidly throughout the early 20th century.
