 Cells usually have a single nucleus, but there are also cells that have many nuclei. Some other have no nucleus. This can be a result of a normal process, as in the maturation of mammalian [[red blood cell]]s, or a result of faulty cell division.[[Image:redbloodcells.jpg|thumb|230px|right|Human red blood cells, like those of other mammals, lack nuclei. This occurs as a normal part of the cells' development.]]
Anucleated cells contain no nucleus and are, therefore, incapable of dividing to produce daughter cells. The best-known anucleated cell is the mammalian red blood cell, or erythrocyte, which also lacks other organelles such as mitochondria, and serves primarily as a transport vessel to ferry oxygen from the lungs to the body's tissues. Erythrocytes mature through erythropoiesis in the bone marrow, where they lose their nuclei, organelles, and ribosomes. The nucleus is expelled during the process of differentiation from an erythroblast to a reticulocyte, which is the immediate precursor of the mature erythrocyte.[tpl]cite  journal  | last =Skutelsky | first =E. |author2=Danon D. | month =June | year =1970 | title =Comparative study of nuclear expulsion from the late erythroblast and cytokinesis | journal =J Cell Biol | issue =60(3) | pages =625–635 | pmid =5422968 | doi = 10.1016/0014-4827(70)90536-7 | volume=60[/tpl] The presence of mutagens may induce the release of some immature "micronucleated" erythrocytes into the bloodstream.[tpl]cite  journal  | last =Torous | first =DK | coauthors =Dertinger SD, Hall NE, Tometsko CR. | date = | year =2000 | title =Enumeration of micronucleated reticulocytes in rat peripheral blood: a flow cytometric study | journal =Mutat Res | volume = 465| issue =465(1–2) | pages =91–99 | doi = 10.1016/S1383-5718(99)00216-8| pmid =10708974 | url =  [/tpl][tpl]cite  journal  | last =Hutter  | first =KJ |author2=Stohr M. | year =1982 | title =Rapid detection of mutagen induced micronucleated erythrocytes by flow cytometry | journal =Histochemistry | volume =75 |issue=3 | pages =353–362 | pmid =7141888 | url =  | doi =  10.1007/bf00496738[/tpl] Anucleated cells can also arise from flawed cell division in which one daughter lacks a nucleus and the other has two nuclei.

Multinucleated and binucleated cells can also be abnormal in humans; for example, cells arising from the fusion of monocytes and macrophages, known as giant multinucleated cells, sometimes accompany inflammation[tpl]cite  journal  | last =McInnes  | first =A |author2=Rennick DM | date = | year =1988 | title =Interleukin 4 induces cultured monocytes/macrophages to form giant multinucleated cells | journal =J Exp Med | issue =2 | pages =598–611 | pmid =3258008 | doi =10.1084/jem.167.2.598 | volume=167 | pmc=2188835[/tpl] and are also implicated in tumor formation.[tpl]cite  journal  | last =Goldring | first =SR |author2=Roelke MS|author3=Petrison KK|author4=Bhan AK | year =1987 | title =Human giant cell tumors of bone identification and characterization of cell types | journal =J Clin Invest | volume =79 |issue=2 | pages =483–491 | pmid =3027126  | doi =  10.1172/JCI112838 | pmc=424109[/tpl]
A number of dinoflagelates are known to have two nuclei.Imanian B, Pombert JF, Dorrell RG, Burki F, Keeling PJ (2012) Tertiary endosymbiosis in two dinotoms has generated little change in the mitochondrial genomes of their dinoflagellate hosts and diatom endosymbionts" PLoS One 7(8) e43763. Unlike other multinucleated cells these nuclei contain two distinct lineages of DNA: one from the dinoflagelate and the other from a symbiotic diatom. Curiously the mitochondrion and the plastid of the diatom remain functional.

==Evolution==

As the major defining characteristic of the eukaryotic cell, the nucleus' evolutionary origin has been the subject of much speculation. Four major hypotheses have been proposed to explain the existence of the nucleus, although none have yet earned widespread support.[tpl]cite journal | author = Pennisi E.| title = Evolutionary biology. The birth of the nucleus | doi = 10.1126/science.305.5685.766| journal = Science | volume = 305 | issue =5685 | pages = 766–768 | year =2004 | pmid = 15297641[/tpl]
The first model known as the "syntrophic model" proposes that a symbiotic relationship between the archaea and bacteria created the nucleus-containing eukaryotic cell. (Organisms of the Archaea and Bacteria domain have no cell nucleus.C.Michael Hogan. 2010. Archaea. eds. E.Monosson & C.Cleveland, Encyclopedia of Earth. National Council for Science and the Environment, Washington DC.) It is hypothesized that the symbiosis originated when ancient archaea, similar to modern methanogenic archaea, invaded and lived within bacteria similar to modern myxobacteria, eventually forming the early nucleus. This theory is analogous to the accepted theory for the origin of eukaryotic mitochondria and chloroplasts, which are thought to have developed from a similar endosymbiotic relationship between proto-eukaryotes and aerobic bacteria.[tpl]cite book | author= Margulis, Lynn | year= 1981 | title= Symbiosis in Cell Evolution | pages=206–227 | publisher= W. H. Freeman and Company | location=San Francisco | isbn = 0-7167-1256-3[/tpl] The archaeal origin of the nucleus is supported by observations that archaea and eukarya have similar genes for certain proteins, including histones. Observations that myxobacteria are motile, can form multicellular complexes, and possess kinases and G proteins similar to eukarya, support a bacterial origin for the eukaryotic cell.[tpl]cite journal | author = Lopez-Garcia P, Moreira D. | title = Selective forces for the origin of the eukaryotic nucleus | doi = 10.1002/bies.20413| journal = BioEssays | volume = 28 | issue =5 | pages = 525–533 | year =2006 | pmid = 16615090[/tpl]
A second model proposes that proto-eukaryotic cells evolved from bacteria without an endosymbiotic stage. This model is based on the existence of modern planctomycetes bacteria that possess a nuclear structure with primitive pores and other compartmentalized membrane structures.[tpl]cite  journal  | author =Fuerst JA. | title = Intracellular compartmentation in planctomycetes | journal = Annu Rev Microbiol. | volume = 59 | issue = | pages = 299–328 | year =2005 | pmid = 15910279 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.micro.59.030804.121258  [/tpl]  A similar proposal states that a eukaryote-like cell, the chronocyte, evolved first and phagocytosed archaea and bacteria to generate the nucleus and the eukaryotic cell.[tpl]cite journal | author =Hartman H, Fedorov A. | title = The origin of the eukaryotic cell: a genomic investigation  | doi = 10.1073/pnas.032658599| journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. | volume = 99 | issue =3 | pages = 1420–1425 | year =2002 | pmid = 11805300 | pmc =122206 [/tpl]
The most controversial model, known as viral eukaryogenesis, posits that the membrane-bound nucleus, along with other eukaryotic features, originated from the infection of a prokaryote by a virus. The suggestion is based on similarities between eukaryotes and viruses such as linear DNA strands, mRNA capping, and tight binding to proteins (analogizing histones to viral envelopes). One version of the proposal suggests that the nucleus evolved in concert with phagocytosis to form an early cellular "predator".[tpl]cite journal |author=Bell PJ |title=Viral eukaryogenesis: was the ancestor of the nucleus a complex DNA virus? |journal=J. Mol. Evol. |volume=53 |issue=3 |pages=251–6 |date=September 2001 |pmid=11523012 |doi=10.1007/s002390010215 |url=[/tpl] Another variant proposes that eukaryotes originated from early archaea infected by poxviruses, on the basis of observed similarity between the DNA polymerases in modern poxviruses and eukaryotes.[tpl]cite journal | author = Takemura M | year = 2001 | title = Poxviruses and the origin of the eukaryotic nucleus | url = | journal = J Mol Evol | volume = 52 | issue = 5| pages = 419–425 | pmid = 11443345 | doi=10.1007/s002390010171[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Villarreal L, DeFilippis V | title = A hypothesis for DNA viruses as the origin of eukaryotic replication proteins  | doi = 10.1128/JVI.74.15.7079-7084.2000| journal = J Virol | volume = 74 | issue = 15 | pages = 7079–7084 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10888648 | pmc = 112226[/tpl] It has been suggested that the unresolved question of the evolution of sex could be related to the viral eukaryogenesis hypothesis.[tpl]cite journal |author=Bell PJ |title=Sex and the eukaryotic cell cycle is consistent with a viral ancestry for the eukaryotic nucleus |journal=J.

A more recent proposal, the exomembrane hypothesis, suggests that the nucleus instead originated from a single ancestral cell that evolved a second exterior cell membrane; the interior membrane enclosing the original cell then became the nuclear membrane and evolved increasingly elaborate pore structures for passage of internally synthesized cellular components such as ribosomal subunits.[tpl]cite  journal  | author = de Roos AD| title = The origin of the eukaryotic cell based on conservation of existing interfaces| journal = Artif Life | volume = 12 | issue = 4 | pages = 513–523. | year =2006 | pmid = 16953783 | doi = 10.1162/artl.2006.12.4.513  [/tpl]
