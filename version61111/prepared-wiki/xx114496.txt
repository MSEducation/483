Peter Street (born 6 June 1980 in Tasmania) is a former professional Australian rules footballer in the Australian Football League. 
At 211Â cm (6' 11") he is the equal tallest player in the history of the VFL/AFL (along with Aaron Sandilands).
Originally drafted by the Geelong Football Club in the 1998 AFL Draft, Street was traded to the Western Bulldogs at the end of the 2003 season.  The ruckman was considered a cult figure at the Bulldogs and during the 2006 season, amidst many long-term injuries to the club's taller players, he became an important ruckman for the club.
He was, however, delisted by the Bulldogs in 2008 and was not re-drafted by another club.
