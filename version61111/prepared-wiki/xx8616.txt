Tesla gained experience in telephony and electrical engineering before emigrating to the United States in 1884 to work for Thomas Edison in New York City. He soon struck out on his own with financial backers, setting up laboratories and companies to develop a range of electrical devices. His patented AC induction motor and transformer were licensed by George Westinghouse, who also hired Tesla for a short time as a consultant. Tesla went on to pursue his ideas of wireless lighting and electricity distribution in his high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in New York and Colorado Springs and made early (1893) pronouncements on the possibility of wireless communication with his devices. He tried to put these ideas to practical use in his ill-fated attempt at intercontinental wireless transmission; his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project.[tpl]cite web |title=Tesla Tower in Shoreham Long Island (1901–1917) meant to be the "World Wireless" Broadcasting system |url=http://www.teslasociety.com/teslatower.htm |publisher=Tesla Memorial Society of New York |accessdate=3 June 2012[/tpl] In his lab he also conducted a range of experiments with mechanical oscillator/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging. He even built a wireless controlled boat which may have been the first such device ever exhibited.
Tesla's achievements and his abilities as a showman demonstrating his seemingly miraculous inventions made him world-famous.[tpl]cite book |last=O'Shei |first=Tim |title=Marconi and Tesla: Pioneers of Radio Communication |year=2008 |publisher=MyReportLinks.com Books  |isbn=978-1-59845-076-7 |page=106[/tpl] Although he made a considerable amount of money from his patents, he spent a lot financing his own projects. He lived for most of his life in a series of New York hotels although the end of his patent income and eventual bankruptcy led him to live in diminished circumstances.[tpl]harvnb|Cheney|Uth|Glenn|1999|pp=121, 154[/tpl] Tesla continued to invite the press to parties he held on his birthday to announce new inventions he was working on and make (sometimes unusual) public statements.[tpl]harvnb|Seifer|2001|p=1942[/tpl][tpl]harvnb|Pickover|1999[/tpl] Because of his pronouncements and the nature of his work over the years, Tesla gained a reputation in popular culture as the archetypal "mad scientist."[tpl]harvnb|Van Riper|2011[/tpl] He died on 7 January 1943.
Tesla's work fell into relative obscurity after his death, but since the 1990s, his reputation has experienced a resurgence in popular culture.[tpl]harvnb|Van Riper|2011|p=150[/tpl] His work and reputed inventions are also at the center of many conspiracy theories and have also been used to support various pseudosciences, UFO theories and New Age occultism. In 1960, in honor of Tesla, the General Conference on Weights and Measures for the International System of Units dedicated the term "tesla" to the SI unit measure for magnetic field strength.[tpl]cite web |title=Welcome to the Tesla Memorial Society of New York Website |url=http://www.teslasociety.com/mri_digest.htm |publisher=Tesla Memorial Society of New York |accessdate=3 June 2012[/tpl]

==Early years (1856–1885)==

Nikola Tesla was born on 10 July (O.S. 28 June) 1856 to Serbian parents in the village of Smiljan, Austrian Empire (modern-day Croatia). His father, Milutin Tesla, was a Serbian Orthodox priest.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.neuronet.pitt.edu/~bogdan/tesla/bio.htm |title=Tesla, Nikola |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher= University of Pittsburgh |accessdate=1 January 2011[/tpl] Tesla's mother, Đuka Tesla (née Mandić), whose father was also a Serbian Orthodox priest,[tpl]harvnb|O'Neill|2007|p=10[/tpl] had a talent for making home craft tools, mechanical appliances, and the ability to memorize Serbian epic poems. Đuka had never received a formal education. Nikola credited his eidetic memory and creative abilities to his mother's genetics and influence.[tpl]cite web|last=Cheney|first=Margaret|title=TESLA: MAN OUT OF TIME|url=http://www.bookviewzine.com/issue104.html|work=bookviewzine online publish of biography|publisher=Simon and Schuster, 2001|accessdate=29 May 2013[/tpl][tpl]harvnb|Seifer|2001|p=7[/tpl] Tesla's progenitors were from western Serbia, near Montenegro.[tpl]harvnb|O'Neill|2007|p=12[/tpl]
Tesla was the fourth of five children. He had an older brother named Dane and three sisters, Milka, Angelina and Marica. Dane was killed in a horse-riding accident when Nikola was five.[tpl]harvnb|Cheney|Uth|Glenn|1999|p=3[/tpl] However, according to another account, Dane died after falling down the cellar stairs, but when he was unconscious and in delirium, he claimed that Nikola pushed him down.[tpl]cite book|last=Cheney|first=Margaret|title=Tesla : man out of time|year=2001|publisher=Simon & Schuster|location=New York|isbn=0743215362|page=9|edition=1st Touchstone ed.[/tpl]  In 1861, Tesla attended the "Lower" or "Primary" School in Smiljan where he studied German, arithmetic, and religion. In 1862, the Tesla family moved to Gospić, Austrian Empire, where Tesla's father worked as a pastor. Nikola completed "Lower" or "Primary" School, followed by the "Lower Real Gymnasium" or "Normal School."[tpl]cite web |title=Tesla Timeline |url=http://www.teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla-timeline-1862-tesla-moves-to-gospic |publisher=Tesla Universe |accessdate=16 August 2012[/tpl]
In 1870, Tesla moved to Karlovac to attend school at Higher Real Gymnasium, where he was profoundly influenced by a math teacher Martin Sekulić.[tpl]harvnb|O'Neill|2007|p=32[/tpl] Tesla was able to perform integral calculus in his head, which prompted his teachers to believe that he was cheating.[tpl]cite web |title=Tesla Life and Legacy – Tesla's Early Years |url=http://www.pbs.org/tesla/ll/ll_early.html |publisher=PBS |accessdate=8 July 2012[/tpl] He finished a four-year term in three years, graduating in 1873.[tpl]harvnb|O'Neill|2007|p=33[/tpl]
In 1873, Tesla returned to his birthtown, Smiljan. Shortly after he arrived, Tesla contracted cholera; he was bedridden for nine months and was near death multiple times. Tesla's father, in a moment of despair, promised to send him to the best engineering school if he recovered from the illness[tpl]cite web|last=Tesla|first=Nikola|title=My Inventions The Autobiography of Nikola Tesla|url=http://www.lucidcafe.com/library/96jul/teslaautobio.html|accessdate=16 August 2012[/tpl] (his father had originally wanted him to enter the priesthood).[tpl]Cite book|last=Glenn|first=edited by Jim|title=The complete patents of Nikola Tesla|year=1994|publisher=Barnes & Noble Books|location=New York|isbn=1-56619-266-8[/tpl]
In 1874, Tesla evaded being drafted into the Austro-Hungarian Army in Smiljan[tpl]harvnb|Seifer|2001[/tpl] by running away to Tomingaj, near Gračac. There, he explored the mountains in hunter's garb. Tesla claimed that this contact with nature made him stronger, both physically and mentally. He read many books while in Tomingaj, and later claimed that Mark Twain's works had helped him to miraculously recover from his earlier illness.
In 1875, Tesla enrolled at Austrian Polytechnic in Graz, Austria, on a Military Border scholarship. During his first year, Tesla never missed a lecture, earned the highest grades possible, passed nine exams[tpl]cite web|title=Tesla Timeline |url=http://www.teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla-timeline-1861-dane-tesla-dies |publisher=Tesla Universe |accessdate=16 August 2012[/tpl] (nearly twice as many required[tpl]harvnb|O'Neill|2007[/tpl]), started a Serbian culture club, and even received a letter of commendation from the dean of the technical faculty to his father, which stated, "Your son is a star of first rank." Tesla claimed that he worked from 3 a.m. to 11 p.m., no Sundays or holidays excepted. He was "mortified when his father made light of those hard won honors." After his father's death in 1879, Tesla found a package of letters from his professors to his father, warning that unless he were removed from the school, Tesla would be killed through overwork. During his second year, Tesla came into conflict with Professor Poeschl over the Gramme dynamo, when Tesla suggested that commutators weren't necessary. At the end of his second year, Tesla lost his scholarship and became addicted to gambling. During his third year, Tesla gambled away his allowance and his tuition money, later gambling back his initial losses and returning the balance to his family. Tesla claimed that he "conquered his passion then and there," but later he was known to play billiards in the US. When exam time came, Tesla was unprepared and asked for an extension to study, but was denied. He never graduated from the university and did not receive grades for the last semester.
In December 1878, Tesla left Graz and severed all relations with his family to hide the fact that he dropped out of school. His friends thought that he had drowned in the Mur River.[tpl]harvnb|Seifer|2001|p=18[/tpl] Tesla went to Maribor (now in Slovenia), where he worked as a draftsman for 60 florins a month. He spent his spare time playing cards with local men on the streets. In March 1879, Milutin Tesla went to Maribor to beg his son to return home, but Nikola refused.[tpl]cite web|title=Tesla Timeline|url=http://www.teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla-timeline-1862-tesla-moves-to-gospic#goto-1878|publisher=Tesla Universe|accessdate=16 August 2012[/tpl] Nikola suffered a nervous breakdown at around the same time.
On 24 March 1879, Tesla was returned to Gospić under police guard for not having a residence permit. On 17 April 1879, Milutin Tesla died at the age of 60 after contracting an unspecified illness[tpl]cite web|title=Tesla Timeline|url=http://www.teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla-timeline-1862-tesla-moves-to-gospic#goto-1879|publisher=Tesla Universe|accessdate=16 August 2012[/tpl] (although some sources claim that he died of a stroke[tpl]cite web|title=Timeline of Nikola tesla|url=http://www.teslasociety.org/timeline.html|publisher=tesla memorial society of ny|accessdate=1 December 2012[/tpl] ). During that year, Tesla taught a large class of students in his old school, Higher Real Gymnasium, in Gospić.
In January 1880, two of Tesla's uncles put together enough money to help him leave Gospić for Prague where he was to study. Unfortunately, he arrived too late to enroll at Charles-Ferdinand University; he never studied Greek, a required subject; and he was illiterate in Czech, another required subject. Tesla did, however, attend lectures at the university, although, as an auditor, he did not receive grades for the courses.[tpl]cite web|title=Tesla Timeline|url=http://www.teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla-timeline-1862-tesla-moves-to-gospic#goto-1880|publisher=Tesla Universe|accessdate=16 August 2012[/tpl][tpl]Cite book|last=Mrkich|first=D.|title=Nikola Tesla: the european years|year=2003|publisher=Commoner's Publishing|location=Ottawa|isbn=0-88970-113-X|edition=1st ed.[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=NYHOTEL|url=http://www.teslasociety.com/nyhotel.htm|publisher=Tesla Society of NY|accessdate=17 August 2012[/tpl]
In 1881, Tesla moved to Budapest to work under Ferenc Puskas at a telegraph company, the Budapest Telephone Exchange. Upon arrival, Tesla realized that the company, then under construction, was not functional, so he worked as a draftsman in the Central Telegraph Office instead. Within a few months, the Budapest Telephone Exchange became functional and Tesla was allocated the chief electrician position.[tpl]cite web|title=Tesla Timeline|url=http://www.teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla-timeline-1881-tesla-works-in-budapest?PHPSESSID=b2ac3fd9ddbac330fbfd29e6dd44a509;|publisher=Tesla Universe|accessdate=17 August 2012[/tpl] During his employment, Tesla made many improvements to the Central Station equipment and claimed to have perfected a telephone repeater or amplifier, which was never patented nor publicly described.

===Working for Edison===

In 1882, Tesla began working for the Continental Edison Company in France, designing and making improvements to electrical equipment.[tpl]cite web|url=http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/nikola-tesla-the-genius/|title=Nikola Tesla: The Genius Who Lit the World|publisher=Top Documentary Films[/tpl]
In June 1884, Tesla relocated to New York City.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/tesla/ll/ll_america.html |title=Coming to America |publisher=Public Broadcasting Service |accessdate=14 November 2010[/tpl] During his trip across the Atlantic, his ticket, money, and some of his luggage were stolen, and he was nearly thrown overboard after a mutiny broke out on the ship.[tpl]cite web|title=Tesla Timeline|url=http://www.teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla-timeline-1884-tesla-arrives-in-new-york|publisher=Tesla Universe|accessdate=17 July 2012[/tpl] He arrived with only four cents in his pocket, a letter of recommendation, a few poems, and the remainder of his belongings.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]
Tesla was hired by Edison to work for his Edison Machine Works. Tesla's work for Edison began with simple electrical engineering and quickly progressed to solving some of the company's most difficult problems. Tesla was even offered the task of completely redesigning the Edison Company's direct current generators.[tpl]cite book |title=American inventors, entrepreneurs & business visionaries |last=Carey |first=Charles W. |year=1989 |publisher=Infobase Publishing |isbn=0-8160-4559-3 |page=337 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=XKiGgl36bkgC |accessdate=27 November 2010[/tpl]
In 1885, Tesla claimed that he could redesign Edison's inefficient motor and generators, making an improvement in both service and economy. According to Tesla, Edison remarked, "There's fifty thousand dollars in it for you—if you can do it"[tpl]harvnb|Cheney|2001|pp=54–57[/tpl]—this has been noted as an odd statement from an Edison whose company was stingy with pay and who did not have that sort of cash on hand.[tpl]harvnb|Jonnes|2004|p=110[/tpl] After months of work, Tesla fulfilled the task and inquired about payment. Edison, claiming that he was only joking, replied, "Tesla, you don't understand our American humor."[tpl]harvnb|Pickover|1999|p=14[/tpl][tpl]harvnb|O'Neill|2007|p=64[/tpl] Instead, Edison offered a US$10 a week raise over Tesla's US$18 per week salary; Tesla refused the offer and immediately resigned.

==Middle years (1886–1899)==

In 1886, Tesla formed his own company, Tesla Electric Light & Manufacturing.[tpl]cite web|title=Tesla Timeline|url=http://www.teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla-timeline-1886-the-winter-of-suffering#goto-1885|publisher=Tesla Universe|accessdate=17 July 2012[/tpl] The company installed electrical arc light based illumination systems designed by Tesla and also had designs for dynamo electric machine commutators, the first patents issued to Tesla in the US.[tpl]harvnb|Jonnes|2004[/tpl]
Tesla proposed that the company should go on to develop his ideas for alternating current transmission systems and motors. The investors disagreed and eventually fired him, leaving him penniless; Tesla was forced to work as a ditch digger for US$2 per day. Tesla considered the winter of 1886/1887 as a time of "terrible headaches and bitter tears." During this time, he questioned the value of his education.[tpl]cite web|title=Tesla Timeline|url=http://www.teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla-timeline-1886-the-winter-of-suffering#goto-1886|publisher=Tesla Universe|accessdate=17 July 2012[/tpl]
In April 1887, Tesla started a company, the Tesla Electric Company, with the backing of New York attorney Charles F. Peck and Alfred S. Brown, the director of Western Union. They set up a laboratory for Tesla at 89 Liberty Street in Manhattan so he could work on his alternating current motor and other devices for power distribution, with an agreement that they share fifty-fifty with Tesla any profits generated from patents.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla-timeline-1887-szigeti-comes-to-america |title=Tesla Timeline, Year: 1887 |publisher=Teslauniverse.com |accessdate=10 September 2012[/tpl] It was here, in 1887, that Tesla constructed a brushless alternating current induction motor, based on a rotating magnetic field principle he claimed to have conceived of in 1882.[tpl]cite book|title=Networks of power: electrification in Western society, 1880–1930|publisher=JHU Press|page=117|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=g07Q9M4agp4C&pg=PA117&dq=Galileo+Ferraris+and+rotating+magnetic+field&hl=en&sa=X&ei=NMp0T_bXL6Gc2AXt7e3ODg&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Galileo%20Ferraris%20and%20rotating%20magnetic%20field&f=false[/tpl] He received a US patent for the motor in May 1888.[tpl]cite web|title=Timeline of Nikola Tesla|url=http://www.teslasociety.org/timeline.html|publisher=Tesla Memorial Society of NY|accessdate=5 July 2012[/tpl] At that time, many inventors were trying to develop workable AC motors because AC's advantages in long distance high voltage transmission were counterbalanced by the inability to operate motors on AC. The rotating magnetic field induction motor seems to have been an independent invention by Tesla, but it was not a unique discovery at the time.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=1AsFdUxOwu8C&pg=PA204&lpg=PA204&dq=Tesla++Ferraris+induction+independent&source=bl&ots=u5KUDyGE2O&sig=Q-MxnMFjnKrr03xF3LyBdReYVtg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=R5J8UI3oNKLs0QH-rIHgCg&ved=0CEkQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=Tesla%20%20Ferraris%20induction%20independent&f=false |title=Robert Bud, Instruments of Science: An Historical Encyclopedia, page 204 |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=18 March 2013[/tpl]  Italian physicist  Galileo Ferraris published a paper on rotating magnetic field based induction motor on 11 March 1888,[tpl]cite web|title=Galileo Ferraris Physicist, Pioneer of Alternating Current Systems (1847–1897) Inventor of the Induction Motor "Father of three-phase current" – Electrotechnical Congress, Frankfurt 1891|url=http://edisontechcenter.org/GalileoFerraris.html|publisher=Edison Tech Center|accessdate=3 July 2012[/tpl][tpl]Cite book|author=Vaclav Smil|title=Creating the Twentieth Century:Technical Innovations of 1867–1914 and Their Lasting Impact|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ZANP8uYlu1cC&pg=PA76|date=14 July 2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-988341-7|page=76[/tpl][tpl]Cite book|author1=Fritz E.

In 1888, the editor of Electrical World magazine, Thomas Commerford Martin (a friend and publicist), arranged for Tesla to demonstrate his alternating current system, including his induction motor, at the American Institute of Electrical Engineers  (now IEEE).[tpl]Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8j5bJ5OkGpgC&pg=PA36&lpg=PA36&dq=Westinghouse+tesla++Electrical+Engineers&source=bl&ots=5nHK8Hlhi1&sig=7NmfQ2iGm7IznasuUyl8Ce58bNQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=1-xNUNb6Aonw0gGWv4H4Cg&ved=0CFMQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=Westinghouse%20tesla%20%20Electrical%20Engineers&f=false |title=Fritz E.

In July 1888, Brown and Peck negotiated a licensing deal with George Westinghouse for Tesla's polyphase induction motor and transformer designs for $60,000 in cash and stock and a royalty of $2.50 per AC horsepower produced by each motor. Westinghouse also hired Tesla for one year for the large fee of $2,000 ($[tpl]Inflation|US|2000|1888|r=-2[/tpl] in today's dollars[tpl]Inflation-fn|US[/tpl]) a month to be a consultant at the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company's Pittsburgh labs.[tpl]Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=WKuG-VIwID8C&pg=PA305&lpg=PA305&dq=tesla+hired+by+westinghouse&source=bl&ots=KDI0aTz0EK&sig=oct2jnPyWkQ3qvUR-JmstK9F0FI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=jRwxUKK3LtS80QHjxoGYAg&sqi=2&ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=tesla%20hired%20by%20westinghouse&f=false |title=John W.

During that year, Tesla worked in Pittsburgh, helping to create an alternating current system to power the city's streetcars. He found the time there frustrating because of conflicts between him and the other Westinghouse engineers over how best to implement AC power. Between them, they settled on a 60-cycle AC current system Tesla proposed (to match the working frequency of Tesla's motor), although they soon found that, since Tesla's induction motor could only run at a constant speed, it would not work for street cars. They ended up using a DC traction motor instead.[tpl]cite web|last=Harris |first=William |url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/nikola-tesla2.htm |title=William Harris, How did Nikola Tesla change the way we use energy?, page 3 |publisher=Science.howstuffworks.com |date=14 July 2008 |accessdate=10 September 2012[/tpl]

===American citizenship===

On 30 July 1891, at the age of 35, Tesla became a naturalized citizen of the United States. He told many of his companions that he valued the citizenship more than any scientific honors that he had acquired.[tpl]cite web|title=Tesla Timeline|url=http://www.teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla-timeline-1891-tesla-granted-citizenship|publisher=Tesla Universe|accessdate=5 July 2012[/tpl]
In the same year, Tesla established his South Fifth Avenue laboratory in New York. Later, he established his Houston Street laboratory in New York at 46 E. Houston Street. He lit electric lamps wirelessly at both of the New York locations, providing evidence for the potential of wireless power transmission.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Krumme |first1=Katherine |last2= |first2= |year=2000 |title=Mark Twain and Nikola Tesla: Thunder and Lightning |publisher=University of California, Berkeley |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20120516065244/http://www.genevolution.net/documents/twain%20and%20tesla.pdf |format=PDF[/tpl]
In 1892, Tesla spent a few months in Europe visiting other scientists. He later went to visit his hometown,[tpl]Cite book|last=Burgan|first=Michael|title=Nikola Tesla: physicist, inventor, electrical engineer|year=2009|publisher=Compass Point Books|location=Minneapolis, Minn.|isbn=0-7565-4086-0[/tpl] arriving from Paris hours before his mother's death.[tpl]cite web|title=Tesla Timeline|url=http://www.teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla-timeline-1892-tesla-looses-his-mother|publisher=Tesla Universe|accessdate=4 July 2012[/tpl] He stayed at her side until he was exhausted. Nikola was awakened from a dream, in which an angel bearing resemblance to his mother appeared. He wrote: "I was wakened up by an indescribably sweet song of many voices." He believed that the dream was a sign that his mother had died; he later confirmed this. Her last words to him were: "You've arrived, Nidžo, my pride." At first, Tesla believed that the dream was a message from the supernatural; however, after a few months of research, he concluded that his dream was caused by a painting of angels that he had seen before going to bed and that the singing voices had been from a nearby church.
After the death of his mother, Tesla became ill and spent two to three weeks recovering in Gospić and Tomingaj.
From 1892 to 1894, Tesla served as the vice president of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, the forerunner (along with the Institute of Radio Engineers) of the modern-day IEEE.[tpl]cite web|title=Tesla's Connection to Columbia University *|url=http://www.teslasociety.com/columbia.pdf|publisher=Tesla Memorial Society of NY|accessdate=5 July 2012|author=Kenneth L.

Tesla investigated harvesting energy in space. He believed that it was merely a question of time until men would succeed in attaching their machinery to the very wheelwork of nature, stating: "Ere many generations pass, our machinery will be driven by a power obtainable at any point of the universe."
In 1893, Westinghouse won the bid to electrify the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago with alternating current. This World's Fair devoted a building to electrical exhibits. It was a key event in the history of AC power, as Westinghouse and Tesla demonstrated the safety and reliability of alternating current to the American public.[tpl]Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=F6cWRxU9go4C&pg=PR21&dq=westinghouse+World%27s+Columbian+Exposition&hl=en&sa=X&ei=RPv2T5mzG8mQ0QHFj7nqBg&ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=westinghouse%20World%27s%20Columbian%20Exposition&f=false |title=David J.

As a result of the "War of Currents," Edison and Westinghouse went nearly bankrupt. Edison had lost control of his company to J.P. Morgan, and Morgan was refusing to loan more money to Westinghouse due to the financial strain of the Tesla AC patentsThomas Parke Hughes, Networks of power: electrification in Western society, 1880–1930 (1983), page 119Hans Camenzind, Much Ado About Almost Nothing: Man's Encounter With the Electron, (2007), page 107 (at that point Westinghouse had paid out an estimated $200,000 in licenses and royalties to Tesla, Brown, and Peck[tpl]harvnb|Seifer|2001|p=190[/tpl]). In 1897, Westinghouse explained his financial difficulties to Tesla in stark terms, saying that if things continue the way they were he would no longer be in control of Westinghouse Electric and Tesla would have to "deal with the bankers" to try to collect future royalties. Westinghouse convinced Tesla to release his company from the licensing agreement over Tesla's AC patents in exchange for Westinghouse Electric purchasing the patents for a lump sum payment of $216,000;[tpl]harvnb|Cheney|2001|pp=73–4[/tpl] this provided Westinghouse a break from what, due to alternating current's rapid gain in popularity, had turned out to be an overly generous $2.50 per AC horsepower royalty.

===X-ray experimentation===

Starting in 1894, Tesla began investigating what he referred to as radiant energy of "invisible" kinds when he had noticed damaged film in his lab in previous experimentsMaja Hrabak et al., "Nikola Tesla and the Discovery of X-rays," in RadioGraphics, vol. 28, 2008 July 1189–92.

His early experiments were with Crookes tubes, a cold cathode electrical discharge tube. Soon after, much of Tesla's early research—hundreds of invention models, plans, notes, laboratory data, tools, photographs, valued at $50,000—was lost in the 5th Avenue laboratory fire of March 1895. Tesla is quoted by The New York Times as saying, "I am in too much grief to talk. What can I say?"[tpl]cite web|title=Tesla Timeline|url=http://www.teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla-timeline-1895-tesla-looses-fifth-ave-lab-to-fire|publisher=Tesla Universe|accessdate=4 July 2012[/tpl] Tesla may have inadvertently captured an X-ray image (predating Wilhelm Röntgen's December 1895 announcement of the discovery of x-rays by a few weeks) when he tried to photograph Mark Twain illuminated by a Geissler tube, an earlier type of gas discharge tube.

Friday, 13 March 1896" |publisher=Anengineersaspect.blogspot.com |date=23 July 2011 |accessdate=10 September 2012[/tpl] Tesla proceeded to do his own experiments in X-ray imaging, developing a high energy single terminal vacuum tube of his own design that had no target electrode and that worked from the output of the Tesla Coil (the modern term for the phenomenon produced by this device is bremsstrahlung or braking radiation). In his research, Tesla devised several experimental setups to produce X-rays. Tesla held that, with his circuits, the "instrument will ... enable one to generate Roentgen rays of much greater power than obtainable with ordinary apparatus."N. Tesla, "High Frequency Oscillators for Electro-Therapeutic and Other Purposes", in Proceedings of the American Electro-Therapeutic Association, American Electro-Therapeutic Association. Page 25.
Tesla noted the hazards of working with his circuit and single-node X-ray-producing devices. In his many notes on the early investigation of this phenomenon, he attributed the skin damage to various causes. He believed early on that damage to the skin was not caused by the Roentgen rays, but by the ozone generated in contact with the skin, and to a lesser extent, by nitrous acid. Tesla incorrectly believed that X-rays were longitudinal waves, such as those produced in waves in plasma. These plasma waves can occur in force-free magnetic fields.Griffiths, David J.

On 11 July 1934, the New York Herald Tribune published an article on Tesla, in which he recalled an event that would occasionally take place while experimenting with his single-electrode vacuum tubes; a minute particle would break off the cathode, pass out of the tube, and physically strike him. "Tesla said he could feel a sharp stinging pain where it entered his body, and again at the place where it passed out." In comparing these particles with the bits of metal projected by his "electric gun," Tesla said, "The particles in the beam of force ... will travel much faster than such particles ... and they will travel in concentrations."[tpl]Cite book|last=editor|first=Leland Anderson,|title=Nikola Tesla's teleforce & telegeodynamics proposals|year=1998|publisher=21st Century Books|location=Breckenridge, Colo.|isbn=0-9636012-8-8[/tpl]

In 1898, Tesla demonstrated a radio-controlled boat—which he dubbed "teleautomaton"—to the public during an electrical exhibition at Madison Square Garden. The crowd that witnessed the demonstration made outrageous claims about the workings of the boat, such as magic, telepathy, and being piloted by a trained monkey hidden inside.Eger, Christopher (1 April 2007)  "The Robot Boat of Nikola Tesla: The Beginnings of the UUV and remote control weapons" Tesla tried to sell his idea to the U.S. military as a type of radio-controlled torpedo, but they showed little interest.[tpl]Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6aStP3Du5cgC&pg=PT50&lpg=PT50&dq=tesla+radio+controlled+torpedo&source=bl&ots=kCZEi3Sewl&sig=9BodsLXXdagl2_dqi9CRWt6clbw&hl=en&sa=X&ei=lKw2UPTaIIiK0QGrloDIDg&sqi=2&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=tesla%20radio%20controlled%20torpedo&f=false |title=P.

In 1900, Tesla was granted patents for a "system of transmitting electrical energy" and "an electrical transmitter." When Guglielmo Marconi made his famous first ever transatlantic radio transmission in 1901, Tesla quipped that it was done with 17 Tesla patents. This was the beginning of years of patent battles over radio with Tesla's patents being upheld in 1903, followed by a reverse decision in favor of Marconi in 1904. In 1943, a Supreme Court of the United States decision restored the prior patents of Tesla, Oliver Lodge, and John Stone.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=c92LQsxMxEUC&pg=PA3&lpg=PA3&dq=British+Court+tesla+radio&source=bl&ots=9enh3iv6Ri&sig=_cZbUxJcBpahYAzA9esD9bb_Tj0&hl=en#v=onepage&q=British%20Court%20tesla%20radio&f=false |title=Jean-Michel Redouté, Michiel Steyaert, EMC of Analog Integrated Circuits, page 3 |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=18 March 2013[/tpl] The court declared that their decision had no bearing on Marconi's claim as the first to achieve radio transmission, just that since Marconi's claim to certain patents were questionable, he could not claim infringement on those same patents[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=SdGaiV6iup0C&pg=PA3&lpg=PA3&dq=supreme+court+1943+radio+marconi&source=bl&ots=rKt8D5C3xg&sig=XuISBITcZzpFApoFE-IROq9qns0&hl=en#v=onepage&q=supreme%20court%201943%20radio%20marconi&f=false |title=Robert Sobot, Wireless Communication Electronics:Introduction to RF Circuits and Design Techniques, page 4 |publisher=Books.google.com |date=18 February 2012 |accessdate=18 March 2013[/tpl] (there are claims the high court was trying to nullify a World War I claim against the U.S. government by the Marconi Company via simply restoring Tesla's prior patent).

===Colorado Springs===

On 17 May 1899, Tesla moved to Colorado Springs, where he would have room for his high-voltage, high-frequency experiments; his lab was located near Foote Ave. and Kiowa St.According to the Tesla memorial marker in Memorial park on Pikes Peak Ave. He chose this location because the polyphase alternating current power distribution system had been introduced there and he had associates who were willing to give him all the power he needed without charging for it.Nikola Tesla On His Work With Alternating Currents and Their Application to Wireless Telegraphy, Telephony, and Transmission of Power, Leland I. Anderson, 21st Century Books, 2002, p. 109, ISBN 1-893817-01-6.  Upon his arrival, he told reporters that he was conducting wireless telegraphy experiments, transmitting signals from Pikes Peak to Paris.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl] The 1978 book "Colorado Springs Notes, 1899–1900" contains descriptions of Tesla's experiments.
On 15 June 1899, Tesla performed his first experiments at his Colorado Springs lab; he recorded his initial spark length at five inches long, but very thick and noisy.
Tesla investigated atmospheric electricity, observing lightning signals via his receivers. Tesla stated that he observed stationary waves during this time.Corum, K. L., J. F. Corum, "Nikola Tesla, Lightning Observations, and Stationary Waves." 1994. The great distances and the nature of what Tesla was detecting from lightning storms confirmed his belief that the earth had a resonant frequency.Marc Seifer, Wizard: The Life and Times of Nikola Tesla  - 1998 - page 217Some Tesla historians speculate that what Tesla was actually observing was an atmospheric phenomenon called the Schumann resonance where resonances occur in the waveguide formed by the space between the surface of the earth and the conductive ionosphere.(Margaret Cheney, Robert Uth, Jim Glenn, Tesla, Master of Lightning, page 168), (Jennifer Ouellette, LIGHTNING FLASHES ON ORIGIN OF SOLAR SYSTEM, Discovery News, 12 May 2012), (Corum, J. F., K.L. Corum, Nikola Tesla and the Diameter of the Earth: A Discussion of One of the Many Modes of Operation of the Wardenclyffe Tower, 1996, p. 13)
He produced artificial lightning (with discharges consisting of millions of volts and up to 135 feet long).Gillispie, Charles Coulston, "Dictionary of Scientific Biography;" Tesla, Nikola. Charles Scribner's Sons, New York. Thunder from the released energy was heard 15 miles away in Cripple Creek, Colorado. People walking along the street observed sparks jumping between their feet and the ground. Sparks sprang from water line taps when touched. Light bulbs within 100 feet of the lab glowed even when turned off. Horses in a livery stable bolted from their stalls after receiving shocks through their metal shoes. Butterflies were electrified, swirling in circles with blue halos of St. Elmo's fire around their wings.[tpl]harvnb|Childress|1993[/tpl]
While experimenting, Tesla inadvertently faulted a power station generator, causing a power outage. In August 1917, Tesla explained what had happened in The Electrical Experimenter: "As an example of what has been done with several hundred kilowatts of high frequency energy liberated, it was found that the dynamos in a power house six miles away were repeatedly burned out, due to the powerful high frequency currents set up in them, and which caused heavy sparks to jump thru the windings and destroy the insulation!"[tpl]Cite journal|last=SECOR|first=H.

At his lab, Tesla observed unusual signals from his receiver (which he interpreted as 1—2—3—4), which he later believed were extraterrestrial radio wave communications coming from Mars. The signals were substantially different from the signals that he had noted from the noise of storms and the earth.[tpl]cite web|first=http://www.teslasociety.com/mars.pdf|title=Nikola Tesla and the Planetary Radio Signals|url=http://www.teslasociety.com/mars.pdf|accessdate=9 September 2012[/tpl] Specifically, he later recalled that the signals appeared in groups of one, two, three, and four clicks together.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl] Tesla was highly criticized upon revealing his finding.

Research has suggested that Tesla may have had a misunderstanding of the new technology he was working with,[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl] or that the signals Tesla observed may have been from a non-terrestrial natural radio source, specifically, the Jovian plasma torus signals.[tpl]Cite book| last =Corum| first =Kenneth L.| coauthors =James F.

In 1899, John Jacob Astor IV invested $100,000 for Tesla to further develop and produce a new lighting system. Instead, Tesla used the money to fund his Colorado Springs experiments.[tpl]cite web|title=Tesla Timeline|url=http://www.teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla-timeline-1912-john-jacob-astor-dies|publisher=Tesla Universe|accessdate=10 September 2012[/tpl]

The Colorado experiments had prepared Tesla for the establishment of the trans-Atlantic wireless telecommunications facility known as Wardenclyffe near Shoreham, Long Island.[tpl]harvnb|Seifer|2001|p=542[/tpl] 

==Wardenclyffe years (1900–1917)==

In 1900, with US$150,000 (more than $3 million today; 51% from J. Pierpont Morgan), Tesla began planning the Wardenclyffe Tower facility.[tpl]Cite news|last=Broad|first=William J|title=A Battle to Preserve a Visionary's Bold Failure|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/05/science/05tesla.html |accessdate=20 May 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=4 May 2009[/tpl]
Tesla later approached Morgan to ask for more funds to build a more powerful transmitter. When asked where all the money had gone, Tesla responded by saying that he was affected by the Panic of 1901, which he (Morgan) had caused. Morgan was shocked by the reminder of his part in the stock market crash and by Tesla's breach of contract by asking for more funds. Tesla wrote another plea to Morgan, but it was also fruitless. Morgan still owed Tesla money on the original agreement, and Tesla had been facing foreclosure even before construction of the tower began.
In December 1901, Marconi successfully transmitted the letter S from England to Newfoundland, terminating Tesla's relationship with Morgan. Over the next 5 years, Tesla wrote over 50 letters to Morgan, pleading for and demanding additional funding to complete the construction of Wardenclyffe. Tesla continued his project for another nine months. The tower was raised to its full 187 feet. In July 1903, Tesla wrote to Morgan that in addition to wireless communication,
Wardenclyffe would be capable of wireless transmission of electric power. On 14 October 1904, Morgan finally replied through his secretary, stating, "It will be impossible for Morgan to do anything in the matter," after Tesla had written to Morgan when the financier was meeting with the Archbishop of Canterbury in an attempt to appeal to his Christian spirit.
In June 1902, Tesla's lab operations were moved to Wardenclyffe from Houston Street.
On his 50th birthday in 1906, Tesla demonstrated his [tpl]convert|200|hp|kW|abbr=off[/tpl] 16,000 rpm bladeless turbine. During 1910–1911 at the Waterside Power Station in New York, several of his bladeless turbine engines were tested at 100–5,000 hp.[tpl]cite web|title=Timeline|url=http://www.teslasociety.org/timeline.html|publisher=Tesla Memorial Society of NY|accessdate=3 July 2012[/tpl]
Tesla invented a steam-powered mechanical oscillator—Tesla's oscillator. While experimenting with mechanical oscillators at his Houston Street lab, Tesla allegedly generated a resonance of several buildings. As the speed grew, it is said that the machine oscillated at the resonance frequency of his own building and, belatedly realizing the danger, he was forced to use a sledge hammer to terminate the experiment, just as the police arrived.[tpl]harvnb|O'Neill|2007|pp=162–164[/tpl] In February 1912, an article—"Nikola Tesla, Dreamer" by Allan L. Benson—was published in World Today, in which an artist's illustration appears showing the entire earth cracking in half with the caption, "Tesla claims that in a few weeks he could set the earth's crust into such a state of vibration that it would rise and fall hundreds of feet and practically destroy civilization. A continuation of this process would, he says, eventually split the earth in two."
Before World War I (1914–1918), Tesla looked overseas for investors to fund his research. When the war started, Tesla lost the funding he was receiving from his patents in European countries.
During this time, Tesla was staying at Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, renting in an arrangement for deferred payments.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl] Eventually, the Wardenclyffe deed was turned over to George Boldt, proprietor of the Waldorf-Astoria, to pay a US$20,000 debt (about $400,000 today). In 1917, around the time that the Wardenclyffe Tower was demolished by Boldt to make the land a more viable real estate asset, Tesla received AIEE's highest honor, the Edison Medal.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2012[/tpl]
During World War I in the August 1917 edition of the magazine Electrical Experimenter Tesla put forward his views on how electricity could be used to locate submarines via using the reflection of an "electric ray" of "tremendous frequency," with the signal being viewed on a fluorescent screen (a system that has been noted to have a superficial resemblance to modern RADAR).Margaret Cheney, Robert Uth, Jim Glenn, Tesla, Master of Lightning, page 128-129 Tesla was incorrect in his assumption that high frequency radio waves would penetrate waterLewis Coe, Wireless Radio: A History, McFarland - 2006, page 154 but Émile Girardeau, who helped develop France's first RADAR system in the 1930s, noted in 1953 that Tesla's general speculation that a very strong high frequency signal would be needed was correct stating "(Tesla) was prophesying or dreaming, since he had at his disposal no means of carrying them out, but one must add that if he was dreaming, at least he was dreaming correctly."Margaret Cheney, Tesla: Man Out of Time, page 266Margaret Cheney, Robert Uth, Jim Glenn, Tesla, Master of Lightning, page 129

==Nobel Prize rumors==

On 6 November 1915, a Reuters news agency report from London had the 1915 Nobel Prize in Physics awarded to Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla; however, on 15 November, a Reuters story from Stockholm stated the prize that year was being awarded to Sir William Henry Bragg and William Lawrence Bragg "for their services in the analysis of crystal structure by means of X-rays."[tpl]cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1915|url=http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1915/|publisher=nobelprize.org|accessdate=29 July 2012[/tpl][tpl]harvnb|Cheney|2001|p=245[/tpl][tpl]harvnb|Cheney|Uth|Glenn|1999|p=120[/tpl] There were unsubstantiated rumors at the time that Tesla and/or Edison had refused the prize. The Nobel Foundation declined to comment on the rumors other than saying, "Any rumor that a person has not been given a Nobel Prize because he has made known his intention to refuse the reward is ridiculous," a recipient could only decline a Nobel Prize after he is announced a winner.
There have been subsequent claims by Tesla biographers that Edison and Tesla were the original recipients and that neither was given the award because of their animosity toward each other; that each sought to minimize the other's achievements and right to win the award; that both refused ever to accept the award if the other received it first; that both rejected any possibility of sharing it; and even that a wealthy Edison refused it to keep Tesla from getting the $20,000 prize money.[tpl]cite book |title=Nikola Tesla Research |last=Research |first=Health |publisher=|isbn=0-7873-0404-2 |page=9 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=N0gD7HxMfsUC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=28 November 2010 |date=September 1996[/tpl]
In the years after these rumors, neither Tesla nor Edison won the prize (although Edison did receive one of 38 possible bids in 1915 and Tesla did receive one bid out of 38 possible bids in 1937).[tpl]harvnb|Seifer|2001|pp=378–380[/tpl]

Starting in 1934, the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company began paying Tesla US$125 per month as well as paying his rent at the Hotel New Yorker, expenses the Company would pay for the rest of Tesla's life. Accounts on how this came about vary.

In 1934, Tesla wrote to Consul Janković of his homeland.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl] The letter contained a message of gratitude to Mihajlo Pupin who had initiated a donation scheme by which American companies could support Tesla.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl] Tesla refused the assistance, choosing instead to live on a modest pension received from Yugoslavia, and to continue his research.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl]
In 1935, in an annual birthday celebration interview, Tesla announced a method of transmitting mechanical energy with minimal loss over any terrestrial distance, a related new means of communication, and a method of accurately determining the location of underground mineral deposits.
In the fall of 1937, after midnight one night, Tesla left the Hotel New Yorker to make his regular commute to the cathedral and the library to feed the pigeons. While crossing a street a couple of blocks from the hotel, Tesla was unable to dodge a moving taxicab and was thrown heavily to the ground. Tesla's back was severely wrenched and three of his ribs were broken in the accident (the full extent of his injuries will never be known; Tesla refused to consult a doctor—an almost lifelong custom). Tesla didn't raise any question as to who was at fault and refused medical aid, only asking be taken to his hotel via cab. Tesla was bedridden for some months and was unable to continue feeding pigeons from his window; soon, they failed to come. In the spring of 1938, Tesla was able to get up. He at once resumed the pigeon-feeding walks on a much more limited scale, but frequently had a messenger act for him.

===Directed-energy weapon===

In 1937, at a luncheon in his honor concerning the death ray, Tesla stated, "But it is not an experiment ... I have built, demonstrated and used it. Only a little time will pass before I can give it to the world." His records indicate that the device is based on a narrow stream of small tungsten pellets that are accelerated via high voltage (by means akin to his magnifying transformer).
During the same year, Tesla wrote a treatise, The Art of Projecting Concentrated Non-dispersive Energy through the Natural Media,Tesla, Nikola, THE NEW ART OF PROJECTING CONCENTRATED NON-DISPERSIVE ENERGY THROUGH NATURAL MEDIA, System of Particle Acceleration for Use in National Defense, Circa 16 May 1935. concerning charged particle beam weapons.[tpl]harvnb|Seifer|2001|p=454[/tpl] Tesla published the document in an attempt to expound on the technical description of a "superweapon that would put an end to all war." This treatise is currently in the Nikola Tesla Museum archive in Belgrade. It describes an open-ended vacuum tube with a gas jet seal that allows particles to exit, a method of charging particles to millions of volts, and a method of creating and directing non-dispersive particle streams (through electrostatic repulsion). Tesla tried to interest the US War Department,"Aerial Defense 'Death-Beam' Offered to U.S. By Tesla" 12 July 1940 the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia in the device.[tpl]cite web|last=Seifer|first=Marc J.|title=Tesla's "death ray" machine|url=http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/tesla/esp_tesla_2.htm|accessdate=5 September 2012[/tpl]
During the period in which the negotiations were being carried on, Tesla claimed that efforts had been made to steal the invention. His room had been entered and his papers had been scrutinized, but the thieves, or spies, left empty-handed. He said that there was no danger that his invention could be stolen, for he had at no time committed any part of it to paper. The blueprint for the teleforce weapon was all in his mind.[tpl]cite news | last1= O'Neill |first1= John J. |url=http://www.pbs.org/tesla/res/res_art12.html |title=Tesla Tries To Prevent World War II (unpublished Chapter 34 of Prodigal Genius) |work=PBS [/tpl]

==Death==

On 7 January 1943, Tesla, 86, died alone in Room 3327 of the New Yorker Hotel. His corpse was later found by maid Alice Monaghan after she had entered Tesla's room, ignoring the "do not disturb" sign that Tesla had placed on his door two days prior to his death. Assistant medical examiner, H.W. Wembly, was called to the scene; after examining the body, he ruled that the cause of death had been coronary thrombosis, and that there had been no suspicious circumstances.[tpl]cite web|title=Tesla Timeline|url=http://www.teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla-timeline-1943-tesla-dies-at-86|publisher=Tesla Universe|accessdate=18 July 2012[/tpl]

A few days after Tesla's death, the information center of the Yugoslav royal government-in-exile released a statement, giving a short review of Tesla's achievements and the schedule for his memorial service and funeral.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl]
On 10 January 1943, New York City mayor Fiorello La Guardia read a eulogy written by Slovene-American author Louis Adamič live over the WNYC radio. Violin pieces "Ave Maria" and "Tamo daleko" were played in the background.
On 12 January, Tesla was given a state funeral at the Cathedral of Saint John the Divine, the largest Gothic cathedral in the world in New York City. 2,000 people attended. The funeral service was opened by Episcopal Bishop William T. Manning and concluded by Reverend Dushan J. Shukletovich, rector of the Serbian Orthodox Church of St. Sava. After the funeral, Tesla's corpse was taken to the Ferncliff Cemetery in Ardsley, New York, where it was later cremated.
On 13 January, a second service was conducted in Serbian by prominent priests of the Serbian Orthodox Cathedral of St. Sava in New York City.
In 1952, after constant pressure from Tesla's nephew, Sava Kosanović, arrangements were finally made; Tesla's entire estate (original papers, thousands of letters, photographs and most of Tesla's inventions including the remote-controlled boat, wireless fluorescent lamps, motors, turbines, etc.) was shipped to Belgrade. The estate was shipped in 80 trunks marked N.T.
In 1957, Ms. Charlotte Muzar, secretary and assistant to Tesla's nephew, the late Sava Kosanović, delivered Tesla's ashes from the United States to Belgrade. Tesla's ashes are currently kept in the third room of the Nikola Tesla Museum, in the gold-plated sphere on a marble pedestal.[tpl]cite web|title=Urn with Tesla's ashes|url=http://www.tesla-museum.org/meni_en/muzej/3.htm|publisher=Tesla Museum|accessdate=16 September 2012[/tpl]

==Patents==

Tesla obtained around 300 patents worldwide for his inventions.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.tesla-symp06.org/papers/Tesla-Symp06_Sarboh.pdf | title = Nikola Tesla's Patents | first = Snežana | last = Šarboh | date =  18–20 October 2006 | work = Sixth International Symposium Nikola Tesla | publisher = | location = Belgrade, Serbia | page = 6 | format = PDF | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071030134331/http://www.tesla-symp06.org/papers/Tesla-Symp06_Sarboh.pdf | archivedate = 30 October 2007 | accessdate =8 October 2010 | ref = sarbo[/tpl] Some of Tesla's patents are not accounted for, and various sources have discovered some that have lain hidden in patent archives. There are a minimum of 278 patents issued to Tesla in 26 countries that have been accounted for. Many of Tesla's patents were in the United States, Britain, and Canada, but many other patents were approved in countries around the globe.Cheney, 62 Many inventions developed by Tesla were not put into patent protection.

==Personal life==

Tesla worked every day from 9 a.m until 6 p.m. or later, with dinner from exactly 8.10 p.m., at Delmonico's restaurant and later the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. Tesla would telephone his dinner order to the headwaiter, who also could be the only one to serve him. "The meal was required to be ready at eight o'clock ... He dined alone, except on the rare occasions when he would give a dinner to a group to meet his social obligations. Tesla would then resume his work, often until 3 a.m."[tpl]harvnb|O'Neill|2007|pp=283, 286[/tpl]
For exercise, Tesla walked between 8 to 10 miles per day. He squished his toes one hundred times for each foot every night, claiming that it stimulated his brain cells.[tpl]harvnb|Seifer|2001|p=413[/tpl]
In an interview with newspaper editor Arthur Brisbane, Tesla said that he did not believe in telepathy, stating, "Suppose I made up my mind to murder you," he said, "In a second you would know it. Now, isn't that wonderful? By what process does the mind get at all this?" In the same interview, Tesla said that he believed that all fundamental laws could be reduced to one.[tpl]Cite news|last=Brisbane|first=Arthur|title=OUR FOREMOST ELECTRICIAN.|accessdate=5 September 2012|newspaper=The World|date=22 July 1894[/tpl]

Tesla spent over $2,000, including building a device that comfortably supported her so her bones could heal, to fix her broken wing and leg. Tesla stated,  "I have been feeding pigeons, thousands of them for years. But there was one, a beautiful bird, pure white with light grey tips on its wings; that one was different. It was a female. I had only to wish and call her and she would come flying to me. I loved that pigeon as a man loves a woman, and she loved me.

===Appearance===

Tesla was [tpl]height|precision=2|ft=6|in=2[/tpl] tall and weighed [tpl]convert|142|lb|kg[/tpl], with almost no weight variance from 1888 to about 1926.[tpl]harvnb|O'Neill|2007|p=292[/tpl] He was an elegant, stylish figure in New York City, meticulous in his grooming, clothing, and regimented in his daily activities.  "This was not because of personal vanity. Neatness and fastidiousness in clothes were entirely in harmony with every other phase of his personality. He did not maintain a large wardrobe and he wore no jewelry of any kind ... He observed, however, that in the matter of clothes the world takes a man at his own valuation, as expressed in his appearance, and frequently eases his way to his objective through small courtesies not extended to less prepossessing individuals."[tpl]harvnb|O'Neill|2007|p=289[/tpl] 
Although many of Tesla's progenitors were dark-eyed, his eyes were gray-blue. He claimed that his eyes were originally darker, but as a result of the exorbitant use of his brain, their hue changed. However, his mother and some of his cousins possessed gray eyes, so it can be inferred that the gray of his eyes was inherited.[tpl]harvnb|O'Neill|2007|p=327[/tpl]
Arthur Brisbane, a newspaper editor for the New York World, described Tesla's appearance: 

===Eidetic memory===

Tesla read many works, memorizing complete books, and supposedly possessed a photographic memory.[tpl]harvnb|Cheney|2001|p=33[/tpl] He was a polyglot, speaking eight languages: Serbo-Croatian, Czech, English, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, and Latin.[tpl]harvnb|O'Neill|2007|p=282[/tpl] Tesla related in his autobiography that he experienced detailed moments of inspiration. During his early life, Tesla was stricken with illness time and time again. He suffered a peculiar affliction in which blinding flashes of light would appear before his eyes, often accompanied by visions. Often, the visions were linked to a word or idea he might have come across; at other times they would provide the solution to a particular problem he had encountered. Just by hearing the name of an item, he would be able to envision it in realistic detail. Tesla would visualize an invention in his mind with extreme precision, including all dimensions, before moving to the construction stage, a technique sometimes known as picture thinking. He typically did not make drawings by hand but worked from memory. Beginning in his childhood, Tesla had frequent flashbacks to events that had happened previously in his life.

===Sleep habits===

Tesla claimed to never sleep more than two hours.[tpl]harvnb|O'Neill|2007|p=46[/tpl] However, Tesla did admit to "dozing" from time to time "to recharge his batteries."
During his second year of study at Graz, Tesla developed a passion for (and became very proficient at) billiards, chess and card-playing, sometimes spending more than 48 hours in a stretch at a gaming table.[tpl]harvnb|O'Neill|2007|p=43[/tpl][tpl]harvnb|O'Neill|2007|p=301[/tpl] On one occasion at his laboratory, Tesla worked for a period of 84 hours without sleep or rest.[tpl]harvnb|O'Neill|2007|p=208[/tpl]
Kenneth Swezey, a journalist whom Tesla had befriended, confirmed that Tesla rarely slept. Swezey recalled one morning when Tesla called him at 3 a.m.: "I was sleeping in my room like one dead ... Suddenly, the telephone ring awakened me ... Tesla spoke animatedly, with pauses, he ... worked out a problem, comparing one theory to another, commenting; and when he felt he had arrived at the solution, he suddenly closed the telephone."

===OCD===

Tesla probably suffered from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in his later years. He developed a hatred of jewelry and round objects, could not bear to touch hair, did not like to shake hands, and became obsessed with the number three—he often felt compelled to walk around a block three times before entering a building, and demanded 18 napkins (a number divisible by three) to polish his silver and glasses and plates until they were impeccable whenever he went dining. If he read one of an author's books, he felt compelled to read all of their books.[tpl]cite journal |last=Mast |first=Amy |title=America's forgotten innovator, Nikola Tesla |publisher=Florida State University |pages=14–15 |url=http://www.magnet.fsu.edu/mediacenter/publications/flux/vol1issue1/documents/magnetmilestones.pdf |format=PDF[/tpl]

===Relationships===

Tesla never married, claiming that his chastity was very helpful to his scientific abilities. However, toward the end of his life, he told a reporter, "Sometimes I feel that by not marrying, I made too great a sacrifice to my work ..." There have been numerous accounts of women vying for Tesla's affection, even some madly in love with him.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl] Tesla, though polite and soft-spoken, did not have any known relationships.

Robert Underwood Johnson described him as attaining a "distinguished sweetness, sincerity, modesty, refinement, generosity, and force."  His loyal secretary, Dorothy Skerrit, wrote: "his genial smile and nobility of bearing always denoted the gentlemanly characteristics that were so ingrained in his soul." Tesla's friend, Julian Hawthorne, wrote, "seldom did one meet a scientist or engineer who was also a poet, a philosopher, an appreciator of fine music, a linguist, and a connoisseur of food and drink."[tpl]Citation needed | date =August 2012[/tpl]

Tesla could be harsh at times, openly expressing disgust for overweight people, such as when he fired a secretary because of her weight.[tpl]harvnb|Cheney|2001|p=110[/tpl] He was quick to criticize clothing. On several occasions, Tesla directed a subordinate to go home and change her dress.
When Thomas Edison died in 1931, Tesla contributed the only negative opinion to the New York Times, buried in an extensive coverage of Edison's life:
[tpl]quote |He had no hobby, cared for no sort of amusement of any kind and lived in utter disregard of the most elementary rules of hygiene ... His method was inefficient in the extreme, for an immense ground had to be covered to get anything at all unless blind chance intervened and, at first, I was almost a sorry witness of his doings, knowing that just a little theory and calculation would have saved him 90 percent of the labor.

Tesla exhibited a pre-atomic understanding of physics in his writings;[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ZNqo1zaZRTYC&pg=PA181&lpg=PA181&dq=tesla+education+atomic+physics&source=bl&ots=ZJ_NJfpmSP&sig=pyuGct0TP-UXLdtmLPSrGqAnMt0&hl=en#v=onepage&q=tesla%20education%20atomic%20physics&f=false |title=Thomas Valone, Harnessing the Wheelwork of Nature: Tesla's Science of Energy, Adventures Unlimited Press, 2002, Page 181 |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=18 March 2013[/tpl] he disagreed with the theory of atoms being composed of smaller subatomic particles, stating there was no such thing as an electron creating an electric charge (he believed that if electrons existed at all they were some fourth state of matter or sub-atom that could only exist in an experimental vacuum and that they had nothing to do with electricity).[tpl]harvnb|O'Neill|2007|p=249[/tpl][tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=tCcDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA171&lpg=PA171&dq=tesla+believe+electron&source=bl&ots=XwEJcSlWTw&sig=jjOQ3wg9FqkIow7TA4fR4HDaVIg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=5J9TUJPNJYP20gHSyoCoBA&ved=0CEAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=tesla%20believe%20electron&f=false |title="The Profit of Science Looks Into The Future," Popular Science November 1928, page 171 |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=18 March 2013[/tpl] Tesla believed that atoms are immutable—they could not change state or be split in any way. He was a believer in the 19th century concept of an all pervasive "ether" that transmitted electrical energy.[tpl]harvnb|Seifer|2001|p=1745[/tpl]
Tesla was generally antagonistic towards theories about the conversion of matter into energy.[tpl]harvnb|O'Neill|2007|p=247[/tpl] He was also critical of Einstein's theory of relativity, saying:
Tesla claimed to have developed his own physical principle regarding matter and energy that he started working on in 1892 and in 1937, at age 81, claimed in a letter to have completed a "dynamic theory of gravity" that "would put an end to idle speculations and false conceptions, as that of curved space."[tpl]cite web|title=Nikola Tesla|url=http://www.famousscientists.org/nikola-tesla|publisher=FamousScientists.org|accessdate=15 December 2011[/tpl] He stated that the theory was "worked out in all details" and that he hoped to soon give it to the world.Prepared Statement by Nikola Tesla downloadable from www.tesla.hu Further elucidation of his theory was never found in his writings.[tpl]harvnb|Cheney|2001|p=309[/tpl]

===Societal views===

Tesla, like many of his era, became a proponent of an imposed selective breeding version of eugenics. His opinion stemmed from the belief that humans' "pity" had interfered with the natural "ruthless workings of nature," rather than from conceptions of a "master race" or inherent superiority of one person over another. His advocacy of it was, however, to push it further. In a 1937 interview, he stated:
[tpl]cquote |... man's new sense of pity began to interfere with the ruthless workings of nature. The only method compatible with our notions of civilization and the race is to prevent the breeding of the unfit by sterilization and the deliberate guidance of the mating instinct ... The trend of opinion among eugenists is that we must make marriage more difficult. Certainly no one who is not a desirable parent should be permitted to produce progeny. A century from now it will no more occur to a normal person to mate with a person eugenically unfit than to marry a habitual criminal.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/tesla/res/res_art11.html | title= A Machine to End War |date=February 1937 |publisher=Public Broadcasting Service |accessdate=23 November 2010[/tpl][/tpl]
In 1926, Tesla commented on the ills of the social subservience of women and the struggle of women toward gender equality, indicated that humanity's future would be run by "Queen Bees." He believed that women would become the dominant sex in the future.Kennedy, John B., "When woman is boss, An interview with Nikola Tesla." Colliers, 30 January 1926.
Tesla is widely considered by his biographers as a humanist regarding his worldview.[tpl]cite book | title=The Tesla Papers|year= 2000|publisher= Adventures Unlimited Press| isbn= 978-0-932813-86-2| page = 15 | editor-first =David Hatcher | last = Childress | quote =His idealism and humanism left him with little stomach for the world of industrial and financial intrigue.[/tpl][tpl]cite book | title = Innovation: The Lessons of Nikola Tesla|year=2008|publisher=Blue Eagle |isbn= 978-987-651-009-7| page= 43 | first1 = Peter | last1 = Belohlavek | first2 = John W | last2 = Wagner|quote=This was Tesla: a scientist, philosopher, humanist, and ethical man of the world in the truest sense.[/tpl][tpl]cite book |title=Empires of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, and the Race to Electrify the World|year= 2004 | publisher =Random House Digital |isbn=978-0-375-75884-3|page=154| first =Jill | last = Jonnes| accessdate= 4 April 2013 | quote =Tesla, just thirty-one, was as much a true humanist as ever, seeking to ease the hard labor of the whole world with his spectacular induction motor and alternating current system.[/tpl][tpl]cite book | title = Edison's Concrete Piano: Flying Tanks, Six-Nippled Sheep, Walk-On-Water Shoes, and 12 Other Flops From Great Inventors|year=2009|publisher= ECW Press|isbn= 978-1-55490-551-5| first = Judy | last = Wearing | quote =Tesla, the unselfish humanist he was, would roll over in his grave.[/tpl][tpl]cite book | title = Wizard: the life and times of Nikola Tesla: biography of a genius|year= 1996 | publisher =Citadel Press|isbn = 978-0-8065-1960-9 |page=506| first =Marc J | last = Seifer | quote= Frank Jenkins, "Nikola Tesla: The Man, Engineer, Inventor, Humanist and Innovator," in Nikola Tesla: Life and Work of a Genius (Belgrade: Yugoslav Society for the Promotion of Scientific Knowledge, 1976), pp. 10—21.[/tpl]
Tesla made predictions about the relevant issues of a post-World War I environment in a printed article, "Science and Discovery are the great Forces which will lead to the Consummation of the War" (20 December 1914).[tpl]cite web |last= Tesla|first=Nikola|title=Science and Discovery are the great Forces which will lead to the Consummation of the War|url=http://www.rastko.rs/rastko/delo/10832|publisher= Rastko|accessdate=17 July 2012[/tpl] Tesla believed that the League of Nations was not a remedy for the times and issues.[tpl]Citation needed | date=June 2012[/tpl]

===Religious views===

Tesla was raised as an Orthodox Christian. Later in his life, he did not consider himself to be a "believer in the orthodox sense," and opposed religious fanaticism.[tpl]cite web|title=A Machine to End War|url=http://www.pbs.org/tesla/res/res_art11.html|publisher=PBS.org|accessdate=27 July 2012|author=Nikola Tesla|coauthors=by Nikola Tesla as told to George Sylvester Viereck|date=February 1937[/tpl] He had a profound respect for both Buddhism and Christianity.
In his article, "The Problem of Increasing Human Energy," published in 1900, Tesla stated: [tpl]bquote|For ages this idea each of us is only part of a whole has been proclaimed in the consummately wise teachings of religion, probably not alone as a means of insuring peace and harmony among men, but as a deeply founded truth. The Buddhist expresses it in one way, the Christian in another, but both say the same: We are all one.[tpl]cite web|last=Tesla|first=Nikola|title=THE PROBLEM OF INCREASING HUMAN ENERGY|url=http://www.tfcbooks.com/tesla/1900-06-00.htm|publisher=Century Illustrated Magazine|accessdate=15 August 2012[/tpl][/tpl] However, his religious views remain uncertain due to other statements that he made.[tpl]Cite book|title=Alien Interview|year=2008|publisher=New York Herald Tribune|isbn=978-0-615-20460-4|author=Nikola Tesla|editor=Lawrence R. Spencer|accessdate=31 July 2012|page=303|date=11 September 1932|quote=It might as well be said that God has properties. He has not, but only attributes and these are of our own making.[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=Radio's 100 men of science: biographical narratives of pathfinders in electronics and television|year=1944|publisher=Harper & Brothers|pages=122–123|author=Orrin Elmer Dunlap|edition=2|quote=In one of his last interviews with this author, Tesla in his eighties still dreamed of power transmission by radio. ... "Religion is simply an ideal" remarked.  "It is an ideal force that tends to free the human being from material bonds. I do not believe that matter and energy are interchangeable, any more than are the body and soul. There is just so much matter in the universe and it cannot be destroyed. As I see life on this planet, there is no individuality. It may sound ridiculous to say so, but I believe each person is but a wave passing through space, ever-changing from minute to minute as it travels along, finally, some day, just becoming dissolved."[/tpl][tpl]Cite book|title=Nikola Tesla|publisher=FECHA|url=http://fecha.org/tesla.htm|accessdate=31 July 2012[/tpl] For example, in his article, "A Machine to End War", published in 1937, Tesla stated: [tpl]bquote|There is no conflict between the ideal of religion and the ideal of science, but science is opposed to theological dogmas because science is founded on fact. To me, the universe is simply a great machine which never came into being and never will end. The human being is no exception to the natural order. Man, like the universe, is a machine. Nothing enters our minds or determines our actions which is not directly or indirectly a response to stimuli beating upon our sense organs from without. Owing to the similarity of our construction and the sameness of our environment, we respond in like manner to similar stimuli, and from the concordance of our reactions, understanding is born. In the course of ages, mechanisms of infinite complexity are developed, but what we call "soul" or "spirit," is nothing more than the sum of the functionings of the body. When this functioning ceases, the "soul" or the "spirit" ceases likewise.[/tpl]

==Literary works==

==Legacy and honors==

Tesla's legacy has endured in books, films, radio, TV, music, live theater, comics and video games. The lack of recognition received during his own lifetime has cast him as a tragic and inspirational character, well suited to dramatic fiction. The impact of the technologies invented by Tesla is a recurring theme in several types of science fiction.
