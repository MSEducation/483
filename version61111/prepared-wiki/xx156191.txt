[[Sticky wicket]]

CATEGORIES: Cricket terminology, Metaphors referring to sport

Sticky wicket is a metaphor used to describe a difficult circumstance. It originated as a term for difficult circumstances in the sport of cricket, caused by a damp and soft pitch.

==Origins==

The phrase comes from the game of cricket. The pitch in cricket is also known as "the wicket" (According to the Laws of Cricket, this usage is incorrect, but it is in common usage and commonly understood by cricket followers). It can be affected by rain and the sun, causing the ball to bounce unpredictably: a pitch which had been wet would become increasingly difficult to bat on, as it dried out.
Such a pitch was referred to as a "sticky wicket" for a batsman because the ball's bounces are unpredictable. Such wickets are far less common in cricket since matches stopped being played on uncovered pitches.

==Examples of use==

An early example of the term can be seen in Bell's Life in London, July 1882: "The ground... was suffering from the effects of recent rain, and once more the Australians found themselves on a sticky wicket."[tpl]cite web |last=Martin |first=Gary |year=2007 |title= A sticky wicket |work= The Phrase Finder |accessdate=2007-06-04 |url= http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/334550.html[/tpl]
