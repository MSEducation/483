==Fictional character biographies==

These brothers ruled the galaxy a billion years ago before being banished by beings known as the Timeless Ones. The Demons Three have tried to return time and again, summoned by Felix Faust and others, their attempts always foiled by the Justice League. Abnegazar was slain by Doctor Fate in Swamp Thing #50, but is currently being resurrected by his brothers. They have also been seen in the company of Neron.
Anyone can summon the power of the Demons Three by possessing (and utilizing) three artifacts: the Green Bell of Uthool, the Silver Wheel of Nyorlath and the Red Jar of Calythos which were created by the brothers for this purpose and could not be destroyed or moved from Earth, meaning the Timeless Ones created magical guardians for them. If one releases the incense from the jar and then spins the wheel while the bell resounds, a series of events is set in motion which, one hundred years later, frees the demons; but for that century, the one who freed them could possess all their awesome power. In JLA #10 Faust is able to make the JLA recover the items, and later in JLA #11 while the JLA are time-travelling to capture the Lord of Time who has escaped to the future, they discover the demons a century later. They are imprisoned, but Green Lantern helps Wonder Woman escape, and she uses his ring to free the others. Green Lantern disguises the JLA as each other so the Demons will be fooled, they are able to capture them and imprison them once more.
The Demons three - with Abnegazar, after his rebirth, still just a big maggot - cooperated with Neron in an attempt to destroy the Justice League. While they were evidently less powerful than him, the Devil showed some veneration for their great age.
In the JLA/Avengers crossover, these objects are part of the twelve items of power sought by the heroes.
In Infinite Crisis, Abnegazar, Rath and Ghast became members of the Secret Society of Super Villains. They help Felix Faust kidnap Nightshade for Alexander Luthor in Day of Vengeance Infinite Crisis Special.
Ralph Dibny (Elongated Man) comes into possession of the Silver Wheel of Nyorlath in 52, Week 41, Day 3. Professor Achilles Milo apparently was experimenting on it from within the Haven Correction Facility. 
The Green Bell of Uthool and the Silver Wheel of Nyorlath recently appeared in Teen Titans #42, seen on the desk of Sebastian Faust, along with an open book showing a summoning spell with an illustration of the Demons Three. Faust also mentions that he lent the Red Jar of Calythos to Blue Devil.
In Teen Titans #83, the three prominently appear in the backup feature, plotting to use the souls of Traci 13, Black Alice, and Zachary Zatara to permanently escape from Hell.
