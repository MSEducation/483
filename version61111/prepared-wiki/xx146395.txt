Pamunkey Regional Library serves the counties of Goochland, Hanover, King and Queen, and King William, and the towns of Ashland and West Point in central Virginia. The service area is approximately [tpl]convert|1349|sqmi|km2[/tpl] with a population of about 128,000, of which approximately 68,000 are registered patrons of the Library. Average monthly circulation of materials is 75,000, among ten branch libraries and a bookmobile. There is no central or main branch. Administrative offices are located in the Hanover Branch.  Technical Services and Mobile Services (the Bookmobile and Delivery) are located at the Atlee Branch.
The library system is named after the Pamunkey River, a ninety-mile river that begins twenty miles (32Â km) north of Richmond, Virginia,  where it joins the North and South Anna rivers. The Pamunkey River goes on to divide Hanover and King William counties. It joins its sister river, the Mattaponi, near West Point, where they create the York River.
The Hanover Branch of the Pamunkey Regional Library opened its doors on October 22, 1942. It was one of eleven libraries donated to rural Virginia counties by Mr. David K. E. Bruce. Mr. Bruce also donated equipment and a book collection.  The library was built to resemble 18th-century architecture. The Hanover Branch also houses a Virginiana collection that includes local history and genealogy.
The King & Queen Branch of the Pamunkey Regional Library, was housed in the former Marriott School from 1994 to 2001. It moved into a new facility next to the school.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Counties/KingandQueen/049-5010_MarriottSchool_2007_NRfinal.pdf|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Marriott School |author=Bryan Clark Green | date=June 2006|publisher=Virginia Department of Historic Resources[/tpl]
