==Artist statement==

"These necklaces and brooches represent a recent departure. They are neither narrative nor conceptual jewelry. Instead, I want to make jewelry that is decorative and comfortably wearable. Beyond that, I want these articles to become the center of attention when they are worn, and thus to make their wearers feel exceptional".
