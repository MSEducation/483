[[Detroit Autorama]]

CATEGORIES: Auto shows

The Detroit Autorama is a large showcase of custom cars held each year at Cobo Hall in Detroit, Michigan, USA. It is put on by the Michigan Hot Rod Association and is held every year in March. The event was first held in 1953.

==History==

The Detroit Autorama started as a hot rod show that raised enough funds to build a dragstrip for the MHRA. The first Autorama was held at the University of Detroit Field House in January 1953 and around 1,500 people attended.
In 1954, the MHRA decided it needed a larger space, so they chose to hold the show at the Michigan State Fairgrounds. In 1955, the show moved again to the Detroit Artillery Armory, before moving back to the Fairgrounds in 1956. The first Autorama to be held at Cobo Hall was in 1961.

===Don Ridler===

In 1957, the MHRA hired Don Ridler as a promotions agent and publicist for the show. Ridler booked bands that were popular at the time to play at Autorama. Popular acts like Duane Eddy and The Big Bopper helped gain attendance at the show. Ridler died an untimely death in 1963. The Ridler Award was established in 1964 in his honor.

===The 1970s, 1980s and 1990s===

Autorama continued to expand in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In the 1970s, Autorama was the highest paying car show in the US, with $500 and the trophy going to the Ridler winners. Autorama in the 1970s had not only the feature cars such as the Monkeemobile and creations from Ed Roth and George Barris, but also bands, television personalities and Playboy Playmates.
Some of the bands to play Autorama include Bobby Rydell, Bo Diddley, Brownsville Station, Mitch Ryder, The Turtles, Chubby Checker, The Big Bopper, Alice Cooper and The Amboy Dukes with Ted Nugent.
Featured cars include most forms of the Batmobile, the Monkeemobile, Greased Lightning, General Lee, the Red Baron, ZZ Top's Eliminator, the A-Team van, the Munster Koach, the Hot Wheels Twin Mill, and more recently, Lightning McQueen and Mater from the movie Cars.
