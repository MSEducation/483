CATEGORIES: German record labels

Plastic City, a German record label located in Mannheim, releases since 1993 various artists and DJs in tech house f.ex. The Timewriter and Terry Lee Brown Junior, Marshall Jefferson, AWeX (f.ex Tom Wax), Steve Poindexter, Kriss Dior aka Bassface Sascha, David Alvarado, Andry Nalin (Nalin & Kane), Alexi Delano und G-Pal. Until 2003 it was owned by UCMG. For a short-term period Holophon adopted it and since 2004 „Plastic City“ belongs to Daredo.
Between 1995 and 2002 Plastic City was also located in London (Plastic City UK) and New York (Plastic city America) with several individual single releases and its own repertoire (tribe) of artists. In consequences of the September 11th, 2001 and the fact, that the New Yorker bureau was located in the neighbourhood of Ground Zero, label activities had been stopped. Also „Plastic City UK“ didn’t release any new albums for a short-term period. A lot of artists of this time from both sister labels are now releasing directly on the mother label in Germany.
The musical responsibility has firstly Alexander Hendorf (A&R). Afterwards appeared Babak Shayan (2001-2002). Since 2004 Joachim Keil assumes full responsibility for Plastic City, whereas since 2006 Alex Flatner is responsible for artists management. 
The most successful releases of Plastic City are Compilation series of Terry’s Café (1-12), Deep Train (1-6) as well as the albums of Terry Lee Brown Junior and The Timewriter. Since August 2008 there is a weekly radio show at the Sonica Radio station Ibiza with Gorge.

==The Label philosophy==

Plastic city a town, doesn’t made of stones and metal, but made up on the thoughts of their listeners. That, at least has been mentioned by Scientists in 2495 in „Scientists Report network“ (so written in English on a lot of covers since 1995  till today). Thereby, Plastic City has something mystical; it should be timeless but still keeps his flow. It is a town (built by thoughts), where the inhabitants and their positions are indeterminate, as new dimensions are developing constantly and changes are taking place.
The releases of Plastic City are divided in so called time ages  like “Reconstructed“ (1998 – 2002), „Maybe, Plastic City“ (2003-2006) and actually „Imagination of the shape“ (2006-today).
