[[Arequipa Region]]

CATEGORIES: Regions of Peru, Arequipa Region

Arequipa is a region in southwestern Peru. It is bordered by the Ica, Ayacucho, Apurímac and Cusco regions in the north, the Puno Region in the east, the Moquegua Region in the south and the Pacific Ocean in the west. Its capital, also called Arequipa, is Peru's second-largest city.

==Geography==

This region has a rough topography which is characterized by heavy layers of volcanic lava covering large areas of its inter-Andean sector. It has deep canyons such as the ones formed by the Ocoña and Majes rivers.  Plateaus range in height from medium, such as La Joya, and high-altitude ones such the Arrieros Pampa and those located in the zones of Chivay, Huambo and Pichucolla.  Volcanic cones are seen emerging above the plateaus and forming snowfalls, such as Misti, Chachani, Ampato, Mismi, Sulimana and Coropuna. In contrast with these heights, there are deep canyons, including Majes, Colca, Sihuas and Ocoña, where important aspects of the ecological evolution of this zone can be clearly observed.
Along the coast, small plateaus and dunes represent characteristics of the desert of Arequipa, such as the ones located in the Majes, Sihuas and La Joya plains, which are particularly beautiful and developed.
From a hydrographic point of view, the rivers draining its territory belong mainly to the Pacific watershed.  Some rivers belong to the Amazon hydrographic system. Some of the region's main rivers are: Ocoña, Yauca, Camaná and Quilca.  The starting point of the Amazon River is located in the Arequipa region [tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl].

==Points of interest==

There are numerous points of interest in the Arequipa region. The three coastal provinces, Caraveli, Camana and Islay all have popular beaches. Various ports can also be found along the coastline, the two most important being Mollendo and Matarani, both in the province of Islay.
The Colca Canyon, twice as deep as the Grand Canyon in the United States, is situated in the province of Caylloma. The Cotahuasi Canyon is in the La Union Province. Colca Valley provides incredible close-up views of majestic Andean condors soaring in their natural habitat. Cotahuasi, at [tpl]convert|3535|m[/tpl], is presently thought to be the deepest canyon in the world. Both canyons offer spectacular scenery and villages as yet unaffected by the modern world.
In the Castilla Province near Corire there is Toro Muerto with more than 3,000 petroglyphs. Further to the north near Andaguas lies the Valley of Volcanoes. Almost 100 cones of various sizes dominate the lava-hardened landscape.
