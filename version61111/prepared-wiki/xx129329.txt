==Biography==

Melvin Rhyne was born in Indianapolis in 1936 and started playing the piano shortly thereafter.  At 19 years old, Rhyne started playing piano with then-unknown tenor saxophonist Rahsaan Roland Kirk but quickly switched over to the instrument that would make him famous: the Hammond B3 organ.  Rhyne's piano skills translated to the organ fluently and before long he was backing famous blues players like B.B. King and T-Bone Walker.[tpl]cite web|last=Yanow |first=Scott |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/melvin-rhyne-p7414/biography |title=Melvin Rhyne - Music Biography, Credits and Discography |publisher=AllMusic |date=1936-10-12 |accessdate=2013-03-07[/tpl]  In 1959 he was asked to join fellow Indianapolis musician Wes Montgomery's newly formed trio.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bing.com/music/overview/search?q=Melvin+Rhyne&artistID=F61C0000-0600-11DB-89CA-0019B92A3933 |title=Melvin Rhyne |publisher=Bing |date=1936-10-12 |accessdate=2013-03-07[/tpl]
Rhyne then moved to Wisconsin and largely kept to himself for the next two decades.  In 1991, however, Rhyne returned to the jazz scene, playing on Herb Ellis' album Roll Call, Brian Lynch's At the Main Event, and his own comeback The Legend.  Rhyne continued to be prolific in the years to come, releasing eight more solo albums on the Criss Cross jazz label.[tpl]cite web|last=Profiles |first=Jazz |url=http://jazzprofiles.blogspot.com/2010/12/mel-rhyne-hammond-b-3-organist.html |title=Jazz Profiles: Mel Rhyne: 1937-2013 - R.I.P. the Archives |publisher=Jazzprofiles.blogspot.com |date=2010-12-04 |accessdate=2013-03-07[/tpl]  Rhyne also recorded with The Mark Ladley Trio for the 1992 release, Strictly Businesshttps://itunes.apple.com/us/album/strictly-business/id625160175 and the 1994 release, Evidence.http://www.allmusic.com/album/evidence-mw0000595850 Both landed in the Jazz Charts at CMJ New Music Report and The Gavin Report.
