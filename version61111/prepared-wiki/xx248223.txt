The Whittemores and Peterson established the Whittemore Peterson Institute in 2005. Research began in 2006 with the opening of a small laboratory and an office on the University of Nevada, Reno campus under the direction of Judy Mikovits. WPI registered as a 501(c)(3) public charity in 2006. The Institute opened a new facility in August 2010 in the University of Nevada's Center for Molecular Medicine. Daniel Peterson left the Whittemore Peterson Institute in 2010 because of concerns about the "singular pursuit of XMRV" that was conducted without his input. His name was added to the Science paper only after a reviewer's comment. Peterson was reported to be working with Jay Levy, one of the original discoverers of HIV, to try to determine whether XMRV was truly present in the same patients examined in the Science study.

==Organization and mission==

Annette Whittemore serves as president and Institute Administrator of the WPI. Vincent Lombardi, first author of the 2009 Science paper, was appointed as Research Director in March 2011.http://www.wpinstitute.org/news/docs/DirTransRes.pdf Lombardi, a biochemist,WPI: "Research Profiles" along with Harvey Whittemore, co-founded RedLabs USA, Inc., now Viral Immune Pathology Diagnostics (VIP Dx). Virologist Judy Mikovits was the previous research director. Her employment was terminated in October 2011. Jamie Deckoff-Jones, a doctor who says she has CFS and takes antiviral medications, was director of clinical services until she was fired in 2011. The Institute has stated that their research unit is composed of scientists from the National Cancer Institute, the National Institute of Aging, the La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology, and Kings College, UK. Jonathan Kerr (Kings College, London) resigned in 2011.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.wpinstitute.org/about/docs/WPI_About_the_Institute.pdf | title = ABOUT THE WHITTEMORE PETERSON INSTITUTE | format = PDF | accessdate = 10 January 2010 [/tpl]
The WPI's stated mission is to "bring discovery, knowledge, and effective treatments to patients with illnesses that are caused by acquired dysregulation of both the immune system and the nervous system, often resulting in life long disease and disability."[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.nih.gov/news/health/oct2009/nci-08.htm | title = Consortium of Researchers Discover Retroviral Link to Chronic Fatigue Syndrome | publisher = NIH News - National Institutes of Health - US Department of Health and Human Services | date = October 8, 2009 | accessdate  = 24 Feb 2010[/tpl] The Institute considers such diseases as CFS, fibromyalgia, atypical multiple sclerosis and autism to be "Neuro Immune Diseases" with an underlying infectious or environmental exposure etiology.WPI research statement However, there is currently no expert consensus on the etiology of these diseases and conditions.

==Funding and support==

Initial funding for the institute was provided by the Whittemores, who in 2004 committed $5 million, successfully lobbied the Nevada legislature for support and arranged an affiliation with their alma mater, the University of Nevada, Reno. The Nevada legislature agreed to provide $3 million,[ref]
