</ref> The entire project includes construction of two new academic buildings, the removal of Sawyer Library from its current location, and the construction of a new library at the rear of a renovated Stetson Hall (which served as the college library prior to Sawyer's construction). The academic buildings, temporarily named North Academic Building and South Academic building, were completed in fall of 2008. In the spring of 2009, South Academic Building was renamed Schapiro Hall in honor of former President [[Morton O. Schapiro]].  In the spring of 2010 the North Academic Building was renamed Hollander Hall.  Construction of the new Sawyer Library is scheduled to be completed in 2014, after which the old Sawyer Library will be razed.
After several years of planning, the college decided to group undergraduates starting with the Class of 2010 into four geographically coherent clusters, or "Neighborhoods".[ref]
