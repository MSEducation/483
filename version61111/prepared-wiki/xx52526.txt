In humans the main gluconeogenic precursors are lactate, glycerol (which is a part of the triacylglycerol molecule), alanine and glutamine. Altogether, they account for over 90% of the overall gluconeogenesis.[tpl]cite pmid|11213896[/tpl] Other glucogenic amino acid as well as all citric acid cycle intermediates, the latter through conversion to oxaloacetate, can also function as substrates for gluconeogenesis.  In ruminants, propionate is the principal gluconeogenic substrate.Beitz, D. C.  2004.  Carbohydrate metabolism. In:  Reese, W. O.  Dukes' physiology of domestic animals. 12th ed.  Cornell Univ.

Lactate is transported back to the liver where it is converted into pyruvate by the Cori cycle using the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase. Pyruvate, the first designated substrate of the gluconeogenic pathway, can then be used to generate glucose.[tpl]cite book |title=Principles of Biochemistry with a Human Focus |last=Garrett |first=Reginald H. |coauthors=Charles M. Grisham |year=2002 |publisher=Brooks/Cole, Thomson Learning |location=USA |isbn=0-03-097369-4 |pages=578, 585 [/tpl] Transamination or deamination of amino acids facilitates entering of their carbon skeleton into the cycle directly (as pyruvate or oxaloacetate), or indirectly via the citric acid cycle.
Whether even-chain fatty acids can be converted into glucose in animals has been a longstanding question in biochemistry.[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1093/bioinformatics/btn621 | author = Figueiredo, Luis F., Stefan Schuster, Christoph Kaleta, David A. Fell | title = Can sugars be produced from fatty acids? A test case for pathway analysis tools | journal = Bioinformatics | volume = 25 | issue = 1 | pages = 152–158 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19117076[/tpl] It is known that odd-chain fatty acids can be oxidized to yield propionyl CoA, a precursor for succinyl CoA, which can be converted to pyruvate and enter into gluconeogenesis. In plants, specifically seedlings, the glyoxylate cycle can be used to convert fatty acids (acetate) into the primary carbon source of the organism. The glyoxylate cycle produces four-carbon dicarboxylic acids that can enter gluconeogenesis.
In 1995, researchers identified the glyoxylate cycle in nematodes.[tpl]cite journal | doi =  10.1006/dbio.1995.1156 | author =  Liu, F., et al. | title = Bifunctional glyoxylate cycle protein of Caenorhabditis elegans: a developmentally regulated protein of intestine and muscle | journal = Developmental Biology | volume = 169 | issue =  2 | pages = 399–414 | year = 1995 | pmid =  7781887[/tpl] In addition, the glyoxylate enzymes malate synthase and isocitrate lyase have been found in animal tissues.[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1186/1745-6150-1-31 | author = Fyodor A Kondrashov, Eugene V Koonin, Igor G Morgunov, Tatiana V Finogenova, Marie N Kondrashova | title = Evolution of glyoxylate cycle enzymes in Metazoa: evidence of multiple horizontal transfer events and pseudogene formation | journal = Biology Direct | volume = 1 | pages = 31 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17059607 | pmc = 1630690[/tpl] Genes coding for malate synthase gene have been identified in other metazoans including arthropods, echinoderms, and even some vertebrates. Mammals found to possess these genes include monotremes (platypus) and marsupials (opossum) but not placental mammals. Genes for isocitrate lyase are found only in nematodes, in which, it is apparent, they originated in horizontal gene transfer from bacteria.
The existence of glyoxylate cycles in humans has not been established, and it is widely held that fatty acids cannot be converted to glucose in humans directly. However, carbon-14 has been shown to end up in glucose when it is supplied in fatty acids.[tpl]cite journal | author =  Weinman, E.O., et al. | title = Conversion of fatty acids to carbohydrate: application of isotopes to this problem and role of the Krebs cycle as a synthetic pathway | journal = Physiol. Rev. | volume = 37 | issue =  2 | pages = 252–72 | year = 1957 | pmid =  13441426[/tpl] Despite these findings, it is considered unlikely that the 2-carbon acetyl-CoA derived from the oxidation of fatty acids would produce a net yield of glucose via the citric acid cycle - however, acetyl-CoA can be converted into pyruvate and lactate through the ketogenic pathway.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bioline.org.br/request?np10002|author=Glew, Robert H|title=You Can Get There From Here: Acetone, Anionic Ketones and Even-Carbon Fatty Acids can Provide Substrates for Gluconeogenesis|accessdate=August 2013[/tpl] Put simply, acetic acid (in the form of acetyl-CoA) is used to partially produce glucose; acetyl groups can only form part of the glucose molecules (not the 5th carbon atom) and require extra substrates (such as pyruvate) in order to form the rest of the glucose molecule. But a roundabout pathway does lead from acetyl-coA to pyruvate, via acetoacetate, acetone, acetol and then either propylene glycol or methylglyoxal.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bioline.org.br/request?np10002|author=Glew, Robert H|title=You Can Get There From Here: Acetone, Anionic Ketones and Even-Carbon Fatty Acids can Provide Substrates for Gluconeogenesis|accessdate=August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Miller DN, Bazzano G | year = 1965 | title = Propanediol metabolism and its relation to lactic acid metabolism | journal = Ann NY Acad Sci | volume = 119 | pages = 957–973 | bibcode = 1965NYASA.119..957M | last2 = Bazzano | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1965.tb47455.x | pmid = 4285478 | issue = 3[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Ruddick JA | year = 1972 | title = Toxicology, metabolism, and biochemistry of 1,2-propanediol | journal = Toxicol App Pharmacol | volume = 21 | pages = 102–111 | doi = 10.1016/0041-008X(72)90032-4[/tpl]

==Location==

In mammals, gluconeogenesis is restricted to the liver,[tpl]cite book|last=Widmaier|first=Eric|title=Vander's Human Physiology|year=2006|publisher=McGraw Hill|isbn=0-07-282741-6|pages=96[/tpl] the kidney and possibly the intestine.[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1074/jbc.R400011200 | author = Mithieux, G., Rajas, F., Gautier-Stein, A. | title = A novel role for glucose 6-phosphatase in the small intestine in the control of glucose homeostasis.| journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 279 | issue = 43 | pages = 44231–44238 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15302872[/tpl] However these organs use somewhat different gluconeogenic precursors. The liver uses primarily lactate, alanine and glycerol while the kidney uses lactate, glutamine and glycerol.[tpl]cite doi|10.1111/j.1464-5491.2009.02894.x[/tpl] Propionate is the principal substrate for gluconeogenesis in the ruminant liver, and the ruminant liver may make increased use of gluconeogenic amino acids, e.g. alanine, when glucose demand is increased.Overton, T. R., J. K. Drackley, C. J. Ottemann-Abbamonte, A. D. Beaulieu, L. S. Emmert and J. H. Clark. 1999.  Substrate utilization for hepatic gluconeogenesis is altered by increased glucose demand in ruminants.  J. Anim. Sci. 77: 1940-1951.  The capacity of liver cells to use lactate for gluconeogenesis declines from the preruminant stage to the ruminant stage in calves and lambs.Donkin, S. S. and L. E. Armentano.  1995.  Insulin and glucagon regulation of gluconeogenesis in preruminating and ruminating bovine.  J. Anim. Sci. 73: 546-551.  In sheep kidney tissue, very high rates of gluconeogenesis from propionate have been observed.Sasaki, S., K. Ambo, M. Muramatsu and T. Tsuda.  1975.  Gluconeogenesis in the kidney-cortex slices of normal fed and starved sheep.  Tohoku J. Agr. Res. 26: 20-29.   The intestine uses mostly glutamine and glycerol.
In all species, the formation of oxaloacetate from pyruvate and TCA cycle intermediates is restricted to the mitochondrion, and the enzymes that convert Phosphoenolpyruvic acid (PEP) to glucose are found in the cytosol.[tpl]cite book |title= Fundamentals of Biochemistry |last= Voet |first= Donald |coauthors= Judith Voet, Charlotte Pratt |year= 2008 |publisher= John Wiley & Sons Inc |isbn=978-0-470-12930-2 |page=556[/tpl]  The location of the enzyme that links these two parts of gluconeogenesis by converting oxaloacetate to PEP, PEP carboxykinase, is variable by species: it can be found entirely within the mitochondria, entirely within the cytosol, or dispersed evenly between the two, as it is in humans.  Transport of PEP across the mitochondrial membrane is accomplished by dedicated transport proteins; however no such proteins exist for oxaloacetate.  Therefore, in species that lack intra-mitochondrial PEP carboxykinase, oxaloacetate must be converted into malate or aspartate, exported from the mitochondrion, and converted back into oxaloacetate in order to allow gluconeogenesis to continue.

==Pathway==

Gluconeogenesis is a pathway consisting of a series of eleven enzyme-catalyzed reactions. The pathway may begin in the mitochondria or cytoplasm, this being dependent on the substrate being used. Many of the reactions are the reversible steps found in glycolysis.
. This enzyme is stimulated by high levels of acetyl-CoA (produced in β-oxidation in the liver) and inhibited by high levels of ADP and glucose.

==Regulation==

While most steps in gluconeogenesis are the reverse of those found in glycolysis, three regulated and strongly exergonic reactions are replaced with more kinetically favorable reactions. Hexokinase/glucokinase, phosphofructokinase, and pyruvate kinase enzymes of glycolysis are replaced with glucose-6-phosphatase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, and PEP carboxykinase. This system of reciprocal control allow glycolysis and gluconeogenesis to inhibit each other and prevent the formation of a futile cycle.
The majority of the enzymes responsible for gluconeogenesis are found in the cytoplasm; the exceptions are mitochondrial pyruvate carboxylase and, in animals, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. The latter exists as an isozyme located in both the mitochondrion and the cytosol.Chakravarty, K., Cassuto, H., Resef, L., & Hanson, R.W. (2005) Factors that control the tissue-specific transcription of the gene for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase-C. Critical Reviews of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 40(3), 129-154.  The rate of gluconeogenesis is ultimately controlled by the action of a key enzyme, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, which is also regulated through signal transduction by cAMP and its phosphorylation.
Most factors that regulate the activity of the gluconeogenesis pathway do so by inhibiting the activity or expression of key enzymes. However, both acetyl CoA and citrate activate gluconeogenesis enzymes (pyruvate carboxylase and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, respectively). Due to the reciprocal control of the cycle, acetyl-CoA and citrate also have inhibitory roles in the activity of pyruvate kinase.
Global control of gluconeogenesis is mediated by glucagon (released when blood glucose is low); it triggers phosphorylation of enzymes and regulatory proteins by Protein Kinase A (a cyclic AMP regulated kinase) resulting in inhibition of glycolysis and stimulation of gluconeogenesis. Recent studies have shown that the absence of hepatic glucose production has no major effect on the control of fasting plasma glucose concentration. Compensatory induction of gluconeogenesis occurs in the kidneys and intestine, driven by glucagon, glucocorticoids, and acidosis.[tpl]cite journal | author = Mutel, E., Gautier-Stein, A., Abdul-Wahed, A., Amigó-Correig, M., Zitoun, C., Stefanutti, A., Houberdon, I., Tourette, J.A., Mithieux, G., Rajas, F. | title = Control of blood glucose in the absence of hepatic glucose production during prolonged fasting in mice: induction of renal and intestinal gluconeogenesis by glucagon| journal = Diabetes | volume = 60 | issue = 12 | pages = 3121–3131 | year = 2011 | doi = 10.2337/db11-0571 | pmid = 22013018 | pmc = 3219939[/tpl]
