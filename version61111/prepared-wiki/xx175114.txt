A Hydrogen tank (other names- cartridge or canister) is used for hydrogen storage.International hydrogen fuel and pressure vessel forum 2010R&D of large stationary hydrogen/CNG/HCNG storage vesselsCNG & Hydrogen tank safety, R&D, and testing The first type IV hydrogen tanks for compressed hydrogen at 700 Bar (10,000 PSI) were demonstrated in 2001, the first fuel cell vehicles on the road with type IV tanks are the Toyota FCHV, Mercedes-Benz F-Cell and the HydroGen4.

Various applications has allowed the development of different H2 storage scenario.
Recently, the Hy-CanHycan consortium has introduced a small one liter, 10 bar format

Using MagnesiumCNRS Institut Neel H2 Storage for hydrogen storage, a safe but weighty reversible storage technology. Typically the pressure requirement are limited to 10 bar.
The charging process generates heat whereas the discharge process will require some heat to release the H2 contained in the storage material. To activate those type of hydrides, you need to reach at least 300Â°C.
