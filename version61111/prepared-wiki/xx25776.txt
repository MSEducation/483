Eileen Chang (September 30, 1920 – September 8, 1995), also known as Zhang Ailing or Chang Ai-ling, was one of the most influential modern Chinese writers.[tpl]Cite news |title=Eileen Chang, 74, Chinese Writer Revered Outside the Mainland |url = http://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/13/obituaries/eileen-chang-74-chinese-writer-revered-outside-the-mainland.html |newspaper=New York Times |date=September 13, 1995 |accessdate=6 September 2013[/tpl] Her most famous works include Lust, Caution and Love in a Fallen City.
Chang is noted for her fiction writings that deal with the tensions between men and women in love, and are considered by some scholars to be among the best Chinese literature of the period. Chang's portrayal of life in 1940s Shanghai and Japanese-occupied Hong Kong is remarkable in its focus on everyday life and the absence of the political subtext which characterised many other writers of the period. The Taiwanese author Yuan Qiongqiong drew inspiration from Eileen Chang. The poet and University of Southern California professor Dominic Cheung commented "had it not been for the political division between the Nationalist and Communist Chinese, she would have almost certainly won a Nobel Prize".
Chang's enormous popularity and famed image were in distinct contrast to her personal life, which was marred by disappointment, tragedy, increasing reclusiveness, and ultimately her sudden death from cardiovascular disease at age 74.

==Biography==

===Childhood and youth===

Chang was born Zhang Ying ([tpl]lang|zh-hans|張煐[/tpl]) in Shanghai, China. She was the daughter of Zhang Zhiyi ([tpl]lang|zh-hans|張志沂[/tpl]) (1896–1953) and Huang Suqiong ([tpl]lang|zh-hans|黃素瓊[/tpl]) (1893–1957). Chang's paternal grandfather, Zhang Peilun ([tpl]lang|zh-hans|張佩綸[/tpl]), was son-in-law to Li Hongzhang, an influential court official during the Qing Dynasty, who married Chang's paternal grandmother, Li Juyu ([tpl]lang|zh-hans|李菊耦[/tpl]) (1866–1916). Her maternal grandfather, Huang Yisheng ([tpl]lang|zh-hans|黃翼升[/tpl]), was a prominent naval commander. Her childhood had also been shared with paternal aunt Zhang Maoyuan ([tpl]lang|zh-hans|張茂淵[/tpl]) (1898–1991).
In 1922, when Chang was two years old, the family relocated to Tianjin, but in 1923, her mother left for the United Kingdom after her father took in a concubine and later became addicted to opium. Their marriage had been arranged, and despite having bound feet, Chang's mother managed to ski in the Swiss Alps.According to the introduction chapter in the novella Lust, Caution. She returned in 1927, as her husband had promised to end the turmoil with drug usage and his personal affairs, and the family settled back to Shanghai in 1928. Her parents divorced in 1930, and she and her younger brother Zhang Zijing ([tpl]lang|zh-hans|張子靜[/tpl]) (1921–1997) were raised by their father.
Upon graduation from high school, Chang had a fight with her stepmother and father. Eventually, she contracted dysentery. Instead of receiving treatment, her father beat her and forced her to stay in her bedroom for six months. Chang ran away to live with her mother shortly after her 18th birthday, where they remained in a new apartment for nearly two years, until she began to attend university and briefly lived in Hong Kong.[tpl]cite book |title=Biographical dictionary of Chinese women, Volume 2 |last=Wiles |first= Sue|authorlink= |coauthors=Lee, Stefanowska, Ho |year= 2006|publisher=University of California Press|location= |isbn= 0-520-24449-4|pages= 274|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=XOGdnCPJSOMC[/tpl]

===Education===

Chang started school at age 4. Besides her native Chinese, Chang studied and professed a high ability in English. Although she says her family was not religious, she attended an all-female Christian high school, St. Mary's Hall, Shanghai, where she graduated in 1937.[tpl]zh icon[/tpl] "张爱玲母校只剩“断壁残垣”居民要求保护(图)". xinmin.cn.

In 1939, Chang was to attend the University of London on a full scholarship, but never did due to the ongoing Second Sino-Japanese War. Instead, she studied English Literature at the University of Hong Kong, where she met her lifelong friend, Fatima Mohideen ([tpl]lang|zh-hans|炎櫻[/tpl]) (died 1995). When Chang was one semester short of earning her degree, Hong Kong fell to the Empire of Japan in December 1941 and Chang made the decision to return to China. Her original plan was to finish her bachelor's degree at Saint John's University, but she chose to drop out after several weeks due to financial issues."Eileen Chang’s biography". Shenzhen Daily.

===Early work===

At the age of 10, Chang's mother renamed her Ailing, a transliteration of Eileen, in preparation for her entrance into an English school. While in high school, Chang read Dream of the Red Chamber, one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature, which would influence her work throughout her career. Chang already displayed great literary talent and her writings were published in the school magazine. The following year, she wrote her debut short novel at the age of 12.[tpl]cite book |title=Love in a Fallen City (New York Review Books Classics) |last=Chang |first= Eileen|authorlink= |coauthors=Kingsbury, Karen |year= 2007|publisher=New York Review Books Classics|location= |isbn= 1-59017-178-0|pages= 320|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=49gDP2Hwc6sC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl]
In 1943, Chang was introduced to the prominent editor Zhou Shoujuan ([tpl]lang|zh-hans|周瘦鵑[/tpl]), and gave him a few pieces of her writing. With Zhou's backing, Chang soon became the most popular new writer in Shanghai. Within the next two years, she wrote some of her most acclaimed works, including Qing Cheng Zhi Lian ([tpl]lang|zh-hans|傾城之戀[/tpl]) and Jin Suo Ji ([tpl]lang|zh-hans|金鎖記[/tpl]).

Despite Hu being labelled a traitor for collaborating with the Japanese during the ongoing World War II, Chang continued to remain loyal to Hu. Shortly thereafter, Hu chose to move to Wuhan to work for a newspaper. While staying at a local hospital, he seduced a 17-year-old nurse, Zhou Xunde ([tpl]lang|zh-hans|周訓德[/tpl]), who soon moved in with him.
