The United Nations Development Group (UNDG) is a consortium from the result of UN reform, created by the Secretary-General of the United Nations in 1997, to improve the effectiveness of UN development activities at the country level.
Its strategic priorities are to respond to the Triennial comprehensive policy review (TCPR) - which became in 2008 the Quadrennial comprehensive policy review (QCPR) - and global development priorities, as well as to ensure the UN development system becomes more internally focused and coherent. The UNDG strategic priorities give direction to UNDG members efforts at the global, regional and country level to facilitate a step change in the quality and impact of UN support at the country level.UNDG Strategic Priorities The QCPR of the operational system of the United Nations is a process and a United Nations General Assembly resolution by which the members of the United Nations General Assembly review the coherence effectiveness and funding of UN development programmes, funds, and specialised agencies of the UN operational system for development.

==History==

By 1997, there were calls within the United Nations to draw all UN agencies working on development issues together; for the many UN Development Programmes, Funds, and Specialised Agencies were encroaching upon each other's activities. An initial proposal was to merge the UNICEF, the World Food Programme and the UNFPA into the UNDP. Finally, then Secretary General Kofi Annan worked to form the UNDG and won praise from then UNDP Administrator James Speth.
