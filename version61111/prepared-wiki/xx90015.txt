[[Memory augmentation]]

CATEGORIES: Memory processes

Memory augmentation is the process by which one's ability to retain information is increased. The retrieval of memory has been proven to be faulty in the human brain—it is partially inaccurate and not totally reliable (see more: Recovered memory.) A study conducted by students of the Information Science Department in Nara, Japan sought to measure how able memory is to augment. They used a computer system, the "Ubiquitous Memories," to demonstrate if the technology aided to augmentation better than other methods: notes with a pen and paper, portraits used in a previous trial experiment, and just plain human memory. The results were that the Ubiquitous Memories aided in retrieving memory, and made less mistakes than the other methods.[tpl]cite journal|last=Kawamura|first=Tatsuyuki|coauthors=Tomohiro Fukuhara, Hideaki Takeda, Yasuyuki Kono, Masatsugu Kidode|title=Ubiquitous Memories: a memory externalization system using physical objects|journal=Personal and Ubiquitous Computing|date=15 August 2006|volume= 11|series=Series 4|pages=287–298[/tpl]
