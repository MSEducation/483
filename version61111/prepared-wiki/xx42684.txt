3-D Tic-Tac-Toe is a video game released by Atari, Inc for the Atari 2600 console and Atari 8-bit computers in 1980.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2009[/tpl]

==Description==

The game is similar to the traditional game of tic-tac-toe, but is played on four 4×4 grids stacked vertically; it is basically a computerized version of the board game Qubic using traditional tic-tac-toe notation and layout. To win, a player must place four of their symbols on four squares that line up vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, on a single grid, or spaced evenly over all four grids. This creates a total of 76 possible ways to win, in comparison to eight possible ways to win on a standard 3×3 board. The game has nine variations: it can be played by two players against each other, or one player can play against a built-in AI on one of eight different difficulty settings. The game uses the standard joystick controller.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2009[/tpl]
3-D Tic-Tac-Toe was written by Carol Shaw, who went on to greater fame as the creator of Activision's River Raid.http://www.atariage.com/programmer_page.html?ProgrammerID=80
