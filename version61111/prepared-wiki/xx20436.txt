==Ecology==

Pseudotsuga macrocarpa, has several features to tolerate and survive wildfire, notably the very thick bark, and the presence of numerous adventitious buds on the upper side of the branches; this enables the trees to survive even crown fires which burn off all the branchlets, the apparently dead trees becoming green again the following spring. Wildfire frequencies in the chaparral habitats in which it often grows typically range from 15-50 year intervals. Bigcone Douglas-fir is closely associated with canyon live oak (Quercus chrysolepis) and often establishes itself in its shade; after about 50 years, it emerges above the oak canopy.
The number of plant associates in Bigcone Douglas-fir communities is usually small. Common overstory associates include Bigleaf Maple (Acer macrophyllum), California Bay Laurel (Umbellularia californica), Gray Pine (Pinus sabineana), and White Alder (Alnus rhombifolia). Shrub associates include Bigpod Ceanothus (Ceanothus megacarpus), Red shank (Adenostoma sparsifolium), Eastwood Manzanita (Arctostaphylos glandulosa), Toyon (Heteromoles arbutifolia), several species of sage (Salvia), and Coastal sae scrub oak (Quercus dumosa).
Ground cover is usually sparse and may include California buckwheat (Eriogonum fasciculatum), wild onion (Allium spp.), Scarlet beardtongue (Penstemon ternatus), Giant chain fern (Woodwardia fimbriata), and Western bracken (Pteridium aquilinum var. pubescens).
Pseudotsuga macrocarpa populations are suspected to be declining due to possibly larger and more extreme wildland fires with greater frequencies.  Major wildfires within its range, since 2003, have clearly proven a reduced extent when compared to early 1930's extents derived from historical aerial photos.  Although historical information has provided the opportunity to detect stand level patch changes, post-fire resprouting of older more mature trees and natural regeneration and recruitment of the species into higher canopy has yet to be adequately quantified.  One tree species in direct competition with Bigcone is Calocedrus decurrens, with preliminary post-fire regeneration of this species exponentially greater than Bigcone. After 1 or 2 years after the Station fire in 2009 on the Angeles National Forest, there was an estimated 20:1 cedar:bigcone seedling density in fixed radius plots on Mount Wilson.  It may be more appropriate to perform population stability estimates up to 5 yrs or much later (ie. 20 yrs) after a large conflagration due to the potential for immediate and delayed post-fire sprouting and regeneration and interplant competition, as well as the well-noted strategy of seed germination in shrub understories, which is likely to escape detection by surveyors until much later in its life. Research related to the role of mychorizae and its relationship to seed establishment needs evaluated in these vegetation communities due to the suspected role it has with the relationship with water, especially in water-limited systems such as those in the wildlands of southern California.  In addition, an aggressive seed cone collection strategy should be drafted for this species which includes extensive collection during large cone production years such as 2013, and should include a tracking system to determine correlations to climatic conditions in order to develop a foundation from which to perform species viability assessments w/ varying future climate scenarios.  This tree is being considered for more extensive plantings in semiarid locales. Its favorable qualities include resistance to drought, fire, insects, decay, and damage from ozone, and its aggressive rooting system and tolerance to variable growing medium. The needles of older trees sometimes fade to yellow, drop, and trees appear dead only to sprout with renewed vigor within 2 years. The reason is unknown, although drought or insects may be possible causes.

==Uses==

There is no current commercial market for Bigcone Douglas-fir wood due to limited distribution and access. It is heavy, hard, and fine grained but not durable. There is less sapwood than heartwood, and the latter contains pockets of resin. In the past, the wood was used locally for fuel and lumber. Bigcone Douglas-fir stands provide habitat for Black-tailed Deer, Black Bear, and various small animals. These trees provide preferred spring habitat for Black Bear in the San Bernardino Mountains. The seeds are eaten by various rodents and birds. Bigcone Douglas-fir is used for watershed restoration. The Los Angeles County Department of Forestry has extensively planted the tree over a 50-year period for that purpose. Some Bigcone Douglas-fir - Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) hybrids show promise for outplanting on drier sites in the Douglas-fir region. These hybrids produce wood of comparable quality to that of Douglas-fir and have the drought tolerance of Bigcone Douglas-fir.
