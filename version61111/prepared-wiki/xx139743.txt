Oakley railway station was built by the Midland Railway in 1857 on its extension from Leicester to Bedford and Hitchin.
It was closed to passengers in 1958 and closed completely in 1963. The station buildings remain in a dilapidated state though the goods yard is used by a haulage company.
About a mile (2 km) north of the station is the point where the Midland installed its first troughs to allow locomotives to pick up water. The river valley here is very flat, and the line crosses it seven times in the space of about [tpl]convert|7|mi[/tpl]. The line is elevated because of problems with flooding. Even the local roads have raised walkways.Radford, B., (1983) Midland Line Memories: a Pictorial History of the Midland Railway Main Line Between London (St Pancras) & Derby London: Bloomsbury Books
