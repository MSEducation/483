In the first round of this knockout tournament, aggregate goals over two matches determined the winners; the Conference Championships were one match each, with the winner of each conference advancing to MLS Cup.  In all rounds, the tie-breaking method was two 15-minute periods of extra time, followed by penalty kicks if necessary.  The away goals rule was not used.
