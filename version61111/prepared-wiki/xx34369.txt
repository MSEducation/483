news.admin.net-abuse.email (sometimes abbreviated nanae or n.a.n-a.e, and often incorrectly spelled with a hyphen in "email") is a Usenet newsgroup devoted to discussion of the abuse of email systems, specifically through spam and similar attacks. According to a timeline compiled by Keith Lynch,[tpl]Cite web | last=Lynch | first=Keith | title=Keith Lynch's timeline of spam related terms and concepts | url=http://keithlynch.net/spamline.html[/tpl] news.admin.net-abuse.email was the first widely available electronic forum for discussing spam.
Steve Linford, the founder of The Spamhaus Project, sometimes posts in the newsgroup.
