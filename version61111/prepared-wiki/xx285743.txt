The Haraguchi Rice Mill, on Ohiki Rd. in Hanalei, Hawaii, on Kauai, is one of five former rice mills in Hanalei Valley.  It was built in 1930 and was a corrugated iron structure on a concrete pad.  It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[tpl]cite web|url=http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NRHP/Text/83000252.pdf |title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Haraguchi Rice Mill |author=Karol M.

It was listed on the National Register in 1983;  the listing included one contributing structure and four contributing objects.  The listing was shortly after 1982 Hurricane Iwa had collapsed the rice mill structure.  Heavy machinery including an engine were not significantly harmed, however, and it was then thought that the structure could be restored.
