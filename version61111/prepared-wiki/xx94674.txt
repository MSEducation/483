Four of the Saanich first nations, Tsartlip, Pauquachin, Tseycum and Tsawout, created the ȽÁU,WELṈEW̱ Tribal School in 1989. It holds classes from preschool to grade 9, where SENĆOŦEN, the W̱SÁNEĆ language and W̱SÁNEĆ culture are taught along with the provincial curriculum. The school is also a venue for community events.[tpl]cite web|title=ȽÁU,WELṈEW̱ Tribal School|url=http://www.fpcf.ca/SILS2005/tschool.htm|accessdate=17 April 2012[/tpl]
