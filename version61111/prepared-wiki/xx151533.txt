Hamilton Pierce "Mac" McWhorter (born June 17, 1950) is a former offensive line coach for the Penn State Nittany Lions and was the interim head coach for Georgia Tech's football team in 2001 Georgia Tech Football History Database after George O'Leary resigned and only coached for one game, the 2001 Seattle Bowl against No. 11-ranked Stanford. Tech won, 24 to 14,2001-2002 Bowl Games technically giving McWhorter the highest win percentage of any Georgia Tech football coach.

After spending 2011 out of football following his retirement at Texas, Penn State's new football coach Bill O'Brien convinced McWhorter to join the staff at Penn State, following the death of Joe Paterno. McWhorter, who one sportswriter described as O'Brien's "biggest get" onto the coaching staff at Penn State, despite his enjoyment of retirement and attending football games as a fan of the Georgia Bulldogs, agreed, and moved to the northeast for the first time in his life.  His tenure at Penn State was not expected to last particularly long for a variety of reasons including parents in worsening health and grandchildren, but while at Penn State, he was beloved among his players, including offensive guard Miles Dieffenbach, who commented, [tpl]quote|"We love him a lot ... He loves to have a good time. He's a funny guy. I don't know how old he is, but he's out there like he's 25 years old."[/tpl] McWhorter noted that he loved coaching at Penn State, but had no timetable for how long he would coach. McWhorter retired following the 2013 season once again after not being retained by James Franklin.[tpl]cite news|last=Gross|first=Mike|title=Offensive line coach McWhorter is O'Brien's biggest ' get' at Penn State|url=http://lancasteronline.com/article/local/908051_Offensive-line-coach-McWhorter-is-O-Brien-s-biggest--get--at-Penn-State.html|accessdate=October 20, 2013|newspaper=Lancaster Newspapers|date=October 20, 2013[/tpl]
