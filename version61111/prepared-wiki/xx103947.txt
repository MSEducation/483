==Career==

===United Kingdom===

Neville was a West End idol of the 1950s, hailed as "one of the most potent classical actors of the Burton-O'Toole generation".Jeremy Lewis, "A Real Class Act", Nottingham Evening Post, 5 March 1999 A leading member of London's Old Vic Company, he played many classical leading roles, including Romeo in Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet (a role he repeated on American television for the anthology series Producers' Showcase), and an acclaimed Richard in Richard II, with Virginia McKenna as Queen Anne. He also alternated with Richard Burton the parts of Othello and Iago in Othello.Obituary for Neville in the Daily Telegraph, 21 November 2011 He was a frequent visiting player at the Bristol Old Vic. He received good reviews in the musical adaptation of Lolita, called Lolita, My Love, which closed in Boston en route to Broadway.
Noted for his classical good looks and mellifluous voice, the young Neville was frequently described as the young John Gielgud's natural successor. For a while, he took over the leading role of Nestor Le Fripé from Keith Michell in the original West End production of the musical Irma La Douce, playing opposite Elizabeth Seal as Irma. For a brief period in 1963, he returned to the London stage, playing Alfie in the stage version of the play by Bill Naughton, but by then his theatrical commitment lay outside London.
In 1961, his weekly pay declining from £200 to £50, he joined the Nottingham Playhouse, becoming joint artistic director with Frank Dunlop and Peter Ustinov when the current building in Nottingham opened in 1963. It became one of Britain's leading provincial repertory theatres. Though Dunlop and Ustinov soon left, Neville remained at the theatre until 1967. He resigned over funding disputes with the local authority and the Arts Council.Michael Coveney John Neville obituary in The Guardian, 21 November 2011

He later took similar positions with the Neptune Theatre in Halifax, Nova Scotia (1978–83) and other Canadian theatre companies, including as artistic director of the Stratford Festival of Canada from 1985–89, as well as continuing his acting career. On top of his artistic decisions, Neville distinguished himself such as when he helped eliminate the Neptune's deficit with canny promotions such as giving free tickets to the local taxi drivers and their families, correctly anticipating the recipients to enthusiastically discuss the theatre to passengers and tourists.[tpl]cite news|last=O'Reilly|first=Terry|title=Loss Leaders: How Companies Profit By Losing Money|url=http://www.cbc.ca/undertheinfluence/season-2/2013/04/20/loss-leaders-how-companies-profit-by-losing-money-1/|accessdate=20 April 2013|newspaper=CBC Radio: Under the Influence|date=20 April 2013[/tpl]
