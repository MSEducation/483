Caroline Records started as a subsidiary of Richard Branson's Virgin Records label during the early to mid-1970s. The label originally specialized in putting out budget-price LPs by mainly progressive rock and jazz artists that were generally not considered to have a great deal of 'mainstream' or commercial appeal, but were often however creatively of great interest.
The first release was Outside the Dream Syndicate by Tony Conrad and Faust in 1973. The original logo was a photographic-style variation on that of the Virgin label's "Twins" logo designed by Roger Dean.
Both the US and UK branches of Caroline Records are subsidiaries of Caroline Music, which includes Caroline Distribution and is in turn owned by Universal Music Group. Caroline has or had a number of subsidiary labels including Astralwerks, Gyroscope, Caroline Blue Plate, Rocks the World, Scamp, and Passenger.
On February 20, 2014, it was revealed that American rapper 50 Cent had signed to the label, and would release his next album on it on June 3, 2014.http://allhiphop.com/2014/02/20/50-cent-leaves-interscope-records-new-album-coming-june-3rd/
