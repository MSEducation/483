The average life expectancy is 30 years from onset, which is 5 to 10 years lower than that of unaffected people. Almost 40% of people with MS reach the seventh decade of life. Nevertheless, two-thirds of the deaths are directly related to the consequences of the disease. Suicide is more common, while infections and other complications are especially dangerous for the more disabled. Although most people lose the ability to walk before death, 90% are capable of independent walking at 10 years from onset, and 75% at 15 years.[tpl]cite journal|author=Myhr KM, Riise T, Vedeler C, et al|title=Disability and prognosis in multiple sclerosis: demographic and clinical variables important for the ability to walk and awarding of disability pension|journal=Mult.

==Epidemiology==

The number of people with MS, as of 2010, is 2–2.5 million (approximately 30 per 100,000) globally, with rates varying widely in different regions.[tpl]cite book |author=World Health Organization |title=Atlas: Multiple Sclerosis Resources in the World 2008 |publisher=World Health Organization |location=Geneva |year=2008 |pages=15–16 |isbn=92-4-156375-3|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2008/9789241563758_eng.pdf[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Milo R, Kahana E |title=Multiple sclerosis: geoepidemiology, genetics and the environment |journal=Autoimmun Rev |volume=9 |issue=5 |pages=A387–94 |date=March 2010 |pmid=19932200 |doi=10.1016/j.autrev.2009.11.010 |url=[/tpl] It is estimated to have resulted in 18,000 deaths that year.[tpl]cite journal|last=Lozano|first=R|title=Global and regional mortality from 235 causes of death for 20 age groups in 1990 and 2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010.|journal=Lancet|date=15 December 2012|volume=380|issue=9859|pages=2095–128|pmid=23245604|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61728-0[/tpl] In Africa rates are less than 0.5 per 100,000, while they are 2.8 per 100,000 in South East Asia, 8.3 per 100,000 in the Americas, and 80 per 100,000 in Europe. Rates surpass 200 per 100,000 in certain populations of Northern European descent. The number of new cases that develop per year is about 2.5 per 100,000.
Rates of MS appear to be increasing, this however may be explained simply by better diagnosis. Studies on populational and geographical patterns have been common[tpl]cite journal|author=Kurtzke JF|title=Epidemiologic evidence for multiple sclerosis as an infection|journal=Clin. Microbiol. Rev.|volume=6|issue=4 |pages=382–427|date=October 1993|pmid=8269393|pmc=358295|url=http://cmr.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=8269393|doi=10.1128/CMR.6.4.382[/tpl] and have led to a number of theories about the cause.[tpl]cite journal|author=Ascherio A, Munger KL|title=Environmental risk factors for multiple sclerosis.

MS usually appears in adults in their late twenties or early thirties but it can rarely start in childhood and after 50 years of age. The primary progressive subtype is more common in people in their fifties. Similar to many autoimmune disorders, the disease is more common in women, and the trend may be increasing.[tpl]cite journal|author=Alonso A, Hernán MA|title=Temporal trends in the incidence of multiple sclerosis: a systematic review|journal=Neurology|volume=71|issue=2|pages=129–35|date=July 2008 |pmid=18606967|doi=10.1212/01.wnl.0000316802.35974.34[/tpl] As of 2008, globally it is about two times more common in women than in men. In children, it is even more common in females than males, while in people over fifty, it affects males and females almost equally.

==History==

===Medical discovery===

The French neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot (1825–1893) was the first person to recognize multiple sclerosis as a distinct disease in 1868. Summarizing previous reports and adding his own clinical and pathological observations, Charcot called the disease sclerose en plaques. The three signs of MS now known as Charcot's triad 1 are nystagmus, intention tremor, and telegraphic speech (scanning speech), though these are not unique to MS. Charcot also observed cognition changes, describing his patients as having a "marked enfeeblement of the memory" and "conceptions that formed slowly".[tpl]cite journal |author=Clanet M |title=Jean-Martin Charcot. 1825 to 1893 |journal=Int MS J |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=59–61 |date=June 2008 |pmid=18782501 |url= http://www.msforum.net/Site/ViewPDF/ViewPDF.aspx?ArticleID=E80DC748-5048-4BD2-9393-18BCAE0A1514&doctype=Article |format=PDF[/tpl] * [tpl]cite journal |author=Charcot, J. |year=1868 |title=Histologie de la sclerose en plaques |journal=Gazette des hopitaux, Paris |volume=41 |pages=554–5 [/tpl]
Before Charcot, Robert Carswell (1793–1857), a British professor of pathology, and Jean Cruveilhier (1791–1873), a French professor of pathologic anatomy, had described and illustrated many of the disease's clinical details, but did not identify it as a separate disease.[tpl]cite journal|author=Compston A|title=The 150th anniversary of the first depiction of the lesions of multiple sclerosis|journal=J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatr.|volume=51|issue=10|pages=1249–52|date=October 1988|pmid=3066846|pmc=1032909 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.51.10.1249[/tpl] Specifically, Carswell described the injuries he found as "a remarkable lesion of the spinal cord accompanied with atrophy". Under the microscope, Swiss pathologist Georg Eduard Rindfleisch (1836–1908) noted in 1863 that the inflammation-associated lesions were distributed around blood vessels.[tpl]cite journal |author=Lassmann H |title=The pathology of multiple sclerosis and its evolution |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B |volume=354 |issue=1390 |pages=1635–40 |date=October 1999 |pmid=10603616 |pmc=1692680 |doi=10.1098/rstb.1999.0508 |url=[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Lassmann H |date=July 2005 |title=Multiple sclerosis pathology: evolution of pathogenetic concepts |journal=Brain Pathology |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=217–22 |doi=10.1111/j.1750-3639.2005.tb00523.x |pmid=16196388 [/tpl] During the 20th century theories about the cause and pathogenesis were developed and effective treatments began to appear in 1990s.

===Historical cases===

There are several historical accounts of people who lived before or shortly after the disease was described by Charcot and probably had MS.
A young woman called Halldora who lived in Iceland around 1200 suddenly lost her vision and mobility but, after praying to the saints, recovered them seven days after. Saint Lidwina of Schiedam (1380–1433), a Dutch nun, may be one of the first clearly identifiable people with MS. From the age of 16 until her death at 53, she had intermittent pain, weakness of the legs, and vision loss—symptoms typical of MS.[tpl]cite journal|author=Medaer R|title=Does the history of multiple sclerosis go back as far as the 14th century?|journal=Acta Neurol. Scand.|volume=60|issue=3|pages=189–92|date=September 1979|pmid=390966 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0447.1979.tb08970.x[/tpl] Both cases have led to the proposal of a "Viking gene" hypothesis for the dissemination of the disease.[tpl]cite journal|author=Holmøy T|title=A Norse contribution to the history of neurological diseases |journal=Eur. Neurol.|volume=55|issue=1|pages=57–8|year=2006|pmid=16479124|doi=10.1159/000091431[/tpl]
Augustus Frederick d'Este (1794–1848), son of Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex and Lady Augusta Murray and the grandson of George III of the United Kingdom, almost certainly had MS. D'Este left a detailed diary describing his 22 years living with the disease. His diary began in 1822 and ended in 1846, although it remained unknown until 1948. His symptoms began at age 28 with a sudden transient visual loss (amaurosis fugax) after the funeral of a friend. During the course of his disease, he developed weakness of the legs, clumsiness of the hands, numbness, dizziness, bladder disturbances, and erectile dysfunction. In 1844, he began to use a wheelchair. Despite his illness, he kept an optimistic view of life.[tpl]cite book|last= Firth|first=D|title= The Case of August D`Esté |year=1948|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|author=Pearce JM |title=Historical descriptions of multiple sclerosis|journal=Eur. Neurol.|volume=54|issue=1|pages=49–53|year=2005|pmid=16103678 |doi=10.1159/000087387[/tpl] Another early account of MS was kept by the British diarist W. N. P. Barbellion, nom-de-plume of Bruce Frederick Cummings (1889–1919), who maintained a detailed log of his diagnosis and struggle. His diary was published in 1919 as The Journal of a Disappointed Man.[tpl]cite book|last= Barbellion|first= Wilhelm Nero Pilate|title= The Journal of a Disappointed Man |year=1919|publisher=George H. Doran|location=New York|isbn= 0-7012-1906-8[/tpl]

==Research==

===Medications===

There is ongoing research looking for more effective, convenient, and tolerable treatments for relapsing-remitting MS; creation of therapies for the progressive subtypes; neuroprotection strategies; and effective symptomatic treatments.[tpl]cite journal |author=Cohen JA |title=Emerging therapies for relapsing multiple sclerosis |journal=Arch. Neurol.|volume=66 |issue=7 |pages=821–8 |date=July 2009 |pmid=19597083 |doi=10.1001/archneurol.2009.104 |url=[/tpl]
During the 2000s and 2010s, there has been approval of several oral drugs that are expected to gain in popularity and frequency of use.[tpl]cite journal |author=Miller AE |title=Multiple sclerosis: where will we be in 2020? |journal=Mt. Sinai J. Med. |volume=78 |issue=2 |pages=268–79 |year=2011 |pmid=21425270 |doi=10.1002/msj.20242 |url=[/tpl] Several more oral drugs are under investigation, one being laquinimod, which was announced in August 2012 and is in a third phase III trial after mixed results in the previous ones.[tpl]cite news|last=Jeffrey|first=susan|title=CONCERTO: A Third Phase 3 Trial for Laquinimod in MS|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/768902|accessdate=21 May 2013|newspaper=Medscape Medical News|date=9 August 2012[/tpl] Similarly, studies aimed to improve the efficacy and ease of use of already existing therapies are occurring. This includes the use of new preparations such as the PEGylated version of interferon-β-1a, which it is hoped may be given at less frequent doses with similar effects.[tpl]cite journal |author=Kieseier BC, Calabresi PA |title=PEGylation of interferon-β-1a: a promising strategy in multiple sclerosis |journal=CNS Drugs|volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=205–14 |date=March 2012 |pmid=22201341 |doi=10.2165/11596970-000000000-00000 |url=[/tpl][tpl]cite press release|url=http://www.biogenidec.com/press_release_details.aspx?ID=5981&ReqId=1777510|title=Biogen Idec Announces Positive Top-Line Results from Phase 3 Study of Peginterferon Beta-1a in Multiple Sclerosis|publisher=Biogen Idec |date=24 January 2013|accessdate=21 May 2013[/tpl] Request for approval ofpeginterferon beta-1a is expected during 2013.
Monoclonal antibodies have also raised high levels of interest. Alemtuzumab, daclizumab, and CD20 monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab, ocrelizumab and ofatumumab have all shown some benefit and are under study as potential treatments.[tpl]cite journal |author=Saidha S, Eckstein C, Calabresi PA|title=New and emerging disease modifying therapies for multiple sclerosis |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |volume=1247|issue= |pages=117–37 |date=January 2012 |pmid=22224673 |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2011.06272.x |url=[/tpl] Their use has also been accompanied by the appearance of potentially dangerous adverse effects, the most important of which being opportunistic infections. Related to these investigations is the development of a test for JC virus antibodies, which might help to determine who is at greater risk of developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy when taking natalizumab. While monoclonal antibodies will probably have some role in the treatment of the disease in the future, it is believed that it will be small due to the risks associated with them.
Another research strategy is to evaluate the combined effectiveness of two or more drugs.[tpl]cite journal |author=Milo R, Panitch H |title=Combination therapy in multiple sclerosis |journal=J. Neuroimmunol. |volume=231 |issue=1-2 |pages=23–31 |date=February 2011 |pmid=21111490|doi=10.1016/j.jneuroim.2010.10.021 |url=[/tpl] The main rationale for using a number of medications in MS is that the involved treatments target different mechanisms and, therefore, their use is not necessarily exclusive. Synergies, in which one drug improves the effect of another are also possible, but there can also be drawbacks such as the blocking of the action of the other or worsened side-effects. There have been several trials of combined therapy, yet none have shown positive enough results to be considered as a useful treatment for MS.
Research on neuroprotection and regenerative treatments, such as stem cell therapy, while of high importance, are in the early stages.[tpl]cite journal |author=Luessi F, Siffrin V, Zipp F |title=Neurodegeneration in multiple sclerosis: novel treatment strategies|journal=Expert Rev Neurother |volume=12 |issue=9 |pages=1061–76; quiz 1077 |date=September 2012 |pmid=23039386|doi=10.1586/ern.12.59 |url=http://www.expert-reviews.com/doi/full/10.1586/ern.12.59[/tpl] Likewise, there are not any effective treatments for the progressive variants of the disease. Many of the newest drugs as well as those under development are probably going to be evaluated as therapies for PPMS or SPMS.

===Disease biomarkers===

While diagnostic criteria are not expected to change in the near future, work to develop biomarkers that help with diagnosis and prediction of disease progression is ongoing. New diagnostic methods that are being investigated include work with anti-myelin antibodies, and studies with serum and cerebrospinal fluid, but none of them has yielded reliably positive results.[tpl]cite journal |author=Harris VK, Sadiq SA |title=Disease biomarkers in multiple sclerosis: potential for use in therapeutic decision making |journal=Mol Diagn Ther |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=225–44 |year=2009 |pmid=19712003 |doi=10.2165/11313470-000000000-00000[/tpl]
At the current time, there are no laboratory investigations that can predict prognosis. Several promising approaches have been proposed including: interleukin-6, nitric oxide and nitric oxide synthase, osteopontin, and fetuin-A. Since disease progression is the result of degeneration of neurons, the roles of proteins showing loss of nerve tissue such as neurofilaments, tau, and N-acetylaspartate are under investigation. Other effects include looking for biomarkers that distinguish between those who will and will not respond to medications.
Improvement in neuroimaging techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) carry a promise for better diagnosis and prognosis predictions, although the effect of such improvements in daily medical practice may take several decades. Regarding MRI, there are several techniques that have already shown some usefulness in research settings and could be introduced into clinical practice, such as double-inversion recovery sequences, magnetization transfer, diffusion tensor, and functional magnetic resonance imaging.[tpl]cite journal |author=Filippi M, Rocca MA, De Stefano N, et al. |title=Magnetic resonance techniques in multiple sclerosis: the present and the future |journal=Arch. Neurol. |volume=68 |issue=12 |pages=1514–20 |date=December 2011 |pmid=22159052 |doi=10.1001/archneurol.2011.914 |url=[/tpl] These techniques are more specific for the disease than existing ones, but still lack some standardization of acquisition protocols and the creation of normative values. There are other techniques under development that include contrast agents capable of measuring levels of peripheral macrophages, inflammation, or neuronal dysfunction, and techniques that measure iron deposition that could serve to determine the role of this feature in MS, or that of cerebral perfusion. Similarly, new PET radiotracers might serve as markers of altered processes such as brain inflammation, cortical pathology, apoptosis, or remylienation.[tpl]cite journal |author=Kiferle L, Politis M, Muraro PA, Piccini P |title=Positron emission tomography imaging in multiple sclerosis-current status and future applications |journal=Eur.

===Chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency===

In 2008, vascular surgeon Paolo Zamboni suggested that MS involves narrowing of the veins draining the brain, which he referred to as chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI). He found CCSVI in all patients with MS in his study, performed a surgical procedure, later called in the media the "liberation procedure" to correct it, and claimed that 73% of participants improved.[tpl]Cite journal |author=Zamboni P, Galeotti R, Menegatti E, et al. |title=Chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency in patients with multiple sclerosis |journal=J.
