[[Factor graph]]

CATEGORIES: Graphical models, Markov networks, Application-specific graphs

In probability theory and its applications, a factor graph is a particular type of graphical model, with applications in Bayesian inference, that enables efficient computation of marginal distributions through the sum-product algorithm. One of the important success stories of factor graphs and the sum-product algorithm is the decoding of capacity-approaching error-correcting codes, such as LDPC and turbo codes.
A factor graph is an example of a hypergraph, in that an arrow (i.e., a factor node) can connect more than one (normal) node.
When there are no free variables, the factor graph of a function f is equivalent to the constraint graph of f, which is an instance to a constraint satisfaction problem.

==Definition==

==Examples==

Consider a function that factorizes as follows:

==Message passing on factor graphs==

over the edges incident to the corresponding vertex can be represented as vectors of length 2: the first entry is the message evaluated in 0, the second entry is the message evaluated in 1. When a variable belongs to the field of real numbers, messages can be arbitrary functions, and special care needs to be taken in their representation.
The Hammersley–Clifford theorem shows that other probabilistic models such as Markov networks and Bayesian networks can be represented as factor graphs; the latter representation is frequently used when performing inference over such networks using belief propagation. On the other hand, Bayesian networks are more naturally suited for generative models, as they can directly represent the causalities of the model.
