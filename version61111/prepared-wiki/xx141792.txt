East Malling Research is a now private company located in East Malling, Kent in England.

==History==

A research station was established on the East Malling site in 1913 on the impetus of local fruit growers. The original buildings are still in use today. Some of the finest and most important research on perennial crops has been conducted on the site, resulting in East Mallingâ€™s worldwide reputation. Some of the more well known developments have been achieved in the areas of plant raising, fruit plant culture (especially the development of rootstocks), fruit breeding, ornamental breeding, fruit storage and the biology and control of pests and diseases.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2007[/tpl]
From 1990 a division of Horticulture Research International was on the site. HRI closed in 2009.

===Apple rootstocks===

Ronald Hatton initiated the work[tpl]when|date=May 2013[/tpl] of classification, testing and standardisation of apple tree rootstocks. With the help of Dr Wellington, Hatton sorted out the incorrect naming and mixtures then widespread in apple rootstocks distributed throughout Europe. These verified and distinct apple rootstocks are called the "Malling series". The most widespread used was the M9 rootstock.
