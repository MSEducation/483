==About The Children's Institute (TCI)==

For more than 50 years, The Children’s Institute has been developing the academic, social, behavioral, communication, life and career skills of children, adolescents and young adults with autism and related disabilities. They use an array of evidence-based strategies including Applied Behavioral Analysis, Differentiated Instruction and Universal Design.
TCI students have the same learning activities and experiences that are provided to students in their local schools, with all of the 21st century technology, supports and accommodations they need to succeed.
TCI curriculum is designed to teach “the whole child”, so that students can discover and develop their own unique talents and abilities. TCI offers opportunities for integration into community activities and interaction with typical peers. They promote self-determination in each student so that they can become independent and productive members of the community.
TCI is a state-approved private school for students with autism and related disabilities. As such, tuition is paid by local school districts, and at no cost to families.
