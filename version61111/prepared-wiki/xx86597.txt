4X games are a genre of strategy-based video and board games in which players control an empire and "eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate". The term was first coined by Alan Emrich in his September 1993 preview of Master of Orion for Computer Gaming World. Since then, others have adopted the term to describe games of similar scope and design.'''
4X games are noted for their deep, complex gameplay. Emphasis is placed upon economic and technological development, as well as a range of non-military routes to supremacy. Games can take a long time to complete since the amount of micromanagement needed to sustain an empire scales as the empire grows. 4X games are sometimes criticized for becoming tedious for these reasons, and several games have attempted to address these concerns by limiting micromanagement with varying degrees of success.
The earliest 4X games borrowed ideas from board games and 1970s text-based computer games. The first 4X games were turn-based, but real-time 4X games are not uncommon. Many 4X games were published in the mid-1990s, but were later outsold by other types of strategy games. Sid Meier's Civilization is an important example from this formative era, and popularized the level of detail that later became a staple of the genre. In the new millennium, several 4X releases have become critically and commercially successful.

==Definition==

The term "4X" originates from a 1993 preview of Master of Orion in Computer Gaming World by Alan Emrich, in which he rated the game "XXXX" as a pun on the XXX rating for pornography. The four Xs were an abbreviation for explore, expand, exploit, exterminate.[tpl]cite news | author = Alan Emrich | title = MicroProse' Strategic Space Opera is Rated XXXX| work = Computer Gaming World (Issue #110) | date = September 1993 | pages = 92–93 [/tpl] Other game commentators eventually adopted the "4X" label to describe a game genre with specific gameplay conventions:For sources that go into detail about each of the four Xs, see: [tpl]cite web | url=http://uk.guides.ign.com/guides/818084/page_2.html | title=Civilization IV: Warlords Guide | publisher = IGN | author= J.

These four elements of gameplay have been described as the four phases of a 4X game session. These phases often overlap with each other and vary in length depending on the game design. For example, the Space Empires series and Galactic Civilizations II: Dark Avatar have a long expansion phase, because players must make large investments in research to explore and expand into every area.i.

===Difficulties in definition===

While many strategy games arguably contain a similar "explore, expand, exploit, exterminate" cycle, game journalists, developers and enthusiasts generally apply "4X" to a more specific class of games,[tpl]cite web | url= http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3157333 | publisher = 1UP.com | title= Sins of a Solar Empire Preview | author = Sean Molloy | accessdate = 2008-06-23[/tpl] and contrast 4X games with other strategy games such as Command & Conquer.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/sinsofasolarempire/review.html?tag=tabs;reviews | title = Sins of a Solar Empire for PC Review - GameSpot | publisher = GameSpot | date = 2008-02-13 | author = Jason Ocampo | accessdate = 2008-07-31[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=May 2014[/tpl] Hence, writers have tried to show how 4X games are defined by more than just having each of the four Xs. Gaming sites have stated that 4X games are distinguished by their greater complexity and scale, and their intricate use of diplomacy beyond the standard "friend or foe" seen in other strategy games. Reviewers  have also stated that 4X games feature a range of diplomatic options,Several reviewers refer to diplomacy as a generic 4X feature: [tpl]cite web | url=http://www.deafgamers.com/sudg.htm | publisher = Deaf Gamers | title= Starships Unlimited: Divided Galaxies | year = 2000 | accessdate = 2008-07-26 [/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=May 2014[/tpl]; [tpl]cite web | url=http://www.tacticularcancer.com/content.php?id=29 |author = YourConscience | date = 2006-12-16 | publisher = Tacticular Cancer | title= GalCiv2, SotS, SEV: a 4X Comparison | accessdate =2008-07-26[/tpl]; [tpl]cite web | url=http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2008/03/review-sins-of/ | title=Review: Sins of a Solar Empire Sinfully Good | date=2008-03-17 | author= Earnest Cavalli | publisher = Wired | accessdate = 2008-06-23 [/tpl]; [tpl]cite web | url=http://www.gameshark.com/pc/reviews/2919/Sins-of-a-Solar-Empire-Review.htm | author = Dave VanDyk | publisher = GameShark | title = Sins of a Solar Empire Review | date = 2008-02-14 | accessdate =2008-06-23| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080516220856/http://www.gameshark.com/pc/reviews/2919/Sins-of-a-Solar-Empire-Review.htm| archivedate= 16 May 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] and that they are well known for their large detailed empires and complex gameplay.[tpl]cite web | accessdate = 2008-03-31 | url = http://goty.gamespy.com/2006/pc/index6.html | publisher = GameSpy | title = GameSpy's Game of the Year 2006 - 6.

==Game design==

4X games are a subgenre of strategy games, and include both turn-based and real-time strategy titles.[tpl]cite web | url= http://archive.gamespy.com/reviews/january02/sudg/ | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070629230929/http://archive.gamespy.com/reviews/january02/sudg/ | archivedate= 2007-06-29 | title= GameSpy Reviews: Starships Unlimited: Divided Galaxies | publisher = GameSpy | author = William Abner | date = January 2002 | accessdate=2008-06-23[/tpl] The gameplay involves building an empire,[tpl]cite web | year = 2006 | author = Sal Accardo | accessdate = 2008-06-23 | url = http://goty.gamespy.com/2006/pc/index6.html | title = GameSpy's Game of the Year 2006 - 6.

Most 4X games represent these racial differences with a collection of economic and military bonuses.

===Research and technology===

4X games typically feature a technology tree, which represents a series of advancements that players can unlock to gain new units, buildings, and other capabilities. Technology trees in 4X games are typically larger than in other strategy games, featuring a larger selection of choices.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.joystiq.com/2008/02/01/joystiq-interview-ironclad-talks-4x-strategy-with-sins-of-a-sol/ | title=Joystiq interview: Ironclad talks 4X strategy with Sins of a Solar Empire | author = Jason Dobson | date= 2008-02-01 | publisher = Joystiq | accessdate=2008-06-23 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080706054054/http://www.joystiq.com/2008/02/01/joystiq-interview-ironclad-talks-4x-strategy-with-sins-of-a-sol/| archivedate= 6 July 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Empires must generate research resources and invest them in new technology.[tpl]cite book|author=Andrew Rollings|author2=Ernest Adams|title=Andrew Rollings and Ernest Adams on Game Design|publisher=New Riders Publishing|year=2003|pages=321–345|url=http://my.safaribooksonline.com/1592730019/ch10 | isbn=1-59273-001-9[/tpl] In 4X games, the main prerequisite for researching an advanced technology is knowledge of earlier technology.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game-group/4x-games|title=Moby Games' 4x games Group Description|publisher=MobyGames| accessdate=2008-06-23| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080618074603/http://www.mobygames.com/game-group/4x-games| archivedate= 18 June 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] This is in contrast to non-4X real-time strategy games, where technological progress is achieved by building structures that grant access to more advanced structures and units.
Research is important in 4X games because technological progress is an engine for conquest. Battles are often won by superior military technology or greater numbers, with battle tactics playing a smaller part. In contrast, military upgrades in non-4X games are sometimes small enough that technologically basic units remain important throughout the game.[tpl]cite web | url=http://uk.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/starcraft/review.html | date = 1998-04-15 | publisher = GameSpot | author = Ron Dulin | title=StarCraft for PC Review | accessdate=2008-06-23 [/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=May 2014[/tpl]

===Combat===

Combat is an important part of 4X gameplay, because 4X games allow a player to win by exterminating all rival players, or by conquering a threshold amount of the game's universe. Some 4X games, such as Galactic Civilizations, resolve battles automatically, whenever two units from warring sides meet. This is in contrast to other 4X games, such as Master of Orion, that allow players to manage battles on a tactical battle screen. Even in 4X games with more detailed control over battles, victory is usually determined by superior numbers and technology, with battle tactics playing a smaller part.i. [tpl]cite web | url = http://archive.gamespy.com/reviews/march03/galacticcivpc/index.shtml | publisher = GameSpy | title = GameSpy Review - Galactic Civilizations | author = Allen "Delsyn" Rausch | date = 2003-03-28 | accessdate = 2008-07-30 [/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=May 2014[/tpl]   ii. [tpl]cite web | url = http://pc.ign.com/articles/749/749070p2.html | publisher = IGN | title = IGN - Space Empires V Review | author = Steve Butts | date = 2006-12-04 | accessdate = 2008-07-26 [/tpl] 4X games differ from other combat-focused strategy games by putting more emphasis on research and economics. Researching new technology will grant access to new combat units. Some 4X games even allow players to research different unit components. This is more typical of space 4X games, where players may assemble a ship from a variety of engines, shields, and weaponry.

===Peaceful competition===

4X games allow rival players to engage in diplomacy. While some strategy games may offer shared victory and team play, diplomatic relations tend to be restricted to a binary choice between an ally or enemy. 4X games often allow more complex diplomatic relations between competitors who are not on the same team.i.

In addition to victory through conquest, 4X games often offer peaceful victory conditions/goals that involve no extermination of rival players (although war may be still be a necessary by-product of reaching said goal). For example, some 4X games offer victory to a player who achieves a certain score or the highest score after a certain number of turns.[tpl]cite web | url = http://pc.gamezone.com/gzreviews/p14156.htm | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050216055548/http://pc.gamezone.com/gzreviews/p14156.htm | archivedate = 2005-02-16 | publisher = Game Zone | title = Space Empires IV Preview | date = 2000-08-31 | author = Michael Lafferty | accessdate= 2008-07-26[/tpl] Many 4X games award victory to the first player to master an advanced technology, accumulate a large amount of culture, or complete an awe-inspiring achievement.[tpl]cite web | url= http://pc.ign.com/articles/392/392858p1.html | publisher = IGN | author = Barry Brenesal | title = Galactic Civilizations Review | date = 2003-04-08 | accessdate = 2008-07-26 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080706234421/http://pc.ign.com/articles/392/392858p1.html| archivedate= 6 July 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Several 4X games award "diplomatic victory" to anyone who can win an election decided by their rival players,i.

===Absorbing gameplay===

Since 4X games involve managing a large, detailed empire, game sessions usually last longer than other strategy games.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3157343 | date = 2007-02-20 | author = GFW Staff | title=Previews: Sins of a Solar Empire | publisher=1UP.com | accessdate = 2008-07-26 [/tpl] Game sessions may require several hours of play-time, which can be particularly problematic for multiplayer matches. For example, a small-scale game in Sins of a Solar Empire can last for over 12 hours. However, fans of the genre sometimes expect and embrace these long game sessions.[tpl]cite web | url = http://pc.ign.com/articles/682/682382p1.html | title = Feature: Galactic [tpl]sic|Civ|lizations|nolink=1[/tpl] II Alien Races, Part IV | author = Stardock | publisher = IGN | date = 2007-01-19 | accessdate = 2008-08-15 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080719180329/http://pc.ign.com/articles/682/682382p1.html| archivedate= 19 July 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Turn-based 4X games typically divide these sessions into hundreds of turns of gameplay.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/masteroforion3/news.html?sid=2902095&mode=all | author = Sam Parker | publisher = GameSpot | date = 2002-12-18 | title = Master of Orion III Hands-On Preview | accessdate = 2008-08-19 [/tpl]
Because of repetitive actions and long-playing times, 4X games have been criticized for excessive micromanagement. In early stages of a game this is usually not a problem, but later in a game directing an empire's numerous settlements can demand several minutes to play a single turn. This increases playing-times, which are a particular burden in multiplayer games.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/preview/pc/master_of_orion_3 | publisher = Game Revolution | title=Master of Orion 3 preview for PC - Game Revolution | date = 2001-07-04 | author = Joshua Villines | accessdate=2008-07-26 [/tpl] 4X games began to offer AI governors that automate the micromanagement of a colony's build orders, but players criticized these governors for making bad decisions. In response, developers have tried other approaches to reduce micromanagement,[tpl]cite web | url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/096/096013p1.html | title= IGN - Galactic Civilizations Interview | author = Steve Butts | date = 2001-06-21 | publisher = IGN | accessdate=2008-07-26 [/tpl] and some approaches have been more well received than others.

==History==

===Origin===

Early 4X games were influenced by board games and text-based computer games from the 1970s.[tpl]cite web | publisher= GameSpy | author= Dave "Fargo" Kosak | title= Rich "Zdim" Carlson of Looking Glass Studios: The History of Computer Games - Part I | url=http://archive.gamespy.com/legacy/articles/devweek_l.shtm | accessdate = 2008-06-18 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080617051636/http://archive.gamespy.com/legacy/articles/devweek_l.shtm| archivedate= 17 June 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Andromeda Conquest and Reach for the Stars were published in 1983, and are now seen retrospectively as 4X games. Although Andromeda Conquest was only a simple game of empire expansion, Reach for the Stars introduced the relationship between economic growth, technological progress, and conquest.[tpl]cite web | author = Bruce Geryk | title =History of Space Empire Games - The Early Years 1980-1992 | publisher = GameSpot | url =http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/pc/history_spaceempire/p2_01.html | date = 2001-08-08 | accessdate =2008-07-26[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=May 2014[/tpl]
In 1990, Sid Meier released Civilization and popularized the level of detail that has become a staple of the genre.[tpl]cite web | title = IGN Videogame Hall of Fame: Civilization | publisher = IGN | url=http://games.ign.com/halloffame/civilization.html | accessdate = 2008-05-21| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080505052831/http://games.ign.com/halloffame/civilization.html| archivedate= 5 May 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Sid Meier's Civilization was influenced by board games such as Risk and the Avalon Hill board game also called Civilization. A notable similarity between the Civilization computer game and board game is the importance of diplomacy and technological advancement. Sid Meier's Civilization was also influenced by personal computer games such as the city management game SimCity and the wargame Empire.[tpl]cite web | author=Benj Edwards |title=The History of Civilization | publisher = Gamasutra | url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/1523/the_history_of_civilization.php?page=2 | accessdate = 2008-05-21| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080531030014/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/1523/the_history_of_civilization.php?page=2| archivedate= 31 May 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Civilization became widely successful and influenced many 4X games to come.
In 1991, two highly influential space games were released. VGA Planets was released for the PC, while Spaceward Ho! was released on the Macintosh. Although 4X space games were ultimately more influenced by the complexity of VGA Planets, Spaceward Ho! earned praise for its relatively simple yet challenging game design.[tpl]cite web | author = Bruce Geryk | url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/pc/history_spaceempire/p2_03.html | title=GameSpot - A History of Space Empire Games: VGA Planets and Spaceward Ho! | publisher = GameSpot| date = 2001-08-08 |accessdate=2008-07-26 [/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=May 2014[/tpl] Spaceward Ho! is notable for its similarity to the 1993 game Master of Orion,[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/features/6132108/index.html | title = The Greatest Games of All Time: Master of Orion | publisher = GameSpot | author = Jason Ocampo | date = 2005-08-26 | accessdate = 2008-07-29 [/tpl] with its simple yet deep gameplay. Master of Orion also drew upon earlier 4X games such as Reach for the Stars,[tpl]cite web | url = http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/february02/strat04/ | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080108172202/http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/february02/strat04/ | archivedate = 2008-01-08 | title = Strategy Gaming: Part IV -- In the Beginning | publisher = GameSpy | author = Mark H. Walker | date = February 2002 | accessdate = 2008-07-25 [/tpl] and is considered a classic game that set a new standard for the genre. In a preview of Master of Orion, Alan Emrich coined the term "XXXX" to describe the emerging genre. Eventually, the "4X" label was adopted by the game industry, and is now applied to several earlier game releases.[tpl]cite web | author = Bruce Geryk | title =History of Space Empire Games - Introduction | publisher = GameSpot | url =http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/pc/history_spaceempire/index.html | date = 2001-08-08 |accessdate =2008-07-26[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=March 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

===Peak===

Following the success of Civilization and Master of Orion, other developers began releasing their own 4X games. In 1994, Stardock launched its first version of the Galactic Civilizations series for OS/2,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.stardock.com/products/gcgold/ | title=Galactic Civilizations Gold | publisher = StarDock | accessdate=2008-06-22 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080616024910/http://www.stardock.com/products/gcgold/| archivedate= 16 June 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] and the long-standing Space Empires series began as shareware. Ascendancy and Stars! were released in 1995, and both continued the genre's emphasis on strategic depth and empire management. Meanwhile, the Civilization and Master of Orion franchises expanded their market with versions for the Macintosh.Master of Orion II was released for the Macintosh: [tpl]cite web | url=http://uk.gamespot.com/mac/strategy/masteroforion2/index.html | publisher = GameSpot | year = 1996 | title=Master of Orion II for Mac | accessdate=2008-06-20 [/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=May 2014[/tpl]; and so was Civilization: [tpl]cite web | url = http://www.mobygames.com/game/sid-meiers-civilization | publisher = MobyGames | title = MobyGames - Sid Meier's Civilization | accessdate = 2008-06-24 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080616095903/http://www.mobygames.com/game/sid-meiers-civilization| archivedate= 16 June 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Sid Meier's team also produced Colonization in 1994 and Civilization II in 1996,[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/by_genre/developerId,3/ | publisher = MobyGames | title = MobyGames - Sid Meier Gameography | date = 2008-06-24 [/tpl] while Simtex released Master of Orion in 1993, Master of Magic in 1994 and Master of Orion II in 1996.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.mobygames.com/browse/games/simtex-inc/list-games/ | title = MobyGames - List of all games of Simtex | publisher = MobyGames | accessdate = 2009-02-20 [/tpl]
By the late 1990s, real-time strategy games began outselling turn-based games.[tpl]cite web | author = Mark H. Walker | url= http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/february02/strategygames05/index2.shtm | publisher = GameSpy | title = Strategy Gaming: Part V -- Real-Time vs. Turn-Based | date = February 2002 | accessdate = 2008-06-24 [/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=May 2014[/tpl] As they surged in popularity, major 4X developers fell into difficulties. Sid Meier's Firaxis Games released Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri in 1999 to critical acclaim, but the game fell short of commercial expectations.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_13/86-Alpha-Centauri.2 | title = Featured Article: Alpha Centauri | publisher = The Escapist | date = 2005-10-04 | author = Greg Tito | accessdate = 2008-07-28 [/tpl] Civilization III encountered development problems followed by a rushed release in 2001.[tpl]cite web |author = Kieron Gillen | url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2008/02/20/making-of-soren-johnson-on-civ-4/ | publisher = Rock Paper Shotgun | date = 2008-02-08 | title = Making Of: Soren Johnson On Civ 4 | accessdate = 2008-07-26 [/tpl] Despite the excitement over Master of Orion III, its release in 2003 was met with criticism for its lack of player control, poor interface, and weak AI. Game publishers eventually became risk-averse to financing the development of 4X games.

===Real Time Hybrid 4X===

Eventually real-time 4X games were released, such as Imperium Galactica in 1997,[tpl]cite web | author = Steve Butts | url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/852/852735p1.html | publisher=IGN | title= Sins of a Solar Empire | date= 2008-02-15 | accessdate = 2011-09-29[/tpl] and Starships Unlimited in 2001  and Sword of the Stars in 2006, featuring a combination of a turn based strategy part and real-time tactical combat phase. The blend of 4X and real-time strategy gameplay led Ironclad Games to market their 2008 release Sins of a Solar Empire as a "RT4X" game.i.

Cross-fertilization between board games and video games continued. For example, some aspects of Master of Orion III were drawn from the board game Twilight Imperium.[tpl]cite web | url=http://moo3.quicksilver.com/diary/1200.html | title=Master of Orion III - Designer's Diary | date = 2000-12-13 | publisher = QuickSilver Software | accessdate = 2008-07-26 [/tpl] Even Sins of a Solar Empire was inspired by the idea of adapting the board game Buck Rogers Battle for the 25th Century into a real-time video game.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3638/postmortem_ironcladstardocks_.php | title = Postmortem: Ironclad/Stardock's Sins of a Solar Empire | author = Blair Fraser and Brad Wardell | publisher = Gamasutra | date = 2008-04-28 | accessdate = 2008-07-25 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080714035659/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3638/postmortem_ironcladstardocks_.php?| archivedate= 14 July 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Going in the opposite direction, Eagle Games made a board game adaptation of Sid Meier's Civilization in 2002.[tpl]cite web | url = http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/pirates-2004/540850p1.html | date = 2004-08-20 | author = Andrew S.
