[[Elongation factor]]

CATEGORIES: Protein biosynthesis

Elongation factors are a set of proteins that are used in protein synthesis in the cell. In the ribosome, they facilitate translational elongation, from the formation of the first peptide bond to the formation of the last one.
Elongation is the most rapid step in translation:
Elongation factors play a role in orchestrating the events of this process, and in ensuring the 99.99% accuracy of translation at this speed.
Elongation factors are also a target for pathogen toxins. Corynebacterium diphtheriae produces the diphtheria toxin that alters protein function in the host by inactivating elongation factor (EF-2). This causes pharyngitis and pseudomembranous inflammation in the throat.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa's exotoxin A also inhibits EF-2.
