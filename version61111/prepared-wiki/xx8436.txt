==Compounds==

Niobium is in many ways similar to tantalum and zirconium. It reacts with most nonmetals at high temperatures: niobium reacts with fluorine at room temperature, with chlorine and hydrogen at 200 °C, and with nitrogen at 400 °C, giving products that are frequently interstitial and nonstoichiometric. The metal begins to oxidize in air at 200 °C,[tpl]cite book|publisher = Walter de Gruyter|year = 1985|edition = 91–100|pages = 1075–1079|isbn = 3-11-007511-3|title = Lehrbuch der Anorganischen Chemie|first = Arnold F.|last = Holleman|coauthors = Wiberg, Egon; Wiberg, Nils;|chapter = Niob| language = German[/tpl] and is resistant to corrosion by fused alkalis and by acids, including aqua regia, hydrochloric, sulfuric, nitric and phosphoric acids. Niobium is attacked by hydrofluoric acid and hydrofluoric/nitric acid mixtures.
Although niobium exhibits all of the formal oxidation states from +5 to −1, in most commonly encountered compounds, it is found in the +5 state. Characteristically, compounds in oxidation states less than 5+ display Nb–Nb bonding.

===Oxides and sulfides===

Niobium forms oxides with the oxidation states +5 (Nb2O5), +4 (NbO2), and +3 (Nb2O3), as well as with the rarer oxidation state +2 (NbO).[tpl]Greenwood&Earnshaw[/tpl] Most commonly encountered is the pentoxide, precursor to almost all niobium compounds and alloys.[tpl]cite book|first = Francois|last = Cardarelli|year = 2008|title = Materials Handbook |publisher = Springer London|isbn = 978-1-84628-668-1[/tpl] Niobates are generated by dissolving the pentoxide in basic hydroxide solutions or by melting it in alkali metal oxides. Examples are lithium niobate (LiNbO3) and lanthanum niobate (LaNbO4). In the lithium niobate is a trigonally distorted perovskite-like structure, whereas the lanthanum niobate contains lone [tpl]chem|NbO|4|3-[/tpl] ions. The layered niobium sulfide (NbS2) is also known.
Materials with a thin film coating of niobium(V) oxide can be produced by chemical vapor deposition or atomic layer deposition processes, in each case by the thermal decomposition of niobium(V) ethoxide above 350 °C.[tpl]cite thesis | title = Atomic Layer Deposition of High Permittivity Oxides: Film Growth and In Situ Studies |  author = Rahtu, Antti | publisher = University of Helsinki | url = http://hdl.handle.net/10138/21065 | year = 2002 | isbn = 952-10-0646-3[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | doi =  10.1149/1.2059247 | title =  Electrochromic Properties of Niobium Oxide Thin Films Prepared by Chemical Vapor Deposition | year =  1994 | last1 =  Maruyama | first1 =  Toshiro | journal =  Journal of the Electrochemical Society | volume =  141 | issue =  10 | pages =  2868[/tpl]

===Halides===

Niobium forms halides in the oxidation states of +5 and +4 as well as diverse substoichiometric compounds.[tpl]cite book|first = Anatoly|last = Agulyansky|title = The Chemistry of Tantalum and Niobium Fluoride Compounds|pages = 1–11|publisher = Elsevier|year=2004| isbn = 978-0-444-51604-6[/tpl] The pentahalides ([tpl]chem|NbX|5[/tpl]) feature octahedral Nb centres. Niobium pentafluoride (NbF5) is a white solid with a melting point of 79.0 °C and niobium pentachloride (NbCl5) is yellow (see image at left) with a melting point of 203.4 °C. Both are hydrolyzed to give oxides and oxyhalides, such as NbOCl3. The pentachloride is a versatile reagent being used to generate the organometallic compounds, such as niobocene dichloride ([tpl]chem|(C|5|H|5|)|2|NbCl|2[/tpl]).[tpl]cite journal|author = C. R. Lucas, J. A. Labinger, J. Schwartz|title = Dichlorobis(η5-Cyclopentadienyl)Niobium(IV)|editor = Robert J. Angelici|journal = Inorganic Syntheses|year = 1990|volume = 28|pages = 267–270|isbn = 0-471-52619-3|doi = 10.1002/9780470132593.ch68|publisher = J. Wiley & Sons|location = New York|series = Inorganic Syntheses[/tpl] The tetrahalides ([tpl]chem|NbX|4[/tpl]) are dark-coloured polymers with Nb-Nb bonds, for example the black hygroscopic niobium tetrafluoride (NbF4) and brown niobium tetrachloride (NbCl4).
Anionic halide compounds of niobium are well known, owing in part to the Lewis acidity of the pentahalides. The most important is NbF72-, which is an intermediate in the separation of Nb and Ta from the ores.[tpl]cite journal|title = Staff-Industry Collaborative Report: Tantalum and Niobium|first = Donald J.|last = Soisson|coauthors = McLafferty, J. J.; Pierret, James A.| journal = Industrial and Engineering Chemistry|year = 1961|volume = 53|issue = 11|pages = 861–868|doi = 10.1021/ie50623a016[/tpl] This heptafluoride tends to form the oxopentafluoride more readily than does the tantalum compound.Other halide complexes include octahedral NbCl6−:
As for other early metals, a variety of reduced halide clusters are known, the premier example being Nb6Cl184−.[tpl]Greenwood&Earnshaw2nd[/tpl]

===Nitrides and carbides===

Other binary compounds of niobium include the niobium nitride (NbN), which becomes a superconductor at low temperatures and is used in detectors for infrared light.[tpl]cite journal|doi = 10.1080/09500340410001670866|title = Ultrafast superconducting single-photon detectors for near-infrared-wavelength quantum communications|last = Verevkin|first = A.|coauthors = Pearlman, A.; Slstrokysz, W.; Zhang, J.; Currie, M.; Korneev, A.; Chulkova, G.; Okunev, O.; Kouminov, P.; Smirnov, K.; Voronov, B.; N. Gol'tsman, G.; Sobolewski, Roman|journal = Journal of Modern Optics|volume = 51|issue = 12|year = 2004|pages = 1447–1458[/tpl] The main niobium carbide is NbC, an extremely hard, refractory, ceramic material, commercially used in tool bits for cutting tools.

==Applications==

It is estimated that out of 44,500 metric tons of niobium mined in 2006, 90% was used in the production of high-grade structural steel, followed by its use in superalloys.[tpl]cite web|url = http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/niobium/myb1-2006-niobi.pdf|title = Niobium (Columbium ) and Tantalum|first = John F |last=Papp|publisher = USGS 2006 Minerals Yearbook|accessdate = 2008-09-03[/tpl] The use of niobium alloys for superconductors and in electronic components account only for a small share of the production.

===Steel production===

Niobium is an effective microalloying element for steel. Adding niobium to the steel causes the formation of niobium carbide and niobium nitride within the structure of the steel. These compounds improve the grain refining, retardation of recrystallization, and precipitation hardening of the steel. These effects in turn increase the toughness, strength, formability, and weldability of the microalloyed steel. Microalloyed stainless steels have a niobium content of less than 0.1%.[tpl]cite journal|title = Niobium: Future Possibilities – Technology and the Market Place|first = Friedrich|last= Heisterkamp|coauthors = Tadeu Carneiro|url = http://www.cbmm.com.br/portug/sources/techlib/science_techno/table_content/images/pdfs/closing.pdf|accessdate =|journal = Niobium Science & Technology: Proceedings of the International Symposium Niobium 2001 (Orlando, Florida, USA)|year = 2001|isbn = 978-0-9712068-0-9 |publisher = Niobium 2001 Ltd, 2002|editor=Minerals, Metals and Materials Society, Metals and Materials Society Minerals|format = PDF[/tpl] It is an important alloy addition to high strength low alloy steels which are widely used as structural components in modern automobiles.[tpl]cite journal|journal =Metallurgist|volume = 45|issue = 11–12|doi = 10.1023/A:1014897029026|pages = 477–480|year = 2001|title = Niobium for Steelmaking |first = Zh.|last = Patel|coauthors = Khul'ka K.|accessdate =[/tpl] These niobium-containing alloys are strong and are often used in pipeline construction.[tpl]cite journal|journal = Economic Bulletin|volume = 19|issue = 9|doi = 10.1007/BF02227064|pages = 8–11|year = 1982|title = Niobium: a steel additive with a future|first = Peter|last = Eggert|coauthors = Priem, Joachim; Wettig, Eberhard|accessdate =[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|url = http://www.europipe.com/files/ep_tp_43_01en.pdf|title = Development and Production of High Strength Pipeline Steels|first = Hans–Georg|last = Hillenbrand|coauthors = Gräf, Michael; Kalwa, Christoph| journal=Niobium Science & Technology: Proceedings of the International Symposium Niobium 2001 (Orlando, Florida, USA) |publisher = Europipe|accessdate =|date = 2001-05-02[/tpl]

===Superalloys===

Appreciable amounts of the element, either in its pure form or in the form of high-purity ferroniobium and nickel niobium, are used in nickel-, cobalt-, and iron-based superalloys for such applications as jet engine components, gas turbines, rocket subassemblies, turbo charger systems, and heat resisting and combustion equipment. Niobium precipitates a hardening γ-phase within the grain structure of the superalloy.[tpl]cite book|publisher = ASM International|year = 2002|isbn = 978-0-87170-749-9|title = Superalloys: A Technical Guide|first = Matthew J.|last = Donachie|pages = 29–30[/tpl] The alloys contain up to 6.5% niobium. One example of a nickel-based niobium-containing superalloy is Inconel 718, which consists of roughly 50% nickel, 18.6% chromium, 18.5% iron, 5% niobium, 3.1% molybdenum, 0.9% titanium, and 0.4% aluminium.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.msm.cam.ac.uk/phase-trans/2003/Superalloys/superalloys.html|title = Nickel Based Superalloys| first = H. k. d. h|last = Bhadeshia|publisher = University of Cambridge|accessdate = 2008-09-04[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|journal = Thermochimica Acta|volume = 382|year = 2002|pages= 55–267|doi = 10.1016/S0040-6031(01)00751-1|title = Thermophysikalische Eigenschaften von festem und flüssigem Inconel 718|language=German|first = G.|last = Pottlacher|coauthors = Hosaeus, H.; Wilthan, B.; Kaschnitz, E.; Seifter, A.|issue = 1––2[/tpl] These superalloys are used, for example, in advanced air frame systems such as those used in the Gemini program.
An alloy used for liquid rocket thruster nozzles, such as in the main engine of the Apollo Lunar Modules, is the niobium alloy C-103, which consists of 89% niobium, 10% hafnium and 1% titanium.[tpl]cite journal|url = http://www.cbmm.com.br/portug/sources/techlib/science_techno/table_content/sub_3/images/pdfs/016.pdf|title = Niobium alloys and high Temperature Applications| first = John|last = Hebda| journal = Niobium Science & Technology: Proceedings of the International Symposium Niobium 2001 (Orlando, Florida, USA) |publisher = Companhia Brasileira de Metalurgia e Mineração|accessdate =|date = 2001-05-02|format = PDF[/tpl] Another niobium alloy was used for the nozzle of the Apollo Service Module. As niobium is oxidized at temperatures above 400 °C, a protective coating is necessary for these applications to prevent the alloy from becoming brittle.

===Niobium-base alloys===

C-103 alloy was developed in the early 1960s jointly by the Wah Chang Corporation and Boeing Co.  DuPont, Union Carbide Corp., General Electric Co. and several other companies were developing Nb-base alloys simultaneously, largely driven by the Cold War and Space Race.  The sensitivity of Nb to oxygen requires processing in vacuum or inert atmosphere, which significantly increases the cost and difficulty of production.  Vacuum arc remelting (VAR) and electron beam melting (EBM), novelty processes at the time, enabled the development of reactive metals such as Nb.  The project that yielded C-103 began in 1959 with as many as 256 experimental Nb alloys in the "C-series" (possibly from columbium) that could be melted as buttons and rolled into sheet.  Wah Chang had an inventory of Hf, refined from nuclear-grade Zr, that it wanted to put to commercial use.  The 103rd experimental composition of the C-series alloys, Nb-10Hf-1Ti, had the best combination of formability and high-temperature properties.   Wah Chang fabricated the first 500-lb heat of C-103 in 1961, ingot to sheet, using EBM and VAR. The intended applications included turbine engine components and liquid metal heat exchangers.  Competing Nb alloys from that era included FS85 (Nb-10W-28Ta-1Zr) from Fansteel Metallurgical Corp., Cb129Y (Nb-10W-10Hf-0.2Y) from Wah Chang and Boeing, Cb752 (Nb-10W-2.5Zr) from Union Carbide, and Nb1Zr from Superior Tube Co.

====Numismatics====

Niobium is used as a precious metal in commemorative coins, often with silver or gold. For example, Austria produced a series of silver niobium euro coins starting in 2003; the colour in these coins is created by the diffraction of light by a thin oxide layer produced by anodising.[tpl]cite journal|doi = 10.1016/j.ijrmhm.2005.10.008|journal = International Journal of Refractory Metals and Hard Materials|volume = 24|issue = 4|year = 2006|pages = 275–282|title = Niobium as mint metal: Production–properties–processing|first =Robert|last = Grill|coauthors = Gnadenberge, Alfred[/tpl] In 2012, ten coins are available showing a broad variety of colours in the centre of the coin: blue, green, brown, purple, violet, or yellow.

The arc-tube seals of high pressure sodium vapor lamps are made from niobium, or niobium with 1% of zirconium, because niobium has a very similar coefficient of thermal expansion to the sintered alumina arc tube ceramic, a translucent material which resists chemical attack or reduction by the hot liquid sodium and sodium vapour contained inside the operating lamp.[tpl]cite book|title = Lamps and Lighting|first = Stanley Thomas|last = Henderson|coauthors = Marsden, Alfred Michael; Hewitt, Harry|publisher = Edward Arnold Press|year = 1972|isbn = 0-7131-3267-1|pages = 244–245[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|title = Refractory metals: crucial components for light sources|last = Eichelbrönner|first = G.|year =1998|journal = International Journal of Refractory Metals and Hard Materials|volume = 16|issue = 1|pages = 5–11|doi = 10.1016/S0263-4368(98)00009-2|accessdate =[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|title = Niobium and Niobium 1% Zirconium for High Pressure Sodium (HPS) Discharge Lamps|first = Christopher A.|last = Michaluk|coauthors = Huber, Louis E.; Ford, Robert B.| journal = Niobium Science & Technology: Proceedings of the International Symposium Niobium 2001 (Orlando, Florida, USA)|year = 2001|isbn = 978-0-9712068-0-9 |publisher = Niobium 2001 Ltd, 2002|editor=Minerals, Metals and Materials Society, Metals and Materials Society Minerals[/tpl] The metal is also used in arc welding rods for some stabilized grades of stainless steel.[tpl]US patent reference|number = 5254836|y = 1993|m = 10|d = 19|inventor = Okada, Yuuji; Kobayashi, Toshihiko; Sasabe, Hiroshi; Aoki, Yoshimitsu; Nishizawa, Makoto; Endo, Shunji|title = Method of arc welding with a ferrite stainless steel welding rod[/tpl] It is also used as a material in anodes for cathodic protection systems on some water tanks, which are then usually plated by platinum.[tpl]cite book|author=Moavenzadeh, Fred |title=Concise Encyclopedia of Building and Construction Materials|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YiJaEAUj258C&pg=PA157|accessdate=18 February 2012|date=14 March 1990|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-13248-0|pages=157–[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=Cardarelli, François |title=Materials handbook: a concise desktop reference|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PvU-qbQJq7IC&pg=PA352|accessdate=18 February 2012|date=9 January 2008|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-84628-668-1|pages=352–[/tpl]

==Precautions==

Niobium has no known biological role. While niobium dust is an eye and skin irritant and a potential fire hazard, elemental niobium on a larger scale is physiologically inert (and thus hypoallergenic) and harmless. It is frequently used in jewelry and has been tested for use in some medical implants.[tpl]cite journal|title = New trends in the use of metals in jewellery|first = J.|last = Vilaplana|coauthors = Romaguera, C.; Grimalt, F.; Cornellana, F.|journal = Contact Dermatitis|volume = 25|issue = 3 |pages = 145–148|year = 1990|doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0536.1991.tb01819.x|pmid = 1782765[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|title = New developments in jewellery and dental materials|first = J.|last = Vilaplana|coauthors = Romaguera, C.| journal = Contact Dermatitis|volume = 39|issue = 2| pages = 55–57|year = 1998|doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0536.1998.tb05832.x|pmid = 9746182[/tpl]
Niobium-containing compounds are rarely encountered by most people, but some are toxic and should be treated with care. The short and long term exposure to niobates and niobium chloride, two chemicals that are water soluble, have been tested in rats. Rats treated with a single injection of niobium pentachloride or niobates show a median lethal dose (LD50) between 10 and 100 mg/kg.[tpl]cite journal|title = Pharmacology and toxicology of niobium chloride|first = Thomas J.|last = Haley|coauthor = Komesu, N.; Raymond, K.|journal = Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology|volume = 4|issue = 3|pages = 385–392|year = 1962|doi = 10.1016/0041-008X(62)90048-0|pmid=13903824[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|title = The Toxicity of Niobium Salts |first = William L.|last = Downs|coauthors = Scott, James K.; Yuile, Charles L.; Caruso, Frank S.; Wong, Lawrence C.
