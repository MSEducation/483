==Synopsis==

Mrs. Pringle (Elizabeth Davis) owns a wig shop in a little town in Florida, but she is a demented woman who lives with her mentally retarded son, Rodney (Chris Martell), in a home where she rents rooms to young co-eds attending the local university. Girls are disappearing; they are killed and scalped by a mysterious murderer. When Kathy, a co-ed attending the university nearby, tries to figure out who is killing her classmates, the police discover the terrible truth about the fate of the young victims. And the truth, of course, involves Mrs. Pringle and her son.
