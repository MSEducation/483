==Officiating career==

===Early years===

Carey began officiating football in 1972 working Pop Warner football games in the San Diego, California, area after a suggestion by a friend. Progressing to the college level in 1985, he joined the Western Athletic Conference (WAC).  In the WAC, he officiated three bowl games.

===National Football League===

Carey was hired by the NFL in 1990 as a side judge, before being promoted to referee for the start of the 1995 NFL season.  He became the second African American referee in NFL history after Johnny Grier in 1988.  In addition to being selected as referee in Super Bowl XLII, he served as an alternate for Super Bowl XXXVI.[tpl]cite news |title=Super Bowl Notebook  |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/2002/playoffs/news/2002/02/02/saturday_notebook_ap/ |publisher=CNN Sports Illustrated |date=2002-02-02 |accessdate=2007-12-01[/tpl]  In addition to the Super Bowl, he has officiated two conference championship games, four divisional playoffs, and eight wild card games throughout his career as of the conclusion of the 2007-08 NFL playoffs.[tpl]cite news |title=Super Bowl officials announced |url=http://www.sportsnetwork.com/merge/tsnform.aspx?c=sportsnetwork&page=nfl/news/news.aspx?id=4126654 |publisher=The Sports Network |date=2008-01-30 |accessdate=2008-02-02[/tpl]

====Memorable games====

Carey has worked memorable games throughout his career, most notably during the 2005 NFL season.  On October 3, 2005, Mike and Don Carey became the first brothers to officiate an NFL game together when they were assigned on the same officiating crew for the game between the Carolina Panthers and Green Bay Packers.[tpl]cite news | first= | last=| url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/8927034  | title=Carey brothers mark NFL milestone | publisher=Associated Press | date=2005-10-03 | accessdate=2006-09-01 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070715044940/http://www.nfl.com/news/story/8927034 |archivedate = 2007-07-15[/tpl]
The following week of the 2005 regular season on October 9, 2005, Carey was involved in a game between the Baltimore Ravens and Detroit Lions, which featured a pair of ejections and 21 penalties for the Ravens. In the third quarter with Detroit possession from Baltimore's 6 yard line, Terrell Suggs was penalized for roughing Detroit quarterback Joey Harrington following an incomplete pass. Suggs then quickly approached Mike Carey to argue the call and was immediately ejected from the game. Television replays were inconclusive to determine if contact with an official was made. After the game, Carey spoke to reporters and said, "He bumped me with malice in his heart and he was gone. He said a number of things to me."[tpl]cite news |title=Total meltdown |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/bal-sp.ravens10oct10,0,2126720.story |publisher=The Baltimore Sun |date=2005-10-10 |last=Hensley  |first=Jamison  |accessdate=2008-01-17[/tpl]
Two months later at the start of overtime during a game between the Detroit Lions and Green Bay Packers in December 2005, Carey was unable to locate a coin to use for the coin toss.[tpl]cite news |title=Can't Have Coin Toss Without Coin |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B02E0D91E31F930A25751C1A9639C8B63&n=Top/News/Sports/Pro%20Football/National%20Football%20League/Detroit%20Lions |date=2005-12-13 |publisher=The New York Times |accessdate=2007-12-01[/tpl]  He had given his coin to a child, who served as the Packers' honorary captain, at the game's opening kickoff.  The field judge was able to supply Carey with a penny.
Carey was the referee during a 2005-06 playoff game between the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Washington Redskins.  At the conclusion of a play during this game, Redskins safety Sean Taylor spat in the face of Buccaneers running back Michael Pittman.[tpl]cite news |title=Videotape Shows Taylor Spitting at Buc |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/12/AR2006011202258.html |publisher=The Washington Post |date=2006-01-13 |accessdate=2007-12-01[/tpl]  Pittman retaliated with a slap to Taylor's helmet. Carey could be heard through a live microphone immediately ejecting Taylor from the game. Head linesman Steve Stelljes conferred with Carey over Pittman's actions, but Carey decided not to penalize Pittman. When questioned about taking no action against Pittman by Redskins players, Carey said in response to being spat upon, "What would you do?"  Mike Pereira, the vice president of officiating, approved of Carey's handling of the incident saying that "offsetting personal fouls would not have been appropriate".  Pereira added, "If anybody didn't eject somebody for spitting in somebody's face, I'd be disappointed."
Nearly two years later, Carey was named referee of Super Bowl XLII. On working the NFL's championship game, Carey said it was a "personal honor" and understood the historical significance of being the first African American referee.[tpl]cite web |title=Exclusive Mike Carey interview |url=http://www.nfl.com/videos?videoId=09000d5d80674a73 |publisher=National Football League |date=2008-02-02 |accessdate=2008-02-04[/tpl] On the significance of the event, he said it was a "great sign of the evolution of our society that all barriers are eroding". During the fourth quarter, Carey's judgment was a factor in one of the important plays of the game.[tpl]cite news |title=Referee: I almost sacked Eli Manning  |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/giants/2008/02/07/2008-02-07_referee_i_almost_sacked_eli_manning-1.html |last=Vacchiano |first=Ralph |publisher=Daily News |date=2008-02-07 |accessdate=2008-02-17[/tpl] On third down, with just over a minute left in regulation, New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning received the snap in a shotgun formation and looked to pass the ball. New England Patriots defenders Richard Seymour, Jarvis Green, and Adalius Thomas grabbed and attempted to tackle Manning.  Manning escaped the two defenders and threw a 32-yard pass to wide receiver David Tyree. Under NFL rules, officials are required to stop play when a player is "in the grasp and control" of the defense. Carey determined that "grasp and control" was never achieved since Manning's forward momentum did not stop. Speaking about the play, Carey said, "I anticipated a sack. I didn't assume that was going to happen, but rarely do you see a quarterback escape when he's got that much weight on his back and being dragged by two or three guys who had a hold of him. I could see Manning's head was just straight ahead. He was trying to break free with desperation. Then all of a sudden he spun out and then he started to come right back at me."
