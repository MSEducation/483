==History==

A prototype of the MAB1 was first given to Batio in 2007, which he used at clinics and live shows, before it was mass produced and available to pre-order in 2008. The first batch were issued by Dean in July 2008, and Batio personally autographed and numbered the first 100 on July 14 at the Dean headquarters in Tampa, Florida. The MAB1 was not fitted with Batio's signature "Hands Without Shadows" pickup, as production of the guitar had already begun before it was completed.[tpl]cite web |url=http://deb13.proboards31.com/index.cgi?board=mabannouncements&action=display&thread=8793&page=1#137893 |title=Re: New MAB 1 Armorflame ad |author=Michael Angelo Batio |date=2008-06-21 |accessdate=2008-07-24 |publisher=Michael Angelo Batio Forum [/tpl]
