CATEGORIES: Elementary schools in Ottawa

Mutchmor Public School is an elementary school in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It is located in The Glebe neighbourhood at the corner of Fifth Avenue and Lyon. It is run by the Ottawa-Carleton District School Board
The original portion of the school was built in 1895 making Mutchmor one of the oldest schools in Ottawa. Only two other schools built in Ottawa in the late nineteenth century remain, with nearby First Avenue Public School being one. Further additions were made to the school in 1911 and 1920. The building is officially designated as a heritage structure. 
The school is home to nearly 400 students from junior kindergarten to grade six. Mutchmor provides many programs, including the regular English language program (also known as Core French), a Congregated Gifted program, and a Middle French immersion program. Students typically attend either Glashan Public School or Hopewell Public School for grades seven and eight.
In the 1990s Mutchmor was threatened with closure by the school board. Action by the local community ensured that Mutchmor stayed open, and enrollment is growing steadily. In 2005 Today's Parent magazine named Mutchmor one of the top 40 schools in Canada, highlighting how the school 'rose to the challenge'.
