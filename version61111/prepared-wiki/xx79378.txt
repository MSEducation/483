==Early life and education==

Mathis was born on March 6, 1977 and grew up in a rural area north of LaGrange, Georgia, a town 65 miles southwest of Atlanta. His father was a school bus driver, and his mother was a grocery store cashier.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.down-south.com/interviews/BubbaSparxxx/|title=Bubba Sparxxx Interview|last=Braxton|first=Charlie|work=Down-South.com|accessdate=2009-03-23[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] His closest neighbor, who lived half a mile away, introduced Mathis to rap music through mixtapes mailed from New York City. The music of 2 Live Crew was his introduction to hip hop; he began listening to West Coast gangsta rap such as N.W.A and Too Short and the Atlanta duo OutKast. With rapping as a hobby, Mathis was a tight end and linebacker for his high school's football team and earned All-Region honors in his senior year.[tpl]cite web|last=Birchmeier|first=Jason|title=Bubba Sparxxx > Biography|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p425589/biography|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|publisher=allmusic|year=2006|accessdate=2009-03-23[/tpl] Steve Herndon, a former offensive lineman for the NFL teams Atlanta Falcons and Denver Broncos, played football with Mathis during high school, according to an interview with Down-South.com.

==Career==

After high school Sparxxx moved to Athens, Georgia in 1996. In Athens, he met industry veteran (and now manager and business partner) Bobby Stamps. Stamps noticed Sparxxx rapping after a University of Georgia football game. Stamps arranged for Sparxxx to work with many artists in Athens and Atlanta to complete his first CD.  His first commercial CD release saw some success in Georgia, and the album Dark Days, Bright Nights caught the attention of Jimmy Iovine of Interscope Records. Sparxxx signed to Interscope Records and began working with record producers Timbaland and Organized Noize. The major-label reissue of Dark Days, Bright Nights, released via Timbaland's Beat Club Records imprint, which now included five collaborations with Timbaland and two with Organized Noise, debuted at #3 on the Billboard 200. In 2002, he had a minor hit being featured on Archie Eversole's "We Ready", which became popular for being played at sport events, such as football and basketball games.  In late 2003, he returned with his second album, Deliverance, which was critically acclaimed but sold poorly.
Sparxxx signed a recording contract with Virgin Records in 2004; under Virgin, Sparxxx released The Charm with singles "Ms. New Booty" and "Heat It Up". He left Virgin to establish his own label, New South Entertainment, which is distributed by E1 Records. In 2007, he released a mixtape with DJ Burn One titled Survive Till Ya Thrive. He stated in an interview that he planned on releasing an album to be called Miracle on Gamble Road, in 2012.  He is supposed to appear on Lil Wyte's album Still Doubted. In 2012, he signed to Backroad Records, a subsidiary of the independent label Average Joe's Entertainment, and recorded the song "Country Boy Coolin'" which was featured on Mud Digger Vol. 3, a compilation album released by Average Joe's on June 12, 2012.
In January 2013, Sparxxx released the video "Splinter" which featured Crucifix.
