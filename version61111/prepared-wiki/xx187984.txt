South Humber Bank Power Station is a 1285MW gas-fired power station on South Marsh Road at Stallingborough in North East Lincolnshire north of Healing and the A180 near the South Marsh Road Industrial Estate.
It is owned by Centrica Energy, being run as Centrica SHB Ltd.  The generation manager is Lee Read.  It is around two miles east of Immingham, and employs 64 people.  Centrica owns the most CCGT power stations (eight) in the UK, and South Humber Bank is its largest CCGT station. It is the only power station in North East Lincolnshire.  The site of SHBPS is around 500 metres by 400 metres in area (around 54 acres).  It is next door to the Synthomer plant.Synthomer

==History==

The site was chosen by Dalton Warner Davis, the Chartered Surveyors.Dalton Warner Davis
Construction started in September 1994. Phase 1 was completed in April 1997 with 750MW of power, and entered commercial service in September 1997. Phase 2 was started in November 1996 and was completed in January 1999, adding 510MW.ABB 1996 The plant was built by Switzerland's ABB.

===Ownership===

It was initially run by IVO Generation Services, a company owned by Finland's Fortum (Imatran Voima Oy). The site was owned by the consortium Humber Power Ltd, which was owned by Midland Power, ABB Energy Ventures, Tomen Group, Fortum Group, British Energy and TotalFinaElf. Humber Power Ltd was formed in 1991.
On 29 May 2001, Centrica (as GB Gas Holdings Ltd) bought 60% of the power station, and with 40% owned by Chanter Petroleum (part of TOTAL Midstream Holdings UK Ltd) from Humber Power Ltd.OFGEM 2001 The entire site was then run by Centrica, under the name South Humber Power Ltd.
In September 2005, the station was bought outright (100%) by Centrica, costing £150m (£46.5 million in cash). Centrica also run Glanford Brigg Power Station and the A part of Killingholme Power Station.

==Specification==

Cooling water is drawn from the River Humber. It is a CCGT type power station using natural gas.
Phase 1 consists of three 166MW gas turbines with three heat recovery steam generators. It was designed and built by a consortium of Cockerill Maintenance & Ingénierie (CMI) and International Combustion, and 255MW steam turbine.
Phase 2 consists of two 169MW gas turbines, two heat recovery steam generators and a 171MW steam turbine. It is similar to two CCGTs next-door to each other.
The gas turbines used are ABB Alstom GT 13E2 engines which normally produce 165MW each. Each gas turbine has 72 EV (conical pre-mix) burners. Exhaust gas leaves each turbine at 540C. The engines spin at 3000rpm.Large Centrica PDF The gas turbines are each connected to an ABB WY21 TEWAC turbo generator.
Exhaust gas from each gas turbine passes through an individual CMI heat recovery steam generator (HRSG). For Phase 1 the steam passes through an ABB steam turbine connected to an ABB 50WT hydrogen-cooled turbogenerator. For Phase 2 the steam passes through an ABB steam turbine connected to an ABB WY21 TEWAC (air-water-cooled) turbogenerator. The Phase 1 generator is larger than Phase 2 so needs to be cooled by hydrogen gas.
The terminal voltage of the generators is 15.75kV. Electricity enters the National Grid via a transformer at 400kV connected to a single pylon line. The engines can generate electricity for base load or for peak load operations. Performance of the power plant is dependent on local air temperature and humidity. It has a nominal thermal efficiency of 55%, but usually produces 51%.
In 2009 it produced 8,512 GWh of electricity.Centrica PDF
