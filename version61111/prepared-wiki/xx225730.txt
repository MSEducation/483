</ref> The school received an hostile inspection report which recommended the reintroduction of corporal punishment and expulsion, but Duane refused. In 1965, the newly formed [[Inner London Education Authority]] decided to close the school.<ref name= 'RHadminhist'/>
The case became well known largely due to the publication of Risinghill: Death of a Comprehensive School by Leila Berg in 1968.

===Later career===

After Risinghill controversy, Duane was never appointed a head teacher again. He became a lecturer at Garnett College of Education and wrote and lectured on his educational philosophies. In 1977 he received a MPhil from the University of Nottingham for his research on The Terrace, an experimental ROSLA (raising of the school leaving age) scheme, jointly organised by Royston Lambert head of Dartington Hall School and Alec Clegg of the West Riding Education Authority, to provide education for 15 year olds from Northcliffe School in Conisbrough who no longer saw relevance in standard education. He later published his research in 1995.[ref]
