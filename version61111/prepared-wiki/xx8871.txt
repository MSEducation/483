==Life==

Little is known about Nahum’s personal history. His name means "comforter," and he was from the town of Alqosh, (Nah 1:1) which scholars have attempted to identify with several cities, including the modern  `Alqush of Assyria and Capharnaum of northern Galilee.Nahum at The Catholic Encyclopedia He was a very nationalistic Hebrew however and lived amongst the Elkoshites in peace.Nahum, called "the Elkoshite," is the seventh in order of the minor prophets.

==Works==

Nahum's writings could be taken as prophecy or as history. One account suggests that his writings are a prophecy written in about 615 BC, just before the downfall of Assyria, while another account suggests that he wrote this passage as liturgy just after its downfall in 612 BC.Heaton, E.

The book was introduced in Calvin's Commentary[tpl]cite web | title=Commentaries on Twelve Minor Prophets | url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/calcom28.titlepage.html [/tpl] as a complete and finished poem:
Nahum, taking words from Moses himself, has shown in a general way what sort of "Being God is". The Reformation theologian Calvin argued, Nahum painted God by which  his nature must be seen, and "it is from that most memorable vision, when God appeared to Moses after the breaking of the tables."

==Tomb==

The tomb of Nahum is supposedly inside the synagogue at Alqosh, although there are other places outside Iraq that lay claim also to being the original “Elkosh” from which Nahum hailed.  Alquosh was abandoned by its Jewish population in 1948, when they were expelled, and the synagogue that purportedly houses the tomb is in a poor structural state, to the extent that the tomb itself is in danger of destruction.  The tomb underwent basic repairs in 1796. When all Jews were compelled to flee Alqosh in 1948, the iron keys to the tomb were handed to a Chaldean man by the name of Sami Jajouhana. Few Jews visit the historic site, yet Jajouhana continues to keep the promise he made with his Jewish friends, and looks after the tomb.Chaldean Man Keeps Promise With Jewish Friends A team of US/UK construction engineers, led by Huw Thomas, is currently planning ways to save the building and the tomb.RENOVATION - AL QUSH SYNAGOGUE AND THE TOMB OF NAHUM at tombofnahum.com Money has been allocated for proposed renovation in 2008.
