==Health effects==

A study commissioned by the UK's Food Standards Agency found that a mixture of food colors in combination with preservatives may increase observed symptoms of hyperactivity and may decrease levels of intelligence in children,Myomancy, 7 September 2007Artificial colourings as harmful as leaded petrol for children, Graham Tibbetts, Telegraph, 7 April 2008  but it is unclear which component of the mixture may be responsible for the effects.Do food dyes affect kids' behavior?, Melinda Fulmer, Los Angeles Times, October 13, 2008. Quinoline yellow is one of the colors that the Hyperactive Children's Support Group recommends be eliminated from the diet of children.
UK ministers have agreed that six colorings will be phased out by 2009.BBC bbc.co.uk - Ministers agree food colour ban 12 November 2008
The EFSA decided on 23 September 2009 to tighten the allowed Acceptable Daily Intake for Quinoline Yellow WS from 10 mg/kg to 0.5 mg/kg bodyweight per day. It has been reported to cause genotoxicity,PubMed.gov - The evaluation of the genotoxicity of two commonly used food colors: Quinoline Yellow (E 104) and Brilliant Black BN (E 151) 2004 dermatitis,ChemicalLand - QUINOLINE YELLOW urticaria and rhinitis.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2011[/tpl] 
The color additive can also increase the intake of aluminium beyond the tolerable weekly intake (TWI) of 1 mg/kg/week. Therefore the limit for aluminium may become adjusted to accommodate for this. Also the EFSA panel noted that the JECFA limit for lead is ≤ 2 mg/kg whereas the European Commission limit is ≤ 10 mg/kg.[tpl]cite web|title=EFSA ::.
