===History===

Cranbourne station opened on 1 October 1888 as a station on the  South Gippsland line that until 24 July 1993, was serviced by V/Line services to Leongatha.[tpl]cite journal|date=March 1997|title=Rail Passenger Service Withdrawals Since 1960|author=Chris Banger|journal=Newsrail|publisher=Australian Railway Historical Society|pages=pages 77–82[/tpl] 
However, the Victorian government still has plans to reintroduce rail services to Leongatha in the future as well as extending the electrified line 3.5 kilometres to Cranbourne East. The last regular train ran beyond Cranbourne on 15 January 1998, when the Koala Siding (near Nyora) to Spotswood station sand train ceased operation.[tpl]cite journal|date=February 1998|title=Farewell - The Sand Train|journal=Newsrail|publisher=Australian Railway Historical Society|pages=pages 71–76[/tpl]
