CATEGORIES: Multiple sclerosis, Epstein–Barr virus-associated diseases

Multiple sclerosis (MS), also known as disseminated sclerosis or encephalomyelitis disseminata, is an inflammatory disease in which the insulating covers of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord are damaged. This damage disrupts the ability of parts of the nervous system to communicate, resulting in a wide range of signs and symptoms,[tpl]cite journal |author=Compston A, Coles A |title=Multiple sclerosis |journal=Lancet |volume=372 |issue=9648 |pages=1502–17 |date=October 2008 |pmid=18970977 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61620-7 |url=[/tpl] including physical, mental, and sometimes psychiatric problems.[tpl]cite book|title=Bradley's neurology in clinical practice.|year=2012|publisher=Elsevier/Saunders|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=1-4377-0434-4|edition=6th ed.|author=Murray ED, Buttner EA, Price BH|editor=Daroff R, Fenichel G, Jankovic J, Mazziotta J|chapter=Depression and Psychosis in Neurological Practice[/tpl] MS takes several forms, with new symptoms either occurring in isolated attacks (relapsing forms) or building up over time (progressive forms). Between attacks, symptoms may go away completely; however, permanent neurological problems often occur, especially as the disease advances.
While the cause is not clear, the underlying mechanism is thought to be either destruction by the immune system or failure of the myelin-producing cells.[tpl]cite journal|last=Nakahara|first=J|coauthors=Maeda, M; Aiso, S; Suzuki, N|title=Current concepts in multiple sclerosis: autoimmunity versus oligodendrogliopathy.|journal=Clinical reviews in allergy & immunology|date=February 2012|volume=42|issue=1|pages=26–34|pmid=22189514|doi=10.1007/s12016-011-8287-6[/tpl] Proposed causes for this include genetics and environmental factors such as infections. MS is usually diagnosed based on the presenting signs and symptoms and the results of supporting medical tests.
There is no known cure for multiple sclerosis. Treatments attempt to improve function after an attack and prevent new attacks. Medications used to treat MS while modestly effective can have adverse effects and be poorly tolerated. Many people pursue alternative treatments, despite a lack of evidence. The long-term outcome is difficult to predict, with good outcomes more often seen in women, those who develop the disease early in life, those with a relapsing course, and those who initially experienced few attacks. Life expectancy is 5 to 10 years lower than that of an unaffected population.
As of 2008, between 2 and 2.5 million people are affected globally with rates varying widely in different regions of the world and among different populations. The disease usually begins between the ages of 20 and 50 and is twice as common in women as in men. The name multiple sclerosis refers to scars (sclerae—better known as plaques or lesions) in particular in the white matter of the brain and spinal cord. MS was first described in 1868 by Jean-Martin Charcot. A number of new treatments and diagnostic methods are under development.

==Signs and symptoms==

A person with MS can have almost any neurological symptom or sign; with autonomic, visual, motor, and sensory problems being the most common. The specific symptoms are determined by the locations of the lesions within the nervous system, and may include loss of sensitivity or changes in sensation such as tingling, pins and needles or numbness, muscle weakness, very pronounced reflexes, muscle spasms, or difficulty in moving; difficulties with coordination and balance (ataxia); problems with speech or swallowing, visual problems (nystagmus, optic neuritis or double vision), feeling tired, acute or chronic pain, and bladder and bowel difficulties, among others. Difficulties thinking and emotional problems such as depression or unstable mood are also common. Uhthoff's phenomenon, a worsening of symptoms due to exposure to higher than usual temperatures, and Lhermitte's sign, an electrical sensation that runs down the back when bending the neck, are particularly characteristic of MS. The main measure of disability and severity is the expanded disability status scale (EDSS), with other measures such as the multiple sclerosis functional composite being increasingly used in research.[tpl]cite journal |author=Kurtzke JF |title=Rating neurologic impairment in multiple sclerosis: an expanded disability status scale (EDSS) |journal=Neurology |volume=33 |issue=11 |pages=1444–52 |year=1983 |pmid=6685237 |doi=10.1212/WNL.33.11.1444 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Amato MP, Ponziani G |title=Quantification of impairment in MS: discussion of the scales in use |journal=Mult. Scler. |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=216–9 |date=August 1999 |pmid=10467378 |doi= 10.1191/135245899678846113|url=[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Rudick RA, Cutter G, Reingold S |title=The multiple sclerosis functional composite: a new clinical outcome measure for multiple sclerosis trials |journal=Mult. Scler. |volume=8 |issue=5 |pages=359–65 |date=October 2002 |pmid=12356200 |doi= 10.1191/1352458502ms845oa|url=[/tpl]
The condition begins in 85% of cases as a clinically isolated syndrome over a number of days with 45% having motor or sensory problems, 20% having optic neuritis, and 10% having symptoms related to brainstem dysfunction, while the remaining 25% have more than one of the previous difficulties. The course of symptoms occurs in two main patterns initially: either as episodes of sudden worsening that last a few days to months (called relapses, exacerbations, bouts, attacks, or flare-ups) followed by improvement (85% of cases) or as a gradual worsening over time without periods of recovery (10-15% of cases). A combination of these two patterns may also occur[tpl]cite journal|author=Lublin FD, Reingold SC; National Multiple Sclerosis Society (USA) Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials of New Agents in Multiple Sclerosis |title=Defining the clinical course of multiple sclerosis: results of an international survey |journal=Neurology |volume=46 |issue=4|pages=907–11|date=April 1996|pmid=8780061|doi=10.1212/WNL.46.4.907[/tpl] or people may start in a relapsing and remitting course that then becomes progressive later on. Relapses are usually not predictable, occurring without warning. Exacerbations rarely occur more frequently than twice per year. Some relapses, however, are preceded by common triggers and they occur more frequently during spring and summer.[tpl]cite journal|author=Tataru N, Vidal C, Decavel P, Berger E, Rumbach L |title=Limited impact of the summer heat wave in France (2003) on hospital admissions and relapses for multiple sclerosis |journal=Neuroepidemiology |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=28–32 |year=2006|pmid=16804331 |doi=10.1159/000094233[/tpl] Similarly, viral infections such as the common cold, influenza, or gastroenteritis increase their risk. Stress may also trigger an attack.[tpl]cite journal |author=Heesen C, Mohr DC, Huitinga I, et al.|title=Stress regulation in multiple sclerosis: current issues and concepts |journal=Mult. Scler. |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=143–8 |date=March 2007 |pmid=17439878 |doi=10.1177/1352458506070772[/tpl] Women with MS who become pregnant experience fewer relapses; however, during the first months after delivery the risk increases. Overall, pregnancy does not seem to influence long-term disability. Many events have not been found to affect relapse rates including vaccination, breast feeding, physical trauma,[tpl]cite journal|author=Martinelli V |title=Trauma, stress and multiple sclerosis |journal=Neurol. Sci. |volume=21|issue=4 Suppl 2 |pages=S849–52|year=2000 |pmid=11205361 |doi=10.1007/s100720070024 |url=http://link.springer-ny.com/link/service/journals/10072/bibs/00214%20Suppl%202/0021S849.htm[/tpl] and Uhthoff's phenomenon.

==Causes==

The cause of MS is unknown; however, it is believed to occur as a result of some combination of environmental factors such as infectious agents and genetics. Theories try to combine the data into likely explanations, but none has proved definitive. While there are a number of environmental risk factors and although some are partly modifiable, further research is needed to determine whether their elimination can prevent MS.

===Geography===

MS is more common in people who live farther from the equator, although exceptions exist. These exceptions include ethnic groups that are at low risk far from the equator such as the Samis, Amerindians, Canadian Hutterites, New Zealand Māori,[tpl]cite journal |author=Pugliatti M, Sotgiu S, Rosati G |title=The worldwide prevalence of multiple sclerosis |journal=Clin Neurol Neurosurg |volume=104 |issue=3 |pages=182–91 |date=July 2002|pmid=12127652|doi=10.1016/S0303-8467(02)00036-7|url=[/tpl] and Canada's Inuit, as well as groups that have a relatively high risk close to the equator such as Sardinians, Palestinians and Parsis. The cause of this geographical pattern is not clear. While the north-south gradient of incidence is decreasing, as of 2010 it is still present.
MS is more common in regions with northern European populations and the geographic variation may simply reflect the global distribution of these high-risk populations. Decreased sunlight exposure resulting in decreased vitamin D production has also been put forward as an explanation.[tpl]cite journal |author=Ascherio A, Munger KL, Simon KC |title=Vitamin D and multiple sclerosis|journal=Lancet Neurol |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=599–612 |date=June 2010 |pmid=20494325|doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(10)70086-7 [/tpl] A relationship between season of birth and MS lends support to this idea, with fewer people born in the northern hemisphere in November as compared to May being affected later in life.[tpl]cite journal |author=Kulie T, Groff A, Redmer J, Hounshell J, Schrager S|title=Vitamin D: an evidence-based review |journal=J Am Board Fam Med |volume=22 |issue=6 |pages=698–706 |year=2009|pmid=19897699|doi=10.3122/jabfm.2009.06.090037 |url=[/tpl] Environmental factors may play a role during childhood, with several studies finding that people who move to a different region of the world before the age of 15 acquire the new region's risk to MS. If migration takes place after age 15, however, the person retains the risk of his home country. There is some evidence that the effect of moving may still apply to people older than 15.

===Genetics===

MS is not considered a hereditary disease; however, a number of genetic variations have been shown to increase the risk. The probability is higher in relatives of an affected person, with a greater risk among those more closely related. In identical twins both are affected about 30% of the time, while around 5% for non-identical twins and 2.5% of siblings are affected with a lower percentage of half-siblings.[tpl]cite journal|last=Hassan-Smith|first=G|coauthors=Douglas, MR|title=Epidemiology and diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.|journal=British journal of hospital medicine (London, England : 2005)|date=October 2011|volume=72|issue=10|pages=M146-51|pmid=22041658[/tpl] If both parents are affected the risk in their children is 10 times that of the general population. MS is also more common in some ethnic groups than others.[tpl]cite journal|author=Rosati G|title=The prevalence of multiple sclerosis in the world: an update|journal=Neurol. Sci.|volume=22|issue=2|pages=117–39|date=April 2001|pmid=11603614|doi=10.1007/s100720170011[/tpl]
Specific genes that have been linked with MS include differences in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system—a group of genes on chromosome 6 that serves as the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). That changes in the HLA region are related to susceptibility has been known for over thirty years,[tpl]cite journal |author=Baranzini SE |title=Revealing the genetic basis of multiple sclerosis: are we there yet? |journal=Current Opinion in Genetics & Development |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=317–24 |date=June 2011|pmid=21247752 |pmc=3105160 |doi=10.1016/j.gde.2010.12.006 |url=[/tpl] and additionally this same region has been implicated in the development of other autoimmune diseases such as diabetes type I and systemic lupus erythematosus. The most consistent finding is the association between multiple sclerosis and alleles of the MHC defined as DR15 and DQ6. Other loci have shown a protective effect, such as HLA-C554 and HLA-DRB1*11. Overall, it has been estimated that HLA changes account for between 20 and 60% of the genetic predisposition. Modern genetic methods (genome-wide association studies) have discovered at least twelve other genes outside the HLA locus that modestly increase the probability of MS.

===Infectious agents===

Many microbes have been proposed as triggers of MS, but none have been confirmed. Moving at an early age from one location in the world to another alters a person's subsequent risk of MS. An explanation for this could be that some kind of infection, produced by a widespread microbe rather than a rare one, is related to the disease. Proposed mechanisms include the hygiene hypothesis and the prevalence hypothesis. The hygiene hypothesis proposes that exposure to certain infectious agents early in life is protective, the disease being a response to a late encounter with such agents. The prevalence hypothesis proposes that the disease is due to an infectious agent more common in regions where MS is common and where in most individuals it causes an ongoing infection without symptoms. Only in a few cases and after many years does it cause demyelination. The hygiene hypothesis has received more support than the prevalence hypothesis.
Evidence for a virus as a cause include: the presence of oligoclonal bands in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid of most people with MS, the association of several viruses with human demyelination encephalomyelitis, and the occurrence of demyelination in animals caused by some viral infection.[tpl]cite journal|author=Gilden DH|title=Infectious causes of multiple sclerosis|journal=The Lancet Neurology|volume=4|issue=3|pages=195–202|date=March 2005|pmid=15721830|doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(05)01017-3[/tpl] Human herpes viruses are a candidate group of viruses. Individuals having never been infected by the Epstein-Barr virus are at a reduced risk of getting MS, whereas those infected as young adults are at a greater risk than those having had it at a younger age. Although some consider that this goes against the hygiene hypothesis, since the non-infected have probably experienced a more hygienic upbringing, others believe that there is no contradiction, since it is a first encounter with the causative virus relatively late in life that is the trigger for the disease. Other diseases that may be related include measles, mumps and rubella.

===Other===

Smoking has been shown to be an independent risk factor for MS.  Stress may be a risk factor although the evidence to support this is weak. Association with occupational exposures and toxins—mainly solvents—has been evaluated, but no clear conclusions have been reached. Vaccinations were studied as causal factors; however, most studies show no association. Several other possible risk factors, such as diet and hormone intake, have been looked at; however, evidence on their relation with the disease is "sparse and unpersuasive". Gout occurs less than would be expected and lower levels of uric acid have been found in people with MS. This has led to the theory that uric acid is protective, although its exact importance remains unknown.[tpl]cite journal |author=Spitsin S, Koprowski H |title=Role of uric acid in multiple sclerosis |journal=Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. |volume=318 |issue= |pages=325–42 |year=2008 |pmid=18219824|doi= 10.1007/978-3-540-73677-6_13|url=[/tpl]

==Pathophysiology==

The three main characteristics of MS are the formation of lesions in the central nervous system (also called plaques), inflammation, and the destruction of myelin sheaths of neurons. These features interact in a complex and not yet fully understood manner to produce the breakdown of nerve tissue and in turn the signs and symptoms of the disease. Additionally MS is believed to be an immune-mediated disorder that develops from an interaction of the individual's genetics and as yet unidentified environmental causes. Damage is believed to be caused, at least in part, by attack on the nervous system by a person's own immune system.

===Lesions===

The name multiple sclerosis refers to the scars (sclerae – better known as plaques or lesions) that form in the nervous system. These lesions most commonly affect the white matter in the optic nerve, brain stem, basal ganglia, and spinal cord, or white matter tracts close to the lateral ventricles. The function of white matter cells is to carry signals between grey matter areas, where the processing is done, and the rest of the body. The peripheral nervous system is rarely involved.[tpl]cite journal|author=Compston A, Coles A|title=Multiple sclerosis|journal=Lancet|volume=359|issue=9313|pages=1221–31|date=April 2002|pmid=11955556|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(02)08220-X[/tpl]
To be specific, MS involves the loss of oligodendrocytes, the cells responsible for creating and maintaining a fatty layer—known as the myelin sheath—which helps the neurons carry electrical signals (action potentials). This results in a thinning or complete loss of myelin and, as the disease advances, the breakdown of the axons of neurons. When the myelin is lost, a neuron can no longer effectively conduct electrical signals. A repair process, called remyelination, takes place in early phases of the disease, but the oligodendrocytes are unable to completely rebuild the cell's myelin sheath.[tpl]cite journal |author=Chari DM |title=Remyelination in multiple sclerosis|journal=Int. Rev. Neurobiol. |volume=79 |issue= |pages=589–620 |year=2007 |pmid=17531860|doi=10.1016/S0074-7742(07)79026-8 |url=[/tpl] Repeated attacks lead to successively less effective remyelinations, until a scar-like plaque is built up around the damaged axons. These scars are the origin of the symptoms and during an attack magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) often shows more than ten new plaques. This could indicate that there is a number of lesions below which the brain is capable of repairing itself without producing noticeable consequences. Another process involved in the creation of lesions is an abnormal increase in the number of astrocytes due to the destruction of nearby neurons. A number of lesion patterns have been described.[tpl]cite journal |author=Pittock SJ, Lucchinetti CF |title=The pathology of MS: new insights and potential clinical applications |journal=Neurologist|volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=45–56 |date=March 2007 |pmid=17351524|doi=10.1097/01.nrl.0000253065.31662.37 [/tpl]

===Inflammation===

Apart from demyelination, the other sign of the disease is inflammation. Fitting with an immunological explanation, the inflammatory process is caused by T cells, a kind of lymphocyte that plays an important role in the body's defenses. T cells gain entry into the brain via disruptions in the blood–brain barrier. The T cells recognize myelin as foreign and attack it, explaining why these cells are also called "autoreactive lymphocytes".
The attack of myelin starts inflammatory processes, which triggers other immune cells and the release of soluble factors like cytokines and antibodies. Further breakdown of the blood–brain barrier, in turn cause a number of other damaging effects such as swelling, activation of macrophages, and more activation of cytokines and other destructive proteins. Inflammation can potentially reduce transmission of information between neurons in at least three ways. The soluble factors released might stop neurotransmission by intact neurons. These factors could lead to or enhance the loss of myelin, or they may cause the axon to break down completely.

===Blood–brain barrier===

The blood–brain barrier is a part of the capillary system that prevents the entry of T cells into the central nervous system. It may become permeable to these types of cells secondary to an infection by a virus or bacteria. After it repairs itself, typically once the infection has cleared, T cells may remain trapped inside the brain.  Gadolinium cannot cross a normal BBB and, therefore, Gadolinium-enhanced MRI is used to show BBB breakdowns.[tpl]cite journal |author=Ferré JC, Shiroishi MS, Law M |title=Advanced techniques using contrast media in neuroimaging |journal=Magn Reson Imaging Clin N Am |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=699–713 |date=November 2012 |pmid=23088946 |doi=10.1016/j.mric.2012.07.007 |url=[/tpl]

==Diagnosis==

Multiple sclerosis is typically diagnosed based on the presenting signs and symptoms, in combination with supporting medical imaging and laboratory testing. It can be difficult to confirm, especially early on, since the signs and symptoms may be similar to those of other medical problems.[tpl]cite journal|author=Trojano M, Paolicelli D|title=The differential diagnosis of multiple sclerosis: classification and clinical features of relapsing and progressive neurological syndromes |journal=Neurol. Sci. |volume=22 |issue=Suppl 2 |pages=S98–102 |date=November 2001 |pmid=11794488 |doi=10.1007/s100720100044 |url=http://link.springer-ny.com/link/service/journals/10072/bibs/122%20Suppl%202000/122%20Suppl%2020S98.htm[/tpl] The McDonald criteria, which focus on clinical, laboratory, and radiologic evidence of lesions at different times and in different areas, is the most commonly used method of diagnosis with the Schumacher and Poser criteria being of mostly historical significance.[tpl]cite journal|author=Poser CM, Brinar VV |title=Diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis: an historical review |journal=Clin Neurol Neurosurg |volume=106 |issue=3 |pages=147–58 |date=June 2004 |pmid=15177763 |doi=10.1016/j.clineuro.2004.02.004[/tpl] While the above criteria allow for a non-invasive diagnosis, some state that the only definitive proof is an autopsy or biopsy where lesions typical of MS are detected.[tpl]cite journal|author=McDonald WI, Compston A, Edan G, et al. |title=Recommended diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis: guidelines from the International Panel on the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis |journal=Annals of Neurology |volume=50 |issue=1 |pages=121–7 |date=July 2001 |pmid=11456302 |doi=10.1002/ana.1032[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|author=Polman CH, Reingold SC, Edan G, et al.|title=Diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis: 2005 revisions to the "McDonald Criteria"|journal=Annals of Neurology|volume=58|issue=6 |pages=840–6 |date=December 2005 |pmid=16283615|doi=10.1002/ana.20703[/tpl]
Clinical data alone may be sufficient for a diagnosis of MS if an individual has had separate episodes of neurologic symptoms characteristic of the disease. In those who seek medical attention after only one attack, other testing is needed for the diagnosis. The most commonly used diagnostic tools are neuroimaging, analysis of cerebrospinal fluid and evoked potentials. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and spine may show areas of demyelination (lesions or plaques). Gadolinium can be administered intravenously as a contrast agent to highlight active plaques and, by elimination, demonstrate the existence of historical lesions not associated with symptoms at the moment of the evaluation.[tpl]cite journal|author=Rashid W, Miller DH|title=Recent advances in neuroimaging of multiple sclerosis|journal=Semin Neurol|volume=28|issue=1|pages=46–55|date=February 2008|pmid=18256986|doi=10.1055/s-2007-1019127[/tpl] Testing of cerebrospinal fluid obtained from a lumbar puncture can provide evidence of chronic inflammation in the central nervous system. The cerebrospinal fluid is tested for oligoclonal bands of IgG on electrophoresis, which are inflammation markers found in 75–85% of people with MS. The nervous system in MS may respond less actively to stimulation of the optic nerve and sensory nerves due to demyelination of such pathways. These brain responses can be examined using visual- and sensory-evoked potentials.[tpl]cite journal |author=Gronseth GS, Ashman EJ |title=Practice parameter: the usefulness of evoked potentials in identifying clinically silent lesions in patients with suspected multiple sclerosis (an evidence-based review): Report of the Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology |journal=Neurology |volume=54 |issue=9 |pages=1720–5 |date=May 2000 |pmid=10802774 |doi=10.1212/WNL.54.9.1720|url=[/tpl]

===Clinical courses===

Several subtypes, or patterns of progression, have been described. Subtypes use the past course of the disease in an attempt to predict the future course. They are important not only for prognosis but also for treatment decisions. In 1996, the United States National Multiple Sclerosis Society described four clinical courses:
The relapsing-remitting subtype is characterized by unpredictable relapses followed by periods of months to years of relative quiet (remission) with no new signs of disease activity. Deficits that occur during attacks may either resolve or leave problems, the latter in about 40% of attacks and being more common the longer a person has had the disease. This describes the initial course of 80% of individuals with MS. When deficits always resolve between attacks, this is sometimes referred to as benign MS,[tpl]cite journal |author=Pittock SJ, Rodriguez M |title=Benign multiple sclerosis: a distinct clinical entity with therapeutic implications |journal=Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. |volume=318 |issue= |pages=1–17 |year=2008 |pmid=18219812 |doi=10.1007/978-3-540-73677-6_1 |url=[/tpl] although people will still build up some degree of disability in the long term. On the other hand, the term malignant multiple sclerosis is used to describe people with MS having reached significant level of disability in a short period of time.[tpl]cite book|last=Feinstein|first=A|title=The clinical neuropsychiatry of multiple sclerosis|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=052185234X|page=20|edition=2nd ed.[/tpl] The relapsing-remitting subtype usually begins with a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). In CIS, a person has an attack suggestive of demyelination, but does not fulfill the criteria for multiple sclerosis.[tpl]cite journal|author=Miller D, Barkhof F, Montalban X, Thompson A, Filippi M|title=Clinically isolated syndromes suggestive of multiple sclerosis, part I: natural history, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and prognosis|journal=Lancet Neurol|volume=4|issue=5|pages=281–8|date=May 2005|pmid=15847841|doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(05)70071-5[/tpl] 30 to 70% of persons experiencing CIS later develop MS.
Secondary progressive MS occurs in around 65% of those with initial relapsing-remitting MS, who eventually have progressive neurologic decline between acute attacks without any definite periods of remission. Occasional relapses and minor remissions may appear. The most common length of time between disease onset and conversion from relapsing-remitting to secondary progressive MS is 19 years.[tpl]cite journal|author=Rovaris M, Confavreux C, Furlan R, Kappos L, Comi G, Filippi M|title=Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis: current knowledge and future challenges |journal=Lancet Neurol|volume=5|issue=4|pages=343–54|date=April 2006|pmid=16545751|doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(06)70410-0[/tpl]
The primary progressive subtype occurs in approximately 10–20% of individuals, with no remission after the initial symptoms.[tpl]cite journal|author=Miller DH, Leary SM|title=Primary-progressive multiple sclerosis|journal=Lancet Neurol |volume=6|issue=10|pages=903–12|date=October 2007|pmid=17884680|doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(07)70243-0[/tpl] It is characterized by progression of disability from onset, with no, or only occasional and minor, remissions and improvements. The usual age of onset for the primary progressive subtype is later than of the relapsing-remitting subtype. It is similar to the age that secondary progressive usually begins in relapsing-remitting MS, around 40 years of age.
Progressive relapsing MS describes those individuals who, from onset, have a steady neurologic decline but also have clear superimposed attacks. This is the least common of all subtypes.
Unusual types of MS have been described; these include Devic's disease, Balo concentric sclerosis, Schilder's diffuse sclerosis, and Marburg multiple sclerosis. There is debate on whether they are MS variants or different diseases.[tpl]cite journal|author=Stadelmann C, Brück W |title=Lessons from the neuropathology of atypical forms of multiple sclerosis |journal=Neurol. Sci. |issue=Suppl 4 |pages=S319–22 |volume=25 |date=November 2004|pmid=15727225 |doi=10.1007/s10072-004-0333-1 [/tpl] Multiple sclerosis behaves differently in children, taking more time to reach the progressive stage. Nevertheless, they still reach it at a lower average age than adults usually do.

==Management==

Although there is no known cure for multiple sclerosis, several therapies have proven helpful. The primary aims of therapy are returning function after an attack, preventing new attacks, and preventing disability. As with any medical treatment, medications used in the management of MS have several adverse effects. Alternative treatments are pursued by some people, despite the shortage of supporting evidence.

===Acute attacks===

During symptomatic attacks, administration of high doses of intravenous corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone, is the usual therapy, with oral corticosteroids seeming to have a similar efficacy and safety profile.[tpl]cite cochrane|last=Burton|first=JM|coauthors=O'Connor, PW; Hohol, M; Beyene, J|title=Oral versus intravenous steroids for treatment of relapses in multiple sclerosis.|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|date=12 December 2012|issue=12|review=CD006921|pmid=23235634[/tpl] Although, in general, effective in the short term for relieving symptoms, corticosteroid treatments do not appear to have a significant impact on long-term recovery.[tpl]cite book|first=The National Collaborating Centre for Chronic Conditions|title=Multiple sclerosis : national clinical guideline for diagnosis and management in primary and secondary care|year=2004|publisher=Royal College of Physicians|location=London|isbn=1-86016-182-0|pages=54–57|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK48919/pdf/TOC.pdf|accessdate=6 February 2013|format=pdf|pmid=21290636[/tpl] The consequences of severe attacks that do not respond to corticosteroids might be treatable by plasmapheresis.

===Disease-modifying treatments===

====Relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis====

Eight disease-modifying treatments have been approved by regulatory agencies for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) including: interferon beta-1a, interferon beta-1b, glatiramer acetate, mitoxantrone, natalizumab, fingolimod, teriflunomide[tpl]cite press release|url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm319277.htm |title=FDA approves new multiple sclerosis treatment Aubagio |publisher=US FDA|date=12 September 2012 |accessdate=21 January 2013[/tpl] and dimethyl fumarate.[tpl]cite press release|url=http://www.biogenidec.com/press_release_details.aspx?ID=5981&ReqId=1801165|title=Biogen Idec’s TECFIDERA™ (Dimethyl Fumarate) Approved in US as a First-Line Oral Treatment for Multiple Sclerosis|publisher=Biogen Idec |date=27 March 2013|accessdate=4 June 2013[/tpl] Their cost effectiveness as of 2012 is unclear.[tpl]cite journal|last=Manouchehrinia|first=A|coauthors=Constantinescu, CS|title=Cost-effectiveness of disease-modifying therapies in multiple sclerosis.|journal=Current neurology and neuroscience reports|date=October 2012|volume=12|issue=5|pages=592–600|pmid=22782520|doi=10.1007/s11910-012-0291-6[/tpl]

====Progressive multiple sclerosis====

No treatment has been shown to change the course of primary progressive MS and as of 2011 only one medication, mitoxantrone, has been approved for secondary progressive MS.[tpl]cite book |author=Kellerman, Rick D.; Edward N.

====Adverse effects====

The disease-modifying treatments have several adverse effects. One of the most common is irritation at the injection site for glatiramer acetate and the interferons (up to 90% with subcutaneous injections and 33% with intramuscular injections).[tpl]cite journal|last=Balak|first=DM|coauthors=Hengstman, GJ; Çakmak, A; Thio, HB|title=Cutaneous adverse events associated with disease-modifying treatment in multiple sclerosis: a systematic review.|journal=Multiple sclerosis (Houndmills, Basingstoke, England)|date=December 2012|volume=18|issue=12|pages=1705–17|pmid=22371220|doi=10.1177/1352458512438239[/tpl] Over time, a visible dent at the injection site, due to the local destruction of fat tissue, known as lipoatrophy, may develop.

===Associated symptoms===

Both medications and neurorehabilitation have been shown to improve some symptoms, though neither changes the course of the disease.[tpl]cite journal |author=Kesselring J, Beer S |title=Symptomatic therapy and neurorehabilitation in multiple sclerosis |journal=Lancet Neurol |volume=4 |issue=10 |pages=643–52 |date=October 2005 |pmid=16168933 |doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(05)70193-9 |url=[/tpl] Some symptoms have a good response to medication, such as an unstable bladder and spasticity, while others are little changed. For neurologic problems, a multidisciplinary approach is important for improving quality of life; however, it is difficult to specify a 'core team' as many different health services may be needed at different points in time.
