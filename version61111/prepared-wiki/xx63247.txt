Sticker art (also known as sticker bombing, sticker slapping, slap tagging, and sticker tagging) is a form of street art in which an image or message is publicly displayed using stickers. These stickers may promote a political agenda, comment on a policy or issue, or comprise a subcategory of Graffiti.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2010[/tpl]
Stickers can be placed anywhere accessible, with a much lower risk of apprehension by officials enforcing anti–vandalism laws.
Sticker artists use a variety of label types, including inexpensively purchased and free stickers, such as the United States Postal Service's Label 228 or name tags. Label 228's are often used with hand-drawn art, and are quite hard to remove, leaving a white, sticky residue.
Sticker artists can design and print thousands of stickers at low cost using a commercial printing service or at home with a computer printer and self-adhesive labels.
Sticker artists also print their designs onto adhesive vinyl, which has a strong, permanent adhesive, is waterproof, and generally fade resistant. A variant type of adhesive vinyl, called "destructible", is used by some artists. Destructible vinyl decals are primarily used as tamper indicators on equipment and shipping containers. The difficult–to–remove nature of this material is attractive to sticker artists, including B.N.E. and Obey Giant.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/money/article2199875.ece |title=Poster boy with a difference|last=Blackburn|first=Virginia|date=20 October 2007|publisher=The Times|accessdate=15 March 2014[/tpl][tpl]paywall[/tpl]

Sticker artists often trade their work with each other in order to expand distribution. An artist's stickers may be distributed worldwide and end up adhered in places they themselves have never been to. These trades are sometimes arranged personally or through social networking sites.
