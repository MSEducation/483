==Early life and career==

Peter Matthew Siddle was born in Traralgon, Victoria. He grew up in Morwell, Gippsland, and began playing cricket at the age of 14 for the Latrobe Cricket Club.

In 2006 he attended the Academy again and was offered a full contract with the Victorian Bushrangers for the 2006–07 season. After that, despite suffering a number of shoulder injuries which limited his playing opportunities, he became a regular in the Victorian side.

==Test career==

After just twelve first-class matches and touring India with Australia A, Siddle was named in the national 15-man squad for the four-Test tour of India on 12 September 2008, as back up to established bowlers Brett Lee, Stuart Clark and Mitchell Johnson.  When Clark injured his elbow prior to the Second Test, Siddle was selected in the match squad.  He made his Test debut at the Punjab Cricket Association Stadium in Mohali on 16 October 2008. He picked up 3/114 in the first innings, finishing with match figures of four for 176.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/australia/engine/match/345670.html|title=Scorecard: India v Australia, 2nd Test at Mohali, 17–21 October 2008|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=2009-08-07[/tpl]
Siddle lost his position when Clark recovered, only to regain it when the elbow injury recurred prior to the First Test against South Africa at the WACA, 2008. He broke through with three wickets in front of his home crowd at the Melbourne Cricket Ground during the Boxing Day Test against South Africa on his way to figures of four for 81 in the first innings.[tpl]cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/australia/engine/match/351682.html|title=Scorecard: Australia v South Africa, 2nd Test at Melbourne, 26–30 December 2008|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=2009-08-07[/tpl]  Siddle backed this performance up in the next Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground, taking five for 59 in South Africa's first innings.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ausvrsa2008_09/engine/match/351683.html|title=Scorecard: Australia v South Africa, 3rd Test at Sydney 3–7 January 2009|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=2009-08-07[/tpl]  His efforts were not enough, however, to prevent Australia from succumbing to a historic home series defeat.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/series/351610.html|title=Results: South Africa in Australia Test Series 2008–09|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=2009-08-07[/tpl]
Siddle also gave a fine account of himself on the South African leg of the rubber, in which the Australians triumphed 2–1.  Going into the 2009 Ashes series, he had notched up 29 Test wickets at an average of 27.65.  That it had come in six Tests against the South Africans and one in India, and with an economy rate of only 2.57 an over, made his record still more impressive.Booth, Lawrence. "Myths; And stereotypes." The Spin, 30 June 2009. In the first Test of the 2009 Ashes Series, Siddle took 2/97 in the first day's play.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/engvaus2009/engine/current/match/345970.html|title=Scorecard:England v Australia, 1st Test at Cardiff, 8–12 July 2009|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=2009-07-09[/tpl] In the fourth Test of the 2009 Ashes Series, Siddle took 5/21 in the first day as his career best.
On 25 November 2010, Siddle's 26th birthday, he took a Test hat-trick amongst his six wickets in the first Test of the 2010–11 Ashes series, taking six for just 54 runs, his best ever in test match cricket as he bowled 16 overs in total.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/9226319.stm |title=Ashes: Peter Siddle hat-trick shocks England at Gabba |accessdate=2010-11-25|work=BBC Sport |date=25 November 2010[/tpl] On 29 December 2010, Siddle scored 40 in the 2nd innings of the 4th Ashes Test at the MCG, his highest score in first class cricket.
