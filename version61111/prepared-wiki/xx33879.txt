Gary Rich Burghoff (born May 24, 1943) is an American actor, known for playing Charlie Brown in the 1967 Off-Broadway musical You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown, and the character Corporal Walter Eugene "Radar" O'Reilly in the M*A*S*H movie and TV series.

==Life and career==

Burghoff was born in Bristol, Connecticut. He studied tap dance and became a proficient drummer, despite having a congenital deformity of three fingers on his left hand. He gained early experience acting for the Belfry Players of Williams Bay, Wisconsin.Program, "The Belfry Players... Twenty-Ninth Season of Plays," 1962In 1967 he originated the role of Charlie Brown in the original Off-Broadway production of You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown. He was the drummer for a band called the Relatives in 1968. Actress Lynda Carter was the band's singer. The group opened at the Sahara Hotel and Casino lounge in Las Vegas, Nevada and played there for three months. He and Carter remained friends, and she helped cast him in an episode of her later hit series The New Adventures of Wonder Woman, in the 1978 episode "The Man Who Wouldn't Tell".

===M*A*S*H===

Burghoff made his feature film debut in Robert Altman's MASH (1970). Although several actors from the original film made guest appearances in the television series, Burghoff was the only actor cast as a regular, continuing in the role of Radar O'Reilly. Although he ostensibly played the same character in the series that he played in the film, Burghoff has cited differences in the portrayal: "In the original feature film MASH, I created Radar as a lone, darker and somewhat sardonic character; kind of a shadowy figure. I continued these qualities for a short time until I realized that the TV MASH characters were developing in a different direction from the film characters. It became a group of sophisticated, highly educated Doctors (and one head nurse) who would rather be anywhere else and who understood the nature of the 'hell hole' they were stuck in. With Gelbart's help, I began to mold Radar into more innocent, naïve character as contrast to the other characters, so that while the others might deplore the immorality and shame of war (from an intellectual and judgmental viewpoint), Radar could just REACT from a position of total innocence."By Ken Levine
Burghoff was nominated for six Emmy Awards for M*A*S*H in the category of Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series and, of those nominations, he won an Emmy in 1977. The award was accepted on behalf of Burghoff by co-star Alan Alda.
Burghoff left M*A*S*H after the seventh season because of burnout and a desire to spend more time with his family, though he returned the following year to film a special two-part farewell episode, "Goodbye Radar." On the subject of his departure, Burghoff said, "Family, to me, became the most important thing... I was not available as a father because of my work. That doesn’t stop when the work stops. Whenever you go out as a family, you’re always torn from family to deal with public recognition."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.assistnews.net/Stories/2006/s06050004.htm | work=Assist News Service|title=Fighting for family, life after M*A*S*H|date=1989-08-25[/tpl]
As originally conceived, "Goodbye Radar" was supposed to be the final episode of season 7, but at the behest of CBS, it was expanded into a double-episode for the November sweeps the next season. Mike Farrell tried to persuade Burghoff to stay on the show, citing the lacklustre careers of former M*A*S*H regulars Larry Linville and McLean Stevenson after their departures.
Covering the conclusion of M*A*S*H for TV Guide in 1983, Burt Prelutsky wrote, "Although nobody wanted to be quoted for the record, the feelings about Gary Burghoff's leaving were fairly unanimous: loved Radar, hated Burghoff. As summed up by one of the principals: 'Gary had personality problems. He always felt there was a conspiracy against him. He was rude to everyone, but if anyone ever said anything back to him, he'd throw a tantrum. He had frequent spats with his cast members, particularly with Alan Alda. Once his other cast member, Mike Farrell told him that his problem was that he could dish it out but he couldn't take it, and Gary said, "And I'm getting real sick and tired of dishing it out." The poor guy didn't even realize what he'd said.'"[tpl]cite book | first = B | last = Prelutsky | chapter = So Long, 4077th: The Troops Scatter, but the Memories Linger | title = TV Guide | date = 1983-02-12 | pages = 21[/tpl]
Mike Farrell later said, "Gary Burghoff may well have been the best actor in the company, it's always seemed to me. His focus, his ability to find those little gems of behavior that made everything absolutely true were a marvel to behold."Mike Farrell Online

A Twitter feed purporting to be that of Gary Burghoff was created in December 2013.Dangerous Minds The account has frequently posted tweets criticizing Alan Alda. Comedian Patton Oswalt said, "Burghoff has retired to Florida with 40 years worth of career resentments and grudges and absolutely nothing to lose when it comes to airing them out over Twitter. Well, since he’s unverified, we can only assume this is the real Burghoff. However, it’s kind of a stretch to assume that an imposter would be able to dig up this much dirt on the behind-the-scenes shenanigans of the mid-70s run of Battle of the Network Stars.[tpl]cite news| http://patton-oswalt.musicnewshq.com/news/why-gary-burghoff-has-the-best-feed-on-twitter-death-and-taxes | work=Patton Oswalt | title=Why Gary Burghoff has the best feed on Twitter | date=2014-02-07[/tpl]
