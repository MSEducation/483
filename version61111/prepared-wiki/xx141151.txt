Timothy Andrew Tweats (born 18 April 1974) is a former English cricketer. He was a right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium-pace bowler who played for Derbyshire between 1992 and 1999, and for Staffordshire in 2000.
He made his debut for Derbyshire in a loss against Glamorgan, though, playing as a lower-middle order batsman, he barely disgraced himself, being caught at 24.
He did not play first-class cricket again until the 1995 season, spending all of 1993 and a significant portion of 1994 in the Second XI. A slow starter upon his return, he excelled in the 1997 season, where he hit his debut first-class century, before making a career-best score of 189, and finishing high in the batting averages for the season. During his high-scoring innings, Kim Barnett partnered him to a county record second-wicket stand of 417, a record which stands to this day.
In 2000 Tweats played for Staffordshire.
Tweats is currently head of Business and IT at Alleynes High School.
