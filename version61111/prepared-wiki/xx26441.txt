Jean-Bertrand Aristide (born 15 July 1953) is a Haitian former Catholic priest of the Salesian order and politician who served as Haiti's first democratically elected president.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1P2-7679593.html|title=Military ousts Haiti's leader, claims power President Aristide en route to France; fighting kills 26|publisher=The Boston Globe|date=1 October 1991[/tpl][tpl]Cite web|url=http://ijrl.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/4/2/217|title=Haiti: The impact of the 1991 coup|publisher=International Journal of Refugee Law|date=June 1992[/tpl] A proponent of liberation theology,How Our Governments Snuffed Out a Democracy And Kidnapped a President: A Modern Parable, Johann Hari, The Huffington Post, 17 September 2010Damning the Flood, Richard Pithouse, Mute Magazine, 14 October 2008 Aristide was appointed to a parish in Port-au-Prince in 1982 after completing his studies. He became a focal point for the pro-democracy movement first under Jean-Claude "Baby Doc" Duvalier and then under the military transition regime which followed. He won the Haitian general election, 1990-1991 with 67% of the vote and was briefly President of Haiti, until a September 1991 military coup. The coup regime collapsed in 1994 under US pressure and threat of force (Operation Uphold Democracy). Aristide was then President again from 1994 to 1996 and from 2001 to 2004. However, Aristide was ousted in a 2004 coup d'état, in which one of his former soldiers participated. He accused the United States of orchestrating the coup d'état against him with support from Jamaican Prime Minister P. J. Patterson among others.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/americas/03/01/aristide.claim/|title=Aristide says US deposed him in 'coup d'etat'|publisher=CNN|date=2 March 2004 | accessdate=6 May 2010[/tpl] Aristide was later forced into exile in the Central African Republic and South Africa.

==Early life and church career==

Aristide was born into poverty in Port-Salut, Sud Department. His father died three months after Aristide was born, and he later moved to Port-au-Prince with his mother. In 1958, Aristide started school with priests of the Salesian order.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://web.archive.org/web/19960101000000-20090802200407/http://edition.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/americas/02/16/haiti.aristide.ap/index.html|title=Aristide no stranger to struggle|publisher=Associated Press|date=16 February 2004|accessdate=30 January 2010[/tpl] He was educated at the College Notre Dame in Cap-Haïtien, graduating with honors in 1974. He then took a course of novitiate studies in La Vega, Dominican Republic before returning to Haiti to study philosophy at the Grand Seminaire Notre Dame and psychology at the State University of Haiti. After completing his post-graduate studies in 1979, Aristide traveled in Europe, studying in Italy, Greece, http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:y8pI62Nom-gJ:www.palmbeach.k12.fl.us/Multicultural/curriculum/Haiti/11JeanBertrandAristide.pdf+Jean-Bertrand+Aristide%27s+father+Greek&hl=el&gl=gr&sig=AHIEtbSKyUkP6nxU_lN51AFz7xsoeoxssQ and in the Palestinian town of Beit Jala at the Cremisan Monastery.

This did not go unnoticed by the regime's top echelons. Under pressure, the provincial delegate of the Salesian Order sent Aristide into three years of exile in Montreal. By 1985, as popular opposition to Duvalier's regime grew, Aristide was back preaching in Haiti. His Easter Week sermon, "A Call to Holiness," delivered at the cathedral of Port-au-Prince and later broadcast throughout Haiti, proclaimed, "The path of those Haitians who reject the regime is the path of righteousness and love."[tpl]Cite journal| last = Hallward| first = Peter| authorlink = Peter Hallward| title = Option Zero in Haiti| journal = New Left Review| volume = 27| issue = May–June 200| location = London| date = May–June 2004| url = http://newleftreview.org/A2507| accessdate =20 May 2010[/tpl]

==First presidency (1991–96)==

Following the violence at the aborted national elections of 1987, the 1990 elections were approached with caution. Aristide announced his candidacy for the presidency.  Following a six-week campaign, during which he dubbed his followers the "Front National pour le Changement et la Démocratie" (National Front for Change and Democracy, or FNCD), the "little priest" was elected President in 1990 with 67% of the vote in what is generally recognized as the first honest election in Haitian history. However, just eight months into his Presidency he was overthrown by a bloody military coup. He broke from FNCD and created the Struggling People's Organization (OPL,Organisation Politique "Lavalas") – "the flood" or "torrent" in Kréyòl.
A coup attempt against Aristide had taken place on 6 January, even before his inauguration, when Roger Lafontant, a Tonton Macoute leader under Duvalier, seized the provisional President Ertha Pascal-Trouillot and declared himself President. After large numbers of Aristide supporters filled the streets in protest and Lafontant attempted to declare martial law, the Army crushed the incipient coup.Collins, Edward Jr.; Cole, Timothy M. (1996), "Regime Legitimation in Instances of Coup-Caused Governments-in-Exile: The Cases of Presidents Makarios and Aristide", Journal of International Law & Practice 5(2), p220.
During Aristide's short-lived first period in office, he attempted to carry out substantial reforms, which brought passionate opposition from Haiti's business and military elite. He sought to bring the military under civilian control, retiring the Commander in Chief of the Army Hérard Abraham, initiated investigations of human rights violations, and brought to trial several Tontons Macoute who had not fled the country. He also banned the emigration of many well known Haitians until their bank accounts had been examined.Collins, Edward Jr.; Cole, Timothy M. (1996), "Regime Legitimation in Instances of Coup-Caused Governments-in-Exile: The Cases of Presidents Makarios and Aristide", Journal of International Law & Practice 5(2), p219. His relationship with the National Assembly soon deteriorated, and he attempted repeatedly to bypass it on judicial, Cabinet and ambassadorial appointments. His nomination of his close friend and political ally, René Préval, as Prime Minister, provoked severe criticism from political opponents overlooked, and the National Assembly threatened a no-confidence vote against Préval in August 1991. This led to a crowd of at least 2000 at the National Palace, which threatened violence; together with Aristide's failure to explicitly reject mob violence this permitted the junta which would topple him to accuse him of human rights violations.

===1991 coup d'état===

In September 1991 the army performed a coup against him (1991 Haitian coup d'état), led by Army General Raoul Cédras, who had been promoted by Aristide in June to Commander in Chief of the Army. Aristide was deposed on 29 September 1991, and after several days sent into exile, his life only saved by the intervention of US, French and Venezuelan diplomats.Collins, Edward Jr.; Cole, Timothy M. (1996), "Regime Legitimation in Instances of Coup-Caused Governments-in-Exile: The Cases of Presidents Makarios and Aristide", Journal of International Law & Practice 5(2), p199. In accordance with the requirements of Article 149 of the Haitian Constitution, Superior Court Justice Joseph Nérette was installed as Président Provisoire to serve until elections were held within 90 days of Aristide's resignation. However, real power was held by army commander Raoul Cédras.[tpl]Cite news| date =1 October 1991| title =Leader of Haiti Ousted Military Takes Over After Seizing Aristide| work =St. Louis Post-Dispatch |format = reprint| url =http://bailey83221.livejournal.com/99074.html[/tpl] The elections were scheduled, but were canceled under pressure from the United States Government.

A campaign of terror against Aristide supporters was started by Emmanuel Constant after Aristide was forced out. In 1993, Constant, who had been on the CIA's payroll as an informant since 1992, organized the Front for the Advancement and Progress of Haïti (FRAPH), which targeted and killed Aristide supporters.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-11-02/news/mn-52438_1_house-intelligence-committee|author=Jim Mann|title= Congress to Probe CIA-Haiti Ties: Reports say agency financed some leaders involved in coup|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=2 November 1993[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/cia-helped-to-set-up-terror-group-in-haiti-1441438.html|author=Rupert Cornwell|title=CIA 'helped to set up terror group' in Haiti|publisher=The Independent|date=7 October 1994 | location=London[/tpl][tpl]Cite web|url=http://live.thenation.com/doc/20051212/weisbrot|author= Mark Weisbrot|title=Undermining Haiti|publisher=The Nation|date=22 November 2005[/tpl]
Aristide spent his exile first in Venezuela and then in the United States, working to develop international support. A United Nations trade embargo during Aristide's exile, intended to force the coup leaders to step down, was a strong blow to Haiti's already weak economy.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19930827&slug=1717922|author=Victoria Graham|title=UN Ready To End Haiti Sanctions|publisher=The Seattle Times|date=27 August 1993[/tpl] President George H.W.

In addition to this trade with the US, the coup regime was supported by massive profits from the drug trade thanks to the Haitian military's affiliation with the Cali Cartel and the drug-affiliated government in the neighboring Dominican Republic; Aristide publicly stated that his own pursuit of arresting drug dealers was one event that prompted the coup by drug-affiliated military officials Raul Cedras and Michel Francois (a claim echoed by his former Secretary of State Patrick Elie). Rep. John Conyers (D-Michigan) expressed concern that the only US government agency to publicly recognize the Haitian junta's role in drug trafficking was the DEA, and that despite a wealth of evidence provided by the DEA proving the junta's drug connections, the Clinton administration downplayed this factor rather than use it as a hedge against the junta (as the US government had done against Manuel Noriega). Conyers expressed concern that this silence was due to the CIA's connections to these military officers dating back to the creation of the Haitian Intelligence service known as SIN, as Alan Nairn's research has shown: "We have turned a very deaf ear to what is obviously a moving force... it leads you to wonder if our silence is because we knew this was going on and of our complicity in drug activity..."[tpl]Cite news|url=http://globalresearch.ca/articles/BER402A.html|author=Dennis Bernstein|title=The CIA Haitian Connection|publisher=Pacific News Service|date=20 October 1993[/tpl] Nairn in particular alleged that the CIA's connections to these drug traffickers in the junta not only dated to the creation of SIN, but were ongoing during and after the coup. Nairn's claims are confirmed in part by revelations of Emmanuel Constant regarding the ties of his FRAPH organization to the CIA before and during the coup government.

===1994 return===

Following massive peaceful public pro-Aristide demonstrations by Haitian expats (estimated over 250,000 people at a demonstration in NY City) urging Bill Clinton to deliver on his election promise to return Aristide to Haiti, US and international pressure (including United Nations Security Council Resolution 940 on 31 July 1994), persuaded the military regime to back down and US troops were deployed in the country by President Bill Clinton. On 15 October 1994, the Clinton administration permitted Aristide to return to Haiti to complete his term in office on the condition that he adopt the economic program of the defeated US backed candidate in the 1990 elections, a former World Bank official who had received 14% of the vote. As democracy was thereby restored, the World Bank announced that: "The renovated state must focus on an economic strategy centered on the energy and initiative of Civil Society, especially the private sector, both national and foreign.""Harvest of Hunger: The United States in Haiti" Institute for Food and Development Policy, 8 February 2005[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/16/world/mission-haiti-scene-for-aristide-s-followers-every-step-dance-every-cheer-song.html|title=For Aristide's Followers, Every Step Is a Dance, Every Cheer a Song|last= Manegold (AP)|first=Catherine S.|date=16 October 1994|work=Mission to Haiti: The Scene|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=14 February 2010[/tpl]

That much is evident from the distended stomachs of children in villages like Pont-Sonde, the throngs of women seeking jobs at 30 cents an hour in sweatshops owned by U.S. clothing manufacturers and the daily street demonstrations through the slums of Port-au-Prince by laid-off government employees.""Push To Free Market Hard On Haiti" The Washington Post, 16 April 2000
Moreover, immediately after the Clinton administration allowed Aristide to return to office, in a series of private meetings, Administration officials admonished Aristide to put aside the rhetoric of class warfare and seek instead to reconcile Haiti’s tiny elite sector and poor majority. The Administration also urged Aristide to stick closely to neoliberal economics and to abide by the Caribbean nation’s constitution — which gives substantial political power to the Parliament while imposing tight limits on the Executive. Administration officials demanded that Aristide reach out to some of his political opponents in setting up his new government to set up a broad-based coalition regime. The Administration made it clear to Aristide that if he failed to reach a consensus with Parliament, the United States would withdraw support for his government."U.S. Cautions Aristide Over Divisive Action" The Los Angeles Times, 17 September 1994
Aristide disbanded the Haitian army, and established a civilian police force. Aristide's first term ended in February 1996, and the constitution did not allow him to serve consecutive terms. There was some dispute over whether Aristide, prior to new elections, should serve the three years he had lost in exile, or whether his term in office should instead be counted strictly according to the date of his inauguration; it was decided that the latter should be the case. René Préval, a prominent ally of Aristide and Prime Minister in 1991 under Aristide, ran during the 1995 presidential election and took 88% of the vote. There was about 25% participation in these elections.[tpl]Verify credibility|date=February 2010[/tpl][tpl]Verify credibility|date=February 2010[/tpl]Haiti Overview from american.edu
Knight-Ridder reports that "The United States both the Clinton and Bush administrations failed to take many steps that it had promised to choke the flow of money and goods to the Haitian dictators and their wealthy supporters. According to documents and interviews with federal officials, investigators and targets of the sanctions, the U.S. government:
 --Never seized U.S. homes owned by coup supporters, despite a vow to the contrary.
 --Eroded its own embargo by buying baseballs and black-market gasoline from alleged backers of the regime and training military men who worked for it.
--Subverted its own goals by granting embargo exemptions to U.S. companies and wealthy Haitians.
--Delayed freezing Haitian leaders' assets for almost 15 months after the coup. By that time, the Bank of Boston found only 50.71 Haitian gourdes, worth about $1.10, in the accounts of Brig. Gen. Philippe Biamby, the Haitian army's chief of staff.
But more serious complaints - such as charges that Texaco distributed tankers of fuel - were allegedly left on the back burner. Now the U.S. attorney's office and the General Accounting Office are examining the Texaco case and the handling of the embargo by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, the little-known agency that enforces sanctions. Investigators want to know if OFAC - or some other agency - bowed to political or business pressures and deliberately avoided taking action against sanction violators. OFAC says it administered the Haiti embargo "consistent" with instructions from the White House, the State Department and the National Security Council. It didn't run an airtight embargo, because it wasn't told to run an airtight embargo.""Poorly Enforced Sanctions Botch U.S. Embargo Of Haiti" Knight-Ridder Newspapers, 3 November 1994

==Opposition (1996–2001)==

In late 1996, Aristide broke from the OPL over what he called its "distance from the people" and created a new political party, the Fanmi Lavalas. The OPL, holding the majority in the Sénat and the Chambre des Députés, renamed itself the Organisation du Peuple en Lutte, maintaining the OPL acronym.
The Fanmi Lavalas "won" the 2000 legislative election in May, but a number of Senate seats which should have had second-round runoffs were allocated to Lavalas candidates which, while leading, had not achieved a first-round majority of all votes cast. Fanmi Lavalas controlled the Provisional Election Commission which made the decision.[tpl]Cite journal|last=Dailey|first=Peter |date=13 March 2003|title=Haiti: The Fall of the House of Aristide|journal=New York Review of Books|publisher=nybooks.com|volume=50|issue=4|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/16126|accessdate=14 February 2010[/tpl] Aristide then was elected later that year in the 2000 presidential election, an election boycotted by most opposition political parties, now organised into the Convergence Démocratique.

===2004 coup d'état===

Although Aristide continued to command widespread support among Haitians, the Washington Post informed their readers that regime change was looming on 21 November 2003: "Aristide has pushed with mixed success a populist agenda of higher minimum wages, school construction, literacy programs, higher taxes on the rich and other policies that have angered an opposition movement run largely by a mulatto elite that has traditionally controlled Haiti's economy.""Armed attacks increase pressure on Haitian leader / Civilian opposition movement targets popular Aristide" The Washington Post, 21 November 2003 In the three years leading up to the coup, the nation's already moribund economy further deteriorated and the government ground to a halt as the opposition refused to participate in elections. "Aristide was espousing change in Haiti, fundamental populist change," said Robert Maguire, a Haiti scholar who has criticized American policy as insufficiently concerned with Haiti's poor. "Right away, he was viewed as a threat by very powerful forces in Haiti." President Aristide promised not only to give voice to the poor in the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, but also to raise the minimum wage and force businesses to pay taxes. He rallied supporters with heated attacks on the United States, a tacit supporter of past dictatorships and a major influence in Haitian affairs.
In February 2004, the assassination of gang leader Amiot Metayer sparked a violent rebellion that culminated in Aristide's removal from office. Amiot's brother, Buteur Metayer, blamed Aristide for the assassination, and used this as an argument given in order to form the National Revolutionary Front for the Liberation of Haiti. Joined by other groups the rebels quickly took control of the North, and eventually laid siege to, and then invaded, the capital. Under disputed circumstances, Aristide was flown out of the country by the U.S. on 28 February 2004.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3543355.stm|title=Haiti's Aristide defiant in exile|publisher=BBC News|date=8 March 2004[/tpl] Jamaican Prime Minister P. J. Patterson released a statement saying "we are bound to question whether his resignation was truly voluntary, as it comes after the capture of sections of Haiti by armed insurgents and the failure of the international community to provide the requisite support. The removal of President Aristide in these circumstances sets a dangerous precedent for democratically elected governments anywhere and everywhere, as it promotes the removal of duly elected persons from office by the power of rebel forces."
After Aristide was removed from Haiti, looters raided his villa.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://web.archive.org/web/19960101-re_/http://edition.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/americas/03/01/aristide.home.ap/index.html|title=Looters pick through Aristide's villa: Letters about the CIA, FBI left behind|last=Associated Press|date=1 March 2004|publisher=CNN|accessdate=29 January 2010[/tpl] Most barricades were lifted the day after Aristide left as the shooting had stopped; order was maintained by Haitian police, along with armed rebels and local vigilante groups.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/americas/03/01/haiti.scene.reut/index.html|title=Haitians emerge to work, or party|last=Reuters|date=1 March 2004|publisher=CNN|accessdate=29 January 2010[/tpl] Almost immediately after the Aristides were transported from Haiti, Prime Minister of Jamaica, P.J. Patterson, dispatched a Member of Parliament, Sharon Hay-Webster, to the Central African Republic. The leadership of that country agreed that Aristide and his family could go to Jamaica. The Aristides were in the island for several months until the Jamaican government gained acceptance by the Republic of South Africa for the family to relocate there.
Aristide later stated that France and the U.S. had a role in what he termed "a kidnapping" that took him from Haiti to South Africa via the Central African Republic.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v26/n08/farm01_.html|title=Who removed Aristide?|author=Paul Farmer|publisher=London Review of Books|date=15 April 2004[/tpl] However, authorities said his temporary asylum there had been negotiated by the United States, France and Gabon.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://web.archive.org/web/19960101-re_/http://edition.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/africa/03/01/centralaf.aristide.ap/index.html|title=Aristide arrives for African exile|last=Associated Press|date=1 March 2004|publisher=CNN International|accessdate=29 January 2010[/tpl] On 1 March 2004, U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-CA), along with Aristide family friend Randall Robinson, reported Aristide had told them that he had been forced to resign and had been abducted from the country by the United States and that he had been held hostage by an armed military guard.[tpl]Cite web| title = Rep Maxine Waters: Aristide Says 'I Was Kidnapped'| publisher = Democracy Now| url =http://www.democracynow.org/2004/3/1/rep_maxine_waters_aristide_says_i/index.pl?issue=20040301 | accessdate=21 July 2006[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] According to Rep. Maxine Waters D-California, Mildred Aristide called her at her home at 6:30 am to inform her "the coup d'etat has been completed", and Jean-Bertrand Aristide said the U.S. Embassy in Haiti's chief of staff came to his house to say he would be killed "and a lot of Haitians would be killed" if he refused to resign immediately and said he "has to go now." Aristide's letter, which is described as his resignation, does not actually have Aristide as clearly and officially resigning.  Rep. Charles Rangel, D-New York expressed similar words, saying Aristide had told him he was "disappointed that the international community had let him down" and "that he resigned under pressure" – "As a matter of fact, he was very apprehensive for his life. They made it clear that he had to go now or he would be killed." When asked for his response to these statements Colin Powell said that "it might have been better for members of Congress who have heard these stories to ask us about the stories before going public with them so we don't make a difficult situation that much more difficult" and he alleged that Aristide "did not democratically govern or govern well". CARICOM, an organization of Caribbean countries that included Haiti, called for a United Nations investigation into Aristide's removal, but were reportedly pressured by the U.S. and France to drop their request. Some observers suggest the rebellion and removal of Aristide were covertly orchestrated by these two countries.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines04/0413-08.htm|author=Thalif Deen|title=US, France Block UN Probe of Aristide Ouster|publisher=Inter Press Service|date=13 April 2004[/tpl][tpl]Cite web|url=http://live.thenation.com/doc/20051212/weisbrot|author=Mark Weisbrot|title=Undermining Haiti|publisher=The Nation|date=22 November 2005[/tpl] In a 2006 interview, Aristide said the United States went back on their word regarding compromises he made with them over privatization of enterprises to ensure that part of the profits would go to the Haitian people and then "relied on a disinformation campaign" to discredit him.An Interview with Jean-Bertrand Aristide Aristide's interview was conducted in French, in Pretoria, on 20 July 2006; originally published in London Review of Books, 19 February 2007

After being cast into exile, in mid-2004 Aristide, his family, and bodyguards were welcomed to South Africa by several cabinet ministers, 20 senior diplomats, and a guard of honour.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/southafrica/1463372/Mbeki-rolls-out-the-red-carpet-for-exile-Aristide.html|title=Mbeki rolls out the red carpet for exile Aristide|last=Munnion|first=Christopher |date=1 June 2004|publisher=Telegraph co.uk|accessdate=14 February 2010 | location=London[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=13&art_id=vn20040601020633394C195402|title=Warm welcome for Aristide |last=Momberg|first=Eleanor |date=1 June 2004|publisher=Independent Online (IOL)|accessdate=14 February 2010[/tpl] Receiving a salary from and provided staff by the South African government,[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=13&art_id=vn20090625110116436C282577|title=Ex president living it up in SA |last=Political Bureau|date=25 June 2009|publisher=Independent Online (IOL)|accessdate=14 February 2010[/tpl] Aristide lived with his family in a government villa in Pretoria.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jan/15/haiti-exiled-former-president-aristide|title=Haiti's exiled former president vows to return|publisher=Guardian News and Media|date=15 January 2010 | location=London | first=David | last=Smith | accessdate=6 May 2010[/tpl] In South Africa, Aristide became an honorary research fellow at the University of South Africa, learned Zulu, and on 25 April 2007, received a doctorate in African Languages."Exiled Aristide gets SA doctorate", iafrica.com, 26 April 2007.
On 21 December 2007, a speech by Aristide marking the new year and Haiti's Independence Day was broadcast, the fourth such speech since his exile; in the speech he criticized the 2006 presidential election in which Préval was elected, describing it as a "selection," in which "the knife of treason was planted" in the back of the Haitian people."Exiled former Haitian president stirs supporters with speech", Associated Press (International Herald Tribune), 22 December 2007.

===Return to Haiti===

In a 2008 United States Embassy cable, former US Ambassador to Haiti, Janet Sanderson emphasizes that: "A premature departure of MINUSTAH would leave the Haitian government...vulnerable to...resurgent populist and anti-market economy political forces—reversing gains of the last two years. MINUSTAH is an indispensable tool in realizing core USG government policy interests in Haiti.""SUBJECT: WHY WE NEED CONTINUING MINUSTAH PRESENCE IN HAITI" U.S. Embassy Port Au Prince, 2008-10-01 15:48
At a high-level meeting on 2 August 2006, top US and UN officials declared: "Aristide Movement Must Be Stopped."
The cable describes how former Guatemalan diplomat Edmond Mulet, then chief of MINUSTAH "urged US legal action against Aristide to prevent the former president from gaining more traction with the Haitian population and returning to Haiti."
At Mulet’s request, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan urged South Africa’s President Thabo Mbeki "to ensure that Aristide remained in South Africa.""Haiti: A/s Shannon's Meeting With Minustah Srsg" U.S. Embassy Port Au Prince (Haiti), Wed, 2 August 2006 19:01 UTC

On 7 November 2010, in an exclusive interview ( the last given before his return to Haiti) with independent reporter Nicolas Rossier in Eurasia Review and the Huffington Post, Aristide declared that the 2010 elections were not inclusive of his party Fanmi Lavalas and therefore not fair and free.

On 17 March 2011, Aristide departed for Haiti from his exile in South Africa. U.S. President Barack Obama had asked South African President Jacob Zuma to delay Aristide's departure to prevent him from returning to Haiti before a presidential run-off election scheduled for Sunday. Aristide's party was barred from participating in the elections, and the U.S. fears his return could be "destabilizing".[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/returning-to-haiti-aristide-says-haitians-who-fought-for-democracy-are-happy-hes-coming-home/2011/03/18/ABImuxo_story.html| title=Returning to Haiti, Aristide says Haitians who fought for democracy are happy he’s coming home| publisher=Washington Post| date=18 March 2011| deadurl=yes[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=December 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl] On Friday, 18 March 2011, he arrived at Port-au-Prince airport, and was greeted by thousands of supporters.[tpl]cite news| url=http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE72I01L20110319| author=Joseph Guyler Delva and Pascal Fletcher| title=Aristide makes triumphant Haiti return before vote| publisher=Reuters Africa| date=19 March 2011[/tpl] He told the crowd waiting at the airport, "The exclusion of Fanmi Lavalas is the exclusion of the Haitian people. In 1804, the Haitian revolution marked the end of slavery. Today, may the Haitian people end exiles and coup d’états, while peacefully moving from social exclusion to inclusion."
Former Haiti President Jean-Bertrand Aristide is once again in the cross-hairs of the US government, this time being accused of pocketing millions of dollars in bribes from Miami businesses. Aristide’s lawyer, Ira Kurzban, declined to comment about the Justice Department’s investigation because the ex-president hasn’t been charged with any crime. But, Kurzban said: "I view this as part of the same smear campaign that the United States has orchestrated against Aristide since he was first elected in 1990." The revelation that federal officials are still pursuing Aristide, years after a U.S. grand jury investigation failed to nab him on drug-trafficking and money-laundering allegations, comes at a politically charged time in Haiti. Haitian media reported that President Michel Martelly’s government had indicted Aristide for corruption and drug trafficking during his rule, immediately triggering anger among his supporters. Haiti’s justice minister told The Miami Herald the reports were false.
Thousands marched through the streets of Haiti’s capital, singing pro-Aristide slogans while denouncing Martelly, to mark the eighth anniversary of Aristide’s ouster from power on 29 February 2004. The demonstration — the biggest anti-Martelly protest since he came to power in May — showed that Aristide still enjoys a measure of popularity. He returned to Haiti from South Africa on 18 March 2011 over the strong objections of the Obama administration.
The trial of Duperval, Haiti Teleco’s former director of international relations, highlights the U.S. Justice Department’s persistence in pursuing the bribery case and Aristide. Some question the zeal. The U.S. government may be sending a signal to Aristide, called Titid by his admirers, to think twice about trying to re-enter the political scene, observers said. "The display of popular support for Aristide is very worrisome to the U.S., so indicting Titid before a potential comeback makes perfect sense," said Robert Fatton, a Haiti expert at the University of Virginia. Unless the Justice Department has an air-tight case, arresting Aristide could have volatile consequences, observers said."Miami bribery probe zeroes in on Haiti's ex-leader Aristide" The Miami Herald, 03.03.12

==Accomplishments==

Under President Aristide's leadership, his party implemented many major reforms. These included greatly increasing access to health care and education for the general population; increasing adult literacy and protections for those accused of crimes; improving training for judges, prohibiting human trafficking, disbanding the Haitian military (which primarily had been used against the Haitian people), establishing improved human rights and political freedom; doubling the minimum wage, instituting land reform and assistance to small farmers, providing boat construction training to fishermen, establishing a food distribution network to provide low cost food to the poor at below market prices, building low-cost housing, and attempting to reduce the level of government corruption.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.zmag.org/znet/viewArticle/4804|author=Stephen Lendman|title=Achievements Under Aristide, Now Lost|publisher=ZNet|date=16 December 2005[/tpl]

===Achievements in education===

During successive Lavalas administrations, Jean Bertrand Aristide and Rene Preval built 195 new primary schools and 104 secondary schools. Prior to Aristide's election in 1990, there were just 34 secondary schools nationwide. Lavalas also provided thousands of scholarships so that children could afford to attend church/private schools. Between 2001 and 2004, the percentage of children enrolled in primary school education rose to 72%, and an estimated 300,000 adults took part in Lavalas sponsored adult literacy campaigns. This helped the adult literacy rate rise from 35% to 55%.Hallward, Peter. Damming the Flood: Haiti, Aristide and the Politics of Containment. Verso Press, 2007, pg. 133

===Achievements in health care===

In addition to numerous educational advances, Aristide and Lavalas embarked on an ambitious plan to develop the public primary health care system with Cuban assistance. Since the devastation unleashed by Hurricane George in 1998, Cuba entered a humanitarian agreement with Haiti whereby Haitian doctors would be trained in Cuba, and Cuban doctors would work in rural areas. At the time of the 12 January earthquake, 573 doctors had been trained in Cuba.Edmonds, Kevin. The Undermining of Haitian Healthcare: Setting the Stage for Disaster. NACLA, 22 February 2010
Despite operating under an aid embargo, the Lavalas administration succeeded in reducing the infant mortality rate as well as reducing the percentage of underweight newborns.Hallward, Peter. Damming the Flood: Haiti, Aristide and the Politics of Containment. Verso books, 2007, pg. 134 A successful AIDS prevention and treatment program was also established, leading the Catholic Institute for International Relations to state, the "incredible feat of slowing the rate of new infections in Haiti has been achieved despite the lack of international aid to the Haitian government, and despite the notable lack of resources faced by those working in the health field."Hallward, Peter. Damming the Flood: Haiti, Aristide and the Politics of Containment. Verso Books, 2007, pg. 134

===Disbanding the military and paramilitaries - the Fad'H, Tonton Macoutes, and Attaches===

As discussed in detail inJeb Sprague. Paramilitarism and the Assault on Democracy in Haiti. Monthly Review, 2012 the Lavalas political project has long been dedicated to promoting a civilian police force and disband the long-time tools of elite repression in Haiti which have been the country's brutal military and paramilitary forces.  The government under Aristide launched the first trial of paramilitary death squads and successfully jailed many after aired on Haitian public television trials of FAdH and FRAPH members involved in massacres of civilians. Reforming the country's security services though posed a constant problem for Lavalas, as the U.S. sought to undermine these reform efforts and the corrupting influence of the narco-trade continued to be present among the police as it had in earlier periods.

==Wikileaks and Aristide==

The release of many documents through Wikileaks has provided a great deal of insight into how the international community (United States, Canada, France and Brazil) has regarded Aristide, his lasting influence, the coup, and his exile.
November 2004
Dominican President Leonel Fernandez gave a speech in front of other regional leaders in which he said Aristide commanded "great popular support" within Haiti and called for his inclusion in the country’s democratic future.http://www.aftenposten.no/spesial/wikileaksdokumenter/article4065602.ece
January 2005
USA pressuring South Africa to hold Aristide, or face the loss of potential UN Security Council seat
"Bienvenu later offered to express our shared concerns in Pretoria, perhaps under the pretext that as a country desiring to secure a seat on the UN Security Council, South Africa could not afford to be involved in any way with the destabilization of another country....2 (S) Bienvenu speculated on exactly how Aristide might return, seeing a possible opportunity to hinder him in the logistics of reaching Haiti. If Aristide traveled commercially, Bienvenu reasoned, he would likely need to transit certain countries in order to reach Haiti. Bienvenu suggested a demarche to CARICOM countries by the U.S. and EU to warn them against facilitating any travel or other plans Aristide might have.... Both Bienvenu and Barbier confided that South African mercenaries could be heading towards Haiti, with Bienvenu revealing the GOF had documented evidence that 10 South African citizens had come to Paris and requested Dominican visas between February and the present."http://www.aftenposten.no/spesial/wikileaksdokumenter/article4065619.ece
A June 2005 cable states:
"the GOB (Government of Brazil) officials made clear continued Brazilian resolve to keep Aristide from returning to the country or exerting political influence"http://tools.folha.com.br/print?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww1.folha.uol.com.br%2Fpoder%2F859514-estrategia-brasileira-para-o-haiti-passava-por-manter-aristide-fora-do-pais-leia.shtml&site=emcimadahora
"the GOB had been encouraged by recent South African Government commitments to Brazil that the GSA (Government of South Africa) would not allow Aristide to use his exile there to undertake political efforts"
Fall of 2008:
On Preval's fear Aristide would return to Haiti via Venezuela
President Rene Preval made reference to these rumors, telling the Ambassador that he did not want Aristide "anywhere in the hemisphere." Subsequent to that, he remarked that he is concerned that Aristide will accept the Chavez offer but deflected any discussion of whether Preval himself was prepared to raise the matter with Chavez.http://www.aftenposten.no/spesial/wikileaksdokumenter/article4065638.ece

==Criticism==

===Accusations of human rights abuses===

Human Rights Watch accused the Haitian police force under President Aristide and his political supporters of attacks on opposition rallies. They also said that the emergence of armed rebel groups seeking to overthrow Aristide reflected "the failure of the country's democratic institutions and procedures".[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2004/02/13/haiti-aristide-should-uphold-rule-law|title=Haiti: Aristide Should Uphold Rule of Law|publisher=Human Rights Watch|date=13 February 2004[/tpl] However as a detailed study on the armed rebel paramilitaries shows, these groups received vital support from a handful of Haitian elites, Dominican governmental sectors, and foreign intelligence. The undermanned Haitian police faced difficulties in fending off cross-border attacks led by the ex-army paramilitary rebels.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://monthlyreview.org/press/books/pb3003/|title=Paramilitarism and the Assault on Democracy in Hiati|publisher=Monthly Review Press|date=15 August 2012[/tpl] 
Videos surfaced showing a portion of a speech by Aristide on 27 August 1991, which took place just after army and death squad members attempted to assassinate him, where he says "Don't hesitate to give him what he deserves.

Aristide has published a number of books including an autobiography in 1993 and Nevrose vetero-testamentaire (1994) with excerpts of his masters and doctoral theses.
In 2000 Aristide published the book  Eyes of the Heart: Seeking a Path for the Poor in the Age of Globalization that accused the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund of working on behalf of the world's wealthiest nations rather than in the interest of genuine international development. Aristide called for "a culture of global solidarity" to eliminate poverty as an alternative to the globalization represented by neocolonialism and neoliberalism.Jean-Bertrand Aristide, "Introduction," The Haitian Revolution by Touissant L'Ouverture (New York and London: Verso, 2008), p. xxxiii.
In 2005 the documentary Aristide and the Endless Revolution appeared. In the film Nicolas Rossier investigates the events leading up to the 2004 coup against Aristide.aristidethefilm.com
