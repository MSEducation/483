Law schools are nationally accredited by the American Bar Association (ABA),ABA Accreditation Process and graduates of these schools may generally sit for the bar exam in any state. There are 203 ABA accredited law schools, divided between 200 with full accreditation and 3 with provisional accreditation.List of ABA approved law schools
In addition, individual state legislatures or bar examiners, like the State Bar of California, may maintain a separate accreditation system which is open to non-ABA accredited schools.  The California State Bar also accredits law schools, which the California Committee of Bar Examiners (CBE) recognizes.  Also, the CBE allows registered "Unaccredited" schools to operate and students of those schools are eligible to take the California Bar Examination upon graduation.
