==Etymology==

In ancient times, the town was known as "city of Mediomatrici", being inhabited by the tribe of the same name.Martin P. (2010) Metz, 2000 years of history. Eds. Serpenoise. ISBN 978-2-87692-845-9 pp. 8–9 After its integration into the Roman Empire, the city was called Divodurum Mediomatricum, meaning Holy Village or Holy Fortress of the Mediomatrici,Toussaint M. (1948) Metz à l'époque gallo-romaine. Eds. Impr. P. Even. pp. 21–22 [tpl]fr[/tpl] then it was known as Mediomatrix. During the 5th century AD, the name evolved to "Mettis", which gave rise to Metz.

==History==

Metz has a recorded history dating back over 3,000 years. Before the conquest of Gaul by Julius Caesar in 52 BC, it was the oppidum of the Celtic Mediomatrici tribe. Integrated into the Roman Empire, Metz became quickly one of the principal towns of Gaul with a population of 40,000,Vigneron B. (1986) Metz antique: Divodurum Mediomatricorum. Eds. Maisonneuve.

===Population===

The inhabitants of Metz are called Messin(e)s. Statistics on the ethnic and religious make up of the population of Metz are haphazard, as the French Republic prohibits making distinctions between citizens regarding race, beliefs, and political and philosophic opinions in the process of census taking.A law from 1872 forbids the collection by the state of census data based on questions about religious beliefs. The French Third Republic considered that kind of information to be private and that any citizen of the Republic should be considered as equal of his mates, regardless his private life. In accordance with the concept of laïcité, this principle was reaffirmed by the current French Fifth Republic in a law from 1978, stating that "it is forbidden to collect or process data of a personal nature related to racial or ethnic origins as well as political, philosophic, or religious opinions."
The French national census of 2009 estimated the population of Metz to be 121,841, while the population of Metz urban agglomeration was about 389,851.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bdm.insee.fr/bdm2/affichageSeries.action;jsessionid=69361A7E2570F741827C8DDE89D37FC4?recherche=idbank&idbank=000067700&codeGroupe=29|title=Historical census database of the population of Metz, INSEE. |date= |accessdate=January 2012[/tpl] [tpl]fr[/tpl] Through history, Metz's population has been impacted by the vicissitudes of the wars and  annexations involving the city, which have prevented continuous population growth. More recently, the city has suffered from the restructuring of the military and the metallurgy industry.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lorraine.pref.gouv.fr/index.php?headingid=234|title=Official Lorraine prefecture webpage on the military restructurings.|date= |accessdate=September 2008[/tpl] [tpl]fr[/tpl] The historical population for the current area of Metz municipality is as follows:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.insee.fr/fr/ppp/bases-de-donnees/recensement/populations-legales/commune.asp?depcom=57463|title=Census of the population of Metz, INSEE. |date= |accessdate=January 2012[/tpl] [tpl]fr[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://cassini.ehess.fr|title=Database Cassini, EHESS. |date= |accessdate=29 June 2012[/tpl] [tpl]fr[/tpl]

===Notable people linked to the city===

Several well-known figures have been linked to the city of Metz throughout its history. Renowned Messins include poet Paul Verlaine,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xskq5v_la-maison-de-verlaine-clip-2012_creation#.UUtxixnmvH0|title=Verlaine's native house - House of Verlaine (museum), video clip. |date= |accessdate=21 March 2013[/tpl] [tpl]fr[/tpl] composer Ambroise Thomas, and mathematician Jean-Victor Poncelet; numerous well-known German figures were also born in Metz notably during the annexation periods. Moreover, the city has been the residence of people such as writer François Rabelais, Cardinal Mazarin, political thinker Alexis de Tocqueville, French patriot and American Revolutionary War hero the Marquis de La Fayette, and Luxembourg-born German-French statesman Robert Schuman.

==Law and government==

===Local law===

Local law ([tpl]Lang-fr|droit local[/tpl]) applied in Metz is a legal system that operates in parallel with French law. Created in 1919, it preserves the French laws applied in France before 1870 and maintained by the Germans during the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine, but repealed in the rest of France after 1871. It also maintains German laws enacted by the German Empire between 1871 and 1918, specific provisions adopted by the local authorities, and French laws that have been enacted after 1919 to be applicable only in Alsace-Lorraine. This specific local legislation encompasses different areas including religion, social work and finance.
The most striking of the legal differences between France and Alsace-Lorraine is the absence in Alsace-Lorraine of strict secularism, even though a constitutional right of freedom of religion is guaranteed by the French government. Alsace-Lorraine is still governed by a pre-1905 law established by the Concordat of 1801, which provides for the public subsidy of the Roman Catholic, Lutheran, and Calvinist churches and the Jewish religion.

===Administration===

Like every commune of the present French Republic, Metz is managed by a mayor ([tpl]Lang-fr|maire[/tpl]) and a municipal council ([tpl]Lang-fr|conseil municipal[/tpl]), democratically elected by two-round proportional voting for six years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070633&idArticle=LEGIARTI000024040149&dateTexte=20120630|title=Official French general code of territorial collectivities, French Republic|date= |accessdate=June 2012[/tpl] [tpl]fr[/tpl] The mayor is assisted by 54 municipal councillors,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.metz.fr/metz2/municipalite/cyber_mairie/organigramme/elus_photos.php|title=Official Metz municipality website, List of Metz municipal councilors.|date= |accessdate=July 2012[/tpl] [tpl]fr[/tpl] and the municipal council is held on the last Thursday of every month.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.metz.fr/metz2/municipalite/cyber_mairie/conseil/index.php|title=Official Metz municipality website, agenda and procès-verbal of the Municipal Council of Metz.|date= |accessdate=July 2012[/tpl] [tpl]fr[/tpl]Since March 2009, records of municipal council meetings are available as audio files in French.

===Urban ecology===

Under the leadership of such people as botanist Jean-Marie Pelt, Metz pioneered a policy of urban ecology during the early 1970s.

===Metz in the arts===

Metz was an important cultural centre during the Carolingian Renaissance.Demollière C.J. (2004) L'art du chantre carolingien. Eds. Serpenoise. ISBN 2-87692-555-9 [tpl]fr[/tpl] For example, Gregorian chant was created in Metz during the 8th century as a fusion of Gallican and ancient Roman repertory. Then called Messin Chant, it remains the oldest form of music still in use in Western Europe. The bishops of Metz, notably Saint-Chrodegang promoted its use for the Roman liturgy in Gallic lands under the favorable influence of the Carolingian monarchs. Messin chant made two major contributions to the body of chant: it fitted the chant into the ancient Greek octoechos system, and invented an innovative musical notation, using neumes to show the shape of a remembered melody.Grier J. (2003) Ademar de Chabannes, Carolingian Musical Practices, and Nota Romana. Journal of the American Musicological Society. 56 (1):43–98. Metz was also an important centre of illumination of Carolingian manuscripts, producing such monuments of Carolingian book illumination as the Drogo Sacramentary.[tpl]cite web|url=http://bm.mairie-metz.fr/clientbookline/home.asp|title=Official Metz library website, medieval book webpage.|date= |accessdate=1 July 2012[/tpl] [tpl]fr[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://bm.mairie-metz.fr/sitebm/commun/patrimoine/galerie%20Vy/index-heures.html|title=Official Metz library website, Book of Hours of John of Vy.|date= |accessdate=1 July 2012[/tpl] [tpl]fr[/tpl]
The Metz School ([tpl]Lang-fr|École de Metz[/tpl]) was an art movement in Metz and the region between 1834 and 1870, centred around Charles-Laurent Maréchal.Livre Groupe (2010) École de Metz: Christophe Fratin, Charles-Franois Champigneulle, Laurent-Charles Marechal, Louis-Theodore Devilly, Auguste Migette. Eds. Books LLC. ISBN 978-1-159-58648-5 [tpl]fr[/tpl] The term was originally proposed in 1845 by the poet Charles Baudelaire, who appreciated the works of the artists. They were influenced by Eugène Delacroix and inspired by the medieval heritage of Metz and its romantic surroundings. The Franco-Prussian War and the annexation of the territory by the Germans resulted in the dismantling of the movement. The main figures of the Metz School were Charles-Laurent Maréchal, Auguste Migette, Auguste Hussenot, Louis-Théodore Devilly, Christopher Fratin, and Charles Pêtre. Their works include paintings, engravings, drawings, stained-glass windows, and sculptures.

===The Graoully dragon as symbol of the city===

The Graoully is depicted as a fearsome dragon, vanquished by the sacred powers of Saint Clement of Metz, the first Bishop of the city. The Graoully quickly became a symbol of Metz and can be seen in numerous insignia of the city, from the 10th century on.Bellard A. (1966) Le Graoully de Metz à la lumière de la paléontologie. Ed. Mémoires de l'Académie de Metz. ISBN 978-2-9531744-3-4 [tpl]fr[/tpl] Writers from Metz tend to present the legend as an allegory of Christianity's victory over paganism, represented by the harmful dragon.
