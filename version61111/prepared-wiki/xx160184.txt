[[Covering the Bases]]

CATEGORIES: 2005 debut albums

Covering the Bases is the debut album by Major League Baseball pitcher Bronson Arroyo.  It was released in 2005 following the Boston Red Sox 2004 World Series Championship, which Arroyo was a part of; he was traded to the Cincinnati Reds after the 2005 season, and later joined the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2014.  
The album features cover versions of twelve songs — mainly modern rock hits — that Arroyo would play for his teammates while in the locker room and on the road. Musicians involved in the album included prolific studio guitarist Michael Landau, Alice in Chains/Ozzy Osbourne bassist Mike Inez, Red Sox general manager Theo Epstein, and a small spoken word part during "Everlong" by author Stephen King.
