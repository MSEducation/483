==Foundation==

The abbey of Crossmolina was founded by a member of the landowning De Barry family. Little remains of this foundation today. In 1306, three Normans were indicted for robbery from the abbot. During the 15th century, Crossmolina passed into Bourke Family. In 1526 O'Donnell of Tir Conaill (Co. Donegal) invaded Tirawley and demolished Crossmolina castle. 
The abbey was dissolved in the 1537. Around 1630 the abbey and its lands came into the possession of Sir Richard Blake. The dissolution deprived the people of a centre of hospitality, culture and education.
