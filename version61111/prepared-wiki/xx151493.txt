The following is an episode list for the Kids' WB animated television series The Batman, starring the titular character. The series premiered on September 11, 2004, and  ended on March 22, 2008.[tpl]cite web |url=http://news.toonzone.net/article.php?ID=14832 |title=The Batman renewed for 5th season  |accessdate=2007-04-15 |publisher=Toonzone.net[/tpl] Although the series borrows many elements from previous Batman storylines, it does not follow the continuity set by the comic books nor that of the previous Batman: The Animated Series or its spin-offs. Also, the animation style bears a strong resemblance to that of Jackie Chan Adventures, since Jeff Matsuda was the chief character designer for both shows. The designs of many supervillains, like the characters Joker, Penguin and Riddler, are very different from those of their comic counterparts.
A total of 65 episodes were produced and aired over the series' three-and-a-half year run.
The first five seasons are available on DVD. A Direct-To-DVD movie titled The Batman vs. Dracula, based on the series, was released in on October 18, 2005 and made its television debut on Cartoon Network's Toonami block on October 22, 2005. There is also a spin-off comic book series, The Batman Strikes!, published by DC Comics which is set in the same continuity and style of The Batman.
