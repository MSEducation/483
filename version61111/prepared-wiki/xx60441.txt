==History==

The trophy was first awarded at the end of the 1977–78 NHL season.  It was named after Frank J. Selke, former general manager of the Toronto Maple Leafs and Montreal Canadiens. The Selke Trophy was the fifth and last of the major NHL awards to be introduced that have been named after General Managers and owners of the Original Six teams, the other awards being the Art Ross Trophy, James Norris Memorial Trophy, Conn Smythe Trophy, and Jack Adams Award. 
The first recipient was Bob Gainey of the Canadiens, who won the trophy the first four years it was given, and to date he has won it more times than any other player.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/html/silver_splashfrankselke.htm|title=Legends of Hockey-NHL Trophies-Frank J.

The Montreal Canadiens and Detroit Red Wings have won the trophy the most times, with 7 awards apiece. The team with the greatest number of unique winners is the Red Wings with 4 -- Sergei Fedorov (twice), Steve Yzerman, Kris Draper, and Datsyuk (three times) -- all coming since 1994.
There has been only one instance in which a Selke Trophy winner was also awarded the Hart Memorial Trophy for Most Valuable Player—Sergei Fedorov captured both trophies during the 1993–94 NHL season.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net:8080/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SilverwareTrophyWinner.jsp?tro=FST&year=1993-94|title=Legends of Hockey-Silverware-1993-94 Frank J.
