In epidemiology, an epidemic (from Greek ἐπί epi "upon or above" and δῆμος demos "people") occurs when new cases of a certain disease, in a given human population, and during a given period, substantially exceed what is expected based on recent experience.[tpl]rp|354[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Green MS, Swartz T, Mayshar E, Lev B, Leventhal A, Slater PE, Shemer J |title=When is an epidemic an epidemic? |journal=Isr.

Epidemics of infectious disease are generally caused by a change in the ecology of the host population (e.g. increased stress or increase in the density of a vector species), a genetic change in the parasite population or the introduction of a new parasite to a host population (by movement of parasites or hosts). Generally, an epidemic occurs when host immunity to a parasite population is suddenly reduced below that found in the endemic equilibrium and the transmission threshold is exceeded."epidemic".

An epidemic may be restricted to one location; however, if it spreads to other countries or continents and affects a substantial number of people, it may be termed a pandemic.[tpl]cite book |author= |title=Principles of Epidemiology, Second Edition |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |location=Atlanta, Georgia |year=|pages= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |url=http://www2a.cdc.gov/phtn/catalog/pdf-file/Epi_course.pdf[/tpl][tpl]rp|55[/tpl] The declaration of an epidemic usually requires a good understanding of a baseline rate of incidence; epidemics for certain diseases, such as influenza, are defined as reaching some defined increase in incidence above this baseline. A few cases of a very rare disease may be classified as an epidemic, while many cases of a common disease (such as the common cold) would not.

==Causes==

There are several changes that may occur in an infectious agent that may trigger an epidemic these include:[tpl]rp|55[/tpl]
An epidemic disease is not required to be contagious, and the term has been applied to West Nile fever and the obesity epidemic, among others.
The conditions which govern the outbreak of epidemics include infected food supplies such as contaminated drinking water and the migration of populations of certain animals, such as rats or mosquitoes, which can act as disease vectors.  Certain epidemics occur at certain seasons: for example, whooping-cough occurs in spring, whereas measles produces two epidemics, one in winter and one in March. Influenza, the common cold, and other infections of the upper respiratory tract, such as sore throat, occur predominantly in the winter.
There is another variation, both as regards the number of persons affected and the number who die in successive epidemics: the severity of successive epidemics rises and falls over periods of five or ten years."Epidemic."

==Types==

===Common source outbreak===

In a common source outbreak, the affected individuals had an exposure to a common agent. If the exposure is singular and all of the affected individuals develop the disease over a single exposure and incubation course, it can be termed a point source outbreak. If the exposure was continuous or variable, it can be termed a continuous outbreak or intermittent outbreak, respectively.[tpl]rp|56[/tpl]

===Propagated outbreak===

In a propagated outbreak, the disease spreads person-to-person. Affected individuals may become independent reservoirs leading to further exposures.[tpl]rp|56[/tpl]
Many epidemics will have characteristics of both common source and propagated outbreaks. For example, secondary person-to-person spread may occur after a common source exposure or an environmental vectors may spread a zoonotic diseases agent.[tpl]rp|56–58[/tpl]

==Etymology==

The term epidemic derives from a word form attributed to Homer's Odyssey, which later took its medical meaning from Epidemics, a treatise by Hippocrates.[tpl]cite journal |author=Martin PM, Martin-Granel E |title=2,500-year evolution of the term epidemic |journal=Emerging Infect. Dis. |volume=12 |issue=6 |pages=976–80 |date=June 2006 |pmid=16707055 |doi= 10.3201/eid1206.051263|url=http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/content/12/6/pdfs/v12-n6.pdf |pmc=3373038[/tpl] Before Hippocrates, epidemios, epidemeo, epidamos, and other variants had meanings similar to the current definitions of "indigenous" or "endemic." Thucydides' description of the Plague of Athens is considered one of the earliest accounts of a disease epidemic. By the early 17th century, the terms endemic and epidemic referred to contrasting conditions of population-level disease, with the endemic condition at low rates of occurrence and the epidemic condition widespread.[tpl]cite book|last=Lodge|first=T.|title=A treatise of the plague: containing the nature, signes, and accidents of the same, with the certaine and absolute cure of the fevers, botches and carbuncles that raigne in these times|year=1603|publisher=Edward White|location=London[/tpl]
