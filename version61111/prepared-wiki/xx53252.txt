</ref> But whereas ''[[High Plains Drifter]]'' resolves its story-line by means of a series of unfolding flash back narratives (although ambiguity still remains), ''Pale Rider'' does not include any such obvious clues to the nature and past of the 'Preacher'. One is left to draw one's own conclusions regarding the overall story line and its meaning.
The movie's title is taken from The Book of Revelation, chapter 6, verse 8: "And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him." The reading of the biblical passage describing this character is neatly choreographed to correspond with the sudden appearance of the Preacher, who arrived as a result of a prayer from Megan, in which she quoted Psalm 23. Preacher's comment after beating one of the villains is, "Well, the Lord certainly does work in mysterious ways." After the temptation to shift his ministry to the town, Preacher says, "You can't serve God and Mammon, Mammon being money."Clive Marsh, Gaye Ortiz, Explorations in theology and film: movies and meaning, Blackwell Publishers 1997 (reprint 2001), p. 68 Eastwood himself has acknowledged that the film contains a great number of biblical parallels. According to Robert Jewett the film's dialogue parallels Paul's teaching on divine retribution (Romans 12:19-21).

==Similarities to "Shane"==

The plot contains many similarities to the 1953 film Shane.  Both films center around a community of laborers united against a gang of crooked entrepreneurs trying to control and take advantage of them.  In both, a stranger suddenly appears whom no one knows, but who is an experienced gunfighter and sympathizes with the townspeople against the gang.  In both, the protagonist's child idolizes the stranger, and his wife is attracted to him.  In both, the gang kills a member of the community who confronts them; and, the stranger ultimately avenges the town.  In both, the stranger rides off with the child calling after him.
