He was appointed by Sultan Qaiqabad to the fief of Baran and the command of the army. Soon, Sultan Qaiqabad suffered from a paralytic stroke and Firuz marched towards Delhi. The nobles placed Kayumars, the three-year-old son of Qaiqabad on the throne. But the sons of Firuz dashed into the city and carried away the infant Sultan, defeating a force sent in pursuit of them. Most of the Turkic nobles now submitted to Firuz. Qaiqabad was put to death and his corpse was thrown into the Yamuna. On 13 July 1290 Jalal-ud-Din Firuz was enthroned in the palace of Kalughari.He was made a slave from there.Mahajan, V.D. (1991, reprint 2007). History of Medieval India, Part I, New Delhi: S.

==Reign==

After the accession to the throne, Jalaluddin allowed Malik Chhajju, the nephew of Balban to retain his freedom of Kara-Manikpur. The post of wazir was conferred on Khvaja Khatir, who had held it under Balban and Qaiqabad. Fakhr-ud-Din, the kotwal of Delhi was also allowed to continue. Jalaluddin's eldest son received the title of Khan Khanan, his second son received the title of Arkali Khan and his third son received the title of Qadr Khan. He appointed his younger brother the ariz-i-mumalik (army minister) and conferred upon him the title of Yaghrush Khan. His two nephews, Alauddin and Almas Beg received significant responsibilities in the royal household and his relation Malik Ahmad Chap was appointed deputy master of ceremonies.
In 1292, a horde of more than 100,000 Mongols invaded the Indian subcontinent. Successes in battle and smart negotiation caused a partial retreat on the part of the Mongols. They rose again five years later when his nephew and son-in-law Alauddin Khilji was on the throne. 
Alauddin was also responsible for a successful raid in to Deccan as Governor of Kara under his uncle, Jalaluddin. Jalaluddin was killed by his cruel nephew Ali Gurshap when he arrived to dinner with him at kara.
