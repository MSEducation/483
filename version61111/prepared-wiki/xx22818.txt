German submarine ''U-462 was a Type XIV supply and replenishment U-boat ("Milchkuh") of Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine'' during World War II.
Her keel was laid down on 2 January 1941, by Deutsche Werke in Kiel. She was launched on 29 November 1941 and commissioned on 5 March 1942 with Oberleutnant zur See Bruno Vowe in command. Vowe commanded the boat until she was lost. She served, first as part of the 4th U-boat Flotilla while carrying out training, then as part of the 10th and 12th flotillas while taking part in operations.

==Operational career==

U-462 conducted eight patrols. As a supply boat, she avoided combat.

===1st patrol===

For her first patrol, U-462 departed Kiel on 23 July 1942 and arrived at St. Nazaire in occupied France on 21 September of the same year, having travelled by way of the gap between Iceland and the Faeroe Islands and out into the Atlantic. The latter part of the voyage took her past the Azores on her way to her new base.

===2nd and 3rd patrols===

The U-boat's second effort took her to a point west-southwest of the Cape Verde Islands which she reached on 9 November 1942. She arrived back at St. Nazaire on 7 December 1942.
Her third outing was very short. She left Bordeaux on 20 January 1943, but returned on the 22nd.

===4th and 5th patrols===

The submarine's fourth sortie took her out into the Atlantic once again. The most westerly spot of this patrol was recorded on 27 February 1943. She returned to France, but this time it was to Bordeaux, on 11 March.
The boat's fifth patrol was also routine.

===6th patrol===

She did not leave the Bay of Biscay, being attacked by Mosquito aircraft of 151 and 156 squadrons, RAF on 21 June 1943. One man was killed (Matrosengefreiter Ferdinand Brunnbaur), and four more were wounded. The patrol was aborted, the boat returned to Bordeaux on the 23rd.

===7th patrol===

U-462[tpl]'[/tpl]s seventh patrol was also cut short. She had barely cleared the northwest Spanish coast when she was attacked by a British B-24 Liberator of 224 squadron, RAF. After sustaining sufficient damage to force a return, she entered Bordeaux harbour on 6 July 1943.

===Loss===

On 30 July 1943, U-462 was sunk by a British Halifax bomber of 502 Squadron RAF and gunfire from the British [tpl]sclass|Black Swan|sloop[/tpl]s HMS [tpl]HMS|Wren|U28|2[/tpl], [tpl]HMS|Kite|U87|2[/tpl], [tpl]HMS|Woodpecker|U08|2[/tpl], [tpl]HMS|Wild Goose|U45|2[/tpl] and [tpl]HMS|Woodcock|U90|2[/tpl], in the Bay of Biscay.
