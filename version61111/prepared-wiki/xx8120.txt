When preparing a mojito, lime juice is added to sugar (or syrup) and mint leaves. The mixture is then gently mashed with a muddler. The mint leaves should only be bruised to release the essential oils and should not be shredded.[tpl]cite web|author=Posted by Fumi |url=http://www.wasabibratwurst.com/mojito-recipe/ |title=How to Muddle a Mojito |publisher=Wasabibratwurst.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-01[/tpl] Then rum is added and the mixture is briefly stirred to dissolve the sugar and to lift the mint leaves up from the bottom for better presentation. Finally, the drink is topped with whole ice cubes and sparkling soda water. Mint leaves and lime wedges are used to garnish the glass.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.artofdrink.com/2005/11/the-classic-cuban-mojito.php |title=The Classic Cuban Mojito |publisher=Artofdrink.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-01[/tpl]

Cuba is the birthplace of the Mojito, although the exact origin of this classic cocktail is the subject of debate. One story traces the Mojito to a similar 19th century drink known as "El Draque", after Francis Drake. In 1586, after his successful raid at Cartagena de Indias Drake's ships sailed towards Havana but there was an epidemic of dysentery and scurvy on board. It was known that the local South American Indians had remedies for various tropical illnesses; so a small boarding party went ashore on Cuba and came back with ingredients for a medicine which was effective. The ingredients were aguardiente de caña (a crude form of rum, translates as fire water from sugar cane) added with local tropical ingredients; lime, sugarcane juice and mint.[tpl]cite book |last=Burkhart |first=Jeff |authorlink=Jeff Burkhart |year=2012 |title=Twenty Years Behind Bars: the spirited adventures of a real bartender |edition=1st |publisher=PhotoCine Media |isbn=9780985500115[/tpl] Drinking lime juice in itself would have been a great help in staving off scurvy and dysentery.[tpl]cite web|last=Maratos|first=David|title=How The El Draque Cocktail May Have Helped Britannia Rule The Waves|url=http://articleworld.drupalgardens.com/content/1st-cocktail-invented-1586-was-medicinal-crude-rum-mix-article-34 ''The 1st Cocktail, Invented 1586 Was A Medicinal Crude Rum Mix (Article 34)|work=GoArticles|accessdate=27 April 2013[/tpl] Tafia/Rum was used as soon as it became widely available to the British (ca. 1650). Mint, lime and sugar were also helpful in hiding the harsh taste of this spirit. While this drink was not called a Mojito at this time, it was still the original combination of these ingredients.
Some historians contend that African slaves who worked in the Cuban sugar cane fields during the 19th century were instrumental in the cocktail's origin.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mojitocompany.com/pages.php?pageid=4 |title=Mojito History |publisher=Mojitocompany.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-01[/tpl] Guarapo, the sugar cane juice often used in Mojitos, was a popular drink amongst the slaves who helped coin the name of the sweet nectar.
There are several theories behind the origin of the name Mojito; one such theory holds that name relates to mojo, a Cuban seasoning made from lime and used to flavour dishes.Mojito is derived from the Spanish mojo sauce, which often contains lime juice (see "mojito" at Dictionary.com, citing the American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition, 2006, Houghton Mifflin), while mojo is derived from the Spanish verb mojar, meaning "to make wet" (see definition 3 of "mojo" at Dictionary.com, citing Webster's New Millennium Dictionary of English, Preview Edition (v 0.9.7), 2003-2007, Lexico Publishing Group, LLC) Another theory is that the name Mojito is simply a derivative of mojadito (Spanish for "a little wet") or simply the diminutive of mojado ("wet"). Due to the vast influence of immigration from the Canary Islands, the term probably came from the mojo creole marinades adapted in Cuba using citrus vs traditional Isleno types.
The Mojito was a favorite drink of author Ernest Hemingway.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6624971|title=Great American Writers and Their Cocktails|date=2006-12-15|work=NPR.org|accessdate=2009-06-05[/tpl] Ernest Hemingway made the bar called La Bodeguita del Medio famous as he became one of its regulars and he wrote "My mojito in La Bodeguita, My daiquiri in El Floridita. " This expression in English can still be read on the wall of the bar today, in his handwriting.[tpl]cite web|author=By W.
