Berlusconi had also failed to meet some of his pre-election promises and had failed to prevent economic decline and introduce serious reforms. Many believed that the problems and doubts over Berlusconi's leadership and his coalition were one of the factors that contributed to market anxieties over an imminent Italian financial disaster, which could have a potentially catastrophic effect on the 17-nation eurozone and the world economy. Many critics of Berlusconi accused him of using his power primarily to protect his own business ventures. Umberto Bossi, leader of the Northern League, a partner in Berlusconi's right-wing coalition, was quoted as informing reporters outside parliament, "We asked the prime minister to step aside."Hooper, John; Squires, Nick (10 November 2011).

On 12 November 2011, after a final meeting with his cabinet, Berlusconi met Italian President Giorgio Napolitano at the Palazzo del Quirinale to tend his resignation. As he arrived at the presidential residence, a hostile crowd gathered with banners shouting insults at Berlusconi and throwing coins at the car. After his resignation, the booing and jeering continued as he left in his convoy, with the public shouting words such as "buffoon", "dictator" and "mafioso".http://www.repubblica.it/politica/2011/11/12/dirette/crisi_12_novembre-24884019/ Following Berlusconi's resignation, Mario Monti formed a new government that would remain in office until the next scheduled elections in 2013.[tpl]cite news | title = Incarico a Monti: "Occorre crescita ed equità"| | url = http://www.repubblica.it/politica/2011/11/13/news/monti_napolitano_dopo_incarico-24963634/?ref=HREA-1|accessdate=12 November 2011|newspaper=La Repubblica|date=12 November 2011  |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120920/http://www.repubblica.it/politica/2011/11/13/news/monti_napolitano_dopo_incarico-24963634/?ref=HREA-1 |archivedate=20 September 2012 |deadurl=no[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/17/world/europe/monti-forms-new-italian-government.html | title = Facing Crisis, Technocrats Take Charge in Italy|date= 16 November 2011|work=New York Times|accessdate=16 November 2011  |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120906/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/17/world/europe/monti-forms-new-italian-government.html |archivedate=6 September 2012 |deadurl=no |first1=Rachel |last1=Donadio |first2=Elisabetta |last2=Povoledo[/tpl] On 16 November, Monti announced that he had formed a Cabinet and was sworn in as Prime Minister of Italy, also appointing himself as Minister of Economy and Finances.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financialcrisis/8894014/Mario-Monti-appoints-himself-economy-minister-as-he-unveils-Italy-government.html | title = Mario Monti appoints himself economy minister as he unveils Italy government|date= 16 November 2011|work=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=16 November 2011  |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120918/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financialcrisis/8894014/Mario-Monti-appoints-himself-economy-minister-as-he-unveils-Italy-government.html |archivedate=18 September 2012 |deadurl=no |location=London |first=Nick |last=Squires[/tpl]

==Berlusconism==

Berlusconism ([tpl]lang-it|Berlusconismo[/tpl]) is a term used in the Western media and by few Italian analysts to describe the political positions of the politician and intrapreneur Silvio Berlusconi.

===Origins and features===

The term "berlusconismo" arises 1980s, characterized by a strongly positive valence, as synonym of "entrepreneurial optimism" in the years, that is as definition of an entrepreneurial spirit which does not make get upset from the difficulties, trusting in being able to solve the problems.Floriano De Angeli, "L'Europeo", n. 49, 1993
However, starting from the century XXI, in consequence of the identification primarily Silvio Berlusconi figure policy, the attributed meaning at the end has undergone a settled modification, in the giornalistico-politico language context.
According to the Italian definition given by the online vocabulary of the Encyclopedia Institute, berlusconismo has a wide range which runs down a big ambit variety, all having their origins in the figure of Silvio Berlusconi, and the political movement inspired by him: the substantive refers, in fact, to the "thought movement", but also to "social phenomenon", and, even, the phenomenon "of custom" bound to his entrepreneurial and political figure. The berlusconismo term is also used to refer to a certain laissez-faire vision supported by him, not only of the economy and the markets, but also with reference to the same policy.«berlusconismo» s. m., lemma del Vocabolario Treccani online, dal sito dell'Istituto dell'Enciclopedia italiana Treccani
According to the political and entrepreneurial opponents, the Berlusconismo is only a demagogic populism form, comparing it to the Fascism, also for the fact that Berlusconi has declared more turned his liking for Benito Mussolini,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article3746319.ece|title=Profile: the irrepressible Silvio Berlusconi|work=The Times|location=London|date=14 April 2008|accessdate=16 April 2008|first=Richard|last=Owen|archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120920/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article3746319.ece|archivedate=20 September 2012|deadurl=no[/tpl] even though he has criticized the racial Fascist laws and the alliance with Nazi Germany, referring to himself as pro-Israel.http://972mag.com/strange-relationship-between-silvio-berlusconi-and-italian-jews/65487/http://www.jta.org/2006/04/17/life-religion/features/pro-israel-berlusconi-loses-in-italy In 2013, he returned to calling Mussolini a good leader whose biggest mistake was signing up to exterminate the Jews."Berlusconi defends 'good' Mussolini." Instead his supporters compare Berlusconismo to the French Gaullism and the Argentine Peronism.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.claudioscajola.it/evento.asp?id=392|title=Il Berlusconismo è come Gollismo: durerà a lungo, non è passeggero|accessdate=02-10-2008|date=2007-01-25[/tpl]

A Berlusconi leadership tactics feature is to use the party as half to reach the power (defined "light party", because deprive of a complex structure). This is decidedly comparable to the political tactics used by Charles De Gaulle in France.
Other feature of great importance is emphasis of a "Liberal revolution", thrown and summarized by the "Contract with the Italians" of 2001.

==Legal problems==

===Ongoing trials===

As of October 2013, Berlusconi is involved in four ongoing court trials.

====Abuse of office - The Unipol case (2005)====

In February 2012, Milan prosecutors brought charges against Berlusconi for alleged abuse of office connected with the publication of confidential wiretaps by the Italian newspaper Il Giornale, which is owned by Berlusconi's brother, in 2005.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/33dac7ca-51a8-11e1-a30c-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1lz9nZK2s | title=Berlusconi faces another court case | work=The Financial Times | date=7 February 2012 | accessdate=10 February 2012 | author=Sanderson, Rachel | location=Milan[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16933697 | title=Silvio Berlusconi faces fourth trial on wiretap charges | work=BBC News | date=7 February 2012 | accessdate=10 February 2012[/tpl] The publication of the conversations between then Governor of the Bank of Italy Antonio Fazio, senior management of Unipol and Italian centre-left politician Piero Fassino was a breach of secrecy rules and was seen at the time as an attempt to discredit Berlusconi's political rivals. Their publication also eventually led to the collapse of the proposed takeover of Banca Nazionale del Lavoro by Unipol and the resignation of Fazio. The head of the company used by Italian prosecutors to record the conversations has been previously convicted of stealing the recordings and making them available to Berlusconi. On 7 February 2012, at an initial court hearing, Berlusconi denied he had listened to the tapes and ordered their publication. On 7 March 2013, Berlusconi was sentenced to a one-year jail term.[tpl]cite news|title=Berlusconi sentenced to 1 year jail in wiretap trial|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/07/us-italy-berlusconi-trial-idUSBRE9260FG20130307|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=7 March 2013|date=7 March 2013[/tpl]

====Bribery of Romano Prodi supporting senator (2006)====

In February 2013 Silvio Berlusconi is under investigation for corruption and illegal financing of political parties from the public prosecutor of Naples, in the figures of Vincenzo Piscitelli, Henry John Woodcock, Francesco Curcio, Alessandro Milita and Fabrizio Vanorio. He is accused of bribing in 2006, with € 3 million (of which 1 million and 2 million declared to the tax authorities in black), directed to Senator Sergio De Gregorio to facilitate its passage into the ranks of the Berlusconi led coalition House of Freedoms. Along with Berlusconi, a journalist (Valter Lavitola) at the head of the socialist newspaper L'Avanti! was also investigated, and Sergio De Gregorio self-confessed being the recipient of the bribery.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://napoli.repubblica.it/cronaca/2013/02/28/news/berlusconi_indagato_a_napoli_per_compravendita_di_senatori-53565459/?ref=HREA-1|title=Berlusconi indagato a Napoli per compravendita di senatori|language=Italian|publisher=La Repubblica|date=28 February 2013|accessdate=28 February 2013[/tpl]
On 23 October 2013, Silvio Berlusconi and Valter Lavitola were both indicted by the judge for preliminary hearings, Amelia Primavera. For Senator De Gregorio the process has already been closed in a preliminary hearing, because he opted to self-confess and bargained a reduced sentence of 20 months in prison for the crime. The court hearing at first-instance for the indicted Silvio Berlusconi, has been scheduled to start on 11 February 2014.[tpl]Cite news|title=Compravendita senatori, Berlusconi e Lavitola rinviati a giudizio|language=Italian|publisher=ANSA|url=http://www.ansa.it/web/notizie/rubriche/speciali/2013/07/30/Pdl-piazza-Berlusconi-rassicura_9120850.html|archiveurl=http://archive.is/fmUjB|archivedate = 23 October 2013|accessdate=23 October 2013|date = 23 October 2013[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|title=Compravendita senatori, Berlusconi a processo a Napoli|language=Italian|publisher= Agenzia Giornalistica Italia (AGI)|url=http://www.agi.it/cronaca/notizie/201310231932-cro-rt10359-compravendita_senatori_berlusconi_a_processo_insorge_pdl|archiveurl=http://archive.is/G5yKl|archivedate = 23 October 2013|accessdate = 23 October 2013|date = 23 October 2013[/tpl]

====Defamation against Antonio Di Pietro (2008)====

Berlusconi has repeatedly questioned the legitimacy of the educational degree of the former Operation "Clean Hands" magistrate and leader of the Italy of Values party, Antonio Di Pietro, when he during a 2008 election rally and in an episode of the talk show Porta a Porta repeatedly claimed, that Di Pietro had not obtained his magistrate degree by passing the exams, but with the complicity of the secret services diverted, in order to have a judge placed in the system to overturn the parties of the so-called First Republic. Di Pietro subsequently sued Berlusconi for aggravated defamation.
On 5 October 2010, the court in Viterbo considered Berlusconi could not be judged or punished, because of the parliamentarian immunity Article 68 of the Italian constitution forbidding any legal prosecutions against words spoken by parliamentarians in the process of their "exercise of parliamentary duties", in conjunction with the Italian Chamber of Deputies recently having voted for a decrete to appoint Berlusconi absolute immunity for any spoken words while serving as a deputy. On 19 January 2012 this judgment was set aside by the Supreme Court, which ruled that Berlusconi had been speaking during a campaign rally and not in an institutional setting; meaning he was not covered by the immunity protection provided for by the constitutions Article 68, and consequently should face a new court trial to be held either at the Viterbo court or the Constitutional Court.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.adnkronos.com/IGN/News/Politica/Cassazione-Berlusconi-accusato-di-diffamazione-a-Di-Pietro-si-riparte-da-zero_312877649022.html|title=Cassazione: Berlusconi accusato di diffamazione a Di Pietro, si riparte da zero|language=Italian|publisher=Adnkronos|date=19 January 2012|accessdate=23 May 2012|archiveurl=http://archive.is/pa5n5|archivedate=16 February 2013|deadurl=no[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|title=Cassazione: Berlusconi accusato di diffamazione a Di Pietro, si riparte da zero|url=http://www.liberoquotidiano.it/news/914198/Cassazione-Berlusconi-accusato-di-diffamazione-a-Di-Pietro-si-riparte-da-zero.html|language=Italian|publisher=LiberoQuotidiano.it|date=19 January 2012|accessdate=23 May 2012|archiveurl=http://archive.is/xPwQ|archivedate=4 August 2012|deadurl=no[/tpl]
On 10 January 2013, the Viterbo court decided to transfer the case for judgement directly to the Constitutional Court.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tusciaweb.eu/2013/01/diffamazione-berlusconi-di-pietro-atti-alla-corte-costituzionale/|title=Diffamazione Berlusconi-Di Pietro, atti alla Corte Costituzionale|language=Italian|publisher=TusciaWeb|date=10 January 2013[/tpl] The Constitutional Court ruled on 20 June 2013, that the Chamber of Deputies decrete having extended Berlusconi's immunity beyond what was provided for by the constitution, was a case with conflict of powers and should be disregarded. This mean that Berlusconi do not enjoy any special immunity protection for his spoken words during election campaigns, and that a court case now shall be held by the constitutional court, to decide the merits of the case.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.unita.it/italia/consulta-si-a-ricorso-di-di-pietro-contro-berlusconi-1.506963|title=Consulta: sì a ricorso di Di Pietro contro Berlusconi|language=Italian|publisher=L'Unità|date=20 June 2013[/tpl]

====Soliciting minors for sex - Ruby case (2010)====

The fast-track trial opened on 6 April and was adjourned until 31 May. El Mahroug's lawyer said that Mahroug would not be attaching herself to the case as a civil complainant and denies that she ever made herself available for money.

===Cases with final convictions===

As of October 2013, Berlusconi has only been convicted by the final appeal instance in 1 out of 32 court cases.

====Tax-fraud conviction in Mediaset trial (1988-98)====

The Mediaset trial was launched in April 2005, with indictment of 14 persons (incl. Silvio Berlusconi) for having committed:[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2005/b/sezioni/cronaca/processome/processome/processome.html?ref=search|title=Milano, chiusa l'indagine Mediaset.

(A) false accounting and embezzlement in order to mask payments of substantial "black funds", committed in 1988-94. 
(B) tax fraud equal in total to more than €62 million (120bn Lira), committed in 1988-98.
Both indictments were related to achievement of personal tax evasion, through illicit trade of movie rights between Mediaset and secret fictive foreign companies situated in tax haven nations, causing fictive losses for Mediaset, with the trade gains being accumulated by the foreign companies owned by the indicted tax fraudsters, who ultimately had the gains paid out as personal profit without paying tax in Italy. In 2007 the court case at first-instance had not yet been launched, and the prosecutors dropped the (A) charges against Berlusconi due to the statute of limitations, and for the same reason the (B) charges were narrowed down to the 1994-98 period, in which the prosecutor charged Berlusconi for having committed a personal tax evasion of €7.3 million.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2012/giugno/19/anni_mesi_carcere_Berlusconi_co_8_120619045.shtml|title=I pm: 3 anni e 8 mesi di carcere a Berlusconi|language=Italian|publisher=Corriere della Sera|date=19 June 2012[/tpl]
On 26 October 2012, Berlusconi was sentenced to four years of punishment by an Italian court for tax evasion.[tpl]cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/Silvio-Berlusconi-sentenced-to-four-years-in-prison-for-tax-fraud/articleshow/16970451.cms|title= Silvio Berlusconi sentenced to four years in prison for tax fraud|accessdate=26 October 2012 | work=The Times Of India[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/10/26/silvio-berlusconi-sentenced-to-four-years-in-prison_n_2023142.html |title=Silvio Berlusconi Sentenced To Four Years In Prison Over Mediaset Tax Evasion |publisher=Huffingtonpost.co.uk |date= |accessdate=27 October 2012[/tpl] The charges were in relation to a scheme to purchase overseas film rights at inflated prices through offshore companies.  The four-year term was longer than the three years and eight months the prosecutors had requested, but was shortened to one year in accord with a 2006 amnesty law intended to reduce prison overcrowding. Berlusconi and his co-defendants were also ordered to pay a 10 million euro fine and were banned from holding public office for three years.
On 8 May 2013, the Court of Appeals in Milan confirmed the four-year prison sentence, and extended the public office ban to five years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://milano.corriere.it/milano/notizie/cronaca/13_maggio_8/berlusconi-processo-mediaset-avanti-decisione-corte-appello-milano-2121033125704.shtml|title=Process Mediaset TV rights: Berlusconi sentenced to four years on appeal (Tax Fraud: confirmed the first instance judgment, including the disqualification from holding public office for 5 years)|language=Italian|publisher=Corriere della Sera|date=8 May 2013[/tpl] On 1 August 2013, the Court of Cassation (final appeal) confirmed the sentence of 4 years, of which the last three years are automatically pardoned.[tpl]cite web|last=Sala|first=Alessandro|title=Confermata la condanna per Berlusconi Il Cavaliere ottiene solo lo stop all'interdizione|url=http://www.corriere.it/politica/13_agosto_01/berlusconi-cassazione-sentenza_fd399324-fa87-11e2-9aaf-71b689b7d489.shtml|publisher=corriere della sera|accessdate=2 August 2013[/tpl] The decision marked the first time that Berlusconi received a definitive sentence, despite being on trial nearly 30 times during the last 25 years. In regards of calculating the exact length of the public office ban, the Court of Cassation asked the lower court to re-judge this, because of prosecutors having presented new legal arguments for the ban to be reduced from five to three years. However, a new anti-corruption law passed in late 2012, referred to as the Severino law, will anyway bar Berlusconi from seeking elective office for six years, independently of the court's final ruling for the public office ban duration. The ramifications of his public office ban is, that it makes him ineligible to serve any public office, but technically he will still be allowed as a non-candidate to continue leading his party and center-right coalition in election campaigns. A similar situation occurred in March 2013, when the leader of the Five Star Movement, Beppe Grillo, convicted over a road accident in 1988, led his party's 2013 election campaign despite he couldn't run for a public office because of a rule established within his movement.[tpl]cite news|title=Silvio Berlusconi sentence: Is this the end for 'Il Cavaliere'?|author=Alberto Nardellli|date=2 August 2013|publisher=CNN|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/02/world/europe/silvio-berlusconi-sentence-analysis/|accessdate=2 August 2013[/tpl]
Berlusconi will due to his high age above 70 years, not be placed direct in prison, but can instead decide if he want to serve his one-year jail term either by a house arrest at one of his private residences or by doing community service. As the gross prison term exceeds two years, the Severino law prompts the Italian senate to vote if Berlusconi shall be forced to resign his current senate seat immediately, or alternatively allowing the court imposed ban on holding public office only to take effect by the end of his current legislative term. The pending senate vote, combined with anger over Berlusconi's conviction – a poll indicated 42% of the public believe he has been unfairly persecuted by the magistrates – present a serious political challenge for the fragile ruling coalition. On 3 August, Berlusconi suggested that unless a "solution" to his predicament could be found, Italy was at "risk of a civil war".[tpl]cite news|title=Protesters rally in Rome against ruling on Berlusconi|author=Paddy Agnew|work=Irish Times|date=5 August 2013|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/protesters-rally-in-rome-against-ruling-on-berlusconi-1.1484565|accessdate=5 August 2013[/tpl] The following day, thousands of supporters gathered in front of his house in protest of the ruling.
On 30 August, the Italian President Giorgio Napolitano announced he had not selected Berlusconi as one of the new four lifetime senators, which are granted the privileges of being a lawmaker for life with some protected legal immunity, meaning they can continue working in politics even after being convicted guilty for criminal offences that otherwise would lead to ban from serving one of the public offices. A Senate committee will begin its deliberations on 9 September, to decide if Berlusconi's public office ban shall start immediately or by the end of his current legislative term. Before the committee decision becomes effective, it will need also to be approved by a vote in the full Senate.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/63b5423e-11ac-11e3-a14c-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2e0hvckUi|title=Berlusconi allies hit out over president’s lifetime senator snub|publisher=Financial Times|date=30 August 2013|accessdate=5 September 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/24/us-italy-berlusconi-idUSBRE97N0AN20130824|title=Berlusconi's party says his removal from parliament is 'unthinkable'|publisher=Reuters|date=24 August 2013|accessdate=5 September 2013|first=Catherine|last=Hornby[/tpl]
The deliberations of the Senate committee are expected to last for several weeks, before they reach a decision. According to the Severino law, which became enacted by the Monti government in December 2012, anyone sentenced to more than two years in prison is deemed ineligible to hold public office for a period of six years (or eight years if convicted for "abuse of power"), and should immediately be expelled from the parliament. Berlusconi has argued that the Severino law can not be used to expel persons convicted for crimes committed ahead of December 2012, and plead for the proceedings to be postponed until the European Court of Human Rights or Italy's constitutional court had ruled, whether or not he was correct about his interpretation of the law. Berlusconi also informed, that he in any case had decided to appeal the court ruling against him to the European Court of Human Rights, as he still claimed the ruling itself to be a political and unjust attempt by his opponents, to deprive him of his political power. The response by Prime Minister Enrico Letta's centre-left Democratic Party was however to reject Berlusconi's plea, accusing him of only launching time-wasting maneuvers.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24015130|title=Italian senators debate Berlusconi expulsion|publisher=BBC News|date=9 September 2013|accessdate=10 September 2013[/tpl] Berlusconi's PDL party then made a threat to withdraw their government support, in case the Senate committee expelled Berlusconi as senator. The Democratic Party replied by warning PDL, that they would reject any blackmail attempts, and in any case only would vote in the Senate committee according to the standard of the Italian law. Ahead of the Senate committee's voting, the leading criminal lawyer Paola Severino, who helped design the Severino law, stated to the La Repubblica newspaper that this specific law according to her professional opinion, clearly also applied for crimes being committed before its enactment in December 2012.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/we-wont-be-blackmailed-italys-fragile-coalition-government-close-to-collapse-as-centreleft-prime-minister-enrico-letta-warns-people-of-freedom-party-that-he-wont-buckle-over-silvio-berlusconi-8780580.html|title='We won't be blackmailed': Italy’s fragile coalition government close to collapse as centre-left prime minister Enrico Letta warns People of Freedom party that he won't buckle over Silvio Berlusconi |publisher=The Independent|date=22 August 2013|accessdate=10 September 2013|location=London|first=Michael|last=Day[/tpl]
On 10 September, at the second day of the Senate deliberations, the Democratic Party stated they intend to vote down all three PDL submitted motions to delay the Senate deliberations, and accused PDL for obstructing the work of the Senate committee by playing delaying tactics.

Berlusconi was expected to start serving his four-year prison sentence (reduced to one year), either under house arrest or doing unpaid social community service, in mid-October 2013. In mid-October he informed the court, that he prefers to serve the sentence by doing community service.

==Controversies==

Berlusconi has been involved in many controversies and over 20 court cases during his political career, including a conviction to 4 years prison and 5 years suspension of public functions by the Court of Appeals for 7 M€ tax evasion (and 280 M€ slush fund) on 8 May 2013, confirmed by the Court of Cassation on 1 August 2013.Mediaset, Berlusconi condannato, La Repubblica online Due to a general pardon, his imprisonment was reduced to one year, which due to his age can be served either as a house arrest at his private residence or as community service.
On 24 June 2013 Berlusconi was found guilty of paying an underage prostitute for sex, and of abusing his powers in an ensuing cover up. He was sentenced to seven years in jail, and banned from public office for life. He is certain to appeal[tpl]update after|2013|8|8[/tpl], and the sentence will not be enforced until the result of the trial is confirmed at appeal.

===Economic conflicts of interest===

According to journalists Marco Travaglio and Enzo Biagi, Berlusconi entered politics to save his companies from bankruptcy and himself from convictions. From the very beginning he said it clearly to his associates. Berlusconi's supporters hailed him as the "novus homo", an outsider who was going to bring a new efficiency to the public bureaucracy and reform the state from top to bottom.
Berlusconi was investigated for forty different inquests in less than two years.
− Berlusconi's governments passed laws that shortened statutory terms for tax fraud. Romano Prodi, who defeated Berlusconi in 2006, claimed that these were ad personam laws, meant to solve Berlusconi's problems and defend his interests.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2002/08/05/no-alle-leggi-ad-personam.html|title=No alle leggi ad personam|language=Italian|work=la Repubblica|date=5 August 2002 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120920/http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2002/08/05/no-alle-leggi-ad-personam.html |archivedate=20 September 2012 |deadurl=no[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2003/05/05/intini-no-alle-leggi-ad-personam.html|title=Intini: no alle leggi ad personam|language=Italian|work=la Repubblica|date=5 May 2003 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120920/http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2003/05/05/intini-no-alle-leggi-ad-personam.html |archivedate=20 September 2012 |deadurl=no[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2006/05/27/via-le-leggi-ad-personam.html|title=Via le leggi ad personam|language=Italian|work=la Repubblica|date=27 May 2006 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120920/http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2006/05/27/via-le-leggi-ad-personam.html |archivedate=20 September 2012 |deadurl=no[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://tv.repubblica.it/home_page.php?playmode=player&cont_id=21342&ref=search|title=Berlusconi getta la maschera|language=Italian|publisher=Repubblica Radio TV|date=17 June 2008 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120920/http://tv.repubblica.it/home_page.php?playmode=player&cont_id=21342&ref=search |archivedate=20 September 2012 |deadurl=no[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=November 2011[/tpl]

===Media control and conflict of interest===

Berlusconi's extensive control over the media has been widely criticised by some analysts, some press freedom organisations, and extensively on several Italian newspapers, national and private TV channels by opposition leaders and in general opposition parties members, who allege Italy's media has limited freedom of expression. However such covereage of the complaint in practice put under discussion the point of the complaint itself. The Freedom of the Press 2004 Global Survey, an annual study issued by the American organisation Freedom House, downgraded Italy's ranking from 'Free' to 'Partly Free'[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/media/pressrel/042804.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20040503211418/http://www.freedomhouse.org/media/pressrel/042804.htm |archivedate=3 May 2004 |title=Global Press Freedom Deteriorates – Proportion of Global Population With Access to Free Media Plunges to New Low Italy Drops to "Partly Free" [/tpl] due to Berlusconi's influence over RAI, a ranking which, in "Western Europe" was shared only with Turkey ([tpl]As of|2005|lc=on[/tpl]). Reporters Without Borders states that in 2004, "The conflict of interests involving prime minister Silvio Berlusconi and his vast media empire was still not resolved and continued to threaten news diversity".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=10148|title=Italy – 2004 Annual report|publisher=Reporters Without Borders |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120920/http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=10148 |archivedate=20 September 2012 |deadurl=no[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=July 2011[/tpl] In April 2004, the International Federation of Journalists joined the criticism, objecting to the passage of a law vetoed by Carlo Azeglio Ciampi in 2003, which critics believe is designed to protect Berlusconi's reported 90% control of the Italian national media.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ifj-europe.org/default.asp?index=2451&Language=EN |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20040927133724/http://www.ifj-europe.org/default.asp?index=2451&Language=EN |archivedate=27 September 2004 |title=Journalists In New Protest as Berlusconi's Grip on Italian Media Becomes A Stranglehold [/tpl]
Berlusconi owns via Mediaset 3 of 7 national TV channels: (Canale 5, Italia 1, and Rete 4).  In 2002, Luciano Violante, a prominent member of the Left, said in a speech in Parliament: "Honourable Anedda, I invite you to ask the honourable Berlusconi, because he certainly knows that he received a full guarantee in 1994, when the government changed — that TV stations would not be touched. He knows it and the Honourable Letta knows it."Luciano Violante addressing the Chamber of Deputies of Italy, 28 February 2002)[tpl]Verify source|date=October 2009[/tpl]  The authors of the book Inciucio[tpl]it icon[/tpl] Inciucio. Peter Gomez and Marco Travaglio, 2005, RCS MediaGroup, ISBN 88-17-01020-0 cite this sentence as evidence for the idea that the Left made a deal with Berlusconi in 1994, in which a promise was made not to honour a law in the Constitutional Court of Italy that would have required Berlusconi to give up one of his three TV channels in order to uphold pluralism and competition. According to the authors, this would be an explanation of why the Left, despite having won the 1996 elections, did not pass a law to solve the conflicts of interest between media ownership and politics.
Berlusconi's influence over RAI became evident when in Sofia, Bulgaria he expressed his views on journalists Enzo Biagi and Michele Santoro,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=3284|title=Media pluralism more threatened than ever|publisher=Reporters Without Borders|date=6 August 2002 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120910/http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=3284 |archivedate=10 September 2012 |deadurl=no[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=July 2011[/tpl] and comedian Daniele Luttazzi. Berlusconi said that they "use television as a criminal means of communication". They lost their jobs as a result. This statement was called by critics "Editto Bulgaro".
The TV broadcasting of a satirical programme called RAIot was censored in November 2003 after the comedienne Sabina Guzzanti made outspoken criticism of the Berlusconi media empire.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=8587|title=RAI suspends satirical programme after lawsuit by Berlusconi-owned company|publisher=Reporters Without Borders|date=22 November 2003 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120910/http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=8587 |archivedate=10 September 2012 |deadurl=no[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=July 2011[/tpl] Mediaset, one of Berlusconi's companies, sued RAI over Guzzanti's program, demanding 20 million euros for "damages"; in November 2003 the show was cancelled by the president of RAI, Lucia Annunziata. The details of the event were made into a Michael Moore-style documentary called Viva Zapatero!, which was produced by Guzzanti.
Mediaset, Berlusconi's television group, has stated that it uses the same criteria as the public (state-owned) television RAI in assigning a proper visibility to all the most important political parties and movements (the so-called 'Par Condicio') – which has been since often disproved.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2006/02/15/le-trappole-della-par-condicio.html|title=Le trappole della par condicio|work=la Repubblica|language=Italian|date=15 February 2006 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120716/http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2006/02/15/le-trappole-della-par-condicio.html |archivedate=16 July 2012 |deadurl=no[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2002/05/09/il-bavaglio-del-polo-alla-rai.html|title=Il Bavaglio Del Polo Alla Rai|work=la Repubblica|language=Italian|date=9 May 2002 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120721/http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2002/05/09/il-bavaglio-del-polo-alla-rai.html |archivedate=21 July 2012 |deadurl=no[/tpl] In March 2006, on the television channel Rai Tre, in a television interview with Lucia Annunziata during his talk show, In 1/2 h, he stormed out of the studio because of a disagreement with the host journalist regarding the economic consequences of his government.[tpl]Cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/12/world/europe/12iht-italy-5839062.html|title=Berlusconi walks off show after a testy exchange |work=International Herald Tribune |date=12 March 2006 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120920/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/12/world/europe/12iht-italy-5839062.html |archivedate=20 September 2012 |deadurl=no[/tpl] In November 2007, allegations of news manipulation caused the departure from RAI of Berlusconi's personal assistant.[tpl]Cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article5188289.ece|title=Silvio Berlusconi: Yes, yes, yes, Prime Minister|work=The New Yorker /The Times|date=23 November 2008 | location=London | first=Alexander | last=Stille | accessdate=30 March 2010 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120920/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article5188289.ece |archivedate=20 September 2012 |deadurl=no[/tpl]

===The Economist===

One of Berlusconi's strongest critics in the media outside Italy is the British weekly The Economist (nicknamed by Berlusconi "The Ecommunist"), which in its issue of 26 April 2001 carried a title on its front cover, 'Why Silvio Berlusconi is unfit to lead Italy'. The war of words between Berlusconi and The Economist has gained notoriety, with Berlusconi taking the publication to court in Rome and The Economist publishing letters against him.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.hebig.org/blogs/archives/main/001105.php |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030817191337/http://www.hebig.org/blogs/archives/main/001105.php |archivedate=17 August 2003 |title=An open letter to Silvio Berlusconi [/tpl] The magazine claimed that the documentation contained in its article proves that Berlusconi is 'unfit' for office[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=593654|title=Fit to run Italy?|publisher=Economist|date=26 April 2001 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120920/http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=593654 |archivedate=20 September 2012 |deadurl=no[/tpl] because of his numerous conflicts of interest. Berlusconi claimed the article contained "a series of old accusations" that was an "insult to truth and intelligence".
According to The Economist's findings, Berlusconi, while Prime Minister of Italy, retained effective control of 90% of all national television broadcasting. This figure included stations he owns directly as well as those over which he had indirect control by dint of his position as Prime Minister and his ability to influence the choice of the management bodies of these stations. The Economist has also claimed that the Italian Prime Minister is corrupt and self-serving. A key journalist for The Economist, David Lane, has set out many of these charges in his book Berlusconi's Shadow.
−    
− Lane points out that Berlusconi has not defended himself in court against the main charges, but has relied upon political and legal manipulations, most notably by changing the statute of limitation to prevent charges being completed in the first place. In order to publicly prove the truth of the documented accusations contained in their articles, the newspaper has publicly challenged Berlusconi to sue The Economist for libel. Berlusconi did so,[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/media/pdf/20080905122118632.pdf |title=Document from the Milan court of justice |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2 March 2010 |work=The Economist[/tpl] losing versus The Economist, and being charged for all the trial costs on 5 September 2008, when the Court in Milan issued a judgment rejecting all Mr Berlusconi's claims and sentenced him to compensate for legal expenses.

===Legislative changes===

On some occasions, laws passed by the Berlusconi administration have effectively delayed ongoing trials on him. For example the law reducing punishment for all cases of false accounting and the law on legitimate suspicion, which allowed defendants to request their cases to be moved to another court if they believe that the local judges are biased against them. Because of these legislative actions, political opponents accuse Berlusconi of passing these laws for the purpose of protecting himself from legal charges.  La Repubblica, for example, sustained that Berlusconi passed 17 different laws which have advantaged himself.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2009/11/sezioni/politica/giustizia-18/inchiesta-davanzo/inchiesta-davanzo.html |title=Per Silvio Berlusconi 18 salvacondotti in 15 anni |language=Italian |work=la Repubblica |date=23 November 2009 |accessdate=2 March 2010 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120915/http://www.repubblica.it/2009/11/sezioni/politica/giustizia-18/inchiesta-davanzo/inchiesta-davanzo.html |archivedate=15 September 2012 |deadurl=no[/tpl] Berlusconi and his allies, on the other hand, maintain that such laws are consistent with everyone's right to a rapid and just trial, and with the principle of presumption of innocence (garantismo); furthermore, they claim that Berlusconi is being subjected to a political "witch hunt", orchestrated by certain (allegedly left-wing) judges.
Berlusconi and his government quarreled with the Italian judiciary often. His administration attempted a judiciary reform intended to limit the flexibility of judges and magistrates in their decision-making.  Critics said it would instead limit the magistrature's independence by de facto subjecting the judiciary to the executive's control. The reform was met by almost unanimous dissent from the Italian judges, but was passed by the Italian parliament in December 2004.  It was vetoed by the Italian President, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi.
During the night hours between 5 and 6 March 2010, the Berlusconi-led Italian government passed a decree "interpreting" the electoral law to let the PDL candidate run for governor in Lazio after she had failed to properly register for the elections. The Italian Constitution states that electoral procedures can only be changed in Parliament, and must not be changed by governmental decree.

Silvio Berlusconi has never been tried on charges relating to Cosa Nostra, although several Mafia turncoats have stated that Berlusconi had connections with the Sicilian criminal association. The claims arise mostly from the hiring of Vittorio Mangano, charged for Mafia association, as a gardener and stable-man at Berlusconi's Villa San Martino in Arcore, a small town near Milan. It was Berlusconi's friend Marcello Dell'Utri who introduced Mangano to Berlusconi in 1973.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/world/displaystory.cfm?story_id=587107 |title=An Italian Story |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120724/http://www.economist.com/world/displaystory.cfm?story_id=587107 |archivedate=24 July 2012 |deadurl=no |work=The Economist |date=28 April 2001[/tpl], The Economist, 26 April 2001[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2638609.stm |title=Berlusconi accused of Mafia links |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120721/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2638609.stm |archivedate=21 July 2012 |deadurl=no |work=BBC News |date=8 January 2003[/tpl], BBC News, 8 January 2003 Berlusconi denied any ties to the Mafia.

Berlusconi refused to comment on the sentence. In 2010, Palermo's appeals court cut the sentence to seven years but fully confirmed Dell'Utri's role as a link between Berlusconi and the mafia until 1992.[tpl]cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKTRE6AI5D120101119 |title=UK.reuters.com |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120920/http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKTRE6AI5D120101119 |archivedate=20 September 2012 |deadurl=no |work=Reuters |date=19 November 2010[/tpl], Reuters UK, 19 November 2010
In 1996, a Mafia informer, Salvatore Cancemi, declared that Berlusconi and Dell'Utri were in direct contact with Salvatore Riina, head of the Sicilian Mafia in the 1980s and 1990s. Cancemi disclosed that Fininvest, through Marcello Dell'Utri and mafioso Vittorio Mangano, had paid Cosa Nostra 200 million lire (between 100,000 and 200,000 of today's euro) annually. The alleged contacts, according to Cancemi, were to lead to legislation favourable to Cosa Nostra, in particular the harsh 41-bis prison regime. The underlying premise was that Cosa Nostra would support Berlusconi's Forza Italia party in return for political favours.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4183973,00.html |title=Berlusconi friend on trial for 'aiding Mafia' |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120920/http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4183973,00.html |archivedate=20 September 2012 |deadurl=no |location=London |work=The Guardian |first=Philip |last=Willan |date=10 May 2001[/tpl], The Guardian, 10 May 2001 After a two-year investigation, magistrates closed the inquiry without charges. They did not find evidence to corroborate Cancemi's allegations. Similarly, a two-year investigation, also launched on evidence from Cancemi, into Berlusconi's alleged association with the Mafia was closed in 1996.
According to yet another mafia turncoat, Antonino Giuffrè – arrested on 16 April 2002 – the Mafia turned to Berlusconi's Forza Italia party to look after the Mafia's interests, after the decline in the early 1990s of the ruling Christian Democrat party, whose leaders in Sicily looked after the Mafia's interests in Rome. The Mafia's fall out with the Christian Democrats became clear when Salvo Lima was killed in March 1992. "The Lima murder marked the end of an era," Giuffrè told the court. "A new era opened with a new political force on the horizon which provided the guarantees that the Christian Democrats were no longer able to deliver. To be clear, that party was Forza Italia."[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2003/jan/08/italy.philipwillan|title=Berlusconi aide 'struck deal with mafia'|work=The Guardian | location=London |date=8 January 2003 | first=Philip | last=Willan | accessdate=30 March 2010 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120802/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2003/jan/08/italy.philipwillan |archivedate=2 August 2012 |deadurl=no[/tpl] Dell'Utri was the go-between on a range of legislative efforts to ease pressure on mafiosi in exchange for electoral support, according to Giuffrè.

Provenzano stated that the Mafia's judicial problems would be resolved within 10 years after 1992, thanks to the undertakings given by Forza Italia.
Giuffrè also said that Berlusconi himself used to be in touch with Stefano Bontade, a top Mafia boss, in the mid-1970s. At the time Berlusconi still was just a wealthy real estate developer and started his private television empire. Bontade visited Berlusconi's villa in Arcore through his contact Vittorio Mangano. Berlusconi's lawyer dismissed Giuffrè's testimony as "false" and an attempt to discredit the Prime Minister and his party. Giuffrè said that other Mafia representatives who were in contact with Berlusconi included the Palermo Mafia bosses Filippo Graviano and Giuseppe Graviano.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/online/cronaca/giuffredue/verbale/verbale.html|title=Giuffré: il boss Graviano era il tramite con Berlusconi|language=Italian|work=la Repubblica|date=3 December 2002 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120907/http://www.repubblica.it/online/cronaca/giuffredue/verbale/verbale.html |archivedate=7 September 2012 |deadurl=no[/tpl] The Graviano brothers allegedly treated directly with Berlusconi through the business-man Gianni Letta, somewhere between September/October 1993.

Dell'Utri's lawyer, Enrico Trantino, dismissed Giuffrè's allegations as an "anthology of hearsay". He said Giuffrè had perpetuated the trend that every new turncoat would attack Dell'Utri and the former Christian Democrat prime minister Giulio Andreotti in order to earn money and judicial privileges.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2002/dec/05/italy.philipwillan|title=Berlusconi implicated in deal with godfathers|work=The Guardian | location=London |date=5 December 2002 | first=Philip | last=Willan | accessdate=30 March 2010 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120802/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2002/dec/05/italy.philipwillan |archivedate=2 August 2012 |deadurl=no[/tpl]
In October 2009, Gaspare Spatuzza, a Mafioso turned pentito in 2008, has confirmed Giuffrè statements. Spatuzza testified that his boss Giuseppe Graviano had told him in 1994 that Berlusconi was bargaining with the Mafia, concerning a political-electoral agreement between Cosa Nostra and Berlusconi's Forza Italia. Spatuzza said Graviano disclosed the information to him during a conversation in a bar Graviano owned in the upscale Via Veneto district of the Italian capital Rome. Dell'Utri was the intermediary, according to Spatuzza. Dell'Utri has dismissed Spatuzza's allegations as "nonsense". Berlusconi's lawyer and MP for the PdL, Niccolò Ghedini said that "the statements given by Spatuzza about prime minister Berlusconi are baseless and can be in no way verified."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.adnkronos.com/AKI/English/Politics/?id=3.0.3909367513 |title=Lawyer rejects turncoat's claims linking Berlusconi to mafia |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120723/http://www.adnkronos.com/AKI/English/Politics/?id=3.0.3909367513 |archivedate=23 July 2012 |deadurl=no[/tpl], Adnkronos International, 23 October 2009

===Remarks on Western civilisation and Islam===

After the 11 September 2001 attacks in New York, Berlusconi said: "We must be aware of the superiority of our civilisation, a system that has guaranteed well-being, respect for human rights and – in contrast with Islamic countries – respect for religious and political rights, a system that has as its value understanding of diversity and tolerance."[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/storm-over-berlusconi--inferior-muslims-remarks-670971.html|title=Storm over Berlusconi 'inferior Muslims' remarks|work=The Independent |location=UK|date=27 September 2001 | accessdate=30 March 2010[/tpl] [tpl]dead link |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/storm-over-berlusconi--inferior-muslims-remarks-670971.html|date=September 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wsws.org/articles/2001/sep2001/ital-s29.shtml|title=Racist vomit from Italy's PM Berlusconi|work=WSWS|date=29 September 2001 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120920/http://www.wsws.org/articles/2001/sep2001/ital-s29.shtml |archivedate=20 September 2012 |deadurl=no[/tpl] This declaration caused an uproar, not only in the Arab and Muslim world, but also all around Europe, including Italy.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1565664.stm|title=EU deplores 'dangerous' Islam jibe|publisher=BBC News|date=27 September 2001 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120920/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1565664.stm |archivedate=20 September 2012 |deadurl=no[/tpl] Subsequently Berlusconi told the press: "We are aware of the crucial role of moderate Arab countries...

===Right-to-die case===

After the family of Eluana Englaro (who had been comatose for 17 years) succeeded in having her right to die recognized by the judges and getting doctors to start the process of allowing her to die in the way established by the court, Berlusconi issued a decree to stop the doctor from letting her die. Stating that, "This is murder. I would be failing to rescue her. I'm not a Pontius Pilate", Berlusconi went on to defend his decision by claiming that she was "in the condition to have babies",[tpl]Cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/feb/08/englaro-italy-vatican |work=Guardian |title=Italy faces constitutional crisis over coma woman |date=8 February 2008 | location=London | accessdate=30 March 2010 | first=Michael | last=Day[/tpl] arguing that comatose women were still subject to menstruation.
Critics said that this controversial move had been staged to repair relations with the Vatican, following harsh criticism of the treatment of immigrants by the Berlusconi administration.

===Anti-immigration laws===

During his long career as Prime Minister, Berlusconi has had to deal with a massive immigration from the coast of the North Africa. Due to limit the illegal immigration, the Berlusconi's government promulgated the Bossi-Fini law in 2002. This law took the name by the leaders of the two right-wing allied parties in Berlusconi's government coalition, Umberto Bossi of Lega Nord and Gianfranco Fini of National Alliance.http://www.amnesty.it/pressroom/ra2006/italia.html?page=ra2006
The law provides the expulsion, issued by administrative by the Prefect of the Province where is traced an illegal foreign immigrat, is immediately performed to the accompaniment at the border by the police. Illegal immigrants without valid identity documents, are taken to detention centers, set up by the Turco-Napolitano law, in order to be identified. The law provides for the issuance of residence permits to persons who provide proof of having a job for their maintenance budget. To this general rule you add the special residence permits and those in the application of the right to asylum.
The standard allows the rejections to the country of origin on the high seas, on the basis of bilateral agreements between Italy and neighboring countries, which commit the police forces of their respective countries to cooperate in the prevention of illegal immigration. If the ships dock of illegal immigrants on Italian soil, the identification of those entitled to political asylum and the supply of medical treatment and care takes place in the media of police forces at sea. The law had been severally criticized by the centre-left opposition.
In 2013 the European Parliament asked Italy to modified the Bossi-Fini law because it was too restrictive and severe.http://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2013/10/23/immigrazione-parlamento-ue-modificare-norme-che-infliggono-sanzioni-a-chi-aiuta/754022/

Berlusconi had made disparaging remarks about Finnish cuisine during negotiations to decide on the location of the European Food Safety Authority in 2001. He caused further offence in 2005, when he claimed that during the negotiations he had had to "dust off his playboy charms" in order to persuade the Finnish president, Tarja Halonen, to concede that the EFSA should be based in Parma instead of Finland, and compared Finnish smoked reindeer unfavourably to culatello.

On 24 January 2009, Berlusconi announced his aim to increase the numbers of military patrolling the Italian cities from 3,000 to 30,000 in order to crack down on what he called an "evil army" of criminals. Responding to a female journalist who asked him if this tenfold increase in patrolling soldiers would be enough to secure Italian women from being raped, he said: "We could not field a big enough force to avoid this risk rape. We would need as many soldiers as beautiful women and I don't think that would be possible, because our women are so beautiful." Opposition leaders called the remarks insensitive and in bad taste. Berlusconi retorted that he had merely wanted to compliment Italian women. Other critics accused him of creating a "police state".[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/4339817/Silvio-Berlusconi-criticised-for-pretty-girl-rape-comment.html|title=Silvio Berlusconi criticised for 'pretty girl' rape comment |work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London |date=4 April 2009 | first=Nick | last=Squires | accessdate=30 March 2010 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120920/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/4339817/Silvio-Berlusconi-criticised-for-pretty-girl-rape-comment.html |archivedate=20 September 2012 |deadurl=no[/tpl]

In October 2010, Berlusconi was chastised by the Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano after he was filmed telling "offensive and deplorable jokes", including one whose punchline was similar to one of the gravest blasphemies in the Italian language. It was also revealed he had made another antisemitic joke a few days previously. Berlusconi responded to the allegations by saying the jokes were "neither an offence nor a sin, but merely a laugh".[tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/oct/03/silvio-berlusconi-under-fire-jokes | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Tom | last=Kington | title=Silvio Berlusconi condemned by Vatican newspaper for 'deplorable' jokes | date=3 October 2010 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120802/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/oct/03/silvio-berlusconi-under-fire-jokes |archivedate=2 August 2012 |deadurl=no[/tpl]
On 1 November 2010, after once again being accused of involvement in juvenile prostitution, he suggested that an audience at the Milan trade fair should stop reading newspapers: "Don't read newspapers any more because they deceive you. ...

On 27 January 2013, on the occasion of the Holocaust Remembrance Day, Berlusconi said the Italian fascist dictator Benito Mussolini, except from passing anti-Jewish laws in 1938, only had done "good things" for Italy; and also said Mussolini from a strategic point of view did the right thing in siding with Adolf Hitler during World War II, because Hitler at the point of time when the alliance was made had appeared to be winning the war.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/27/us-italy-berlusconi-mussolini-idUSBRE90Q0B620130127|title=Berlusconi defends Mussolini, draws outrage from political left|publisher=Reuters|date=27 January 2013[/tpl]

===Friendship with Bettino Craxi===

Berlusconi's career as an entrepreneur is also often questioned by his detractors. The allegations made against him generally include suspicions about the extremely fast increase of his activity as a construction entrepreneur in years 1961–63, hinting at the possibility that in those years he received money from unknown and possibly illegal sources. These accusations are regarded by Berlusconi and his supporters as empty slander, trying to undermine Berlusconi's reputation as a self-made man. Also frequently cited by opponents are events dating to the 1980s, including supposed "favour exchanges" between Berlusconi and Bettino Craxi, the former Socialist prime minister and leader of the Italian Socialist Party convicted in 1994 for various corruption charges. The Milan magistrates who indicted and successfully convicted Mr. Craxi in their "Clean Hands" investigation laid bare an entrenched system in which businessmen paid hundreds of millions of dollars to political parties or individual politicians in exchange for sweetheart deals with Italian state companies and the government itself.[tpl]Cite news|work=The New York Times |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/20/news/20iht-obit.2.t_32.html?scp=2&sq=craxi&st=cse |title=Bettino Craxi, Italian Socialist Leader, Dies in Tunisiader |date=20 January 2000|accessdate=11 November 2009 | first=Alan | last=Friedman |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120920/http://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/20/news/20iht-obit.2.t_32.html?scp=2&sq=craxi&st=cse |archivedate=20 September 2012 |deadurl=no[/tpl] Berlusconi acknowledges a personal friendship with Craxi.

===Freedom Army===

On 28 May 2013, Berlusconi and his entourage launched an online initiative which consisted in the recruitment of volunteers, who are available to defend Berlusconi from the convictions of Milan's prosecutors, who are dealing with his trials,Foto Contro la persecuzione dei magistrati, arriva "l'esercito di Silvio" per difendere il Cavaliere.

===Wiretaps and accusations of corruption===

In December 2007 the audio recording of a phone call between Berlusconi, then leader of the opposition parties, and Agostino Saccà (general director of RAI) were published by the magazine L'espresso and caused a scandal in several media.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2007/12/sezioni/politica/berlusconi-indagato/berlusconi-regime/berlusconi-regime.html|title=Inchiesta Berlusconi "Saccà va sospeso" L'ex premier: "Solleva il morale del Capo"|language=Italian|work=la Repubblica|date=13 December 2007[/tpl]
The wiretap was part of an investigation by the Public Prosecutor Office of Naples, where Berlusconi was investigated for corruption.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.corriere.it/cronache/07_dicembre_12/berlusconi_indagato_corruzione_sacca_a47dd26e-a884-11dc-8e86-0003ba99c53b.shtml|title=Berlusconi indagato per corruzione|language=Italian|work=Corriere della Sera|date=12 December 2007[/tpl]
In the phone call, Saccà expresses words of impassioned political support to Berlusconi and criticises the behaviour of Berlusconi's allies. Berlusconi urges Saccà to broadcast a telefilm series which was strongly advocated by his ally Umberto Bossi. Saccà laments that many people have spread rumours on this agreement causing problems to him. Then Berlusconi asks Saccà to find a job in RAI for a young woman explicitly telling him that this woman would serve as an asset in a secret exchange with a senator of the majority who would help him to cause Prodi, with his administration, to fall.[tpl]cite web|url=http://espresso.repubblica.it/dettaglio/Pronto-Silvio-sono-Sacca/1917587|title=Pronto Silvio, sono Saccà|language=Italian|work=L'espresso |location=Italy|date=20 December 2007[/tpl][tpl]Clarify|date=February 2011[/tpl] After the publication of these wiretaps, Berlusconi has been accused by other politicians and by some journalists of political corruption through the exploitation of prostitution. Berlusconi said, in his own defence: "In the entertainment world everybody knows that, in certain situations in RAI TV you work only if you prostitute yourself or if you are leftist. I have intervened on behalf of some personalities who are not leftists and have been completely set apart by RAI TV."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.corriere.it/politica/07_dicembre_20/berlusconi_rai_sinistra_4933f5e8-aefe-11dc-8fe5-0003ba99c53b.shtml|title=Berlusconi: "In Rai tutti raccomandati"|language=Italian|work=Corriere della Sera|date=20 December 2007[/tpl] In the US State Department's 2011 Trafficking in Persons report authorized by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Mr. Berlusconi was explicitly named as a person involved in the "commercial sexual exploitation of a Moroccan child".[tpl]cite web|url=http://e-edition.metro.co.uk/2011/10/31/index.html?p=11 |title=Metro UK - 31/10/2011 digital edition |publisher=E-edition.metro.co.uk |date= |accessdate=1 November 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Pisa |first=Nick |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/silvio-berlusconi/8858275/Silvio-Berlusconi-named-on-US-government-report-on-people-trafficking.html |title=Silvio Berlusconi named on US government report on people trafficking |publisher=Telegraph |date= 30 October 2011|accessdate=1 November 2011 |location=London[/tpl]

===Divorce and allegations of sexual misconduct===

At the end of April 2009, Veronica Lario wrote an open letter expressing her anger at Berlusconi's choice of young, attractive female candidates—some with little or no political experience—to represent the party in the 2009 European Parliament elections. Berlusconi demanded a public apology, claiming that for the third time his wife had "done this to me in the middle of an election campaign", and stated that there was little prospect of his marriage continuing.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8032392.stm|title=Berlusconi demands wife apology|publisher=BBC News|date=4 May 2009|accessdate=4 May 2009[/tpl]  On 3 May, Lario announced she was filing for divorce.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2009/04/28/berlusconi-vien-di-notte-per-gli-auguri.html|title=Berlusconi vien di notte per gli auguri a Noemi|date=28 April 2009|work=la Repubblica|language=Italian[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://corrieredelmezzogiorno.corriere.it/napoli/notizie/politica/2009/28-aprile-2009/blitz-berlusconi-casoria-18-anni-figlia-un-imprenditore-campano-1501302597082.shtml|title=Blitz di Berlusconi a Casoria per i 18 anni della figlia di un imprenditore campano|date=28 April 2009|work=Corriere del Mezzogiorno |location=Italy|language=Italian[/tpl] She claimed that Berlusconi had not attended his own sons' 18th birthday parties, and that she "cannot remain with a man who consorts with minors" and "is not well".[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8031520.stm|title=Berlusconi's wife to divorce him|publisher=BBC News|date=3 May 2009|accessdate=3 May 2009[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article6216767.ece|title=Wife of the Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi sues for divorce|work=The Times | location=London |date=4 May 2009|accessdate=4 May 2009 | first1=Richard | last1=Owen | first2=Anne | last2=Hanley[/tpl]

Berlusconi's lifestyle has raised eyebrows in Catholic circles, with vigorous criticism being expressed in particular by the newspaper Avvenire, owned by the Conferenza Episcopale Italiana (Conference of Italian Bishops).

===Ruby Rubacuori===

In November 2010, teenage Moroccan belly dancer and alleged prostitute Karima El Mahroug (better known as "Ruby Rubacuori") claimed to have been given $10,000 by Berlusconi at parties at his private villas. The girl told prosecutors in Milan that these events were like orgies where Berlusconi and 20 young women performed an African-style ritual known as the "bunga bunga" in the nude.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/11/09/3061762.htm?section=justin|title=Exile an option for besieged Berlusconi|publisher=ABC News (Australia)|date=9 November 2010|accessdate=9 November 2010[/tpl]Berlusconi’s "Bunga Bunga Orgies": Daily Beast 7 November 2010 Retrieved 25 November 2010
It was also found out that, on 27 May 2010, El Mahroug had been arrested for theft by the Milan police but (being still a minor) she was directed to a shelter for juvenile offenders. After a couple of hours, while she was being questioned, Berlusconi, who was at the time in Paris, called the head of the police in Milan and pressured for her release, claiming the girl was related to then President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and that in order to avoid a diplomatic crisis, she was to be brought to the custody of Nicole Minetti.  Following repeated telephone calls by Berlusconi to the police authorities, El Mahroug was eventually released and entrusted to Minetti's care.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ansa.it/web/notizie/rubriche/english/2011/01/26/visualizza_new.html_1616141984.html |title=Prosecutors send fresh evidence for Ruby case searches: Lombardy councillor at centre of scandal summoned |publisher=ANSA |date=26 January 2011[/tpl]
The investigation of Berlusconi for extortion (concussione) and child prostitution regarding Karima El Mahroug has been referred to as "Rubygate".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2011/01/14/ruby-b-under-investigation-for-child-prostitution-videos-and-photos-found-in-girl%E2%80%99s-laptop/86481/ |title=Ruby, B. under investigation for child prostitution Videos and photos found in girl's laptop | Redazione Il Fatto Quotidiano | Il Fatto Quotidiano |publisher=Ilfattoquotidiano.it |date=14 January 2011 |accessdate=1 November 2011[/tpl] MP Gaetano Pecorella proposed to lower the age of majority in Italy to solve the case.[tpl]cite web|url=http://rassegna.governo.it/testo.asp?d=55045063 |title=Governo Italiano — Rassegna stampa |publisher=Rassegna.governo.it |date= |accessdate=1 November 2011[/tpl] Minetti was known for previous associations with Berlusconi, having danced for Colorado Cafe, a show on one of Berlusconi's TV channels, and on Scorie, an Italian version of Candid Camera. In November 2009 she became a dental hygienist, and shortly afterward treated Berlusconi for two broken teeth and facial injuries after he was attacked with a marble statue at a political rally.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] In February 2010, she was selected as one of the candidates representing Berlusconi's The People of Freedom party, despite her lack of any political experience, and was seated on the Regional Council of Lombardy the following month.[tpl]cite news |last=Walker |first=Peter |date=14 January 2011 |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jan/14/ruby-rubacuori-silvio-berlusconi |title=Ruby Rubacuori could finally bring down Silvio Berlusconi |work=The Guardian |location=UK[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.newkerala.com/news/world/fullnews-127291.html |title=Female politician 'organized lesbian romps for Silvio Berlusconi |publisher=New Kerala |date=19 January 2011[/tpl]
The Guardian reported that according to a series of media reports in October 2010, Berlusconi had met El Mahroug, then 17, through Nicole Minetti. Mahroug insisted that she had not slept with the then 74-year-old prime minister. She told Italian newspapers that she merely attended dinner at his mansion near Milan. El Mahroug said she sat next to Berlusconi, who later took her upstairs and gave her an envelope containing €7,000. She said he also gave her jewelry.
Berlusconi has also come under fire for reportedly spending $1.8 million in state funds from RAI Cinema to further the career of a largely unknown Bulgarian actress, Michelle Bonev. The fact that this coincided with severe cuts being made to the country's arts budget provoked a strong reaction from the public.Berlusconi in Hot Water Again for Using State Funds to Help Actress at ARTINFO.com
In January 2011, Berlusconi was placed under criminal investigation relating to El Mahroug for allegedly having sex with an underage prostitute and for abuse of office relating to her release from detention.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.newsweek.com/2011/01/14/more-heat-for-berlusconi.html |title=Berlusconi Faces New Criminal Probe in Italy |work=Newsweek |date=14 January 2011[/tpl] Berlusconi's lawyers were quick to deny the allegations as "absurd and without foundation" and called the investigation a "serious interference with the private life of the prime minister without precedent in the judicial history of the country".[tpl]Cite news |last=Faris |first=Stephan |title=Did Italy's Berlusconi Pay for Sex?|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2042595,00.html |work=Time |date=14 January 2011 |accessdate=22 January 2011[/tpl]
On 15 February 2011, a judge indicted Berlusconi to stand trial on charges carrying up to 15 years in prison.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/feb/15/silvio-berlusconi-trial-teenage-sex |title=Silvio Berlusconi sent for trial accused of paying for sex with teenager |date=15 February 2011 |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=15 February 2011 |first=John |last=Hooper[/tpl][tpl]Cite news |title=Silvio Berlusconi faces Ruby sex charge trial in April |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12083491 |accessdate=15 February 2011 |publisher=BBC News |date=15 February 2011[/tpl] Paying for sex with a minor in Italy is punished within a range of six months to three years imprisonment, while the crime of malfeasance in office (It: concussione) is more severely punished, from four years to twelve years imprisonment, as it is considered a type of extortion committed by a public officer.
The fast-track trial opened on 6 April and was adjourned until 31 May. El Mahroug's lawyer said that Mahroug would not be attaching herself to the case as a civil complainant and denies that she ever made herself available for money. Another alleged victim, Giorgia Iafrate, also decided not to be a party to the case. In January 2013, judges rejected an application from Berlusconi's lawyers to have the trial adjourned so that it would not interfere with Italy's 2013 general election in which Berlusconi participated.
On 24 June 2013, Berlusconi was found guilty of paying for sex with an underage prostitute and of abusing his office. He was sentenced to seven years in prison, one more year than had been requested by the prosecution, and banned from public office for life.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/24/silvio-berlusconi-guilty-underage-prostitute|title=Silvio Berlusconi found guilty of paying for sex|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=24 June 2013|location=London|first=Lizzy|last=Davies|date=24 June 2013[/tpl] Although facing a custodial sentence, if Berlusconi appeals the sentence as expected, it will not be executed until after the appeals process. In the trial, the prosecution claimed that Berlusconi had paid over 4.5 million euros in total for El Mahroug's services.

==Assault at rally==

On 13 December 2009 Berlusconi was hit in the face with an alabaster[tpl]Cite news | title = Tartaglia interrogato dai pm 'Gesto folle, ma premeditato' | language = Italian | publisher=La Repubblica | date = 15 December 2009 | url = http://www.repubblica.it/2009/12/sezioni/politica/giustizia-22/testimone-nuovo/testimone-nuovo.html  |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120920/http://www.repubblica.it/2009/12/sezioni/politica/giustizia-22/testimone-nuovo/testimone-nuovo.html |archivedate=20 September 2012 |deadurl=no[/tpl] statuette of Milan Cathedral after a rally in Milan's Piazza del Duomo. As Berlusconi was shaking hands with the public, a man in the crowd stepped forward and launched the statuette at him.

In the night of 15–16 December a 26-year old man was stopped by police and Berlusconi's bodyguards while trying to gain access to Berlusconi's hospital room. A search revealed that he carried no weapons, although three hockey sticks and two knives were later found in his car.

==Personal fortune==

In 2012, Forbes magazine reported that Berlusconi was Italy's sixth richest man, with a net worth of $5.9 billion. He holds significant assets in television, newspaper, publishing, cinema, finance, banking, insurance, and sports.[tpl]Cite news | url = http://www.forbes.com/lists/2010/10/billionaires-2010_The-Worlds-Billionaires_CountryOfCitizen_13.html | title = Forbes; The World's Billionaires by Country|publisher=Forbes|date=3 October 2010  |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120731/http://www.forbes.com/lists/2010/10/billionaires-2010_The-Worlds-Billionaires_CountryOfCitizen_13.html |archivedate=31 July 2012 |deadurl=no[/tpl] Berlusconi's main company, Mediaset, operates three national television channels covering half of the national television sector; and Publitalia (it), the leading Italian advertising and publicity agency. Berlusconi also owns a controlling stake in Arnoldo Mondadori Editore, the largest Italian publishing house, whose publications include Panorama, one of the country's most popular news magazines. His brother, Paolo Berlusconi, owns and operates il Giornale, a centre-right wing newspaper which provides a pro-Berlusconi slant on Italian politics. Il Foglio, one of the most influential Italian right-wing newspapers, is partially owned by his wife, Veronica Lario. After Lario sold some of her ownership in 2010, Paolo Berlusconi acquired a majority interest in the newspaper. Berlusconi is also the founder and major shareholder of Fininvest, which is among the largest private companies in Italy[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mbres.it/sites/default/files/resources/download_it/ps_1.pdf |title=List of large private Italian companies|format=PDF |date= |accessdate=27 October 2012[/tpl]
