Amadora ([tpl]IPA-pt|ɐmɐˈðoɾɐ[/tpl]) is a municipality and urbanized city in the northwest of the Lisbon Metropolitan Area. The municipal population is 175,872 distributed in eleven civil parishs, with an area of [tpl]convert|23.77|km2|mi2[/tpl]: it is one of the most densely populated municipalities in Portugal.

==History==

Originally named Porcalhota, for being a Majorat of the daughter of one man surnamed Porcalho who was called for being a female Porcalhota.
The Aqueduto das Águas Livres, which brings water from Sintra hills to Lisbon, and stretches [tpl]convert|30|km|mi[/tpl], was finished in the 1770s and includes the largest masonry only arch ever built, located in Campolide — local coat of arms also displays the aqueduct (like others along its way).
At the request of its population, in 1907, King Carlos merged the communities of Porcalhota, Amadora and Venteira into one municipality that he named Amadora.
At the present time Amadora does not have any airfield. However, in the 1920s a small airfield (the first in Portugal) was located here. The first air-travel from Portugal to Brazil had its departure from Amadora. The Captain of the airplane was Adm. Gago Coutinho, a well known Portuguese celebrity.
The municipality was formed on 11 September 1979, when it ceased being a parish of the municipality of Oeiras.
The former Sorefame railway rolling stock factory was located in Amadora, but was closed in 2004. Most of the carriages for Portuguese Railways built during the second half of the 20th century were constructed here.

==Geography==

One of the largest urban communities in Portugal, Amadora forms a conurbation with the Lisbon, sharing the same subway, bus and train networks. It is essentially a suburban extension of the capital, dominated by large apartment blocks, commercial parks and industrial areas.
The municipality is divided into several parishes, responsible for the administration of services and providing local area authority, which include:
Although major rehabilitation plans have been started, Amadora is still regarded as a city with a crime rate higher than the national average. The neighborhood of Cova da Moura, in Amadora, is an incredible example of what one might call lateral citizenship. Starting during the 1970s and 1980s, in less than 30 years, over 10,000 men and women, mostly from the Cape Verde (but also from the North of Portugal and Angola), built an illegal town inside the city. Drug dealing and gangs, as well as unemployment and poverty, are responsible for most of the fear that Cova da Moura inspires to any average citizen. The place is, however, home to dozens of hairdressers that operate in Cova da Moura and are responsible for some of the most creative hair sculptures one can see everywhere in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, and is a centre of both rap music and Hip Hop Tuga suburban culture.

==Economy==

Despite being essentially a residential city, Amadora has commercial zones, industries and headquarters of international companies operating in Portugal.
As commercial zones, it has IKEA, Deacathlon, Alegro, Continente and Dolce Vita Tejo (one of the biggest shopping malls in Europe). Siemens and Roche are examples of international companies based in Amadora.

==Transport==

Amadora's public transport network is extremely far-reaching and reliable, being fully integrated with the transportation network of the Lisbon Metropolitan Area. It has 2 metro stations, the commuter Sintra train line with 3 stations, 2 bus services (Vimeca and Carris) and 4 motorways around the city (2ª Circular, CRIL, CREL and IC-16).

==Culture==

Every year, Amadora city organizes the Amadora International Comics Festivalhttp://www.amadorabd.com/.
