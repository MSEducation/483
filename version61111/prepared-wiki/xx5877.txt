In the 12th and 13th centuries the Ayyubid dynasty constructed many buildings throughout the Middle East, being influenced by their predecessors, the Fatimids, and their rivals, the Crusaders, whilst also developing their own techniques.Peterson, 1996, p.26. Furthermore, women of the Ayyubid family took a prominent role in the patronage of new constructions.Necipoğlu, 1994, pp.35-36. The Ayyubids’ most famous works are the Halil-ur-Rahman Mosque that surrounds the Pool of Sacred Fish in Urfa, the Citadel of CairoHarry Ades, A Traveller's History of Egypt, Arris Publishing Ltd. 2007 ISBN 1-905214-01-4 p226 and most parts of the Citadel of Aleppo.[tpl]Citation|title=The Citadel of Aleppo: Description, History, Site Plan and Visitor Tour (Guidebook)|url=http://archnet.org/library/documents/one-document.jsp?document_id=10623|first1=Julia|last1=Gonnella|publisher=Aga Khan Trust for Culture and the Syrian Directorate-General of Antiquities and Museums|year=2008|isbn=978-2-940212-02-6[/tpl] Another important piece of Kurdish architectural heritage from the late 12th/early 13th century is the Yezidi pilgrimage site Lalish, with its trademark conical roofs.
In later periods too, Kurdish rulers and their corresponding dynasties and emirates would leave their mark upon the land in the form mosques, castles and bridges, some of which have decayed, or have been (partly) destroyed in an attempt to erase the Kurdish cultural heritage, such as the White Castle of the Bohtan Emirate. Well-known examples are Hosap Castle of the 17th century,Verity Campbell - Turkey - 2007 - 724 pages, page 643, ISBN 1-74104-556-8 Sherwana Castle of the early 18th century, and the Ellwen Bridge of Khanaqin of the 19th century.
Most famous is the Ishak Pasha Palace of Dogubeyazit, a structure with heavy influences from both Anatolian and Iranic architectural traditions. Construction of the Palace began in 1685, led by Colak Abdi Pasha, a Kurdish bey of the Ottoman Empire, but the building wouldn’t be completed until 1784, by his grandson, Ishak Pasha.Lonely Planet (2012) 'Ishak Pasha Palace'. Retrieved 7 July 2013.Institut kurde de Paris (2011) 'THE RESTORATION OF ISHAQ PASHA’S PALACE WILL BE COMPLETED IN 2013'. Retrieved 7 July 2013. Containing almost 100 rooms, including a mosque, dining rooms, dungeons and being heavily decorated by hewn-out ornaments, this Palace has the reputation as being one of the finest pieces of architecture of the Ottoman Period, and of Anatolia.
In recent years, the KRG has been responsible for the renovation of several historical structures, such as Erbil Citadel and the Mudhafaria Minaret.UNESCO Office for Iraq (2007) 'Revitalization Project of Erbil Citadel'. Retrieved 7 July 2013.
