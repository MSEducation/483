[[Cold dark matter]]

CATEGORIES: Dark matter

In cosmology and physics, cold dark matter (CDM) is a hypothetical form of matter (a kind of dark matter) whose particles move slowly compared to the speed of light (the cold in CDM) and interact very weakly with electromagnetic radiation (the dark in CDM). It is believed that approximately 80% of matter in the Universe is dark matter, with only a small fraction being the ordinary baryonic matter that composes stars, planets and living organisms. [tpl]As of|2006[/tpl], most cosmologists favor the cold dark matter theory as a description of how the Universe went from a smooth initial state at early times (as shown by the cosmic microwave background radiation) to the lumpy distribution of galaxies and their clusters we see today — the large-scale structure of the Universe. The theory sees the role that dwarf galaxies played as crucial, as they are thought to be natural building blocks that form larger structures, created by small-scale density fluctuations in the early Universe. The theory was originally published in 1984 by American physicists Joel R. Primack, George Blumenthal, and Sandra Moore Faber with British scientist Martin Rees.
In the cold dark matter theory, structure grows hierarchically, with small objects collapsing under their self-gravity first and merging in a continuous hierarchy to form larger and more massive objects. In the hot dark matter paradigm, popular in the early 1980s, structure does not form hierarchically (bottom-up), but rather forms by fragmentation (top-down), with the largest superclusters forming first in flat pancake-like sheets and subsequently fragmenting into smaller pieces like our galaxy the Milky Way. The predictions of the hot dark matter theory disagree with observations of large-scale structures, whereas the cold dark matter paradigm is in general agreement with the observations.

==Composition==

Dark matter is detected through its gravitational interactions with ordinary matter and radiation. As such, it is very difficult to determine what the constituents of cold dark matter are. The candidates fall roughly into three categories:

| year=  2010
}}[/ref] Axions have the theoretical advantage that their existence solves the Strong CP problem in QCD, but have not been detected.

==Challenges==

Several discrepancies between the predictions of the particle cold dark matter paradigm and observations of galaxies and their clustering have arisen:
All of these problems have a number of proposed solutions, and it remains unclear how serious a challenge they represent for the CDM paradigm.[tpl]Cite journal|arxiv = 1006.1647 |title=Local-Group tests of dark-matter Concordance Cosmology: Towards a new paradigm for structure formation|year=2010|last1=Kroupa|first1=P.|last2=Famaey|first2=B.|last3=de Boer|first3=Klaas S.|last4=Dabringhausen|first4=Joerg|last5=Pawlowski|first5=Marcel|last6=Boily|first6=Christian|last7=Jerjen|first7=Helmut|last8=Forbes|first8=Duncan|last9=Hensler|first9=Gerhard|journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume=523|pages=32–54|display-authors = 9 [/tpl]
