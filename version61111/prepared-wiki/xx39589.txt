Ariane 2 was a European expendable carrier rocket, which was used for six launches between 1986 and 1989. It was a member of the Ariane family of rockets, and was produced by AÃ©rospatiale in France.
The Ariane 2 was derived from the earlier Ariane 1, with stretched first and third stages. Its payload capacity was increased to [tpl]convert|2175|kg[/tpl] to a geosynchronous transfer orbit. It first flew on 31 May 1986 carrying the Intelsat-5A F-14 satellite. The third stage failed to ignite, and the rocket was destroyed by range safety. Following this, five more launches were conducted, all of which were successful. The last Ariane 2 launch occurred on 2 April 1989, successfully placing Tele-X into orbit.
