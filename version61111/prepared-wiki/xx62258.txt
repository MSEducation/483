Pottsylvania is a fictional country that appeared in the television series Rocky and His Friends and The Bullwinkle Show, collectively referred to as Rocky and Bullwinkle.
Pottsylvania is a parody of a Cold WarSnow, Tony: "Clinton's War Objective: To Make The World Safe for Diplomates", pg B7.

It was noted for being a nation dedicated to all matters related to espionage and deceitfulness; children were taught in schools how to commit crimes, for instance, while casual conversations would have double meanings.
Populated entirely by government agents and saboteurs, Pottsylvania is the one nation where the cold war never thawed. Its highest honor was the Double Cross, and its newspaper, The Pottsylvania Eavesdropper, was printed in invisible ink. While many considered Pottsylvania to be a spoof, it was considered offensive by the government of the Soviet Union, which banned Rocky & Bullwinkle as anti-Soviet propaganda.http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9500E1D91F31F933A05757C0A9669C8B63 Lidz, Frank:" SUMMER FILMS: CREATURE FEATURES; The Ongoing Adventures of Moose and Squirrel", New York Times, April 30, 2000
Pottsylvania's industries, besides espionage, included production of a vehicle called the "Assassin-8". Millions were built despite Pottsylvania having only 12 miles of road.
Natural landmarks included "Whynchatakea Peak", a large mountain. The geography of Pottsylvania is indeterminate, however. In some locations it appears to be a peninsula, while in others it appears to be either a coastal nation (with seaports) or completely landlocked. Nevertheless, it is accessible by submarine, which appears to be the main form of entry.
Flora and fauna in Pottsylvania included the man-eating Venus flytrap-like plant known as the "Pottsylvania Creeper," and one of the world's few supplies of mooseberry bushesâ€”mooseberries being an ingredient used (in Rocky and Bullwinkle's world) for the production of rocket fuel.
The government of Pottsylvania had been headed by a uniformed dictator known only as Fearless Leader. (In some episodes, another important government figure is Mr. Big.)

==National anthem==

"Hail Pottsylvania" is the national anthem of Pottsylvania, which appears in The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle.
Lyrics:
Hail, Pottsylvania
Hail to the black and the blue!
Hail, Pottsylvania
Sneaky and crooked through and through,
Down with the good guys, up with the boss
Under the sign of the triple cross, hey!
Hail, Pottsylvania,
Hail, hail, hail!
