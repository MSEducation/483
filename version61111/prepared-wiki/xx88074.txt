George Washington Wilson (7 February 1823 - 9 March 1893) Roger Taylor, George Washington Wilson, artist and photographer, 1823-93. Aberdeen University Press, 1981. was a pioneering Scottish photographer.

==Biography==

After studying art in Edinburgh and London, Wilson returned to his native city of Aberdeen in 1849 and established a business as a portrait miniaturist catering to the wealthy families of the North East of Scotland. After some years of mediocre success, Wilson ventured into portrait photography in 1852 setting a portrait studio with John Hay in 25 Crown Street in Aberdeen. From there, aided by his well-developed technical and commercial acumen and a contract to photograph the Royal Family while documenting the building of Balmoral Castle in 1854-1855, he established himself as one of Scotland's premier photographers working for Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in 1860.
Pioneering the development of techniques for photography outside of the studio and the mass production of photographic prints, he moved increasingly from portraiture to landscape photography in the 1860s. He also produced stereoscopic pictures whose main characteristic was that exposures were very short. By 1864 he claimed to have sold over half a million prints.  At the time of his death in 1893 (he had handed over the business to his sons, Charles, Louis and John Hay Wilson in 1888) the firm employed 40 staff and was one of the largest publishers of photographic prints in the world, competing with James Valentine, who was also a prolific photographer, with a large company in Dundee. The  business survived until 1908, when it was wound up at auction.Alastair J Durie, Tourism and commercial photography in Victorian Scotland: the rise and fall of G W Wilson & Co., 1853-1908, Northern Scotland, vol.12, 1992.

Over 40,000 of Wilson's photographic glass plates still exist today, largely due to the meticulous washing and chemical treatments he insisted on. Aberdeen University is in possession of some 38,000 of these,Elizabeth Bennett, Photographic treasures in the George Washington Wilson Collection.
