West Siberian economic region ([tpl]lang-ru|За́падно-Сиби́рский экономи́ческий райо́н[/tpl]; 
tr.: Zapadno-Sibirsky ekonomichesky rayon) is one of twelve economic regions of Russia.  
This vast plain—marshy and thinly populated in the north, hilly in the south—is of growing economic importance, mostly due to the abundance of natural resources: oil, coal, wood, water. There are vast oilfields in the Tyumen Oblast, and Russia's largest oil refinery is in Omsk. The Kuznetsk Basin around Kemerovo and Novokuznetsk is a center of coal mining, and the production of iron, steel, machinery, and chemicals. Logging is a significant industry throughout the region. Hydroelectric stations dam the Ob near Novosibirsk and Kamen-na-Obi. The navigable Ob-Irtysh watershed covers most of this area, and the southern part is also criss-crossed by the Trans-Siberian, South Siberian and Turkestan-Siberian rail lines. Agricultural products include wheat, rice, oats, and sugar beets, and livestock is raised.Russia. The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. 2001-07

==Composition==

==Socio-economic indicators==

The official economic statistics give a positive profile to this region. Not only is GDP in total high due to its substantial total population, but also reported GDP per capita is almost half above the Russian mean, as is industrial productivity. In keeping with this, wage levels are a third above the national average. However, the likelihood of getting paid in full is 14% below the national level. The region's economy is, moreover, relatively low in privatized ex-state enterprises, and only average in new private sector employment.
Levels of social welfare are close to the national mean in terms of life expectancy for men and women, and the proportion of students in higher education. However, popular attitudes in the region give a negative picture of West Siberia. Compared to other regions, people are much less likely to expect life to improve, and are even more negative in their rating of the national economy.West Siberia
