==History==

Werribee station was designed by Frederick Kawerau in partnership with the engineer for the Geelong - Melbourne line Edward Snell. A stone plaque incised "G&M R 1857', was once on the south gable, but was lost when the station burnt down in 1911.Andrew Ward, Citation -Werribee Station, Werribee Our Story It has since been found, built into the wall of the Victorian Railways printing works in Laurens Street, North Melbourne.Harrigan, Victorian Railways to '62
In May 1927 the station building was heavily damaged by fire. As part of the rebuilding, a new, low-pitched roof was provided, and the surviving bluestone walls were cement rendered. The line from Newport to Werribee was electrified in November 1983 and the island platform built. Werribee was upgraded to a Premium station in 1997.[tpl]cite journal|date=October 1997|title=Upgrading Eltham to a Premium Station|journal=Newsrail|publisher=Australian Railway Historical Society|page=page 310[/tpl]
