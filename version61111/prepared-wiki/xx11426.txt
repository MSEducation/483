Virginia ([tpl]IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Virginia.ogg|v|ɚ|ˈ|dʒ|ɪ|n|j|ə[/tpl]), officially the Commonwealth of Virginia, is a U.S. state located in the South Atlantic region of the United States. Virginia is nicknamed the "Old Dominion" due to its status as a former dominion of the English Crown,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Old_Dominion|title=Old Dominion|publisher=Encyclopedia Virginia[/tpl] and "Mother of Presidents" due to the most U.S. presidents having been born there. The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population [tpl]as of|2013|lc=on[/tpl] is over 8.2 million.
The area's history begins with several indigenous groups, including the Powhatan. In 1607 the London Company established the Colony of Virginia as the first permanent New World English colony. Slave labor and the land acquired from displaced Native American tribes each played a significant role in the colony's early politics and plantation economy. Virginia was one of the 13 Colonies in the American Revolution and joined the Confederacy in the American Civil War, during which Richmond was made the Confederate capital and Virginia's northwestern counties seceded to form the state of West Virginia. Although the Commonwealth was under single-party rule for nearly a century following Reconstruction, both major national parties are competitive in modern Virginia.
The Virginia General Assembly is the oldest continuous law-making body in the New World.[tpl]cite web|title=About the General Assembly|url=http://virginiageneralassembly.gov/virginiaLegislature.php?secid=20&activesec=2#!hb=1&mainContentTabs=4&content=4,includes/contentTemplate.php%3Ftid%3D52%26ctype%3Db%26cid%3D31|work=Website: Virginia General Assembly|publisher=State of Virginia|accessdate=June 5, 2013[/tpl] The state government has been repeatedly ranked most effective by the Pew Center on the States. It is unique in how it treats cities and counties equally, manages local roads, and prohibits its governors from serving consecutive terms. Virginia's economy has many sectors: agriculture in the Shenandoah Valley; federal agencies in Northern Virginia, including the headquarters of the Department of Defense and CIA; and military facilities in Hampton Roads, the site of the region's main seaport. Virginia's economy transitioned from primarily agricultural to industrial during the 1960s and 1970s, and in 2002 computer chips became the state's leading export.

==Geography==

Virginia has a total area of [tpl]convert|42774.2|sqmi|km2|1[/tpl], including [tpl]convert|3180.13|sqmi|km2|1[/tpl] of water, making it the 35th-largest state by area.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2000/phc3-us-pt1.pdf |format= PDF |page= 71 |work= United States Census Bureau |date=April 2004 |title= 2000 Census of Population and Housing |accessdate= November 3, 2009[/tpl] Virginia is bordered by Maryland and Washington, D.C. to the north and east; by the Atlantic Ocean to the east; by North Carolina and Tennessee to the south; by Kentucky to the west; and by West Virginia to the north and west. Virginia's boundary with Maryland and Washington, D.C. extends to the low-water mark of the south shore of the Potomac River.[tpl]cite web|url=http://nsglc.olemiss.edu/SandBar/SandBar2/2.4supreme.htm|title=Supreme Court Rules for Virginia in Potomac Conflict|work=The Sea Grant Law Center|publisher=University of Mississippi|year=2003|accessdate=November 24, 2007[/tpl] The southern border is defined as the 36° 30′ parallel north, though surveyor error led to deviations of as much as three arcminutes.[tpl]harvnb|Hubbard, Jr.|2009|p=140[/tpl] The border with Tennessee was not settled until 1893, when their dispute was brought to the U.S. Supreme Court.[tpl]harvnb|Van Zandt|1976|pp=92–95[/tpl]

===Geology and terrain===

The Chesapeake Bay separates the contiguous portion of the Commonwealth from the two-county peninsula of Virginia's Eastern Shore. The bay was formed after the drowned river valleys of the Susquehanna River and the James River.[tpl]cite web|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/fs102-98/|title=Fact Sheet 102–98 – The Chesapeake Bay: Geologic Product of Rising Sea Level|publisher=United States Geological Survey|date=November 18, 1998|accessdate=August 24, 2009[/tpl] Many of Virginia's rivers flow into the Chesapeake Bay, including the Potomac, Rappahannock, York, and James, which create three peninsulas in the bay.[tpl]harvnb|Burnham|Burnham|2004|pp=7, 56–57[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://web.wm.edu/geology/virginia/rivers/rivers.html|title=Rivers and Watersheds|work=The Geology of Virginia|publisher=College of William and Mary|date=February 23, 2007|accessdate=April 11, 2008[/tpl] Geographically and geologically, Virginia is divided into five regions from east to west: Tidewater, Piedmont, Blue Ridge Mountains, Ridge and Valley, and Cumberland Plateau.[tpl]harvnb|The Encyclopedia of Virginia|1999|pp=2–15[/tpl]
The Tidewater is a coastal plain between the Atlantic coast and the fall line. It includes the Eastern Shore and major estuaries of Chesapeake Bay. The Piedmont is a series of sedimentary and igneous rock-based foothills east of the mountains which were formed in the Mesozoic.[tpl]harvnb|Pazzaglia|2006|pp=135–138[/tpl] The region, known for its heavy clay soil, includes the Southwest Mountains.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.deq.state.va.us/vanaturally/guide/agriculture.html|title=Virginia's Agricultural Resources|work=Natural Resource Education Guide|publisher=Virginia Department of Environmental Quality|date=January 21, 2008|accessdate=February 8, 2008[/tpl] The Blue Ridge Mountains are a physiographic province of the chain of Appalachian Mountains with the highest points in the state, the tallest being Mount Rogers at [tpl]convert|5729|ft|m[/tpl].[tpl]harvnb|Burnham|Burnham|2004|p=277[/tpl] The Ridge and Valley region is west of the mountains, and includes the Great Appalachian Valley.

In this region, rivers flow northwest, with a dendritic drainage system, into the Ohio River basin.[tpl]harvnb|Palmer|1998|pp=49–51[/tpl]
The state's carbonate rock is filled with more than 4,000 caves, ten of which are open for tourism.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dmme.virginia.gov/DMR3/dmrpdfs/CAVES.pdf|format=PDF|title=Caves|publisher=Virginia Department of Mines, Minerals and Energy|date=July 2008|accessdate=August 24, 2009[/tpl]
The Virginia seismic zone has not had a history of regular earthquake activity. Earthquakes are rarely above 4.5 in magnitude because Virginia is located away from the edges of the North American Plate. The largest earthquake, at an estimated 5.9 magnitude, was in 1897 near Blacksburg.[tpl]cite web|url=http://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/states/events/1897_05_31.php|title=Largest Earthquake in Virginia|date=January 25, 2008|publisher=United States Geological Survey|accessdate=April 12, 2008[/tpl] A 5.8 magnitude earthquake struck central Virginia on August 23, 2011, near Mineral.

===Climate===

The climate of Virginia becomes increasingly warmer and more humid farther south and east.[tpl]harvnb|Burnham|Burnham|2004|pp=1–3[/tpl] Seasonal extremes vary from average lows of [tpl]convert|26|°F|°C|0[/tpl] in January to average highs of [tpl]convert|86|°F|°C|0[/tpl] in July. The Atlantic ocean has a strong effect on eastern and southeastern coastal areas of the state. Influenced by the Gulf Stream, coastal weather is subject to hurricanes, most pronouncedly near the mouth of Chesapeake Bay.[tpl]cite web|url=http://climate.virginia.edu/description.htm|title=Virginia's Climate|first1=Bruce P.|last1=Hayden|first2=Patrick J.|last2=Michaels|work=Department of Environmental Sciences|publisher=University of Virginia|date=January 20, 2000|accessdate=October 20, 2008|ref=CITEREFHaydenMichaels2000[/tpl]
Virginia has an annual average of 35–45 days of thunderstorm activity, particularly in the western part of the state,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.vaemergency.com/news/history/thunderstorms-lightening|title=Thunderstorms and Lightening|work=Virginia Department of Emergency Management|date=April 2, 2001|accessdate=November 26, 2011[/tpl] and an average annual precipitation of [tpl]convert|42.7|in|cm|0[/tpl]. Cold air masses arriving over the mountains in winter can lead to significant snowfalls, such as the Blizzard of 1996 and winter storms of 2009–2010. The interaction of these elements with the state's topography creates distinct microclimates in the Shenandoah Valley, the mountainous southwest, and the coastal plains.[tpl]cite web|title=The Natural Communities of Virginia|publisher=Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation|url=http://www.dcr.virginia.gov/natural_heritage/ncoverview.shtml|year=2006|accessdate=April 12, 2008[/tpl] Virginia averages seven tornadoes annually, most F2 or lower on the Fujita scale.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.tv3winchester.com/blogs/laurynrickettsblog/15421801.html|title=Tornadoes DO happen in Virginia!|publisher=TV3 Winchester|first=Lauryn|last=Ricketts|date=February 7, 2008|accessdate=February 13, 2009[/tpl]
In recent years, the expansion of the southern suburbs of Washington, D.C. into Northern Virginia has introduced an urban heat island primarily caused by increased absorption of solar radiation in more densely populated areas.[tpl]cite web|url=http://climate.virginia.edu/advisory/2001/ad01-07.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20020922182906/http://climate.virginia.edu/advisory/2001/ad01-07.htm|archivedate=September 22, 2002|title=Advisory 01/07: The Hot Get Hotter?

===Flora and fauna===

Forests cover 65% of the state, primarily with deciduous, broad leaf trees.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.deq.virginia.gov/vanaturally/guide/forests.html|title=Virginia's Forest Resources|work=Natural Resource Education Guide|publisher=Virginia Department of Environmental Quality|date=January 21, 2008|accessdate=February 8, 2008[/tpl] Lower altitudes are more likely to have small but dense stands of moisture-loving hemlocks and mosses in abundance, with hickory and oak in the Blue Ridge. However since the early 1990s, Gypsy moth infestations have eroded the dominance of oak forests.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/shen/naturescience/forests.htm|title=Shenandoah National Park — Forests|publisher=National Park Service|date=July 25, 2006|accessdate=September 10, 2007[/tpl] In the lowland tidewater yellow pines tend to dominate, with bald cypress wetland forests in the Great Dismal and Nottoway swamps. Other common trees and plants include chestnut, maple, tulip poplar, mountain laurel, milkweed, daisies, and many species of ferns. The largest areas of wilderness are along the Atlantic coast and in the western mountains, where the largest populations of trillium wildflowers in North America are found.[tpl]harvnb|Carroll|Miller|2002|pp=xi−xii[/tpl] The Atlantic coast regions are host to flora commonly associated with the South Atlantic pine forests and lower Southeast Coastal Plain maritime flora, the latter found primarily in southeastern Virginia.
Mammals include White-tailed deer, black bear, beaver, bobcat, coyote, raccoon, skunk, groundhog, Virginia Opossum, gray fox, red fox, and eastern cottontail rabbit.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dgif.virginia.gov/wildlife/information/?t=2|title=Species Information: Mammals|publisher=Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries|year=2008|accessdate=November 15, 2008[/tpl] Other mammals include: nutria, fox squirrel, gray squirrel, flying squirrel, chipmunk, brown bat, and weasel. Birds include cardinals (the State Bird), barred owls, Carolina chickadees, Red-tailed Hawks, Ospreys, Brown Pelicans, Quail, Sea gulls, Bald Eagles, and Wild Turkeys. Virginia is also home to both the large and small piliated woodpecker as well as the common woodpecker. The Peregrine Falcon was reintroduced into Shenandoah National Park in the mid-1990s.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/shen/naturescience/birds.htm|title=Shenandoah National Park — Birds|publisher=National Park Service|date=July 25, 2006|accessdate=September 1, 2007[/tpl] Walleye, brook trout, Roanoke bass, and blue catfish are among the 210 known species of freshwater fish.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dgif.virginia.gov/wildlife/fish/|title=Virginia Fishes|publisher=Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries|year=2008|accessdate=November 15, 2008[/tpl] Running brooks with rocky bottoms are often inhabited by plentiful amounts of crayfish and salamanders. The Chesapeake Bay is host to many species, including blue crabs, clams, oysters, and rockfish (also known as striped bass).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chesapeakebay.net/info/baybio1.cfm|title=Bay Biology|publisher=Chesapeake Bay Program|date=January 5, 2006|accessdate=February 4, 2008[/tpl]
Virginia has 30 National Park Service units, such as Great Falls Park and the Appalachian Trail, and one national park, the Shenandoah National Park.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/state/VA/index.htm|title=Virginia|publisher=National Park Service|year=2008|accessdate=November 29, 2008[/tpl] Shenandoah was established in 1935 and encompasses the scenic Skyline Drive. Almost 40% of the park's area (79,579 acres/322 km2) has been designated as wilderness under the National Wilderness Preservation System.[tpl]harvnb|Carroll|Miller|2002|p=158[/tpl] Additionally, there are 34 Virginia state parks and 17 state forests, run by the Department of Conservation and Recreation and the Department of Forestry.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dcr.virginia.gov/state_parks/state_park.shtml|title=Park Locations|publisher=Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation|date=November 9, 2007|accessdate=January 26, 2008[/tpl] The Chesapeake Bay, while not a national park, is protected by both state and federal legislation, and the jointly run Chesapeake Bay Program which conducts restoration on the bay and its watershed. The Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge extends into North Carolina, as does the Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge, which marks the beginning of the Outer Banks.[tpl]harvnb|Smith|2008|pp=152–153, 356[/tpl]

==History==

Jamestown 2007 marked Virginia's quadricentennial year, celebrating 400 years since the establishment of the Jamestown Colony. The celebrations highlighted contributions from Native Americans, Europeans, and Africans, each of which had a significant part in shaping Virginia's history.[tpl]harvnb|Wallenstein|2007|pp=406–407[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/13/AR2007051300412.html|first1=Fredrick|last1=Kunkle|first2=Steve|last2=Vogel|title=President Bush Caps Celebration Of Success in Face of Adversity|accessdate=November 11, 2009|work=The Washington Post|date=May 14, 2007[/tpl] Warfare, including among these groups, has also had an important role. Virginia was a focal point in conflicts from the French and Indian War, the American Revolution and the Civil War, to the Cold War and the War on Terrorism.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lva.virginia.gov/public/guides/vmd/vmdintro.htm|title=Virginia Military Dead Database Introduction|work=Library of Virginia|publisher=Government of Virginia|year=2009|accessdate=April 26, 2009[/tpl] Stories about historic figures, such as those surrounding Pocahontas and John Smith, George Washington's childhood, or the plantation elite in the slave society of the antebellum period, have also created potent myths of state history, and have served as rationales for Virginia's ideology.[tpl]harvnb|Abrams|1999|p=xv[/tpl]

===Colony===

The first people are estimated to have arrived in Virginia over 12,000 years ago.Karenne Wood, ed., The Virginia Indian Heritage Trail, Charlottesville, VA: Virginia Foundation for the Humanities, 2007. By 5,000 years ago more permanent settlements emerged, and farming began by 900 AD. By 1500, the Algonquian peoples had founded towns such as Werowocomoco in the Tidewater region, which they referred to as Tsenacommacah. The other major language groups in the area were the Siouan to the west, and the Iroquoians, who included the Nottoway and Meherrin, to the north and south. After 1570, the Algonquians consolidated under Chief Powhatan in response to threats from these other groups on their trade network.[tpl]harvnb|Heinemann|Kolp|Parent, Jr.|Shade|2007|pp=4–11[/tpl] Powhatan controlled more than 30 smaller tribes and over 150 settlements, who shared a common Virginia Algonquian language. In 1607, the native Tidewater population was between 13,000 and 14,000.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/jame/historyculture/powhatan-indian-lifeways.htm|title=Powhatan Indian Lifeways|publisher=National Park Service|first=Lee|last=Cotton|date=July 1999|accessdate=June 26, 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080924132642/http://www.nps.gov/jame/historyculture/powhatan-indian-lifeways.htm|archivedate=September 24, 2008[/tpl]

The Company financed the first permanent English settlement in the "New World", Jamestown. Named for King James I, it was founded in May 1607 by Christopher Newport.[tpl]harvnb|Conlin|2009|pp=30–31[/tpl] In 1619, colonists took greater control with an elected legislature called the House of Burgesses. With the bankruptcy of the London Company in 1624, the settlement was taken into royal authority as an English crown colony.[tpl]harvnb|Gordon|2004|p=17[/tpl]
Life in the colony was perilous, and many died during the Starving Time in 1609 and the Anglo-Powhatan Wars, including the Indian massacre of 1622, which fostered the colonists' negative view of all tribes.[tpl]harvnb|Hoffer|2006|p=132[/tpl][tpl]harvnb|Grizzard|Smith|2007|pp=128–133[/tpl] By 1624, only 3,400 of the 6,000 early settlers had survived."The lost colony and Jamestown droughts.", Stahle, D.

Tensions and the geographic differences between the working and ruling classes led to Bacon's Rebellion in 1676, by which time current and former indentured servants made up as much as 80% of the population.[tpl]harvnb|Heinemann|Kolp|Parent, Jr.|Shade|2007|pp=51–59[/tpl] Rebels, largely from the colony's frontier, were also opposed to the conciliatory policy towards native tribes, and one result of the rebellion was the signing at Middle Plantation of the Treaty of 1677, which made the signatory tribes tributary states and was part of a pattern of appropriating tribal land by force and treaty. Middle Plantation saw the founding of The College of William & Mary in 1693 and was renamed Williamsburg as it became the colonial capital in 1699.[tpl]harvnb|Heinemann|Kolp|Parent, Jr.|Shade|2007|pp=76–77[/tpl] In 1747, a group of Virginian speculators formed the Ohio Company, with the backing of the British crown, to start English settlement and trade in the Ohio Country west of the Appalachian Mountains.[tpl]harvnb|Anderson|2000|p=23[/tpl] France, which claimed this area as part of their colony of New France, viewed this as a threat, and the ensuing French and Indian War became part of the Seven Years' War (1756–1763).

===Statehood===

The British Parliament's efforts to levy new taxes following the French and Indian War were deeply unpopular in the colonies. In the House of Burgesses, opposition to taxation without representation was led by Patrick Henry and Richard Henry Lee, among others.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/declaration/bio26.htm|title=Signers of the Declaration (Richard Henry Lee)|publisher=National Park Service|date=April 13, 2006|accessdate=February 2, 2008[/tpl] Virginians began to coordinate their actions with other colonies in 1773, and sent delegates to the Continental Congress the following year.[tpl]harvnb|Gutzman|2007|pp=24–29[/tpl] After the House of Burgesses was dissolved by the royal governor in 1774, Virginia's revolutionary leaders continued to govern via the Virginia Conventions. On May 15, 1776, the Convention declared Virginia's independence from the British Empire and adopted George Mason's Virginia Declaration of Rights, which was then included in a new constitution.[tpl]harvnb|Heinemann|Kolp|Parent, Jr.|Shade|2007|pp=125–133[/tpl] Another Virginian, Thomas Jefferson, drew upon Mason's work in drafting the national Declaration of Independence.[tpl]cite journal|last=Schwartz|first=Stephan A.|title=George Mason: Forgotten Founder, He Conceived the Bill of Rights|journal=Smithsonian|issue=31.2|page=142|date=May 2000[/tpl]
When the American Revolutionary War began, George Washington was selected to head the colonial army. During the war, the capital was moved to Richmond at the urging of Governor Thomas Jefferson, who feared that Williamsburg's coastal location would make it vulnerable to British attack.[tpl]harvnb|Cooper|2007|p=58[/tpl] In 1781, the combined action of Continental and French land and naval forces trapped the British army on the Virginia Peninsula, where troops under George Washington and Comte de Rochambeau defeated British General Cornwallis in the Siege of Yorktown. His surrender on October 19, 1781 led to peace negotiations in Paris and secured the independence of the colonies.[tpl]harvnb|Heinemann|Kolp|Parent, Jr.|Shade|2007|pp=131–133[/tpl]
Virginians were instrumental in writing the United States Constitution. James Madison drafted the Virginia Plan in 1787 and the Bill of Rights in 1789. Virginia ratified the Constitution on June 25, 1788. The three-fifths compromise ensured that Virginia, with its large number of slaves, initially had the largest bloc in the House of Representatives. Together with the Virginia dynasty of presidents, this gave the Commonwealth national importance. In 1790, both Virginia and Maryland ceded territory to form the new District of Columbia, though the Virginian area was retroceded in 1846.[tpl]harvnb|Wallenstein|2007|p=104[/tpl] Virginia is called "Mother of States" because of its role in being carved into states like Kentucky, which became the 15th state in 1792, and for the numbers of American pioneers born in Virginia.

===Civil War and aftermath===

In addition to agriculture, slave labor was increasingly used in mining, shipbuilding and other industries.[tpl]harvnb|Davis|2006|pp=125, 208–210[/tpl] The execution of Gabriel Prosser in 1800, Nat Turner's slave rebellion in 1831 and John Brown's Raid on Harpers Ferry in 1859 marked the growing social discontent over slavery and its role in the plantation economy. By 1860, almost half a million people, roughly 31% of the total population of Virginia, were enslaved.[tpl]cite web|url=http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu/php/start.php?year=V1960|title=Census Data for Year 1860|publisher=University of Virginia|year=2007|accessdate=April 6, 2010[/tpl][tpl]harvnb|Morgan|1998|p=490[/tpl] This division contributed to the start of the American Civil War.
Virginia voted to secede from the United States on April 17, 1861, after the Battle of Fort Sumter and Abraham Lincoln's call for volunteers. On April 24, Virginia joined the Confederate States of America, which chose Richmond as its capital.[tpl]harvnb|Robertson|1993|pp=8–12[/tpl] After the 1861 Wheeling Convention, 48 counties in the northwest separated to form a new state of West Virginia, which chose to remain loyal to the Union. Virginian general Robert E. Lee took command of the Army of Northern Virginia in 1862, and led invasions into Union territory, ultimately becoming commander of all Confederate forces. During the war, more battles were fought in Virginia than anywhere else, including Bull Run, the Seven Days Battles, Chancellorsville, and the concluding Battle of Appomattox Court House.[tpl]harvnb|Goodwin|2012|pp=4[/tpl] After the capture of Richmond in April 1865, the state capital was briefly moved to Lynchburg,[tpl]cite web|last=Tripp|first=Steve|title=Lynchburg During the Civil War|url=http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Lynchburg_During_the_Civil_War|work=Encyclopedia of Virginia|publisher=Library of Virginia|accessdate=May 28, 2013[/tpl] while the Confederate leadership fled to Danville.[tpl]harvnb|Robertson|1993|p=170[/tpl] Virginia was formally restored to the United States in 1870, due to the work of the Committee of Nine.[tpl]harvnb|Heinemann|Kolp|Parent, Jr.|Shade|2007|pp=249–250[/tpl]
During the post-war Reconstruction era, Virginia adopted a constitution which provided for free public schools, and guaranteed political, civil, and voting rights.[tpl]harvnb|Morgan|1992|pp=160–166[/tpl] The populist Readjuster Party ran an inclusive coalition until the conservative white Democratic Party gained power after 1883.[tpl]harvnb|Dailey|Gilmore|Simon|2000|pp=90–96[/tpl] It passed segregationist Jim Crow laws and in 1902 rewrote the Constitution of Virginia to include a poll tax and other voter registration measures that effectively disfranchised most African Americans and many poor whites.[tpl]harvnb|Wallenstein|2007|pp=253–254[/tpl] Though their schools and public services were segregated and underfunded due to a lack of political representation, African Americans were able to unite in communities and take a greater role in Virginia society.[tpl]harvnb|Davis|2006|pp=328–329[/tpl]

===Modern era===

New economic forces also changed the Commonwealth. Virginian James Albert Bonsack invented the tobacco cigarette rolling machine in 1880 leading to new industrial scale production centered around Richmond. In 1886, railroad magnate Collis Potter Huntington founded Newport News Shipbuilding, which was responsible for building six major World War I-era battleships for the U.S. Navy from 1907–1923.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.northropgrumman.com/heritage/index.html |title= Our Heritage |publisher= Northrop Grumman |date= December 20, 2011 |accessdate= March 28, 2012[/tpl] During the war, German submarines like U-151 attacked ships outside the port.[tpl]harvnb|Feuer|1999|pp=50–52[/tpl] In 1926, Dr. W.A.R.

Protests started by Barbara Rose Johns in 1951 in Farmville against segregated schools led to the lawsuit Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County. This case, filed by Richmond natives Spottswood Robinson and Oliver Hill, was decided in 1954 with Brown v. Board of Education, which rejected the segregationist doctrine of "separate but equal". But, in 1958, under the policy of "massive resistance" led by the influential segregationist Senator Harry F. Byrd and his Byrd Organization, the Commonwealth prohibited desegregated local schools from receiving state funding.[tpl]harvnb|Wallenstein|2007|pp=340–341[/tpl]
The Civil Rights Movement gained many participants in the 1960s. It achieved the moral force and support to gain passage of national legislation with the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. In 1964 the United States Supreme Court ordered Prince Edward County and others to integrate schools.[tpl]harvnb|Wallenstein|2007|pp=357[/tpl] In 1967, the Court also struck down the state's ban on interracial marriage with Loving v. Virginia. From 1969 to 1971, state legislators under Governor Mills Godwin rewrote the constitution, after goals such as the repeal of Jim Crow laws had been achieved. In 1989, Douglas Wilder became the first African American elected as governor in the United States.[tpl]harvnb|Heinemann|Kolp|Parent, Jr.|Shade|2007|pp=359–366[/tpl]
The Cold War led to the expansion of national defense government programs housed in offices in Northern Virginia near Washington, D.C., and correlative population growth.[tpl]harvnb|Accordino|2000|pp=76–78[/tpl] The Central Intelligence Agency in Langley was involved in various Cold War events, including as the target of Soviet espionage activities. Also among the federal developments was the Pentagon, built during World War II as the headquarters for the Department of Defense. It was one of the targets of the September 11 attacks; 189 people died at the site when a jet passenger plane crashed into the building.[tpl]cite news|last=Kelly|first=Christopher|url=http://www.dcmilitary.com/dcmilitary_archives/stories/112901/12279-1.shtml|title=Forensic feat IDs nearly all Pentagon victims|publisher=Stripe|date=November 29, 2001|accessdate=September 11, 2009[/tpl]

In November 2006, 15 conservative Episcopal churches voted to split from the Diocese of Virginia over the ordination of openly gay bishops and clergy in other dioceses of the Episcopal Church; these churches continue to claim affiliation with the larger Anglican Communion through other bodies outside the United States. Though Virginia law allows parishioners to determine their church's affiliation, the diocese claimed the secessionist churches' buildings and properties. The resulting property law case, ultimately decided in favor of the mainline diocese, was a test for Episcopal churches nationwide.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/supreme-court-wont-hear-appeal-of-dispute-over-episcopal-churchs-property-in-va/2014/03/10/8f22e72a-a886-11e3-8599-ce7295b6851c_story.html|title=Supreme Court won’t hear appeal of dispute over Episcopal Church’s property in Va.|first=Michelle|last=Boorstein|work=The Washington Post|date=March 10, 2014|accessdate=May 1, 2014[/tpl]

Since 1971, the government has functioned under the seventh Constitution of Virginia, which provides for a strong legislature and a unified judicial system. Similar to the federal structure, the government is divided in three branches: legislative, executive, and judicial. The legislature is the General Assembly, a bicameral body whose 100-member House of Delegates and 40-member Senate write the laws for the Commonwealth. The Assembly is stronger than the executive, as it selects judges and justices. The Governor and Lieutenant Governor are elected every four years in separate elections. Incumbent governors cannot run for re-election, however the Lieutenant Governor and Attorney General can, and governors may serve non-consecutive terms.[tpl]cite journal|title=Commentaries on the Constitution of Virginia by A.

==State symbols==

The state nickname is its oldest symbol, though it has never been made official by law. Virginia was given the title "Dominion" by King Charles II of England at the time of The Restoration, because it had remained loyal to the crown during the English Civil War, and the present moniker, "Old Dominion" is a reference to that title. The other nickname, "Mother of Presidents", is also historic, as eight Virginians have served as President of the United States, including four of the first five.
The state's motto, Sic Semper Tyrannis, translates from Latin as "Thus Always to Tyrants", and is used on the state seal, which is then used on the flag. While the seal was designed in 1776, and the flag was first used in the 1830s, both were made official in 1930.[tpl]cite web|url=http://legis.state.va.us/1_cap_class/class_media/4_5_pdfs/factpack-1.pdf|title=Factpack|publisher=Virginia General Assembly|date=January 11, 2007|accessdate=October 14, 2008|format=PDF[/tpl] The majority of the other symbols were made official in the late 20th century.[tpl]cite web|url=http://legis.state.va.us/1_cap_class/9-12/9_12_emb_symb.html|title=Capitol Classroom|publisher=Virginia General Assembly|date=December 13, 2007|accessdate=April 12, 2008[/tpl] The Virginia reel is among the square dances classified as the state dance.
