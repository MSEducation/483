Healesville is a railway station in Victoria, Australia. Formerly the terminus of the Healesville railway line, it is currently the principal station of the Yarra Valley Railway.
A temporary station was built on the site in 1888–1889 when the railway line was extended from Lilydale to Healesville.  The current station was built in 1903 and is now listed with Heritage Victoria.
The station closed along with the Healesville line in 1980. It sat idle for some years, but has now restored as part of the Yarra Valley Railway, which is based out of Healesville. It currently opens on weekends, school holidays, and public holidays.  Walker Railmotor services operate heading 4.5 km to near Tarra Warra Winery.  As of April 2010, works are currently underway to restore the line to Yarra Glen railway station.
