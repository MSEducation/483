This lake provides no public access, as it is completely surrounded by private land. A canal, not navigable, leads from the east side of Lake Idyl to nearby Lake Buckeye. Both the Hook and Bullet and the Take Me Fishing websites say Lake Idyl contains largemouth bass, bluegill and crappie.Take Me Fishing website, at "Lake Idyl, Winter Haven, Florida," http://www.takemefishing.org/fishing/map/ .hook and Bullet website, at http://www.hookandbullet.com/fishing-lake-idyl-winter-haven-fl/ .
