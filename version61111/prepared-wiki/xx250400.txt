The FN Model 30-11 is a Belgian sniper rifle, manufactured between 1976 and 1986.
Derived from the FN Model 30, based on the Mauser action dating to the G98, with three-piece bolt and a five-round magazine. The trigger and stock are both adjustable, the stock by means of butt spacers. The furniture is wood. The rifle features a flash hider, as well as a standard rear-folding bipod (same as the FN MAG). The standard sights are micrometer-adjustable iron, but the usual fitting is an Ansch√ºtz four-power [tpl]convert|28|mm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] telescope; a nightscope can be fitted, if desired. 
No longer manufactured by FN, the Model 30-11 remains in service with Belgian police and military, as well as military forces in several countries.
