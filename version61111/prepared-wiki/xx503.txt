 In addition, several cities such as Oakland, [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] and [[Davis, California|Davis]] have declared themselves as [[nuclear-free zone]]s.

===Transportation===

California's vast terrain is connected by an extensive system of controlled-access highways ('freeways'), limited-access roads ('expressways'), and highways. California is known for its car culture, giving California's cities a reputation for severe traffic congestion. Construction and maintenance of state roads and statewide transportation planning are primarily the responsibility of the California Department of Transportation, nicknamed "Caltrans". The rapidly growing population of the state is straining all of its transportation networks, and California has some of the worst roads in the United States.[tpl]cite web|last=Mieszkowski |first=Katharine |url=http://www.baycitizen.org/blogs/pulse-of-the-bay/read-while-you-are-waiting-traffic-clear |title=California Is Tops in Worst Roads – Pulse of the Bay |publisher=The Bay Citizen |date=September 2, 2010 |accessdate=April 22, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/node/9621456 | work=The Economist | title=A bridge too far gone | date=August 9, 2007[/tpl] The Reason Foundation's 19th Annual Report on the Performance of State Highway Systems ranked California's highways the third-worst of any state, with Alaska second, and Rhode Island first.http://reason.org/files/19th_annual_highway_report.pdf Furthermore, California had the most total deaths from vehicle crashes with litter, debris and other non-fixed objects, with at least 78 killed in a 12-month period, based upon a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration study.http://www.slideshare.net/stevewonder2/spacek-deadly-litter-crashes-2014
The state has been a pioneer in road construction. One of the state's more visible landmarks, the Golden Gate Bridge, was once the longest suspension bridge main span in the world at [tpl]convert|4200|ft|m[/tpl] when it opened in 1937. With its orange paint and panoramic views of the bay, this highway bridge is a popular tourist attraction and also accommodates pedestrians and bicyclists. The San Francisco – Oakland Bay Bridge (often abbreviated the "Bay Bridge"), completed in 1936, transports approximately 280,000 vehicles per day on two-decks. Its two sections meet at Yerba Buena Island through the world's largest diameter transportation bore tunnel, at [tpl]convert|76|ft[/tpl] wide by [tpl]convert|58|ft[/tpl] high.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/esc/tollbridge/SFOBB/Sfobbfacts.html | title=The San Francisco – Oakland Bay Bridge Facts at a glance | publisher=California Department of Transportation | accessdate =April 5, 2012[/tpl] The Arroyo Seco Parkway, connecting Los Angeles and Pasadena, opened in 1940 as the first freeway in the Western United States.[tpl]cite news |last= Pool |first= Bob |title= Pasadena Freeway getting a new look and a new name |work=Los Angeles Times |date=June 25, 2010 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jun/25/local/la-me-parkway-20100625 |accessdate=April 5, 2012[/tpl] It was later extended south to the Four Level Interchange in downtown Los Angeles, regarded as the first stack interchange ever built.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.kcet.org/updaily/socal_focus/history/la-as-subject/navigating-the-stack-the-four-level-turns-58.html | title=L.A.'s Famous Four-Level Freeway Interchange, 'The Stack,' Turns 58 | publisher=KCET | date=September 22, 2011 |accessdate=April 5, 2012[/tpl]
Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), the 6th busiest airport in the world, and San Francisco International Airport (SFO), the 21st busiest airport in the world, are major hubs for trans-Pacific and transcontinental traffic. There are about a dozen important commercial airports and many more general aviation airports throughout the state.
California also has several important seaports. The giant seaport complex formed by the Port of Los Angeles and the Port of Long Beach in Southern California is the largest in the country and responsible for handling about a fourth of all container cargo traffic in the United States. The Port of Oakland, fourth largest in the nation, also handles trade entering from the Pacific Rim to the rest of the country.
The California Highway Patrol is the largest statewide police agency in the United States in terms of employment with over 10,000 employees. They are responsible for providing any police-sanctioned service to anyone on California's state maintained highways and on state property.
The California Department of Motor Vehicles is by far the largest in North America. By the end of 2009, the California DMV had 26,555,006 driver's licenses and ID cards on file.http://dmv.ca.gov/about/profile/official.pdf In 2010, there were 1.17 million new vehicle registrations in force.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_17197542 |title=California new-car sales up 13.1 percent in 2010 |publisher=San Jose Mercury News |accessdate=April 22, 2011[/tpl]
Intercity rail travel is provided by Amtrak California, which manages the three busiest intercity rail lines in the U.S. outside the Northeast Corridor, all of which are funded by Caltrans. This service is becoming increasingly popular over flying and ridership is continuing to set records, especially on the LAX-SFO route.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/01/05/BAMU1GU16Q.DTL | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=Michael | last=Cabanatuan | title=Calif.

Light rail systems are also found in San Jose (VTA), San Diego (San Diego Trolley), Sacramento (RT Light Rail), and Northern San Diego County (Sprinter). Furthermore, commuter rail networks serve the San Francisco Bay Area (ACE, BART, Caltrain), Greater Los Angeles (Metrolink), and San Diego County (Coaster).
The California High-Speed Rail Authority was created in 1996 by the state to implement an extensive [tpl]convert|700|mi|km[/tpl] rail system. Construction was approved by the voters during the November 2008 general election, a $9.95 billion state bond will go toward its construction.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/11/08/BAV6140IK5.DTL | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=Michael | last=Cabanatuan | title=Plan for high-speed rail system released | date=August 17, 2010[/tpl] Nearly all counties operate bus lines, and many cities operate their own city bus lines as well. Intercity bus travel is provided by Greyhound and Amtrak Thruway Coach.

===Water===

California's interconnected water system is the world's largest, managing over 40,000,000 acre feet of water per year, centered on six main systems of aqueducts and infrastructure projects.Hundley, N. (2001). The great thirst: Californians and water. Berkeley, Calif.: University of California Press. Water use and conservation in California is a politically divisive issue, as state experiences periodic droughts and has to balance the demands of its large agricultural and urban sectors, especially in the arid southern portion of the state. The state's widespread redistribution of water also invites the frequent scorn of environmentalists.
The California Water Wars, a struggle between Los Angeles and the Owens Valley for water rights, is one of the most well-known examples of the lengths people will go to in order to secure adequate water supplies.[tpl]cite book|author=Reisner, Marc|title=Cadillac Desert: The American West and its Disappearing Water|publisher=Penguin|year=1993[/tpl] Former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said: "We've been in crisis for quite some time because we're now 38 million people and not anymore 18 million people like we were in the late 60s. So it developed into a battle between environmentalists and farmers and between the south and the north and between rural and urban. And everyone has been fighting for the last four decades about water.""Why California Is Running Dry". CBS News. December 27, 2009.

==Government and politics==

===Government===

thumb|The California State Capitol building in SacramentoThe state's capital is Sacramento.
California is organized into three branches of government – the executive branch consisting of the Governor and the other independently elected constitutional officers; the legislative branch consisting of the Assembly and Senate; and the judicial branch consisting of the Supreme Court of California and lower courts. The state also allows direct participation of the electorate by initiative, referendum, recall, and ratification. Prior to the passage of California Proposition 14 (2010), California allowed each political party to choose whether to have a closed primary or a primary where only party members and independents vote. After June 8, 2010 when Proposition 14 was approved, excepting only the U.S. President and county central committee offices,[tpl]cite web|last=Bowen|first=Debra|title=Voter-Nominated Offices Information|url=http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/statewide-elections/2012-primary/new-open-primary-info.pdf|publisher=California Secretary of State|accessdate=16 March 2014[/tpl] all candidates in the primary elections are listed on the ballot with their preferred party affiliation, but they are not the official nominee of that party.[tpl]cite web|last=Bowen|first=Debra|title=Voter-Nominated Offices Information|url=http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/voter-nominated-offices.htm|publisher=California Secretary of State|accessdate=16 March 2014[/tpl]  At the primary election, the two candidates with the top votes will advance to the general election regardless of party affiliation.   If at the primary, one candidate receives more than 50% of all the votes cast, no general election will be held, and they are declared the winner.
The Governor of California and the other state constitutional officers serve four-year terms and may be re-elected only once.[tpl]cite web|last=California Constitution|title=Article 5|url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/.const/.article_5[/tpl]
The California State Legislature consists of a 40-member Senate and 80-member Assembly. Senators serve four-year terms and Assembly members two. Members of the Assembly are subject to term limits of three terms, and members of the Senate are subject to term limits of two terms.

California's judiciary is the largest in the United States (with a total of 1,600 judges, while the federal system has only about 840). It is supervised by the seven Justices of the Supreme Court of California. Justices of the Supreme Court and Courts of Appeal are appointed by the Governor, but are subject to retention by the electorate every 12 years.

====Local government====

California is divided into 58 counties which are legal subdivisions of the state,Constitution of California, article 11, section 1 additionally there are 482 California cities,[tpl]cite web|title=Learn About Cities|publisher=League of California Cities|accessdate=13 March 2014|url=http://www.cacities.org/Resources/Learn-About-Cities[/tpl] about 3,400 special districts,[tpl]cite book|title=What’s So Special About Special Districts?

===Federal representation===

The State of California sends 53 members to the House of Representatives,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.house.gov/representatives/#state_ca|title=Directory of Representatives|publisher=House.gov|accessdate=25 Mar 2014[/tpl] the nation's largest congressional state delegation. Consequently California also has the largest number of electoral votes in national presidential elections, with 55.  California's U.S. Senators are Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer.

===Politics===

California has an idiosyncratic political culture compared to the rest of the country, and is sometimes regarded as a trendsetter.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/10/30/eveningnews/main2138297.shtml | title=California Is A Political Trendsetter | date=October 30, 2006 | accessdate=February 22, 2011 | work=CBS News[/tpl] In terms of socio-cultural mores and national politics, Californians are perceived as more liberal than other Americans, especially those who live in the inland states.
Among the political idiosyncrasies and trendsetting, California was the second state to recall their state governor, the second state to legalize abortion, and the only state to ban marriage for gay couples twice by voters (including Proposition 8 in 2008). Voters also passed Proposition 71 in 2004 to fund stem cell research, and Proposition 14 in 2010 to completely change the state's primary election process. California has also experienced disputes over water rights; and a tax revolt, culminating with the passage of Proposition 13 in 1978, limiting state property taxes.
The state's trend towards the Democratic Party and away from the Republican Party can be seen in state elections. From 1899 to 1939, California had Republican governors. Since 1990, California has generally elected Democratic candidates to federal, state and local offices, including current Governor Jerry Brown; however, the state has elected Republican Governors, though many of its Republican Governors, such as Arnold Schwarzenegger, tend to be considered moderate Republicans and more centrist than the national party.
The Democrats also now hold a majority in both houses of the state legislature. There are currently 56 Democrats and 24 Republicans in the Assembly; and 26 Democrats and 12 Republicans in the Senate.
The trend towards the Democratic Party is most obvious in presidential elections; Republicans have not won California's electoral votes since 1988. Additionally, both the state's current Democratic U.S. Senators, Dianne Feinstein, a native and former mayor of San Francisco, and Barbara Boxer, a former congresswoman from Marin County, have held onto their seats since they were first elected in 1992.
In the U.S. House, the Democrats held a 34–19 edge in the CA delegation of the 110th United States Congress in 2007. As the result of gerrymandering, the districts in California were usually dominated by one or the other party, and very few districts were considered competitive. In 2008, Californians passed Proposition 20 to empower a 14-member independent citizen commission to redraw districts for both local politicians and Congress. After the 2012 elections, when the new system took effect, Democrats gained 4 seats and held a 38-15 majority in the delegation.
In general, Democratic strength is centered in the populous coastal regions of the Los Angeles metropolitan area and the San Francisco Bay Area. Republican strength is still greatest in eastern parts of the state. Orange County also remains mostly Republican. One study ranked Berkeley, Oakland, Inglewood and San Francisco in the top 20 most liberal American cities; and Bakersfield, Orange, Escondido, Garden Grove, and Simi Valley in the top 20 most conservative cities.[tpl]cite web | url=http://govpro.com/content/gov_imp_31439/index.html | publisher=Bay Area Center for Voting Research | title=Study Ranks America's Most Liberal and Conservative Cities | date=August 16, 2005 | accessdate=February 20, 2011[/tpl]
In October 2012, out of the 23,802,577 people eligible to vote, 18,245,970 people were registered to vote.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/sov/2012-general/02-voter-reg-stats-by-county.pdf |title=Voter Registration by County |author= |date=October 22, 2012 |work=Elections |publisher=California Secretary of State |accessdate=January 12, 2013[/tpl] Of the people registered, the three largest registered groups were Democrats (7,966,422), Republicans (5,356,608), and Decline to State (3,820,545). Los Angeles County had the largest number of registered Democrats (2,430,612) and Republicans (1,037,031) of any county in the state.

====LGBT====

California is considered generally liberal in its policies regarding the LGBT community, and the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people have received greater recognition since 1960 at both the state and municipal level. California is home to a number of gay villages such as the Castro District in San Francisco, Hillcrest in San Diego, and West Hollywood. Through the Domestic Partnership Act of 1999, California became the first state in the United States to recognize same-sex relationships in any legal capacity. In 2000, voters passed Proposition 22, which restricted state recognition of marriage to opposite-sex couples. This was struck down by the California Supreme Court in May 2008, effectively legalizing same-sex marriage; however, this was overruled later that same year when California voters passed Proposition 8. After further judicial cases, in 2013 the U.S. Supreme Court rendered the law void, allowing same-sex marriages in California to resume.

==Cities, towns and counties==

The state's local government is divided into 58 counties and 482 incorporated cities and towns; of which 460 are cities and 22 are towns. Under California law, the terms "city" and "town" are explicitly interchangeable; the name of an incorporated municipality in the state can either be "City of (Name)" or "Town of (Name)".[ref]
