==Company history==

Beacon Roofing Supply was established in 1928 in Charlestown, Massachusetts, as Beacon Sales Company.  By 1953, the company had outgrown its building in Charlestown, and built a new facility in nearby Somerville. In the 1970s, the company expanded to Worcester, Massachusetts and Lewiston, Maine.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.beaconroofingsupply.com/about-us/default.html |title=About Beacon Roofing Supply - Residential Roofing & Commercial Roofing |publisher=Beaconroofingsupply.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16[/tpl]  In 1984, Andrew Logie bought a majority interest in the company.  At that time, sales were almost $17 million, virtually all in commercial roofing.  Shortly after Logie became CEO, David Grace joined Beacon as the company's Chief Financial Officer. During Logie's tenure, the company opened new branches throughout the United States, and expanded into residential roofing as well as commercial roofing. By 1997, seven branches were generating $72 million in annual sales[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.beaconroofingsupply.com/about-us/default.html |title=About Beacon Roofing Supply - Residential Roofing & Commercial Roofing |publisher=Beaconroofingsupply.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16[/tpl]
In 1997, the equity firm Code, Hennessy & Simmons III, L.P. purchased a majority interest in the company.  They re-branded it as and Beacon Roofing Supply, Inc. In 1998, Beacon, in an attempt to acquire successful distributors, purchased its first regional brand, Quality Roofing Supply, a Pennsylvania based roofing distributor. From 1999 - 2000, Beacon continued its purchase of regional roofing distributors by acquiring Best Distributing (North Carolina), Groupe Bedard and Exeltherm Supply (Canada), The Roof Center (Maryland and Virginia), and West End Lumber (Texas).
As Beacon integrated its major acquisitions into the company, Beacon had them to retain their name and original brand identities, to preserve the regional branding.  Additionally, while the newly acquired companies adopt Beacon's systems and management, they retain their control over local sales and marketing practices. 
By 2002, Beacon had surpassed $500 million in revenue.  Early in fiscal 2004, Robert R. Buck joined the company and succeed Andrew Logie as President and CEO.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/beacon-roofing-chair-logie-retiring-buck-named-new-chair |title=Beacon Roofing Chair Logie retiring; Buck named new chair |publisher=MarketWatch |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16[/tpl]  To obtain money to grow the company, Beacon went public with an initial public offereing on the NASDAQ stock exchange, on September 23rd, 2004.  In 2005, The Wall Street Journal ranked Beacon as the sixth fastest-growing new stock issue behind Google.
The company continued to acquire successful distributors across North America and drive organic growth in existing operations. Within three months of the IPO, Beacon acquired Atlanta-based JGA Corp., which had sales of $74 million. In October 2005, Beacon’s made its largest acquisition by purchasing Shelter Distribution, a mid-western distributor with sales of $313 million and 50 branches. Other additions in 2005 and 2006 included ISI, Commercial Supply, Easton Wholesale, Mississippi Roofing, Alabama Roofing, Southern California’s Pacific Supply, Minnesota’s Roof Depot, and RSM Supply in Arkansas, Missouri and Oklahoma.
Sales surpassed $850 million in fiscal 2005 and $1.5 billion in fiscal 2006. In April of 2007, Beacon acquired North Coast Commercial Roofing Systems based in Twinsburg, Ohio, which had sales in excess of $250 million. This strategic acquisition moved Beacon into three new states-Ohio, New York and West Virginia. At this point, operations now encompassed 172 branches in 37 states and 3 Canadian provinces.
In October of 2007, Beacon announced the appointment of Paul M. Isabella as President and Chief Operating Officer.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/beacon-roofing-supply-names-paul-isabella-president-coo |title=Beacon Roofing Supply names Paul Isabella president, COO |publisher=MarketWatch |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16[/tpl] 
In 2008, Beacon continued to grow with the addition of locations in Albuquerque, New Mexico and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Additionally, the company also opened a new branch location in Denver, Colorado.
Beacon made several additional acquisitions in fiscal 2010 that opened up new markets or filled in key existing areas. These acquisitions included two companies in Florida, Independent Building Materials based in Orlando and Phoenix Sales with four branches located in Tampa, Orlando, Pompano and Ft. Myers. In addition, the acquisitions of Lookout Supply, Louisiana Roofing Supply and Posi-Slope and Posi-Pentes increased Beacon’s market presence in Tennessee, Louisiana and Canada, respectively. At the end of 2010, Robert Buck relinquished the title of CEO to Paul Isabella while retaining the title of Chairman of the Board.

Just a few weeks later, the company announced the opening of their 200th location in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. That branch operates under the Best Distributing name.
On July 1, 2012, Beacon acquired Structural Materials Co., which has six locations in Southern California. The acquisition more than doubled the size of the company's market penetration in the Pacific region. That summer, the company also entered new markets in St. Louis, MO, where a new branch was opened under the Roof Depot name and a one-location distributor, Contractors Roofing and Supply Co., was acquired.
Shortly after fiscal 2013 began, the company acquired McClure-Johnston Co. Founded in 1914, McClure-Johnston has 14 locations throughout Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Maryland and Georgia. In another move into a new market, the company acquired two companies in Northern California: Ford Wholesale, based in San Jose, CA, with three branches and Construction Materials Supply with two branches.
On December 31, 2012, the company’s long-time Chief Financial Officer David Grace retired. In January 2013, the company appointed Joseph M.
