3568 ASCII is a small main belt asteroid discovered by Marguerite Laugier on October 17, 1936.
It was named (long after its discovery) in honor of the ASCII character encoding system that was used by most computers. The name was proposed by Syuichi Nakano, who re-discovered this asteroid during his stay at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory; a stay which was partially funded by articles he wrote for the principal Japanese microcomputer magazine, ASCII.Lutz Schmadel, Dictionary of Minor Planet Names, Springer
