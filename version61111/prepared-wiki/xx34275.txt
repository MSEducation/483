</ref>  However the effort paid off as the adaptation was met with good reviews (“A haunting film – and a deeply disturbing one”<ref>Ward, ''Out of the Unknown'', p. 172.</ref> - ''[[The Times]]'') and was awarded first prize at the Fifth ''Festival Internazionale del Film di Fantascienza'' (''International Science Fiction Film Festival'') in [[Trieste]] on 17 July 1967.<ref>Ward, ''Out of the Unknown'', p. 276.</ref>  “Level Seven” was adapted by [[J. B. Priestley]] and directed by [[Rudolph Cartier]]. Priestley’s script had begun life as a potential screenplay for a feature film and condensing it down to ''Out of the Unknown''’s standard running time of fifty minutes proved impossible. In the end, Shubik convinced the management of the BBC to allow “Level Seven” to run to sixty minutes as a one-off exceptional measure. Reviewing “Level Seven” in ''The Listener'', [[John Courtenay Trewin|J.C. Trewin]] said, “the tension was inescapable, the excitement incontestable, more so, undoubtedly, than other thrusts into the future”.<ref>Ward, ''Out of the Unknown'', p. 198.</ref>  The robot costumes created for “The Prophet” were later reused in the ''Doctor Who'' serial “[[The Mind Robber]]”.<ref>

Series two of Out of the Unknown had built on the success of the first series. However, as Irene Shubik and Michel Imison began work on the third series, major changes were implemented.

==Series three==

Shubik was in the middle of her third trip to New York in early 1967 when she received a call from Sydney Newman offering her the opportunity to co-produce, with Graeme McDonald, BBC1's most prestigious drama slot, The Wednesday Play. Shubik accepted the new post but insisted that she be given time to commission a full series of Out of the Unknown scripts before moving on to The Wednesday Play and handing Out of the Unknown over to a new production team. At the same time, Michael Imison also moved on to produce Thirty Minute Theatre. Shubik went on to become a noted television producer of series such as Play for Today, Playhouse and Rumpole of the Bailey and instigated, but did not produce, the acclaimed adaptation of The Jewel in the Crown.
For series three, Shubik commissioned dramatisations of stories by Robert Sheckley (Immortality, Inc.); Isaac Asimov (Liar! and The Naked Sun (the sequel to The Caves of Steel which Shubik had dramatised for Story Parade in 1963)); John Brunner (The Last Lonely Man); Clifford D. Simak (Beach Head and Target Generation); John Wyndham (Random Quest); Cyril M. Kornbluth (The Little Black Bag); Rog Phillips (The Yellow Pill) and Peter Phillips (Get Off My Cloud).  Original stories were provided by Donald Bull (“Something in the Cellar”), Brian Hayles (“1+1=1.5”) and Michael Ashe (“The Fosters”).  Two scripts, “The Yellow Pill” and “Target Generation”, had previously been used in Shubik's earlier anthology series Out of this World.
In September 1967, Alan Bromly and Roger Parkes were appointed as, respectively, the new producer and script editor. Bromly and Parkes both had a background in thriller series. With all the scripts already commissioned, Bromly and Parkes' role was mainly to shepherd them through production.
Series three – the first Out of the Unknown series to be made in colour – was broadcast on Wednesday nights beginning on 7 January 1969 with the episode, “Immortality, Inc.”. One viewer of “Immortality, Inc.” was Beatle George Harrison who can be seen discussing the episode with Ringo Starr in the film Let It Be.Ward, Out of the Unknown, p. 288. Scheduled opposite the very popular ITV drama series The Power Game, the series suffered in the ratings and met with mixed reviews; the Daily Express found the series “most erratic”, sometimes “wonderfully inventive” but at other times “as silly as a comic strip in a child's magazine”.Ward, Out of the Unknown, p. 353. The production of “Random Quest” led its author, John Wyndham, to write to director Christopher Barry praising “the hard work and ingenuity of a great number of people concerned ... excellent work by everybody – not forgetting the adapter. My thanks to everyone ... for weaving it all together so skillfully”.Ward, Out of the Unknown, p. 334. “Beach Head” was entered into the Sixth Festival Internazionale del Film di Fantascienza in July 1968, in the hope of repeating the earlier success of “The Machine Stops”, but did not win.

==Series four==

The fourth series of Out of the Unknown began production in early 1970. Bromly and Parkes were now free to put their own creative mark on the series. Encouraged by Head of Serials Gerald Savory, they sought to recast Out of the Unknown as “not straight science fiction, but with a strong horror content, all starting out from a realistic basis”.Ward, Out of the Unknown, p. 394. The decision to move towards psychological horror came about partly because of the difficulties involved in finding suitable science fiction scripts, partly because the production team felt that their budget couldn't compete with the glossy fare offered by the likes of 2001: A Space Odyssey and Star Trek, both of which had just reached British shores at this time, and partly because it was felt that science fiction could not compete with the real-life drama of the Apollo moon landings then happening.
Another major change for series four was a move away from adapting novels and short stories. Only one episode of series four – “Deathday” based on the novel by Angus Hall, dramatised by Brian Hayles – was an adaptation;the remaining ten episodes were original works.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl]
Series four was broadcast on Wednesday nights beginning 21 April 1971. The new series sported a new title sequence devised by Charles McGhie and a new theme tune - “Lunar Landscape” by Roger Roger. Both ratings[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl] and critical reception were positive, although some viewers were disappointed by the move away from hard science fiction – a typical comment was that of Martin J. Pitt who wrote to the Radio Times, “it will be a pity if the opinions of people like Alan Bromly rob television of the opportunity to present intelligent and exciting science fiction”.
Although the fourth series was judged to be a success, the BBC chose not to renew Out of the Unknown for a fifth series. With the exception of the Play for Today spin-off, Play for Tomorrow, no regular science fiction anthology series has been made by a UK broadcaster since Out of the Unknown went off the air.
