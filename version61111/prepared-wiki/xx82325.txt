[[Latin alphabets]]

CATEGORIES: Latin alphabets, Collation

A Latin or Roman alphabet is an alphabet that uses the letters of the Latin script, the basis of the original Roman Latin alphabet. Extension of the Latin script may be through adding diacritics to existing letters, fusing letters together into ligatures, adding new letters, or treating pairs or triplets of letters as units (digraphs and trigraphs). 
These added letters are often given a place in the alphabet by defining an alphabetical order or collation sequence, which can vary between languages. Some, especially those with diacritics, are not considered distinct letters for this purpose: French é and German ö, for example, are not used in the commonly quoted alphabet sequences. In some languages, digraphs are included in the collation sequence (eg Hungarian CS, Welsh RH).
The ISO basic Latin alphabet includes the 26 basic letters that are included in most alphabets. The International Phonetic Alphabet is also derived mainly from the Latin script. 
The tables below summarize and compare some of the alphabets. In this article, the scope of the word "alphabet" is broadened to include letters with tone marks and other diacritics used to represent a wide range of orthographic traditions found in modern and classical literature, without special regard as to whether the modified letters have their own traditional alphabetic place or are interfiled, or whether the letters are in the sequence in the table or elsewhere.

==Usage of the ISO basic Latin alphabet==

The Afrikaans, Basque,4 Breton, Catalan,6 Czech,8 Danish,9 Dutch,10 English,36 Estonian, Filipino,11 Finnish, French,12 German,13, Greenlandic, Hungarian,15 Interlingua, Karakalpak, Kurdish, Modern Latin, Malay, Norwegian,9 Pan-European, Portuguese, Romanian, Slovak,24 Spanish,25 Swedish, Võro, Walloon27, Xhosa, and Zulu alphabets include all 26 letters, at least in their largest version.
The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) includes all 26 letters in their lowercase forms, although g is always single-story (ɡ) in the IPA and never double-story (8px).
The chart above lists a variety of alphabets that do not officially contain all 26 letters of the ISO basic Latin alphabet. In this list, four letters are used by all of them: A, E, I, and N. For each of the 26 basic ISO Latin alphabet letters, the number of alphabets in the list above using it is as follows:
Note: The I is used in two distinct versions in Turkic languages, dotless (I ı) and dotted (İ i). They are considered different letters, and case conversion must take care to preserve the distinction. Note that Irish traditionally does not write the dot, or tittle, over the small letter i, but the language makes no distinction here if a dot is displayed, so no specific encoding and special case conversion rule is needed like for Turkic alphabets.

==[tpl]anchor|Extended Latin alphabet[/tpl]Additional letters used in Latin alphabets==

Some languages have extended the Latin alphabet with ligatures, modified letters, or digraphs. These symbols are listed below. The characters in the following tables may not all render, depending on which operating system and browser version are used, and the presence or absence of Unicode fonts.

Note: The tables below are a work in progress. Eventually, table cells with light blue shading will indicate letter forms which do not constitute distinct letters in their associated alphabets. Please help with this task if you have the required linguistic knowledge and technical editing skill.
For the order in which the characters are sorted in each alphabet, see Collating sequence.
