Captain Thomas Sydney Sharpe was a World War I flying ace credited with six aerial victories.http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/england/sharpe2.php Retrieved 19 February 2010.
Sharpe  joined the Royal Flying Corps and flew with 24 Squadron from May to July 1916. Subsequently, in 1918, he was appointed a flight commander in 73 Squadron. He destroyed a Fokker Dr.I triplane on 11 March 1918, flying Sopwith Camel No. B5627. He then used No. C1619 for the remainder of his victories; he destroyed an Albatros D.V and two LVG reconnaissance planes on 22 March, and destroyed a pair of D.Vs two days later. Three days later, on 27 March, he was wounded in action and shot down. The identity of his probable conqueror is debatable. It has been credited to Hans Kirschstein,[tpl]cite book |title= Above the Trenches: A Complete Record of the Fighter Aces and Units of the British Empire Air Forces 1915-1920 |page= 336 [/tpl] or to Manfred von Richthofen; Sharpe himself credited enemy antiaircraft fire.
