LGBT is an initialism that stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender. In use since the 1990s, the term is an adaptation of the initialism LGB, which itself started replacing the term gay when in reference to the LGBT community beginning in the mid-to-late 1980s,[ref]Acronyms, initialisms & abbreviations dictionary, Volume 1, Part 1uu

The initialism has become mainstream as a self-designation and has been adopted by the majority of sexuality and gender identity-based community centers and media in the United States and some other English-speaking countries.The 2008 Community Center Survey Report: Assessing the Capacity and Programs of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Community Centers August 29, 2008, Terry Stone, CenterLink (formerly The National Association of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Community Centers).Report link[tpl]dead link|date=October 2011[/tpl](2012 Report link)National Lesbian & Gay Journalists Association: Stylebook Supplement on LGBT Terminology, NLGJA 2008. Stylebook Supplement It is also used in some other countries in whose languages the initialism is meaningful, such as France.
The initialism LGBT is intended to emphasize a diversity of sexuality and gender identity-based cultures and is sometimes used to refer to anyone who is non-heterosexual or non-cisgender instead of exclusively to people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender.
To recognize this inclusion, a popular variant adds the letter Q for those who identify as queer and/or are questioning their sexual identity as LGBTQ, recorded since 1996.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rkUEAQAAIAAJ |title=The Santa Cruz County in-queery, Volume 9, Santa Cruz Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual & Transgendered Community Center, 1996 |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2008-11-01 |accessdate=2011-10-23[/tpl]
On the one hand, some intersex people who want to be included in LGBT groups suggest an extended initialism LGBTI (recorded since 1999William L. Maurice, Marjorie A. Bowman, Sexual medicine in primary care, Mosby Year Book, 1999, ISBN 978-0-8151-2797-0).

==History==

Before the sexual revolution of the 1960s, there was no common non-derogatory vocabulary for non-heterosexuality; the closest such term, "third gender", traces back to the 1860s but never gained wide acceptance in the United States.Kennedy, Hubert C. (1980) The "third sex" theory of Karl Heinrich Ulrichs, Journal of Homosexuality. 1980–1981 Fall–Winter; 6(1–2): pp. 103–1Hirschfeld, Magnus, 1904. Berlins Drittes Geschlecht ("Berlin's Third Sex")Ellis, Havelock and Symonds, J. A., 1897. Sexual Inversion.Carpenter, Edward, 1908. The Intermediate Sex: A Study of Some Transitional Types of Men and Women.Duc, Aimée, 1901. Sind es Frauen? Roman über das dritte Geschlecht ("Are These Women? Novel about the Third Sex")
The first widely used term, homosexual, was thought to carry negative connotations and tended to be replaced by homophile in the 1950s and 1960s,[tpl]cite book |last=Minton |first=Henry |title=Departing from Deviance |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2002 |isbn=0-226-53043-4 |url= http://books.google.com/?id=cCoADHpbzHsC&pg=PA238 |accessdate=2009-01-01[/tpl] and subsequently gay in the 1970s.[tpl]cite book |last=Ross |first=E. Wayne |title=The Social Studies Curriculum: Purposes, Problems, and Possibilities |publisher=SUNY Press |year=2006|isbn= 0-7914-6909-3 |url = http://books.google.com/books?id=4qFMqjxte9IC [/tpl] As lesbians forged more public identities, the phrase "gay and lesbian" became more common. The Daughters of Bilitis folded in 1970 over which direction to focus on: feminism or gay rights issues.Esterberg, Kristen (September, 1994). "From Accommodation to Liberation: A Social Movement Analysis of Lesbians in the Homophile Movement." Gender and Society, 8, (3) p. 424–443. As equality was a priority for lesbian feminists, disparity of roles between men and women or butch and femme were viewed as patriarchal. Lesbian feminists eschewed gender role play that had been pervasive in bars, as well as the perceived chauvinism of gay men; many lesbian feminists refused to work with gay men, or take up their causes.Faderman, Lillian (1991). Odd Girls and Twilight Lovers: A History of Lesbian Life in Twentieth Century America, Penguin Books. ISBN 0-14-017122-3, p. 210–211. Lesbians who held a more essentialist view that they had been born homosexual and used the descriptor "lesbian" to define sexual attraction, often considered the separatist, angry opinions of lesbian-feminists to be detrimental to the cause of gay rights.Faderman (1991), p. 217–218. This was soon followed by bisexual and transgender people also seeking recognition as legitimate categories within the larger community. After the initial euphoria of the Stonewall riots wore off, starting in the late 1970s and the early 1980s, there was a change in perception; some gays and lesbians became less accepting of bisexual or transgender people.[tpl]cite book |last=Alexander |first= Jonathan |first2=Karen |last2=Yescavage |title= Bisexuality and Transgenderism: InterSEXions of The Others |publisher=Haworth Press |year=2004|isbn= 1-56023-287-0 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2SOe4igsrbgC[/tpl] It was thought that transgender people were acting out stereotypes and bisexuals were simply gay men or lesbian women who were afraid to come out and be honest about their identity. Each community that is collectively included has struggled to develop its own identity including whether, and how, to align with other gender and sexuality-based communities at times excluding other subgroups; these conflicts continue to this day.
The initialism LGBT saw occasional use in the United States from about 1988.Research, policy and practice: Annual meeting, American Educational Research Association Verlag AERA, 1988.
Not until the 1990s did it become common to speak of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people with equal respect within the movement.
Although the LGBT community has seen much controversy regarding universal acceptance of different member groups (bisexual and transgender individuals, in particular, have sometimes been marginalized by the larger LGBT community), the term LGBT has been a positive symbol of inclusion.[ref]

==Variants==

Many variants exist including variations that merely change the order of the letters; LGBT or GLBT are the most common terms and the ones most frequently seen in current usage. Although identical in meaning, "LGBT" may have a more feminist connotation than "GLBT" as it places the "L" (for "lesbian") first. When not inclusive of transgender people it is sometimes shortened to LGB.[tpl]cite book | last=Bohan | first=Janis S. | title= Psychology and Sexual Orientation: Coming to Terms | publisher= Routledge | year=1996|isbn=0-415-91514-7| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=v5IzSjeq1S8C[/tpl] LGBT may also include additional "Q"s for "queer" or "questioning" (sometimes abbreviated with a question mark and sometimes used to mean anybody not literally L, G, B or T)  which can then look like e.g., "LGBTQ" or "LGBTQQ"".[tpl]cite book | last=Bloodsworth-Lugo | first=Mary K. | title=In-Between Bodies: Sexual Difference, Race, and Sexuality | publisher=SUNY Press | year=2007|isbn= 0-7914-7221-3 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=Ph74JKY_5dwC[/tpl][tpl]cite book | last=Alder | first=Christine | first2=Anne |last2=Worrall | title=Girls' Violence: Myths and Realities | publisher=SUNY Press | year=2004|isbn=0-7914-6110-6 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=O0ye93mW0eUC[/tpl][tpl]cite book | last=Cherland | first=Meredith Rogers | first2= Helen J. |last2=Harper | title=Advocacy Research in Literacy Education: Seeking Higher Ground | publisher=Routledge | year=2007|isbn= 0-8058-5056-2 |url = http://books.google.com/books?id=ct_5Cf1aH0kC[/tpl]

The order of the letters has not been standardized; in addition to the variations between the positions of the initial "L" or "G", the mentioned, less‐common letters, if used, may appear in almost any order.
