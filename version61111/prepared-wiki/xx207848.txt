88 Boadrum was a duo of free concerts following 2007's 77 Boadrum, hosted by Japanese noise rock band Boredoms. The concerts took place at the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles, California and the Williamsburg waterfront in Brooklyn, New York and featured a new 88-minute composition.
Each concert began at 8:08 PM local time and featured 88 drummers selected by Boredoms and Hisham Bharoocha, the concert's director. Boredoms themselves appeared in Los Angeles, with Gang Gang Dance conducting the Brooklyn concert.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/142255-nike-brings-boredoms-88boadrum-to-la-brooklyn | publisher = Pitchfork Media | date = 2008-07-16 | last = Thompson | first = Paul | accessdate = 2008-07-26 | title = Nike Brings Boredoms' 88Boadrum to L.A., Brooklyn| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080726103705/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/142255-nike-brings-boredoms-88boadrum-to-la-brooklyn| archivedate= 26 July 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
