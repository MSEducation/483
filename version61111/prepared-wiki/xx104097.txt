Christopher Michael Bate FRS (born 1943) is an Emeritus Professor of developmental biology at the Department of zoology and fellow at the Kings College, Cambridge.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kings.cam.ac.uk/research/fellows/michael-bate.html |title=Michael Bate, Fellow in Developmental Biology, King's College, Cambridge |publisher=Kings.cam.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-10-12[/tpl]http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://sbl.salk.edu/~riek/article7.pdf[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kings.cam.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/subjects/natural-sciences.html |title=Natural Sciences | King's College, Cambridge |publisher=Kings.cam.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-10-12[/tpl]
His research is concerned with the way in which the machinery underlying coordinated movement is assembled during embryonic development. On the one hand this involves an analysis of the way in which muscles are assembled, specified and patterned and on the other an investigation of the way in which motor circuits are generated and begin to function.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.zoo.cam.ac.uk/zoostaff/bate.htm |title=Zoology: Bate |publisher=Zoo.cam.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-10-12[/tpl]  
His group works with the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster and brings a combination of genetic, molecular and cellular techniques to bear on the issues of neuromuscular development. At the moment Mike Bate is working on the genetic basis of myoblast recruitment and fusion and on an electrophysiological and structural analysis of the way in which functional properties are acquired by embryonic neurons.
He is a noteworthy ski instructor.
