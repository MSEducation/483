==Political career==

Misick was first elected to the Legislative Council in 1991, when he became Minister of Tourism, Transportation and Communications.  He was re-elected in 1995. In March 2002 he was elected leader of the then opposition PNP thus succeeding Washington Misick. In the April 2003 general elections, Misick's party won 6 out of the possible 13 seats in the legislature. The successful petitioning and winning of by-elections held in two constituencies resulted in Misick being sworn in as Chief Minister of the Turks and Caicos Islands on 16 August 2003. On 7 January 2007, Misick called for general elections on 9 February.  The PNP won 13 of the 15 seats, making it one of the most lopsided election results in the Turks and Caicos Islands.
