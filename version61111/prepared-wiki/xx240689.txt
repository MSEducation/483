Key to the Moon (1981-1988) was a Canadian Thoroughbred Champion racehorse.

==Background==

Bred and raced by Bahnam K. Yousif, he was sired by Wajima, the 1975 American Champion Three-Year-Old Male Horse. Key to the Moon's dam was Kamar, winner of the 1979 Canadian Oaks and a daughter of Key to the Mint, the 1972 American Champion Three-Year-Old Male Horse.
Conditioned for racing by future Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame trainer, Gil Rowntree, at age two Key to the Moon won the 1983 Display Stakes at his home base, Woodbine Racetrack in Toronto, Ontario. The colt helped Bahnam K. Yousif earn the 1983 Sovereign Award for Outstanding Owner. http://www.woodbineentertainment.com/thoroughbred/thoro-guide/2007/06ThoroughbredSeason.pdf

==Racing career==

Key to the Moon raced in the United States and Canada in 1984, winning the Discovery Handicap at Aqueduct Racetrack and at Woodbine Racetrack, the Marine Stakes and Canada's most prestigious race, the Queen's Plate.
In 1985, Key to the Moon again raced in the United States and Canada, notably winning the 1985 Gulfstream Park Sprint Championship and finishing second in the Grade 1 Gulfstream Park Handicap to Dr. Carter. However, after breaking a coffin bone in his left front foot while competing in the March 10th Seminole Stakes at Hialeah Park Race Track, he was out of racing for six months. In 1986 Key to the Moon won the Durham Cup and Dominion Day Handicaps at Woodbine.

==Stud career==

Retired to stud at Gardiner Farms in Caledon East, Ontario, Key to the Moon stood for just two years before his untimely death on August 3, 1988. The promising seven-year-old stallion was galloping in his paddock when he shattered the cannon bone of his right foreleg. He was taken to the veterinary hospital at the University of Guelph but could not be saved and was humanely euthanized. http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/474017981.html?dids=474017981:474017981&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Aug+04%2C+1988&author=Tom+Slater+Toronto+Star&pub=Toronto+Star&desc=Former+Plate+winner+Key+To+The+Moon+killed+after+accident&pqatl=google
