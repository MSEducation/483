==Ribnjak Park==

The Ribnjak Park is situated on the west side of Ribnjak Street at [tpl]coord|45.817|N|15.980|E|type:landmark|name=Ribnjak Park[/tpl]. Located five minutes of walk away from Ban Jelačić Square, the park comprises the western part of the neighborhood. It is also the location of Youth Center Ribnjak and the Purgeraj club.
The park had been a part of the city fortification since the 15th century, but it was projected in its current form and built in 1830 by Zagreb bishop Aleksandar Alagović and architect Leopold Klingspogle. The park was named after the fishponds in the area ([tpl]lang-hr|ribnjak, pl. ribnjaci[/tpl]). However, since late 19th century, parts of the park have been slowly chipped away to make way for new buildings and infrastructure, such as the widening of Ribnjak Street. From 14th century on, the size of ponds had continuously been artificially decreased, until the last pond (in the southern end) was filled and paved over to make way for Josip Lang Square in 1870. Until 1946 the park had been private property of the Zagreb archdiocese. After the World War II it was expanded and opened for public, becoming a prime location in the heart of Zagreb.
Although a beautiful tourist attraction during the day, after dusk the park turns into a youth site for binge drinking and gang violence. After a murder of member of a violent football fan faction committed in April 2008, and an announced bloody retaliation by the murdered fan's gang, the City of Zagreb announced it will hire wardens to patrol the park 24 hours a day.
The Ribnjak Park is also site of the yearly festival Park-in-Zagreb. In 2008, the festival lasted two weeks and hosted many well-known Croatian bands such as The Beat Fleet and Psihomodo Pop.
