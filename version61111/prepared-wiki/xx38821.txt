</ref> The strongest association with FP is with habitat type, especially increased anthropogenic activity causing high nitrogen-footprints in a surrounding environment where green sea turtles reside.<ref name="Lyngbyamajuscula"></ref><ref name="ImmuneStatus"></ref><ref name="Macroalgae"></ref> Sea turtles do live in very complex ecosystem, with both near shore habitats and several years in the open ocean and that makes it very difficult to study ecosystem associations.<ref name="ImmuneStatus"></ref> Even so, observations support the hypothesis that near-shore habitats have a strong correlation with the disease, as newly recruited individuals from the pelagic life phase have never been found with tumours,<ref name="Lyngbyamajuscula"></ref> and when migrating to more shallow ocean zones, such as the [[neritic zone]], individuals still remain free from FP, but when entering lagoon systems turtles may become infected.<ref name="Macroalgae"></ref> The high prevalence of FP is also associated with habitatsâ€™ poor quality, while FP is absent in some habitats of good quality.<ref name="Macroalgae"></ref>
Turtles are known to be robust to physical damage, but are surprisingly very susceptible to biological and chemical contaminants caused by anthropogenic activity. As the turtles forage on invasive macroalgae in nutrient rich waters, they can ingest environmental nitrogen in the form of arginine, which is known to regulate immune activity, promote herpesviruses and contribute to tumorigenesis.
