Modern commercially manufactured cigarettes are seemingly simple objects consisting mainly of a tobacco blend, paper, PVA glue to bond the outer layer of paper together, and often also a cellulose acetate–based filter.Clean Virginia Waterways, Cigarette Butt Litter - Cigarette Filters, Longwood University. Retrieved October 31, 2006.  While the assembly of cigarettes is straightforward, much focus is given to the creation of each of the components, in particular the tobacco blend. A key ingredient that makes cigarettes more addictive is the inclusion of reconstituted tobacco, which has additives to make nicotine more volatile as the cigarette burns.

===Paper===

The paper for holding the tobacco blend may vary in porosity to allow ventilation of the burning ember or contain materials that control the burning rate of the cigarette and stability of the produced ash. The papers used in tipping the cigarette (forming the mouthpiece) and surrounding the filter stabilize the mouthpiece from saliva and moderate the burning of the cigarette as well as the delivery of smoke with the presence of one or two rows of small laser-drilled air holes.JTI, [tpl]cite web |title=Composite List of Ingredients in Non-Tobacco Materials |url=http://www.jti.com/english/corp_responsibility/ingredients/ingredients_links/comp_tab_nonmat.aspx[/tpl] www.jti.com.

===Tobacco blend===

The process of blending gives the end product a consistent taste from batches of tobacco grown in different areas of a country that may change in flavor profile from year to year due to different environmental conditions.David E. Merrill, (1994), "How cigarettes are made". Video presentation at Philip Morris USA, Richmond offices. Retrieved October 31, 2006.
Modern cigarettes produced after the 1950s, although composed mainly of shredded tobacco leaf, use a significant quantity of tobacco processing by-products in the blend. Each cigarette's tobacco blend is made mainly from the leaves of flue-cured brightleaf, burley tobacco, and oriental tobacco. These leaves are selected, processed, and aged prior to blending and filling. The processing of brightleaf and burley tobaccos for tobacco leaf "strips" produces several by-products such as leaf stems, tobacco dust, and tobacco leaf pieces ("small laminate"). To improve the economics of producing cigarettes, these by-products are processed separately into forms where they can then be possibly added back into the cigarette blend without an apparent or marked change in the cigarette's quality. The most common tobacco by-products include:
In recent years, the manufacturers' pursuit of maximum profits has led to the practice of using not just the leaves, but also recycled tobacco offal and the plant stem.David Pemberton, [tpl]cite web | title= Spies, Smoking & Radiation Sickness | url=http://www.ecigator.net/blog/spies-smoking-radiation-sickness[/tpl] The stem is first crushed and cut to resemble the leaf before being merged or blended into the cut leaf.STS[tpl]Dead link|date=November 2009[/tpl]
According to data from the World Health Organization,[tpl]cite web | title=13 Manufacturing Tobacco | url=http://www.who.int/tobacco/statistics/tobacco_atlas/en/[/tpl]. Retrieved May 11, 2011. the amount of tobacco per 1000 cigarettes fell from 2.28 pounds in 1960 to 0.91 pounds in 1999, largely as a result of reconstituting tobacco, fluffing and additives.
A recipe-specified combination of brightleaf, burley-leaf and oriental-leaf tobacco will be mixed with various additives to improve its flavours.

===Additives===

Various additives are combined into the shredded tobacco product mixtures, with humectants such as propylene glycol or glycerol, as well as flavouring products and enhancers such as cocoa solids, licorice, tobacco extracts, and various sugars, which are known collectively as "casings". The leaf tobacco will then be shredded, along with a specified amount of small laminate, expanded tobacco, BL, RL, ES and IS. A perfume-like flavour/fragrance, called the "topping" or "toppings", which is most often formulated by flavor companies, will then be blended into the tobacco mixture to improve the consistency in flavour and taste of the cigarettes associated with a certain brand name. Additionally, they replace lost flavours due to the repeated wetting and drying used in processing the tobacco. Finally the tobacco mixture will be filled into cigarettes tubes and packaged.
A list of 599 cigarette additives, created by five major American cigarette companies, was approved by the Department of Health and Human Services in April 1994.  None of these additives is listed as an ingredient on the cigarette pack(s). Chemicals are added for organoleptic purposes and many boost the addictive properties of cigarettes, especially when burned.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]
One of the chemicals on the list, ammonia, helps convert bound nicotine molecules in tobacco smoke into free nicotine molecules. This process is known as freebasing which enhances the effect of the nicotine on the smoker.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]

===Cigarette butt===

The common name for the remains of a cigarette after smoking is a cigarette butt.  The butt typically comprises about 30 percent of the cigarette's original length.  It consists of a tissue tube which holds a filter and some remains of tobacco mixed with ash. Cigarette butts are the most numerically frequent litter in the world.[tpl]cite journal |last1= Warne |first1= M.

Cigarette filters are made from cellulose acetate and are biodegradable,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bat.com/group/sites/UK__3MNFEN.nsf/vwPagesWebLive/4572237B0C2D456CC1257314004EF667 |title=British American Tobacco - Cigarettes |publisher=Bat.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-25[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=March 2012[/tpl] but depending on environmental conditions they can be resistant to degradation. Accordingly, the duration of the degradation process is cited as taking as little as one month to three years to as long as 10 to 15 years. One campaign group has suggested they are never fully biodegraded.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cigarettelitter.org/index.asp?PageName=Smokers |title=The Facts About Cigarette Butts and Litter - Smokers |publisher=CigaretteLitter.Org |date=2012-03-16 |accessdate=2012-03-25[/tpl]

In the 2006 International Coastal Cleanup, cigarettes and cigarette butts constituted 24.7 percent of the total collected pieces of garbage, over twice as many as any other category.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oceanconservancy.org/site/DocServer/Final_ICC_report_2007_release.pdf?docID=2841 |title=International Coastal Cleanup 2006 Report, page 8 |date= |accessdate=2009-11-13[/tpl]
Cigarette butts contain the chemicals filtered from cigarettes and can leach into waterways and water supplies.[tpl]cite web | title=CigaretteLitter.org| url=http://www.cigarettelitter.org| accessdate=2007-05-28[/tpl] The toxicity of used cigarette butts depends on the brand design because cigarette companies incorporate varying degrees of chemicals in their tobacco blends.  After a cigarette is smoked, the butt is capable of retaining some of the chemicals, and parts of them are carcinogenic. The results of one study indicate that the chemicals released into freshwater environments from cigarette butts are lethal to daphnia at concentrations of 0.125 cigarette butts per litre (or one cigarette butt per 8 litres of water).

Many governments have sanctioned stiff penalties for littering of cigarette butts; the U.S. state of Washington imposes a penalty of $1,025.
There are several options that may help reduce the environmental impact that cigarette butts cause. This includes developing biodegradable filters, increasing fines and penalties for littering butts, using cigarette packs with a compartment to discard cigarette butts in, implementing monetary deposits on filters, increasing the availability of butt receptacles, and expanding public education. It may even be possible to ban the sale of filtered cigarettes altogether on the basis of their adverse environmental impact.[tpl]Cite journal|url=http://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/6/5/1691/html |title=Cigarette Butts and the Case for an Environmental Policy on Hazardous Cigarette Waste |accessdate=2009-09-21[/tpl]

===Cigarette tube===

Cigarette tubes are pre-rolled cigarette paper usually with an acetate or paper filter at the end. They have an appearance similar to a finished cigarette but are without any tobacco or smoking material inside. The length varies from what is known as King Size (84mm) to 100's (100mm).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wikihow.com/Roll-Your-Own-Filter-Cigarettes|title=How to Roll Your Own Filter Cigarettes: 6 Steps (with Pictures)|publisher=wikihow.com|accessdate=2014-02-14[/tpl]
Filling a cigarette tube is usually done with a cigarette injector (also known as a shooter). Cone shaped cigarette tubes are known as cones and can be filled using a packing stick or straw because of their cone shape. Cone smoking is popular because as the cigarette burns it tends to get stronger and stronger. A cone allows more tobacco to be burned at the beginning than the end, allowing for an even flavor [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ryomagazine.com/july/filters.htm|title=Zig-Zag Filtered Cigarette Tubes, RYO Magazine, The Magazine of Roll Your Own Cigarettes, Reviews, the Premier filter tube, filtered cigarettes|publisher=ryomagazine.com|accessdate=2014-02-14[/tpl]

==Consumption==

As of 2002, approximately 5.5 trillion cigarettes are produced globally each year and are smoked by over 1.1 billion people or greater than one-seventh of the world population. While smoking rates have levelled off or declined in developed nations, they continue to rise in developing parts of the world. Smoking rates in the United States have dropped by half from 1965 to 2006 falling from 42% to 20.8% of adults. In the developing world, tobacco consumption is rising by 3.4% per year.

==Lights==

Cigarettes labeled as “Lights,” “Milds,” or “Low-tar,” are considered to have a “lighter,” less pronounced flavor than regular cigarettes.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2012[/tpl]  These cigarette brands may also contain lower levels of tar, nicotine, or other chemicals inhaled by the smoker.[tpl]cite web|url=http://pw1.netcom.com/~rdavis2/cigra.html|accessdate=5 October 2011|title=NICOTINE, TAR, AND CO CONTENT OF DOMESTIC CIGARETTES[/tpl]
The filter design is one of the main differences between light and regular cigarettes, although not all cigarettes contain perforated holes in the filter anymore.  In some light cigarettes, the filter is perforated with small holes that theoretically diffuse the tobacco smoke with clean air.  In regular cigarettes, the filter does not include these perforations.  In ultra-light cigarettes, the filter’s perforations are larger, and in theory, these larger holes produce an even smaller smoke to air ratio.
The majority of major cigarette manufacturers offer a light, low-tar, and/or mild cigarette brand.  Due to recent U.S. legislation prohibiting the use of these descriptors, tobacco manufacturers are turning to color-coding to allow consumers to differentiate between regular and light brands.Koch 2009
The scientific evidence is that switching from regular to light or low-tar cigarettes does not reduce the health risks of smoking or lower the smoker’s exposure to the nicotine, tar, and carcinogens present in cigarette smoke.U.S. National 2004Benowitz 2005, p. 1NCI’s Smoking 2007, p.7

==Notable cigarette brands==

==Electronic Cigarettes==

Electronic cigarettes (commonly called eCigarettes and eCigs) are nicotine delivery devices which, may or may not, resemble cigarettes, and produce vapour rather than smoke.  These devices are illegal in some countries, such as Singapore and Malaysia.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.thesundaily.my/news/593156 | title=E-cigarette usage may lead to various chronic diseases | publisher=theSundaily | accessdate=January 21, 2013 -BROKEN LINK![/tpl] In other countries, these devices are regulated as medical devices and require government approval before they may be marketed and sold.

==Health Effects==

===Smokers===

Nicotine, the primary psychoactive chemical in cigarettes, is addictive.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/GettingHealthy/QuitSmoking/QuittingSmoking/Why-is-it-so-hard-to-quit_UCM_324053_Article.jsp |title=Why is it so hard to quit? |publisher=Heart.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-25[/tpl]  The resulting use of tobacco is the single greatest cause of preventable death globally.[tpl]cite book | author = World Health Organization | title = WHO Report on the Global Tobacco Epidemic 2008: The MPOWER Package | edition = | language = | publisher = World Health Organization | location = Geneva | year = 2008 | pages = | isbn = 92-4-159628-7 | url = http://www.who.int/tobacco/mpower/mpower_report_full_2008.pdf [/tpl][tpl]Page needed|date=November 2010[/tpl] Smoking leads most commonly to diseases affecting the heart, liver and lungs, being a major risk factor for heart attacks, strokes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (including emphysema and chronic bronchitis), and cancer (particularly lung cancer, cancers of the larynx and mouth, and pancreatic cancer). It also causes peripheral vascular disease and hypertension. On average, each cigarette that is smoked is estimated to shorten life by 11 minutes.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/583722.stm |title=HEALTH | Cigarettes 'cut life by 11 minutes' |publisher=BBC News |date=1999-12-31 |accessdate=2012-03-25[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/320/7226/53.1.full |title=Time for a smoke? One cigarette reduces your life by 11 minutes |publisher=BMJ |date= |accessdate=2012-03-25[/tpl] Starting smoking earlier in life and smoking cigarettes higher in tar increases the risk of these diseases.

There are, however, some potential health benefits to smoking: According to a review of epidemiological studies "...cigarette smokers are 50% less likely to have PDdisease or ADdisease than are age- and gender-matched nonsmokers."[tpl]cite pmid|10942038[/tpl]
"Ulcerative colitis is a condition of nonsmokers in which nicotine is of therapeutic benefit."[tpl]cite pmid|11069313[/tpl] A recent review of the available scientific literature concluded that the apparent decrease in Alzheimer risk may be simply because smokers tend to die before reaching the age at which Alzheimer normally occurs. "Differential mortality is always likely to be a problem where there is a need to investigate the effects of smoking in a disorder with very low incidence rates before age 75 years, which is the case of Alzheimer's disease," it stated, noting that smokers are only half as likely as non-smokers to survive to the age of 80.[tpl]Cite doi|10.1046/j.1360-0443.2002.00016.x[/tpl]

===Second-hand smoke===

Second-hand smoke is a mixture of smoke from the burning end of a cigarette, and the smoke exhaled from the lungs of smokers. It is involuntarily inhaled, lingers in the air hours after cigarettes have been extinguished, and can cause a wide range of adverse health effects, including cancer, respiratory infections and asthma.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.lungusa.org/site/pp.asp?c=dvLUK9O0E&b=35422#one | title = Secondhand Smoke | author = | authorlink = | coauthors = |date=June 2007 | work = | publisher = American Lung Association | accessdate = 2012-05-06 [/tpl] Non-smokers who are exposed to second-hand smoke at home or work increase their heart disease risk by 25–30% and their lung cancer risk by 20–30%. Second-hand smoke has been estimated to cause 38,000 deaths per year, of which 3,400 are deaths from lung cancer in non-smokers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tobaccofreefloridanewsroom.com/?cat=6 |title="Tobacco-Free Florida", Centers for Disease Control & Prevention Fact Sheets |publisher=Tobaccofreefloridanewsroom.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-02[/tpl] Sudden infant death syndrome, ear infections, respiratory infections, and asthma attacks can occur in children that are exposed to second-hand smoke.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cancer.org/Cancer/CancerCauses/TobaccoCancer/secondhand-smoke |title=Secondhand Smoke |publisher=Cancer.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-25[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Tobacco/ETS |title=Secondhand Smoke and Cancer - National Cancer Institute |publisher=Cancer.gov |date=2005-08-18 |accessdate=2012-03-25[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/secondhand_smoke/general_facts/index.htm |title=CDC - Fact Sheet - Secondhand Smoke Facts - Smoking & Tobacco Use |publisher=Cdc.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-03-25[/tpl]  Scientific evidence shows that there is no safe level of exposure to second-hand smoke.

==Smoking cessation==

Smoking cessation (colloquially quitting smoking) is the process of discontinuing the practice of inhaling a smoked substance.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.cancer.org/docroot/ped/content/ped_10_13x_guide_for_quitting_smoking.asp| title=Guide to quitting smoking| publisher=American Cancer Society| date=2011-01-31| accessdate=2011-02-15[/tpl]

Although stopping smoking can cause short-term side effects such as reversible weight gain, smoking cessation services and activities are cost-effective because of the positive health benefits.
