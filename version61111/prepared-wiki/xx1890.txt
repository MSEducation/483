CATEGORIES: Chinese classic texts, Confucian texts, Chinese philosophy

Chinese classic texts, or Chinese canonical texts, ([tpl]zh|c=中國古典典籍|p= Zhongguo gudian diǎnjí[/tpl]) today often refer to the Chinese texts which originated before the imperial unification by the Qin Dynasty in 221 BCE, especially the Neo-Confucian titles of Four Books and Five Classics (四書五經), a selection of short books and chapters from the voluminous collection called the Thirteen Classics. All of these pre-Qin texts were written in classical Chinese. As canons they are collectively referred to as jing (經).[tpl]cite book|title=Anthology of World Scriptures|author=Voorst, Robert E.

More broadly speaking, Chinese classic texts may refer to texts written either in vernacular Chinese or in the classical Chinese that was current until the fall of the last imperial dynasty, the Qing, in 1912. These can include shi (史, historical works), zi (子, philosophical works belonging to schools of thought other than the Confucian, but also works of agriculture, medicine, mathematics, astronomy, divination, art criticism, and all sorts of miscellaneous writings) and ji (集, literary works) as well as jing.
In the Ming and Qing dynasties, the Four Books and Five Classics were the subject of mandatory study by those Confucian scholars who wished to take the imperial exams to become government officials. Any political discussion was full of references to this background, and one could not be one of the literati, or even a military officer, without having memorized them. Generally, children first memorized the Chinese characters  of the Three Character Classic and Hundred Family Surnames, and then went on to memorize the other classics. The literate elite therefore shared a common culture and set of values.
Scholarship on these texts naturally divides itself into two periods, before and after the "Burning of the Books" in the Qin dynasty, when many of the original texts, especially those of Confucianism, were burned in a political purge.
