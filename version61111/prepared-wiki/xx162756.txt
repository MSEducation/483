==About the album==

After the success of Leehom Wang's last Mandarin album, The One and Only, Wang decided to head toward a different road of music. Although keeping his usual R&B grove, Wang decided to move away from his previous rock image and focus on hip-hop. Wang's new style was quickly accepted by his fans and gained much more new fans. Copies of the album sold past 1,300,000 in Asia, defeating his last successful album, The One and Only by quite a feat.
Wang's first world tour was also called, Unbelievable. However the tour began one year before the release of this album. During the world tours, Wang had hinted that he was approaching to a new style of music in his new album by incorporating hip-hop beats in some of his rock songs.
Under this album, Wang won Best Producer of the Year at the 15th Golden Melody Awards in 2004. This was the second time he was granted the honor, the first being at the 10th Golden Melody Awards in 1999, under his 1998 breakthrough album, Revolution (公轉自轉).
