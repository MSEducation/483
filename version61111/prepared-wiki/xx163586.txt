The 2007–08 KFC Twenty20 Big Bash was the 3rd season of the official Twenty20 domestic cricket in Australia. Six teams representing six states in Australia  participated in the competition. The competition began on 31 December 2007 when the Queensland Bulls took on two-time champions the Victorian Bushrangers at the new Tony Ireland Stadium in Thuringowa.  Another match between the Western Warriors and last year's finalists the Tasmanian Tigers was held on the same day at the WACA Ground.
This season comprised 15 regular matches, instead of twelve from the 2006–07 season.  This allowed each team to play every other team once.
