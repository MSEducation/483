[tpl]nihongo|Cowboy Bebop|カウボーイビバップ|Kaubōi Bibappu[/tpl] is a 1998 Japanese anime series developed by Sunrise. It featured a production team led by director Shinichirō Watanabe, screenwriter Keiko Nobumoto, character designer Toshihiro Kawamoto, mechanical designer Kimitoshi Yamane, and composer Yoko Kanno. The twenty-six episodes (sessions) of the series are set in the year 2071. It follows the adventures, misadventures and tragedies of a bounty hunter crew travelling on the Bebop, their starship. Cowboy Bebop explores philosophical concepts including existentialism, existential ennui, loneliness, and the past's influence.[tpl]cite web|title=STAFF PICKS: OLD SCHOOL CARTOONS|first=Mary|publisher=The Vault Magazine|url=http://www.thevaultmag.com/archives/1173|accessdate=May 12, 2012[/tpl]
The series premiered in Japan on TV Tokyo's 18:00 timeslot originally occupied by Kodomo no Omocha, from April 3 until June 26, 1998, broadcasting only twelve episodes and a special due to its controversial adult-themed content. The entire twenty-six episodes of the series were later broadcast on WOWOW from October 24 until April 24, 1999. The anime was adapted into two manga series which were serialized in Kadokawa Shoten's Asuka Fantasy DX. A film was later released to theaters worldwide.
The anime series was dubbed in the English language by Animaze and ZRO Limit Productions, and was licensed by Bandai Entertainment in North America and is now licensed by Funimation. For English releases in the United Kingdom, it was licensed by Beez Entertainment and is now licensed by Anime Limited. Madman Entertainment has licensed it for releases in Australia and New Zealand. In 2001, Cowboy Bebop became the first anime title to be broadcast on Adult Swim in the United States.
Cowboy Bebop became a critical and commercial success both in Japanese and international markets, most notably in the United States. The series garnered several major anime and science fiction awards from Japanese publications, and received universal praise for its style, characters, story, voice acting, animation and soundtrack. In the years since its release, critics and reviewers, from the United States in particular, have hailed Cowboy Bebop as a masterpiece and frequently cite it as one of the greatest anime series of all time. Credited with helping introduce anime to a new wave of Western viewers in the early 2000s, Cowboy Bebop has also been labelled a gateway series for the medium as a whole.

==Synopsis==

===Setting===

Cowboy Bebop is set in the year 2071, when humanity has colonized the entire Solar System through the use of "Phase Difference Space Gates", which allow for swift travel in space.[tpl]cite web|last=Patten |first=Fred |title='Cowboy Bebop: The Movie'… At Last |page=2 |url=http://www.awn.com/articles/anime/icowboy-bebop-moviei-last/page/2%2C1 |publisher=Animation World Network |date=March 31, 2003 |accessdate=April 19, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216051449/http://www.awn.com/articles/anime/icowboy-bebop-moviei-last/page/2%2C1 |archivedate= December 16, 2013 [/tpl][tpl]cite web|last= |first= |title=Cowboy Bebop - Original Sessions - Background |url=http://cowboybebop.org/english/session/world/index.html |publisher=CowboyBebop.Org |date= |accessdate=April 25, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030107060711/http://cowboybebop.org/english/session/world/index.html |archivedate= January 7, 2003 [/tpl] These Gates made it possible to deliver vast amounts of materials and energy, including sunlight, to distant planets, consequently making it immensely easier to make these worlds suitable for human habitation (known as terraforming).
In 2022, a catastrophic accident occurred in the Earth's orbit during the development of the Gates, damaging both the planet and the Moon. The Earth's surfaces became heavily irradiated, forcing most of mankind to evacuate via the Gates and leave for the planets and moons of the Solar System. Old governments and ethnic groups were forgotten, and were soon replaced by new allegiances and affiliations as new communities formed. The difficult times eventually brought rapid developments and the economy recovered. However, the widening gap between the rich and poor created a boom in criminal activity, leading to the rise of numerous criminal syndicates. As time passed, the planets and satellites became independent states, and a new generation grew up with no memories of the Earth. Gate technology became a trusted part of everyday life, and a necessary tool for the people. Interplanetary crime fell under the jurisdiction of the Inter Solar System Police (ISSP), an organisation which also introduced a bounty reward scheme. Once registered, bounty hunters were licensed to bring criminals to justice in exchange for high rewards. This created a new class of bounty hunters, also known as "cowboys".

===Plot===

The story begins with the introduction of protagonist Spike Spiegel, an exiled former hitman of the criminal Red Dragon Syndicate, and his partner Jet Black, a former ISSP officer who retired following a mob hit that cost him his arm, as two bounty hunters who travel on Jet's starship the Bebop. Through unintended circumstances, the duo are eventually joined by three new members: Ein, a hyper-intelligent genetically-engineered Welsh Corgi dog, Faye Valentine, an amnesiac femme fatale con artist, and Edward, a barefooted preteen female prolific computer hacker. The series is mostly episodic in nature, with the story regularly following the crew's adventures and bounty hunting quests, while also exploring their day-to-day lives. Aside from the stand-alone stories, there is also a main overarching story arc that centers on Spike.
Throughout the series, the Bebop crew members deal with unresolved issues from their pasts, with the show regularly utilizing flashbacks to illustrate their backstories. Over the course of the series' episodes, Spike occasionally encounters and battles his former friend Vicious, an enforcer of the Red Dragon Syndicate, while his past is shown to be tied to a mysterious woman named Julia. After a brief reunion with his former ISSP partner, Jet discovers he was betrayed and the mob hit that led to his arm loss was a trap carried out by his corrupt partner. Faye discovers she was born in the 20th century and was cryogenically frozen after a space shuttle accident left her severely injured. Edward encounters her long-lost father and eventually decides to leave the Bebop, with Ein choosing to accompany her.
The series ends with the conclusion of Spike's story arc. It is revealed that Julia was Vicious' girlfriend who started a dangerous affair with Spike, who offered to abandon the Red Dragon Syndicate and elope with her. After Vicious found out, he confronted Julia and ordered her to kill Spike, threatening that both would be killed otherwise. To protect herself and Spike, Julia went into hiding, never meeting him as both of them had planned. Spike then faked his death to the Syndicate and disappeared, eventually meeting Jet and forming a bounty hunter partnership with him. In the present, Vicious stages a coup d'etat on the leaders of the Red Dragon Syndicate, becoming its new head and ordering a hit on Spike and Julia. With help, Spike manages to find Julia in their original meeting place. However, the two are shortly ambushed by hitmen sent by Vicious, and Julia is killed in the escape. Spike returns to the Bebop and shares a final moment with Jet and Faye, before flying to Red Dragon headquarters where Vicious is waiting. After fighting his way through numerous henchman, he finally manages to confront Vicious. The two battle, Spike using his pistol, and Vicious using his katana. After a brief standoff, the two exchange blows simultaneously, leaving Vicious dead and Spike severely wounded. Spike descends the staircase, where he is confronted by the remainder of the Red Dragons members. Smiling, he mimicks a gun with his fingers, utters a final word "Bang", and collapses.

==Production==

Cowboy Bebop was developed by animation studio Sunrise and created by Hajime Yatate, the well-known pseudonym for the collective contributions of Sunrise's animation staff. The leader of the series' creative team was director Shinichirō Watanabe, most notable at the time for directing Macross Plus and Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory.[tpl]cite web|last=Patten |first=Fred |title='Cowboy Bebop: The Movie'… At Last |page=1 |url=http://www.awn.com/articles/anime/icowboy-bebop-moviei-last/page/1%2C1 |publisher=Animation World Network |date=March 31, 2003 |accessdate=April 19, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216051442/http://www.awn.com/articles/anime/icowboy-bebop-moviei-last/page/1%2C1 |archivedate= December 16, 2013 [/tpl] Other leading members of Sunrise's creative team were screenwriter Keiko Nobumoto, character designer Toshihiro Kawamoto, mechanical art designer Kimitoshi Yamane and composer Yoko Kanno. Most of them had previously worked together, in addition to having credits on other popular anime titles. Nobumoto had scripted Macross Plus, Kawamoto had designed the characters for Gundam, and Kanno had composed the music for Macross Plus and The Vision of Escaflowne. Yamane had not worked with Watanabe yet, but his credits in anime included Bubblegum Crisis and The Vision of Escaflowne.
Cowboy Bebop was Watanabe's first project as solo director, as he had been co-director in his previous works. The project had initially originated with Bandai's toy division as a sponsor, with the goal of selling spacecraft toys.[tpl]cite web|last=Sevakis |first=Justin |title=Shinichiro Watanabe focus panel - Otakon 2013 |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/convention/2013/otakon/7 |publisher=Anime News Network |date=August 15, 2013 |accessdate=April 19, 2014 [/tpl] Watanabe recalled his only instruction was "So long as there's a spaceship in it, you can do whatever you want." But upon viewing early footage, it became clear that Watanabe's vision for the series didn't match with that of Bandai's. Believing the series would never sell toy merchandise, Bandai pulled out of the project, leaving it in development hell until sister company Bandai Visual stepped in to sponsor it. Since there was no need to merchandise toys with the property any more, Watanabe had free rein in the development of the series.
Watanabe wanted to design not just a space adventure series for adolescent boys but a program that would also appeal to sophisticated adults. While the dialogue of the series was kept clean to avoid any profanities, its level of sophistication was made appropriate to adults in a criminal environment. Mature themes such as drug dealing and homosexuality were also key elements of some episodes.[tpl]cite web|last=Patten |first=Fred |title='Cowboy Bebop: The Movie'… At Last |page=3 |url=http://www.awn.com/articles/anime/icowboy-bebop-moviei-last/page/3%2C1 |publisher=Animation World Network |date=March 31, 2003 |accessdate=April 19, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216051445/http://www.awn.com/articles/anime/icowboy-bebop-moviei-last/page/3%2C1 |archivedate= December 16, 2013 [/tpl] Watanabe would later describe Cowboy Bebop as "80% serious story and 20% humorous touch." When developing the series' story, Watanabe began by creating the characters first. He explained, "the first image that occurred to me was one of Spike, and from there I tried to build a story around him, trying to make him cool."
Watanabe noted that composer Yoko Kanno did not score the music exactly the way he told her to.[tpl]cite web|first=Todd|last=DuBois|url=http://www.toonzone.net/2013/08/otakon-2013-with-shinichiro-watanabe/|title=Otakon 2013: Press Conference and Public Q&A With Director Shinichiro Watanabe|publisher=Toon Zone |date=August 21, 2013|accessdate=April 19, 2014 [/tpl] He stated, "She gets inspired on her own, follows up on her own imagery and comes to me saying 'this is the song we need for Cowboy Bebop,' and composes something completely on her own." Watanabe further explained that he would take inspiration from Kanno's music after listening to it and create new scenes for the story from it. These new scenes in turn would inspire Kanno and give her new ideas for the music and she would come to Watanabe with even more music. Watanabe cited as an example, "some songs in the second half of the series, we didn't even ask her for those songs, she just made them and brought them to us." He commented that while Kanno's method was normally "unforgivable and unacceptable," it was ultimately a "big hit" with Cowboy Bebop. Watanabe described his collaboration with Kanno as "a game of catch between the two of us in developing the music and creating the TV series Cowboy Bebop."
The atmospheres of the planets and the ethnic groups in Cowboy Bebop mostly originated from Watanabe's ideas, with some collaboration from set designers Isamu Imakake, Shoji Kawamori, and Dai Satō. The animation staff established the particular planet atmospheres early in the production of the series before working on the ethnic groups. It was Watanabe who wanted to have several groups of ethnic diversity appear in the series.[tpl]cite book |author=Newtype|title=Cowboy Bebop Anime Guide Volume 4|date=May 21, 2002|page=64|publisher=Tokyopop|isbn=1-931514-08-9[/tpl] Mars was the planet most often used in Cowboy Bebop[tpl]'[/tpl]s storylines, with Satoshi Toba, the cultural and setting producer, explaining that the other planets "were unexpectedly difficult to use." He stated that each planet in the series had unique features, and the producers had to take into account the characteristics of each planet in the story. For the final episode, Toba explained that it was not possible for the staff to have the dramatic rooftop scene occur on Venus, so the staff "ended up normally falling back to Mars."
Regarding the longevity of his work, Watanabe said that during the making of Bebop, he would try to rally the animation staff by telling them that the show would be something memorable in 10, 20, and even 30 years from then. While some of them were doubtful of that at the time, Watanabe many years later expressed his happiness to have been proven right in retrospect. He joked that if Bandai Visual hadn't intervened then "you might be seeing me working the supermarket checkout counter right now."

==Analysis==

===Style and appeal===

Several planets and space stations in the series are shown to be made in the Earth's image. The streets of celestial objects such as Ganymede resemble a modern port city, while Mars is replete with shopping malls, theme parks, casinos and cities. Cowboy Bebop's universe is filled with video players and hyperspace gates, eco-politics and fairgrounds, spaceships and Native American shamans. Futuristic elements are combined with the modern elements, "allowing audiences to easily connect with the Cowboy Bebop world".[tpl]cite web|title=Cowboy Bebop: Complete Sessions Collection Review|year=2004|last=Baigent|first=Robert|publisher=Graduate Journal of Asia-Pacific Studies|url=http://www.arts.auckland.ac.nz/webdav/site/arts/shared/Departments/asian-studies/gjaps/docs-vol2/Baigent1.pdf|accessdate=May 13, 2012[/tpl]
In his review of Cowboy Bebop, Miguel Douglas, editor-in-chief of iSugoi.com, describes the style of the series: 
 the series distinctly establishes itself outside the realm of conventional Japanese animation and instead chooses to forge its own path. With a setting within the realm of science fiction, the series wisely offers a world that seems entirely realistic considering our present time. Free from many of the elements that accompany science fiction in general — whether that be space aliens, giant robots, or laser guns — the series delegates itself towards presenting a world that is quite similar to our own albeit showcasing some technological advances. Certainly not as pristine a future we would see in other series or films, Cowboy Bebop decides to deliver a future that closely reflects that of our own time. This aspect of familiarity does wonders in terms of relating to the viewer, and it presents a world that certainly resembles our very own.[tpl]cite web|title=Anime Review: Cowboy Bebop - カウボーイビバップ - Kaubōi Bibappu |date=September 1, 2010|last=Douglas|first=Miguel|publisher=iSugoi|url=http://www.isugoi.com/cowboy-bebop-review/|accessdate=May 15, 2012[/tpl] 
Daryl Surat of Otaku USA commented on the series' "broad-ranging" appeal due to its style:
 Cowboy Bebop was that rare breed of science-fiction: "accessible". Unlike many anime titles, viewers weren’t expected to have knowledge of Asian culture — character names, signs, and the like were primarily in English to begin with — or have seen any other anime series prior.[tpl]cite web|title=Cowboy Bebop: Reflections on a Modern-Day Anime Relic|date=December 16, 2010|last=Surat|first=Daryl|publisher=Otaku USA|url=http://www.otakuusamagazine.com/SearchAudience/News1/Cowboy_Bebop_3984.aspx|accessdate=May 13, 2012[/tpl] 
 
Susan J. Napier argues, in her book Anime from Akira to Princess Mononoke: Experiencing Contemporary Japanese Animation, that anime increasingly "exists at a nexus point in global culture…an amorphous new media territory that crosses and intermingles national boundaries". Napier goes on to point out that many Japanese commentators refer to anime with the term mukokuseki, meaning "stateless".[tpl]cite book |last=Napier |first=Susan J. |title=Anime from Akira to Howl’s Moving Castle: Experiencing Japanese Animation |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2001 |pages=22–23 |isbn=1-4039-7052-1[/tpl] This implies that much anime is not specifically Japanese and therefore lacks a distinct national identity. Napier states that this "very quality of 'statelessness' has increasing attraction in our global culture". It is said that Cowboy Bebop reflects this and it is a great part of the show's appeal.

===Genre and cultural references===

Watanabe's main inspiration for Cowboy Bebop was Lupin III, a crime anime series from the late 1970s through the mid-1980s. According to Watanabe, the series paid subtle tribute to his favorite American films and series, which were shown in Japan during that time, including Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Bruce Lee films, films with blues or jazz soundtracks, as well as Blaxploitation films. Individual movies from Alien to Midnight Run were pastiched.
The series covered genres such as comedy, detective caper, action and thriller. The musical style was emphasized in many of the episode titles, which were in English, such as: Asteroid Blues, Honky Tonk Woman, Ballad of Fallen Angels, Heavy Metal Queen, etc. The anime draws heavily on Western sources, such as pulp detective stories, film noir, and American Westerns. There are also strong Hong Kong influences, mainly of the heroic bloodshed mold which includes films such as The Killer or Hard Boiled.[tpl]cite web|author=Deni|url=http://www.heroic-cinema.com/reviews/cowboy-bebop-2000|title=Review: Cowboy Bebop (2000)|publisher=Heroic Cinema|date=January 25, 2006|accessdate=May 26, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=|url=http://www.edmundyeo.com/2008/07/saturday-epic-anime-scene-final.html|title=Saturday Epic Anime Scene - Final Shootout in Cowboy Bebop|publisher=|date=July 20, 2008|accessdate=May 26, 2012[/tpl]
These continual borrowings from other genres and cultural products create a familiar access point for a western audience and perhaps in some part explain Cowboy Bebop's popularity. The sense of the familiar is emphasised and reinforced by popular culture references throughout the series. Kung fu films are an obvious influence. In Stray Dog Strut the final fight between Spike and Hakim is influenced by Bruce Lee's Game of Death while in Waltz for Venus, Spike's kung fu lesson is similar to a scene from Lee's Enter the Dragon.
The genre of the western is another influence on Cowboy Bebop. The most obvious reference is in the title of the show, immediately suggesting a lawless society. There are further examples throughout; a show called Big Shot informs the characters of the current bounties, the crew continually come across saloons and desert worlds and engage in gunfights and stand-offs. The show has a perpetual sense of lawlessness – both from the bounties they chase and from within the crew of the Bebop itself.
Similarly science fiction is another key influence, not only in the spaceship and the futuristic setting. A homage of the Alien films is made in the episode Toys in the Attic when an unseen predator stalks the crew. In Wild Horses the influence of Star Wars pervades throughout.
The flavor of film noir permeates Cowboy Bebop. This is especially prevalent in the character of Jet Black, a former cop who rails against the corruption of the police force but is thrown into a semi-lawless state of bounty hunting. As in film noir, characters are morally ambiguous – none more so than Faye Valentine who betrays her allies in the pursuit of a big bounty. The big-city rain-slicked settings of film noir are continually used, especially in the episode Ganymede Elegy. Other visual and aural cues are also taken from film noir, in Pierrot Le Fou for instance, Spike battles an enraged homicidal clown across a fairground, accompanied by lighting and camera angles film noir would use.[tpl]cite web|author=Jeffries, L.B. |url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/feature/115481-the-film-noir-roots-of-cowboy-bebop|title=The Film Noir Roots of Cowboy Bebop|publisher=PopMatters|date=2010-01-19|accessdate=2012-01-25[/tpl]
