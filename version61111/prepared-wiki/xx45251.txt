John Gilbert "Jack" Layton, [tpl]post-nominals|country=CAN|PC[/tpl] (July 18, 1950 – August 22, 2011) was a Canadian social democratic politician and Leader of the Official Opposition. He was leader of the New Democratic Party from 2003 to 2011, and previously sat on Toronto City Council, occasionally holding the title of "Acting Mayor" or "Deputy Mayor" of Toronto during his tenure as city councillor.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.toronto.ca/toronto_history/councillors/2001-2003/layton1.htm|title=Former City Councillor Jack Layton|author=City of Toronto|accessdate=March 24, 2011|authorlink=Municipal government of Toronto[/tpl] He was the Member of Parliament for Toronto—Danforth from 2004 until his death.
Son of a Progressive Conservative cabinet minister, Layton was raised in Hudson, Quebec. He rose to prominence in Toronto municipal politics where he was one of the most prominent left-wing voices on city and Metropolitan Toronto councils, championing many progressive causes. In 1991, he ran for mayor, losing to June Rowlands. Returning to council he rose to become head of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities. In 2003, he was elected leader of the federal NDP on the first ballot of the convention.
Under his leadership, support for the NDP increased in each election. The party's popular vote almost doubled in the 2004 election, which gave the NDP the balance of power in Paul Martin's minority government. In May 2005 the NDP supported the Liberal budget in exchange for major amendments, in what was promoted as Canada's "First NDP budget".[tpl]cite web|last=Campion-Smith|first=Bruce|title=Good for Canada, Layton declares; Commons backs 'first NDP budget'|work=Toronto Star|location=Toronto, Ontario|date=May 20, 2005|page=A6[/tpl] In November of that year, Layton voted with other opposition parties to defeat the Liberal government over the findings of the Gomery Commission. The NDP saw further gains in the 2006 and 2008 elections, in which the party elected 29 and 37 MPs, respectively.
In the 2011 election Layton led the NDP to the most successful result in the party's history, winning 103 seats—enough to form Canada's Official Opposition.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ca.news.yahoo.com/ndp-won-canadians-hearts-votes-broke-liberals-bloc-222048905.html|title=How NDP won the Canadians' hearts and votes and broke the Liberals and Bloc|last=The Canadian Press|publisher=Yahoo! News Network|year=2011|accessdate=May 3, 2011[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2013[/tpl] Federal support for Layton and the NDP in the election was unprecedented, especially in the province of Quebec where the party won 59 out of 75 seats.
Layton died on August 22, 2011, aged 61, after suffering from an undisclosed type of cancer. He was survived by his wife of 23 years, fellow MP Olivia Chow. Shortly before, he had named Nycole Turmel as interim leader of both the New Democratic Party and subsequently of the Official Opposition; Thomas Mulcair eventually won the formal leadership election that followed.

==Early life and education==

John Gilbert "Jack" Layton was born in Montreal and raised in nearby Hudson, Quebec, a comfortable and largely Anglophone community.Wallace, James. "Man of the people: Jack Layton is a pragmatist waiting to be given a chance." Sudbury Star. January 9, 2006, p. A8. His parents were Doris Elizabeth (Steeves), a grand-niece of William Steeves, a Father of Confederation,[tpl]cite web|url=http://boards.ancestry.com/thread.aspx?mv=flat&m=597&p=localities.northam.canada.newbrunswick.albert|title=William Henry Steeves|publisher=ancestry.com|accessdate=August 22, 2011[/tpl] and Progressive Conservative MP Robert Layton. He was elected student council president of his high school, Hudson High School, and his yearbook predicted that he would become a politician;Taber, Jane. "Outside House, Layton learns pecking order." The Globe and Mail. February 1, 2003, p. A5. he would later also credit Billy Bryans, who went on to become a prominent musician with the band The Parachute Club, for having played a role in his student council victory.[tpl]cite news|title=Parachute Club's Billy Bryans dies at 62|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/story/2012/04/23/obit-bryans-billy-parachute-club.html|accessdate=April 23, 2012|newspaper=CBC News|date=April 23, 2012|location=Toronto[/tpl] He graduated from McGill University in 1970 with an Honours Bachelor of Arts in political science and became a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity.
In 1969–70, he was the Prime Minister of the Quebec Youth Parliament.[tpl]cite news|last=Valpe|first=Michael|title=Jack Layton brought inspirational politics to a cynical age|url=http://m.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/jack-layton-brought-inspirational-politics-to-a-cynical-age/article2137539/singlepage/|accessdate=August 26, 2011|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=August 22, 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/61BPHAGUj|archivedate=August 26, 2011|location=Toronto[/tpl]
Layton credits a professor at McGill, the political philosopher Charles Taylor, with being the primary influence in his decision to switch from a science degree to an arts degree.  Moreover, it was on Taylor's advice that he pursued his doctorate in Toronto to study the work of University of Toronto political philosopher C. B. Macpherson. In what is perhaps his most complete articulation of his political philosophy, a foreword he wrote for Canadian Idealism and the Philosophy of Freedom, he explains that, "The idealist current holds that human society has the potential to achieve liberty when people work together to form a society in which equality means more than negative liberty, the absolute and protected right to run races against each other to determine winners. Idealists imagine a positive liberty that enables us to build together toward common objectives that fulfill and even surpass our individual goals."Meynell, Robert. Canadian Idealism and the Philosophy of Freedom. Montreal-Kingston: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2011, xi – xii.  Upon reading Canadian Idealism and the Philosophy of Freedom, Layton came to understand himself as part of the intellectual tradition of Canadian Idealists.
In 1970, the family moved to Toronto where Layton graduated the following year from York University with a Master of Arts in political science. In 1983, he completed his Doctor of Philosophy in political science at York.O'Neil, Peter (January 24, 2003). "Can Layton succeed?", Sudbury Star, p. A9. In 1974, Layton became a professor at Ryerson University."Grading the candidates: What are the educational qualifications of the candidates for mayor of Toronto?" Toronto Star September 29, 1991, p. A3. Over the next decade, he taught at Ryerson, York, and the University of Toronto. He also became a prominent activist for a variety of causes. He wrote several books, including Homelessness: The Making and Unmaking of a Crisis and a book on general public policy, Speaking Out.

==Family and personal life==

Layton's great-granduncle, William Steeves, was a Father of Confederation. His great-grandfather Philip E. Layton was a blind activist who founded the Montreal Association for the Blind[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mabmackay.ca/modules/pages/index.php?id=4&langue=en&menu=4&sousmenu=6|title=History – MAB-MACKAY Rehabilitation Centre|publisher=Mabmackay.ca|accessdate=May 2, 2011[/tpl] in 1908[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/story.html?id=d83c9035-6b65-4b5d-8a62-67f1234eef61|title=A tale of two anglos|newspaper=The Montreal Gazette|date=September 26, 2008|accessdate=May 2, 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/61Df2eJxi|archivedate=August 26, 2011|author=Gazette Staff[/tpl] and led a campaign for disability pensions in the 1930s. Philip was the senior partner in the family business, Layton Bros. Pianos. Layton Pianos had been made in London, England since 1837, and Philip had emigrated to Montreal at the age of 19.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/32031975/1900-Layton-Brothers-Pianos-Organs-Players-Wholesale-and-Retail|title=(1900) Layton Brothers Pianos, Organs & Players: Wholesale and Retail|publisher=Scribd.com|accessdate=May 2, 2011[/tpl]  Philip was a blind organist, composer ("Dominion March", played on carillon at Jack's lying-in-state), piano tuner, and piano retailer. The family business survives as Layton Audio in Montreal.[tpl]cite web|last=Vaisey|first=William|title=Blindness and Vision Loss|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=U1ARTU0000338|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|publisher=Historica-Dominion Institute|accessdate=August 26, 2011|coauthors=Hayes, Janice|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/61DffbdsR|archivedate=August 26, 2011|location=Toronto|year=2011[/tpl]
Jack Layton's grandfather, Gilbert Layton, was a cabinet minister in the Union Nationale government of Maurice Duplessis in Quebec, and resigned due to the provincial government's lack of support for Canadian participation in World War II. His father, Robert Layton, was a Liberal Party activist in the 1960s and 1970s, and served as a Progressive Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) and Cabinet minister in the 1980s under Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.[tpl]cite news|last=Galloway|first=Gloria|title=Behind the scenes: A look at leaders' family ties|accessdate=August 26, 2011|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=December 21, 2005|location=Toronto|page=A7[/tpl]
Layton was raised as a member of the United Church of Canada, and was a member of the Bloor Street United Church parish in Toronto."Jack Layton inspired by United Church spirituality and ethics". The Vancouver Sun, August 25, 2011. However, he also sometimes attended services at the Metropolitan Community Church of Toronto, whose pastor, Brent Hawkes, was a longtime New Democratic Party activist and a personal friend of Layton's.
In 1969, at age 19, Jack married his high school sweetheart Sally Halford, with whom he had two children, Mike, currently a Toronto City Councillor, and Sarah, currently a senior staffer for the Stephen Lewis Foundation.Geddes, John. "Jack Layton." Maclean's. December 5, 2005. Layton and Halford's marriage ended in divorce in 1983 after 14 years.
Layton first met Olivia Chow in 1985 during an auction at Village by the Grange, in which Jack was the auctioneer and Olivia was the interpreter for the Cantonese language observers. They had been previously acquainted, however they realized that they were both candidates in the upcoming election and decided to have lunch together to talk about the campaign. Three weeks after the auction, they went on their first date. Olivia's mother did not approve of Jack at first, because of his race as well as him not being a lawyer or doctor. Jack was invited to dinner at the home of Olivia's mother, where they also played mahjong. After the dinner, Jack attempted to thank Olivia's mother in Cantonese, however Jack's incorrect tone had him inadvertently saying, "Thank you for the good sex." Layton stated "My faux pas broke the ice completely. We've been good buddies ever since."[tpl]cite news|last=Rushowy|first=Kristin|title=Jack and Olivia their love story|url=http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/politics/article/1043197--jack-and-olivia-their-love-story#article|accessdate=August 26, 2011|newspaper=The Toronto Star|date=January 3, 1999|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/61EAHBbDO|archivedate=August 26, 2011|location=Toronto[/tpl]
Layton was known for playing music and singing songs at party gatherings. Alberta NDP Leader Brian Mason remembered during the three-day board meetings when Layton was running for president of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities: “He would gather people together in his hotel room and play the guitar and get everybody singing old folk songs from the ’60s.  He just got people involved, just with his personality, not politics.”[tpl]cite news|last=Kleiss|first=Karen|title=Alberta leaders put away partisan politics to honour Layton: Tributes pour in from across the province|url=http://www.edmontonjournal.com/news/Tributes+indicate+Jack+Layton+legacy+transcends+party+lines/5289309/story.html|accessdate=August 26, 2011|newspaper=The Edmonton Journal|date=August 23, 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/61EAopjYr|archivedate=August 26, 2011|location=Edmonton, Alberta[/tpl]
At the 2005 Parliamentary Press Gallery Dinner (typically a satirical event), Layton sent up himself and his party, playing guitar and singing three songs: "Party for Sale or Rent" (to the tune of "King of the Road"), a re-worked version of "Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out" with different humorous lyrics, and "If I Had Another $4.6 Billion".[tpl]cite news|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Meagan|title=OBITUARY: Jack Layton's legacy as a fighter|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/story/2011/08/22/pol-layton-death.html|work=CBC News|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=August 22, 2011|accessdate=August 23, 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/61EMCoeGy|archivedate=August 26, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Jack Layton- Party For Sale or Rent|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl0Mk1idNXg|work=Youtube|publisher=Youtube, LLC|accessdate=August 23, 2011[/tpl]
Layton was a keen Trekkie, having a custom Starfleet uniform made by a tailor. Layton was famously photographed wearing his uniform at a Star Trek convention in 1991.[tpl]cite news|last=Delacourt|first=Susan|title=Where no NDP leader has gone before|url=http://thestar.blogs.com/politics/2009/05/where-no-ndp-leader-has-gone-before.html|date=May 6, 2009|newspaper=The Toronto Star|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/61ELNC9R5|archivedate=August 26, 2011|accessdate=August 26, 2011[/tpl]

==Toronto City Council==

At York and Ryerson, Layton developed close links with a number of Toronto figures including John Sewell and David Crombie. He was first elected to Toronto City Council in 1982, in a surprise upset against incumbent Gordon Chong. He quickly became one of the most outspoken members of council, and a leader of the left wing.Hayes, David R. "A new star rising over left field." The Globe and Mail. January 8, 1983, p. F3. He was one of the most vocal opponents of the massive SkyDome project,MacLeod, Robert. "Layton urges SkyDome inquiry." The Globe and Mail. September 12, 1991, p. A11. and an early advocate for rights for AIDS patients.Monsebraaten, Laurie. "Alderman proposes $2.1 million AIDS team." Toronto Star. May 6, 1987, p. A6. In 1984, he was fined for trespassing when he handed out leaflets at the Toronto Eaton Centre during a strike by Eaton's staff, but the charge was later thrown out on freedom of speech grounds.Spears, Tom. "Alderman wins appeal for handing out leaflets at Eaton's during strike." Toronto Star. May 27, 1986, p. A18. Layton was also one of the few opponents to Toronto's bid for the 1996 Summer Olympics.James, Royson. "Failure pinned on Jack Layton, poverty group." Toronto Star. September 19, 1990, p. A3. In 1985, he moved to the Metropolitan Toronto council, in the first direct elections for members of that body.Smith, Michael. "Toronto Aldermen gearing up for first direct Metro election." Toronto Star. July 16, 1985, p. A6."Layton proved right." The Globe and Mail. November 13, 1985, p. A17. In the 1988 municipal elections, Layton traded places with city council ally Dale Martin, with Martin going to Metro and Layton returning to Toronto City Council. Layton was easily elected in a contest with former high school teacher Lois MacMillan-Walker. The election was a major victory for Layton as the reformist coalition of which he was the de facto head gained control of City Council, the first time in city history a coalition of New Democrats and independents controlled council.Monsebraaten, Laurie. "Reformers on council seek Toronto's 'rebirth.'" Toronto Star. November 19, 1988, p. D1.
On July 9, 1988, he married Hong Kong-born Toronto District School Board trustee Olivia Chow in a ceremony on Algonquin Island.Spears, Tom. "Busy trustee keeps to a hectic schedule." Toronto Star. July 10, 1988, p. A10.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.postcity.com/Post-City-Magazines/May-2010/The-biggest-fight-of-their-marriage|title=The biggest fight of their marriage – Post City Magazines|publisher=Postcity.com|date=July 9, 1988|accessdate=May 2, 2011[/tpl] Their whitewater rafting honeymoon plans had to be abandoned, however, when days before the wedding Layton collided with a newspaper box while bicycling."Layton Sues for Bike Mishap that 'Ruined' his Honeymoon". Toronto Star. July 5, 1988, p. A7. Chow later joined Layton on the Toronto City Council. She has been a candidate for the federal New Democrats five times, first winning her seat the third time in a close race against Tony Ianno in the 2006 Canadian election, and re-elected in 2008 and 2011.
Layton and Chow were also the subject of some dispute when a June 14, 1990, Toronto Star article by Tom Kerr accused them of unfairly living in a housing cooperative subsidized by the federal government, despite their high income.Kerr, Tom. "Well-to-do Layton lives in 'affordable co-op'". Toronto Star. June 14, 1990, p. A1. Layton and Chow had both lived in the Hazelburn co-op since 1985, and lived together in an $800 per month three-bedroom apartment after their marriage in 1988. By 1990, their combined annual income was $120,000, and in March of that year they began voluntarily paying an additional $325 per month to offset their share of the co-op's Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation subsidy, the only members of the co-op to do so. In response to the article, the co-op's board argued that having mixed-income tenants was crucial to the success of co-ops, and that the laws deliberately set aside apartments for those willing to pay market rates, such as Layton and Chow.Kerr, Tom. "Co-op residents answer critics". Toronto Star. July 19, 1990, p. A21. During the late 1980s and early 1990s they maintained approximately 30% of their units as low income units and provided the rest at what they considered market rent. In June 1990, the city's solicitor cleared the couple of any wrongdoing,Polanyi, Margaret. "Layton cleared of wrongdoing Police say councillor committed no impropriety by living in co-op." The Globe and Mail. August 17, 1990, p. A8. and later that month, Layton and Chow left the co-op and bought a house in Toronto's Chinatown together with Chow's mother, a move they said had been planned for some time.Duffy, Andrew. "Layton says he's moving from co-op." Toronto Star. June 24, 1990, p. A3. Former Toronto mayor John Sewell later wrote in NOW that rival Toronto city councillor Tom Jakobek had given the story to Tom Kerr.Wolfe, Morris. "Sensational tabloids are enticing a suspicious public." The Globe and Mail. February 4, 1992, p. D1.
Originally known for coming to council meetings in blue jeans with unkempt hair, Layton worked to change his image to run for mayor in the 1991 civic election. He also started wearing contact lenses, abandoning his glasses, and traded in his blue jeans for suits.Byers, Jim. "Jack Layton's trim new look triggers rumor mill at city hall." Toronto Star. February 5, 1987, p. A6. In February 1991, Layton became the first official NDP candidate for the mayoralty, pitting him against centrist incumbent Art Eggleton.Lewis, David Stein. "Councillor Jack Layton's campaign to become mayor of Toronto is ..." Toronto Star. February 6, 1991, p. A25. In a move that surprised many, Eggleton elected not to run again.Kerr, Tom. "Eggleton out of race for mayor." Toronto Star. May 2, 1991, p. A1.
Layton was opposed by three right-of-centre candidates: Susan Fish, June Rowlands, and Betty Disero. Right-wing support soon coalesced around former city councillor Rowlands, preventing the internal divisions Layton needed to win office.Byers, Jim. "Rowlands leads by 2–1 margin But 55% want more choice for mayor, Star poll shows" Toronto Star November 9, 1991, p. A1. Layton was also hurt by the growing unpopularity of the provincial NDP government of Bob Rae,MacLeod, Robert. "Rae's misfortunes called drag on Layton Toronto mayoral candidate running under NDP banner." The Globe and Mail. June 15, 1991, p. A7. and by his earlier opposition to Toronto's Olympic bid. Bid organizer Paul Henderson accused Layton and his allies of costing Toronto the event.Byers, Jim. "Guide to the real winners, losers Apparent victories are defeats in topsy-turvy world of politics." Toronto Star. November 15, 1991, p. A12. Despite this, October polls showed Layton only four points behind Rowlands, with 36% support.Byers, Jim. "Rowlands just ahead of Layton, Star poll finds." Toronto Star. October 10, 1991, p. A1. However on October 17, Fish, a former provincial Tory cabinet minister who had only 19% support, pulled out of the race, and many of her supporters moved to Rowlands. Layton lost the November 12 election by a considerable margin.Byers, Jim. "Layton beaten by Rowlands in all but one of 16 wards." Toronto Star. November 21, 1991, p. A7. However, in the same election Olivia Chow easily won a seat on City Council.
Layton returned to academia and founded the Green Catalyst Group Inc., an environmental consulting business.Lakey, Jack. "The mellowing of Jack Layton." Toronto Star. January 4, 1999, p. 1. In 1993, he ran for the Canadian House of Commons in the riding of Rosedale for the NDP, but finished fourth in the generally Liberal riding. In 1994, he returned to Metropolitan Toronto Council, succeeding Roger Hollander in the Don River ward, and he resumed his high profile role in local politics; following the "megacity" merger of Metropolitan Toronto into the current city of Toronto, he was again re-elected to Toronto City Council, serving alongside Pam McConnell in a two-member ward. He remained on Toronto City Council until pursuing the leadership of the federal New Democrats. He also came to national attention as the leader of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities."Layton launches bid to lead NDP: Outspoken T.O. city councillor." The Province. July 23, 2002, p. A22. Federally, he ran again in the 1997 election, but lost to incumbent Dennis Mills by a wide margin. In June 1999, as chair of Toronto's environmental task force, the Toronto Atmospheric Fund, he was instrumental in the preliminary phases of the WindShare wind power cooperative in Toronto through the Toronto Renewable Energy Co-operative.[tpl]cite news|title=Hydro backs waterfront windmill plan|author=Brian McAndrew|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=July 1, 1999[/tpl]

==Leader of the NDP==

Layton was elected Leader of the NDP at the party's leadership convention in Toronto, on January 25, 2003. Layton won on the first ballot with 53.5% of the vote, defeating Bill Blaikie, Lorne Nystrom, Joe Comartin and Pierre Ducasse.Haight, Lana. "Layton surprises locals: Supporters 'blown away' by win over Blaikie, Nystrom; Lana Haight." Star – Phoenix. January 27, 2003, p. A1. His campaign was focused on the need to reinvigorate the party, and was prominently endorsed by former NDP leader Ed Broadbent."Broadbent backs Toronto city councillor as NDP chief". Times – Colonist. November 28, 2002, p. A7.
Layton did not seek election to the House of Commons by running in a by-election, as is the tradition among new party leaders without a seat. Instead, he waited until the 2004 federal election to contest the riding of Toronto—Danforth against Liberal Dennis Mills. With no seat in the House of Commons, he appointed the runner-up, longtime Winnipeg-area MP Bill Blaikie, as parliamentary leader.Paraskevas, Joe. "NDP leader goes after Grits on Day One". Sudbury Star. January 28, 2003, p. A8. Although he had no parliamentary seat, Layton was noted for drawing considerable attention from the Canadian mass media.Goar, Carol. "He makes it look too effortless". Toronto Star. November 5, 2003, p. A26.Curry, Bill. "NDP's Layton accused of hogging the microphones." National Post. February 25, 2003, p. A11. Much of his rhetoric involved attacking the policies of then Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin as conservative, and arguing the ideology of the Liberal Party of Canada had shifted in a more right wing direction. Another focus of Layton's leadership was to focus the party's efforts on Quebec, one of the party's weaker provinces.Chung, Andrew. "Quebec a difficult hill for NDP to climb". Toronto Star. April 26, 2003, p. E02. One of his opponents in the leadership race, Pierre Ducasse, was the first Québécois to run for leader of the NDP. After the race, Layton appointed Ducasse as his Quebec lieutenant and party spokesperson.Curry, Bill. "NDP counting on Ducasse: Popular Quebecer to run in Manicouagan". The Gazette. January 5, 2004, p. A10.
The result of Layton's efforts was a strong increase in the party's support. By the end of 2003, the party was polling higher than both the Canadian Alliance or the Progressive ConservativesLunman, Kim. "NDP inching past conservatives, poll indicates." The Globe and Mail. December 5, 2003, p. A4. and it was even suggested that the next election could see the NDP in place as official opposition.Canton, Maria. "NDP official opposition possible, predicts prof". Calgary Herald. November 16, 2003, p. A8.

===2004 election===

During the 2004 Canadian federal election, controversy erupted over Layton's accusation that Liberal Prime Minister Paul Martin was responsible for the deaths of homeless people because he failed to provide funding for affordable housing.Aubry, Jack. "Layton's line starts a storm." Times – Colonist. May 28, 2004, p. A4. While rates of homelessness and homeless deaths increased during the eleven years of Liberal government, the link to Martin's decisions was indirect as affordable housing is a mainly provincial jurisdiction.Murphy, Barbara. On the street: how we created the homeless. Winnipeg: J. Gordon Shillingford, c2000. Layton's charge was defended by some, including the Ottawa Citizen,Coyne, Andrew. "Layton's charge is out of order." National Post. May 29, 2004, p. A22. but most attacked it as inaccurate and negative campaigning. Moreover the controversy consumed the campaign, overshadowing policy announcements over the next week.Curry, Bill. "Layton drops from radar during Week 2." Star – Phoenix. June 5, 2004, p. A13.
Further controversy followed as Layton suggested the removal of the Clarity Act, considered by some to be vital to keeping Quebec in Canada and by others as undemocratic, and promised to recognize any declaration of independence by Quebec after a referendum.Chase, Steven. "Layton would axe Clarity Act" The Globe and Mail. May 29, 2004, p. A1. This position was not part of the NDP's official party policy, leading some high-profile party members, such as NDP House Leader Bill Blaikie and former NDP leader Alexa McDonough, to publicly indicate that they did not share Layton's views. His position on the Clarity Act was reversed in the 2006 election to one of support.Layton reverses course on Clarity Act[tpl]dead link|date=April 2013[/tpl] CTV News. December 7, 2005.
Layton also continued his effort to improve his party's standing in Quebec. The NDP ran French-language ads in the province and Layton, who spoke colloquial Québécois French, appeared in them. He advocated replacing the first-past-the-post system with proportional representation. He threatened to use the NDP's clout in the event of a minority government. However, it was dismissed out of hand by the Liberal and Bloc Québécois leaders, as they tend to be favored by the first-past-the-post system, normally being allocated a greater proportion of seats than the proportion of votes cast for them. Historically, the NDP's popular vote does not translate into a proportional number of seats because of scattered support. This was most opposed by the Bloc Québécois, who usually had the lowest popular vote but nonetheless won many seats because their support was concentrated in Quebec. Despite these problems, Layton led the NDP to a 15% popular vote, its highest in 16 years. However, it only won 19 seats in the House of Commons, two less than the 21 won under Alexa McDonough in 1997, and far short of the 40 that Layton predicted on the eve of the election. However, some potential NDP voters may have voted Liberal to prevent a possible Conservative win. Olivia Chow and several other prominent Toronto NDP candidates lost tight races and Layton won his own seat against incumbent Liberal Dennis Mills by a much narrower margin than early polls indicated.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2011[/tpl]

===Liberal minority government===

With the ruling Liberal Party being reduced to a minority government, revelations of the sponsorship scandal damaging its popularity to the point where both the Conservative Party and the Bloc Québécois were pressing their advantage for a snap election, the Prime Minister approached the NDP for its support. Layton demanded the cancellation of proposed corporate tax cuts and called for an increase in social spending. The ensuing compromise in the NDP's favour was protested by the other opposition parties who used it as a pretext to force a non-confidence vote. On May 19, two such votes were defeated and Layton's amendments went on to be passed on its final reading vote on June 23. As a result of this political coup and his apparent civil behaviour in a spitefully raucous parliament, many political analysts noted that Layton gained increased credibility as an effective leader of an important party, becoming the major second choice leader in many political polls – for example, polling second in Quebec after Gilles Duceppe, despite the low polls for his party as a whole in the province.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2011[/tpl]

However, the Martin government refused to allow the election date to be decided by the opposition. A motion of non-confidence followed, moved by Stephen Harper and seconded by Layton, triggering the 2006 federal election.

====Coalition attempt with the BQ and the Conservatives====

On March 26, 2011, in response to Harper's allegations that a coalition is not a legitimate or principled way to form government, Duceppe stated that Harper had once tried to form a coalition government with the Bloc and NDP.[tpl]cite news|last=Payton|first=Laura|title=Harper wanted 2004 coalition: Duceppe|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canadavotes2011/story/2011/03/26/cv-kickoff-bloc.html|accessdate=March 26, 2011|newspaper=CBC News|date=March 26, 2011[/tpl] In 2004 Stephen Harper privately met with Bloc Québécois leader Gilles Duceppe and New Democratic Party leader Jack Layton in a Montreal hotel. The meeting that took place between the three party leaders happened 2 months before the federal election. On September 9, 2004, the three signed a letter addressed to then-Governor General Adrienne Clarkson, stating,
[tpl]Quote|We respectfully point out that the opposition parties, who together constitute a majority in the House, have been in close consultation. We believe that, should a request for dissolution arise, this should give you cause, as constitutional practice has determined, to consult the opposition leaders and consider all of your options before exercising your constitutional authority.[tpl]cite news|title=Harper, Layton, Duceppe sought 'co-opposition' in 2004 letter to GG|url=http://www.canada.com/news/Harper+Layton+Duceppe+sought+opposition+2004+letter/4511865/story.html#ixzz1Htw6yDVP|publisher=Montreal Gazette|date=March 27, 2011[/tpl][/tpl]
On the same day the letter was written, the three party leaders held a joint press conference at which they expressed their intent to co-operate on changing parliamentary rules, and to request that the Governor General consult with them before deciding to call an election.[tpl]cite news|last=Chung|first=Andrew|title=Bloc leader accuses Harper of lying about coalition|url=http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/politics/article/962240--bloc-leader-accuses-harper-of-lying-about-coalition?bn=1|accessdate=March 27, 2011|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=March 26, 2011[/tpl] At the news conference, Harper said "It is the Parliament that's supposed to run the country, not just the largest party and the single leader of that party. That's a criticism I've had and that we've had and that most Canadians have had for a long, long time now so this is an opportunity to start to change that." However, at the time, Harper and the two other opposition leaders denied trying to form a coalition government. Harper said, "This is not a coalition, but this is a co-operative effort."
One month later, on October 4, Mike Duffy, now a Conservative senator (appointed by Harper), said "It is possible that you could change prime minister without having an election," and that some Conservatives wanted Harper as prime minister. The next day Layton walked out on talks with Harper and Duceppe, accusing them of trying to replace Paul Martin with Harper as prime minister. Both Bloc and Conservative officials denied Layton's accusations.

===2006 campaign===

With a vote scheduled for January 23, 2006, many New Democrats expected Layton to deliver substantially more seats than he did in 2004. They hoped the NDP would hold the balance of power in a new minority parliament, so that they could carry additional leverage in negotiating with the governing party. Mike Klander, the executive vice-president of the federal Liberals' Ontario wing, resigned after making posts on his blog comparing Chow to a Chow Chow dog and calling her husband an "asshole".Liberal exec quits over his blog remarks about NDPers CBC.ca. December 27, 2005.
Through the course of the campaign, Layton attempted to cast himself as the sole remaining champion of universal health care. Some opinion polls showed that Canadians found Layton the most appealing and charismatic of the leaders. Layton repeatedly insisted that "Canadians have a third choice", and urged Liberals to "lend us your vote". Some commentators and pundits mocked Layton for over-using these catchphrases instead of explaining the NDP platform. [tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2011[/tpl]
The NDP's strategy had changed in that they were focusing their attacks on the Liberals rather than in 2004 where they criticized both the Liberals and Conservatives in equal measure prompting some criticism from Paul Martin.Martin attacks Layton for not attacking Harper January 17, 2006. Andrew Coyne suggested that the NDP not only wanted to disassociate themselves from the scandal-ridden Liberals, but also because the Liberals were likely to receive credit for legislation achieved under the Liberal-NDP partnership. The NDP had also lost close races in the 2004 election due to the Liberals' strategic voting. Early in the campaign, NDP MP Judy Wasylycia-Leis had asked the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) to launch a criminal investigation into the leaking of the income trust announcement.Income trust a major campaign turning point[tpl]dead link|date=April 2013[/tpl] CTV News. January 22, 2006. The criminal probe seriously damaged the Liberal campaign and preventing them from making their key policy announcements, as well as bringing alleged Liberal corruption back into the spotlight.
Layton's campaign direction also caused a break between him and Canadian Auto Workers union head Buzz Hargrove over the issue of strategic voting. Hargrove preferred a Liberal minority government supported by the NDP and he had earlier criticized Layton for participating in the motion of non-confidence that brought down the Liberal government. Hargrove allied with the Liberals and publicly stated that he "did not like the campaign that Jack Layton was running", criticizing Layton for "spending too much time attacking the Liberals". During the final week of the campaign, knowing that last-minute strategic voting had cost the NDP seats in several close ridings during the 2004 election,[tpl]cite news|last=Brennan|first=Richard|title=Liberals stem Conservative tide|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/974828621.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jan+24%2C+2006&author=Richard+Brennan&pub=Toronto+Star&edition=&startpage=A.04&desc=Liberals+stem+Conservative+tide|accessdate=August 26, 2011|newspaper=The Toronto Star|date=January 24, 2006|location=Toronto|page=A4[/tpl] Hargrove and Martin urged all progressive voters to unite behind the Liberal banner to stop a Conservative government.[tpl]cite news|last=Whittington|first=Wes|title=Don't let Tories tear Canada apart Martin; PM in last-ditch plea to voters Says final outcome will hinge on B.C.|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/974196541.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jan+23%2C+2006&author=Les+Whittington&pub=Toronto+Star&edition=&startpage=A.06&desc=Don%27t+let+Tories+tear+Canada+apart+Martin%3B+PM+in+last-ditch+plea+to+voters+Says+final+outcome+will+hinge+on+B.C.|accessdate=August 26, 2006|newspaper=The Toronto Star|date=January 23, 2006|location=Toronto|page=A6[/tpl]
Layton intensified his attacks on the Liberal scandals, pledging to use his minority clout to keep the Conservatives in check. Shortly after the election, the Ontario provincial branch of the NDP revoked Hargrove's party membership because he had violated the party's constitution by campaigning for other parties during an election campaign, though Layton disagreed with this. Hargrove retaliated by severing ties with the NDP at the annual CAW convention. The election increased  the NDP's total seats to 29 seats, up from 18 MP before dissolution. Among the new NDP candidates elected was Olivia Chow, making the two only the second husband-and-wife team in Canadian Parliament history (Gurmant Grewal and Nina Grewal were the first husband-and-wife team in Canadian Parliament after the 2004 federal election). In the end, the NDP succeeded in increasing their parliamentary representation to 29 MPs, though they had significantly fewer seats than the Bloc Québécois (51) or the Opposition Liberals (103).[tpl]cite news|last=Delecourt|first=Susan|title=CON124 36.5% POP VOTE LIB 103 30.1% POP VOTE BLOC 51 10.5% POP VOTE NDP 29 17.4% POP VOTE Independent 1|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/974828531.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jan+24%2C+2006&author=Susan+Delacourt&pub=Toronto+Star&edition=&startpage=A.01&desc=CON124+36.5%25+POP+VOTE+LIB+103+30.1%25+POP+VOTE+BLOC+51+10.5%25+POP+VOTE+NDP+29+17.4%25+POP+VOTE+Independent+1|accessdate=August 26, 2011|newspaper=The Toronto Star|date=January 24, 2006|location=Toronto|page=A1[/tpl]

===2008 campaign===

Layton started off the 2008 federal election campaign with a speech similar to that of US presidential nominee Barack Obama. Layton denied he was trying to draw comparisons with Obama, saying "I mean, I am a lot shorter than he is. He is a brilliant orator. I'm never going to claim to be that. But what I have noticed is that the key issues faced by the American middle class, the working people of the U.S. and their concerns about their families' futures, are awfully similar to the issues that I hear in Canada." Layton said that he has also written to Obama and Hillary Clinton saying that the North American Free Trade Agreement had hurt working people in both countries "and those stories have to be told."
Layton, along with Prime Minister Harper and Bloc Québécois leader Gilles Duceppe, initially opposed the inclusion of Green Party leader Elizabeth May in the leaders' televised debates.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/greens-can-t-participate-in-leaders-debates-networks-rule-1.757797 |title=Greens can't participate in leaders debates, networks rule|publisher=CBC |location=Canada |date=September 8, 2008|accessdate=March 12, 2014 [/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://network.nationalpost.com/np/blogs/fullcomment/archive/2008/09/08/john-turley-ewart-elizabeth-may-torpedoes-the-green-party-again.aspx|title=Elizabeth May torpedoes the Green Party... again |publisher=Network.nationalpost.com|accessdate=June 5, 2010[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2013[/tpl] Layton initially said that he was following the rules of the broadcast consortium, while NDP spokesman Brad Lavigne confirmed that Layton had refused to attend if May was present, noting that May had endorsed Liberal leader Stéphane Dion for prime minister, and arguing that her inclusion would in effect give the Liberals two representatives at the debate. Rod Love, former chief of staff to Ralph Klein, suggested that the Greens could potentially cut into the NDP's support.[tpl]cite news|author=Canada|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080908.welxnpanelmay0908/BNStory/Front|title=A debate without the Greens|work=Globe and Mail|location=Canada|date=September 8, 2008|accessdate=June 5, 2010|location=Toronto[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2013[/tpl] Layton's stance drew criticism from the YWCA,""Who's Afraid of Elizabeth May?"

In the end, the NDP gained 8 new seats, taking its tally to 37. This result still left the NDP as Canada's fourth party, behind the Bloc Québécois with 50.

===Continued Conservative minority government===

The 40th session of parliament began on November 27, 2008, with a fiscal update by the Conservatives that outlined their agenda for the upcoming term. This included a temporary suspension of Federal employees' right to strike and a removal of monetary subsidies for political parties.Opposition threatens to topple Tories over update Richard Brennan. Toronto Star. November 27, 2008. All three opposition parties including the NDP stated that they could not support this position. Layton along with Liberal leader Stéphane Dion and Bloc Québécois leader Gilles Duceppe began negotiations to form a coalition that would replace the Conservatives as the government. The three opposition parties planned to table a motion of non-confidence in the House of Commons, and counted on the likelihood that the Governor General, Michaëlle Jean, would invite the coalition to govern instead of dissolving parliament and calling an election so soon after the last election.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2011[/tpl]
On December 1, 2008, the three opposition leaders signed an accord that laid down the basis for an agreement on a coalition government. The proposed structure would be a coalition between the Liberals and the NDP, with the New Democrats getting six Cabinet positions. Both parties agreed to continue the coalition until June 30, 2011. The Bloc Québécois would not be formally part of the government but would provide support on confidence motions for 18 months.Liberals, NDP, Bloc sign deal on proposed coalition CBC News.

Layton appeared on the Radio-Canada talk show Tout le monde en parle on April 3, an appearance that was credited for improving his party's standing among Francophone voters due to his informal Québécois French.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/layton-remains-game-despite-polls-showing-hes-the-odd-man-out/article575778/ |title=Three leaders, three accents |first=Lysiane |last=Gagnon |date=April 18, 2011 |accessdate=March 12, 2014 |publisher=The Globe and Mail [/tpl] The show is the most popular program in Quebec.[tpl]cite news|newspaper=Montreal Gazette|title=Sovereignist Lepage opened door for Layton|url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/decision-canada/Sovereignist+Lepage+opened+door+Layton/4743471/story.html|author=François Lauzon|date=May 7, 2011|accessdate=May 7, 2011[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2013[/tpl] He was also perceived to have performed well in the televised French-language party leaders' debate on April 13.
In the May 2, 2011, election, Layton led the NDP to 103 seats, more than double its previous high. This was also enough to make the NDP the Official Opposition in the Commons for the first time ever. The NDP gains were partly due to a major surge in Quebec as the party won 59 of the province's 75 seats, dominating Montreal and sweeping Quebec City and the Outaouais, although the NDP also won more seats than any other opposition party in the rest of Canada. The NDP had gone into the election with only one seat in Quebec, that of Mulcair, and had won but a single seat in the province historically (Phil Edmonston in a 1990 by-election). Many of these gains came at the expense of the Bloc, which was reduced to a four-seat rump without official party status in Parliament.

==Illness and death==

On February 5, 2010, Layton announced that he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer. He noted that his father Robert Layton had suffered from the same type of cancer 17 years before and recovered from it. His wife, Olivia Chow, had battled thyroid cancer a few years before. He vowed to beat the cancer and said it would not interrupt his duties as member of Parliament or as leader of the NDP.[tpl]cite web|publisher=New Democratic Party|url=http://www.ndp.ca/press/statement-by-jack-layton-delivered-to-media-today|title=Statement by Jack Layton, delivered to the media today|date=February 5, 2010|accessdate=July 28, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Layton won't attend NDP summer caucus retreat|url=http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Politics/20110817/layton-wont-attend-summer-caucus-110817/|work=CTV News|accessdate=August 24, 2011|date=August 17, 2011[/tpl]
Following the 2011 federal election, Layton led the party into the first month of the new session of Parliament, as well as attending the NDP Federal Convention in Vancouver. After Parliament rose for the summer, Layton announced on July 25, 2011 that he would be taking a temporary leave from his post to fight an unspecified, newly diagnosed cancer. He was hoping to return as leader of the NDP upon the resumption of the House of Commons on September 19, 2011. Layton recommended that NDP caucus chair Nycole Turmel serve as interim leader during his leave of absence.[tpl]cite news|last=LeBlanc|first=Daniel|title=Layton picks Nycole Turmel as interim leader|work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada |date=July 25, 2011|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/layton-picks-nycole-turmel-as-interim-leader/article2108898|accessdate=July 25, 2011|location=Toronto[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2013[/tpl]
