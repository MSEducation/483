==History==

Krispy Kreme's founder Vernon Rudolph and his uncle purchased Joseph LeBeouf's donut shop on Broad Street in Paducah, Kentucky along with a secret recipe for yeast-raised doughnuts in 1933 acquired from a New Orleans French Chef. Rudolph began selling the yeast doughnuts in Paducah and delivered them on his bicycle. The operation was moved to Nashville, Tennessee and other family members joined to meet the customer demand. Rudolph sold his interest in the Nashville store in 1937 and opened a doughnut shop in Winston-Salem, North Carolina selling to grocery stores and then directly to individual customers. The first store in North Carolina was located in a rented building on South Main Street in Winston-Salem in what is now called historic Old Salem. The Krispy Kreme logo was designed by Benny Dinkins, a local architect.
Expansion occurred in the 1950s, including an early store in Savannah, Georgia.  By the 1960s, Krispy Kreme was known throughout the Southeast, and it began to expand into other areas. In 1976, Krispy Kreme Doughnut Corporation became a wholly owned subsidiary of Beatrice Foods of Chicago, Illinois. The headquarters for Krispy Kreme remained in Winston-Salem.
A group of franchisees purchased the corporation back from Beatrice Foods in 1982.

===Growth===

Krispy Kreme began another phase of rapid expansion in the 1990s, opening stores outside the southeastern United States where most of their stores were located. Then, in December 2001, Krispy Kreme opened its first store outside the U.S. in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, just outside Toronto.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=a8mOHRchXI6s | work=Bloomberg | title=Krispy Kreme Canada Trial Tests Private-Equity Disclosure Rules | date=2009-04-13[/tpl]  Since 2004, Krispy Kreme has rapidly expanded its international operations, now including almost 100 stores in Mexico alone.url=http://www.krispykreme.mx/index.php?file=localizador.tp&categ=355 | work=Krispy Kreme | title=Krispy Kreme Mexico | date=2013-12-04

===IPO and accounting scandals===

On April 5, 2000, the corporation went public on the NASDAQ at $21 using the ticker symbol KREM.[tpl]dead link|date=August 2012[/tpl] On May 17, 2001, Krispy Kreme switched to the New York Stock Exchange, with the ticker symbol KKD, which is its current symbol. The stock reached what would be its all-time high of $50 on the New York Stock Exchange in August 2003, a gain of 235 percent from its IPO price. For the fiscal year ended in February 2004, the company reported sales of $665.6 million and operating profits of $94.7 million from almost 400 stores (including international locations). The market initially considered the company as having "solid fundamentals, adding stores at a rapid clip and showing steadily increasing sales and earnings."
 Since then it had lost 75-80% of its value by 2005, amid earnings declines, as well as an SEC investigation over the company's alleged improper accounting practices.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/investor/content/jan2005/pi20050119_0925_pi015.htm |title=The Holes in a Krispy Kreme Rally |publisher=Businessweek |date= |accessdate=2012-08-09[/tpl]
In May 2004, the company missed quarterly estimates for the first time and suffered its first loss as a public company. Chairman and CEO Scott Livengood attributed the poor results to the low-carbohydrate diet craze. This explanation was viewed with skepticism by analysts, as "blaming the Atkins diet for disappointing earnings carried a whiff of desperation",[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cfo.com/printable/article.cfm/4007436?f=options |title=Kremed! |publisher=CFO.com |date=2005-06-01 |accessdate=2012-08-09[/tpl] and as rival donut chain Dunkin' Donuts has not suffered from the low-carb trend over the same compared period.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_02/b3915649.htm |title=Scott Livengood |publisher=Businessweek |date=2005-01-09 |accessdate=2012-08-09[/tpl]
Analysts suggested that Livengood had expanded the chain too rapidly after the IPO, which concentrated certain markets with too many stores. While this approach initially grew revenues and profits at the parent-company level, due to royalty payments from new franchisees, which also increased sales, this reduced the profitability of individual franchisees in the long run as they were forced to compete with one another. For the 2003-04 fiscal year, while the parent enjoyed a 15 percent increase in second-quarter revenues, same-store sales increased only a tenth of a percent during that time. By contrast, McDonald's focused on profitability at the franchise level. Krispy Kreme also had supermarkets and gas stations carry their donuts, which soon contributed up to half of the chain's sales, creating further market saturation as well as increasing competition to its franchisees. All this expansion devalued Krispy Kreme brand's novelty, by making the once-specialty donuts ubiquitous, particularly as the newer sales outlets required pre-made donuts as opposed to the ones made fresh in factory stores, which alienated brand devotees.
Besides royalty payments from new stores, the parent company also enjoyed significant profits by requiring franchisees to purchase mix and doughnut-making equipment from the parent's Krispy Kreme Manufacturing and Distribution (KKM&D) division. KKM&D earned $152.7 million in 2003, which made up 31 percent of sales, with a reported operating margin of 20 percent or higher, but these mark-ups were largely at the expense of its franchisees. By comparison, rival chain Dunkin' Donuts generally avoids selling equipment or materials to its franchisees which "keeps company and franchisee interests aligned", as well as having a royalty stream based on same-store sales.
Krispy Kreme has been accused of channel stuffing by franchisees, whose stores reportedly "received twice their regular shipments in the final weeks of a quarter so that headquarters could make its numbers". The company was also dogged by questionable transactions and self-dealing accusations over the buybacks of franchisees, including those operated by company insiders. A report released in August 2005 singled out then-CEO Scott Livengood and then-COO John W. Tate to blame for the accounting scandals although it did not find that the executives committed intentional fraud.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/11/business/11place.html | work=The New York Times | first=Melanie | last=Warner | title=Report Details Some Failures That Hurt Krispy Kreme | date=2005-08-11[/tpl]
On March 4, 2009 the SEC issued a cease and desist order against Krispy Kreme for its actions inflating their revenues and engaging in illicit activities regarding the purchasing of its own stores to prop up revenues and setting up mechanisms to guarantee it beat earnings estimates by $0.01 which eventually resulted in Krispy Kreme reducing net income over 2 years of over $10.5 million. In it, it proposed remedial actions for Krispy Kreme to take.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2009/34-59499.pdf | title=SEC Accounting and Auditing Enforcement[/tpl]

===Management shuffle===

The company also named Steven Panagos, a managing director of Kroll Zolfo, as president and COO.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.bizjournals.com/triangle/stories/2005/01/17/daily12.html | title=Krispy Kreme CEO departs | date=2005-01-18[/tpl]

===New offerings and changes===

In 2003, a pilot project in Mountain View, California, to sell doughnuts through car windows and sunroofs at a busy intersection (with wireless payment) failed.
Although based on informal advertising such as word-of-mouth, in 2006, Krispy Kreme moved into television and radio advertisements, beginning with its "Share the Love" campaign with heart-shaped doughnuts.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11144425/|title=Krispy Kreme using TV, radio to sell treats|publisher=MSN[/tpl]
On February 19, 2007, Krispy Kreme began selling the Whole Wheat Glazed doughnut in an attempt to appeal to the health conscious. The doughnut has 84 kJ (20 kilocalories in most countries, or 20 Calories in the US) fewer than the original glazed (754 kJ vs. 837 kJ) and contains more fiber (2 grams vs. 0.5 grams). As of January 2008, the trans fat content of all Krispy Kreme doughnuts was reduced to 0.5 of a gram or less.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, in its guidelines, allows companies to round down to 0 g in its nutrition facts label even if the food contains as much as 0.5 of a gram per serving.  Krispy Kreme benefited from this regulatory rule in its subsequent advertising campaign, touting its doughnuts as "trans fat free" and having "0 grams trans fat!".[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS120625+07-Jan-2008+PRN20080107/|title=Krispy Kreme's Entire Menu: Zero Grams Trans Fat | agency=Reuters | date=2008-01-07[/tpl]
