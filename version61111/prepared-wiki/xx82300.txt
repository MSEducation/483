==Republican years==

During the Nixon Administration, Phillips headed two federal agencies, ending his Executive Branch career as director of the U.S. Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) in the Executive Office of the President for five months in 1973, a position from which he resigned when U.S. President Richard M. Nixon reneged on his commitment to veto further funding for Great Society programs begun in the administration of Nixon's predecessor, Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson.Chamberlain, John (1974-08-03) "Some Conservatives Turn Against Nixon", Milwaukee Sentinel. Retrieved 2013-05-06
Nixon's appointment of Phillips as Director of OEO in January 1973 touched off a national controversy culminating in a court case in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia (Williams v. Phillips, 482 F.2d 669) [tpl]cite web|url=http://openjurist.org/482/f2d/669/williams-v-j-phillips |title=482 F2d 669 Williams v.

==Formation of the Conservative Caucus==

Phillips left the Republican Party in 1974 after some two decades of service to the GOP as precinct worker, election warden, campaign manager, congressional aide, Boston municipal Republican chairman, and assistant to the chairman of the Republican National Committee. In 1978, Phillips finished fourth in the Democratic primary for the U.S. Senate in Massachusetts.Weber, Bruce (2013-04-23) "Howard J. Phillips, Stalwart Conservative, Dies at 72", ''The New York Times. Retrieved 2013-04-24.
In 1974, Phillips founded the Conservative Caucus, a nationwide, grass-roots public policy advocacy group.Black, Chris (1992-09-25) "Political activist loses to win Conservative takes defeats in stride in effort to build national antitax party", Boston Globe. Retrieved 2013-05-06. The group opposed the 1978 Panama Canal treaties and the Jimmy Carter-Leonid Brezhnev SALT II treaties in 1979, supported the Strategic Defense Initiative and major tax reductions during the 1980s, and fought to end Federal subsidies to activist groups under the banner of "defunding the Left."
In 1982, Phillips joined the political activist Clymer Wright of Houston, Texas, in an unsuccessful effort to convince U.S. President Ronald W. Reagan to dismiss Houston attorney James A. Baker, III, from the position of presidential chief of staff. Phillips and Wright claimed that Baker, a former Democrat and a political intimate of then Vice President George H. W. Bush, was undercutting conservative initiatives in the Reagan administration. Reagan rejected the Wright-Phillips request, and in 1985, named Baker as United States Secretary of the Treasury, at Baker's request in a job-swap with then Secretary Donald T. Regan, a former Merrill Lynch officer who became chief of staff. Reagan also rebuked Phillips and Wright for waging a "campaign of sabotage" against Baker.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/05/us/briefing-186924.html|title=Phil Gailey and Warren Weaver, Jr., "Briefing"|publisher=The New York Times, June 5, 1982|accessdate=January 27, 2011|date=June 5, 1982[/tpl]
The fight against Baker was not Phillips' first clash with Reagan. The year before in 1981, he had joined other conservatives, such as his friend, the Reverend Jerry Falwell, in opposing the nomination of Sandra Day O'Connor to the United States Supreme Court. According to Phillips, "People say you can't tell how a Supreme Court nominee will turn out once on the bench. I respectfully disagree. In most cases, it's very clear. I opposed the nomination of Sandra Day O'Connor because it was very clear that she had a pro-abortion record in the Arizona State Senate and as a judge in Arizona. She was also allied with Planned Parenthood."Flynn, Dan [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.flynnfiles.com/blog/phillips/phillips1.htm|title=Interview with Howard Phillips by Dan Flynn|publisher=Flynnfiles.com|accessdate=April 22, 2013[/tpl] In 1990, Phillips opposed the first President Bush's nomination of David Souter of New Hampshire to the high court. Phillips said that he opposed Souter because "I read his senior thesis at Harvard in which he said he was a legal positivist and one of his heroes was Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., and that he rejected all higher law theories, such as those spelled out in our Declaration of Independence. In addition, he was a trustee of two hospitals: Dartmouth Hitchcock and Concord Memorial. He successfully changed the policy of those two hospitals from zero abortion to convenience abortion."
Other Conservative Caucus campaigns have involved opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the World Trade Organization, support for a national version of California's Proposition 187 (to end mandated subsidies for illegal aliens), as well as continuing efforts to oppose publicly funded health care, abortion and gay rights. Phillips was the host of Conservative Roundtable, a weekly public affairs television program.

==Role in formation of the New Right==

Phillips played an instrumental role in the leadership of the New Right, and in the founding of the religious right the 1970s. He worked with fellow conservatives Paul Weyrich of the Heritage Foundation and both former Christian Voice (United States) co-activists Richard Viguerie and Terry Dolan to pursade the Reverend Jerry Falwell form the Moral Majority, and helped Judie Brown form the American Life League.

==U.S. Taxpayers Party/Constitution Party==

Phillips was one of the founders of the U.S. Taxpayers Party (which changed its name to the Constitution Party in 1999), a third party associated with conservative,  pro-life issues, and constitutional government ideas on both social and fiscal issues.
