The Domesday Book of 1086 lists Hatherop as Etherope,[tpl]cite web |title= Hatherop |work= Domesday Book |publisher= The National Archives |year= 1086 |url= http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/details-result.asp?Edoc_Id=7577466&queryType=1&resultcount=1 |accessdate=29 May 2008[/tpl] derived from the Old English hēah and throp meaning "high outlying farmstead".Mills, 1998, page 170
The village and parish adjoin the parkland of Williamstrip, a 17th-century country house that was the seat of Michael Hicks Beach, the first Earl St Aldwyn.Hall, 1993, page 83Bentley, 1999, pages 268
Hatherop Castle dates from the sixteenth or seventeenth century, but was partly rebuilt by the architect Henry Clutton for Baron de Mauley in 1850–56.Verey, 1970, page 270  The building is now a school.  Clutton also rebuilt the Church of England parish church of Saint Nicholas for the same client in 1854–55.
The architect and builder Richard Pace built Severalls as a rectory for the parish in 1833.Verey, 1970, page 272 Letchmere, a set of cottages built in 1856, was later converted into a rectory and Severalls became a private house.
The [tpl]convert|3850|acre|adj=on[/tpl] Hatherop Estate was acquired by the trustees of the Ernest Cook Trust in 2002 from the Bazley family, who had owned the estate for more than 130 years.
Following the death of Sir Thomas Bazley in 1996, his children were very keen to retain the community of the estate and avoid breaking it up. They said at the time: "One of the main factors in our decision to sell the estate to the Ernest Cook Trust is our wish to preserve the estate for future generations. We feel that selling to the Ernest Cook Trust is the best way to maintain its special character, as well as retaining the unspoilt nature of the villages of Eastleach and Hatherop, which our father valued so much."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ernestcooktrust.org.uk/estates/glos/hatherop.html |title=Hatherop and the Ernest Cook Trust |publisher=Ernest Cook Trust |accessdate=8 December 2010[/tpl]
