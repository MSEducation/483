Genderqueer (GQ; alternatively non-binary) is a catch-all category for gender identities other than man and woman, thus outside of the gender binary and cisnormativity.[tpl]cite book |title=North American Lexicon of Transgender Terms |editor-last=Usher |editor-first=Raven |year=2006 |publisher= |location=San Francisco |isbn= 9781879194625 |oclc=184841392 |page= |pages=[/tpl] Genderqueer people may identify as one or more of the following:

Many genderqueer people see gender and sex as separable aspects of a person and sometimes identify as a male woman, a female man, or a male/female/intersex genderqueer person.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Walsh |first1=Reuben |date=December 2010 |title=More T, vicar?

As such, genderqueer people may have a variety of sexual orientations, as with transgender and cisgender people.[tpl]cite book |title=Transgender History |last=Stryker |first=Susan |authorlink=Susan Stryker |year=2008 |publisher=Seal Press |location=Berkeley |isbn=9781580052245 |oclc=183914566 |page= |pages=[/tpl]
In addition to being an umbrella term, genderqueer has been used as an adjective to refer to any people who transgress distinctions of gender, regardless of their self-defined gender identity, i.e. those who "queer" gender, expressing it non-normatively.[tpl]cite journal |last=Dahir |first=Mubarak |date=25 May 1999 |title=Whose Movement Is It? |journal=The Advocate |volume= |issue= |page=52 |publisher=Here Media[/tpl] Androgynous is frequently used as a descriptive term for people in this category, though genderqueer people may express a combination of masculinity and femininity, or neither, in their gender expression and not all identify as androgynous. However, the term has been applied by those describing what they see as a gender ambiguity.[tpl]cite book |title=Transgender Voices: Beyond Women and Men |last=Girshick |first=Lori B. |year=2008 |publisher=University Press of New England |location=Hanover |isbn=9781584656456 |oclc=183162406 |page= |pages=[/tpl]

== Gender terms==

Some genderqueer people prefer to use gender-neutral pronouns such as one, ze, sie, hir, co, ey or singular "they", "their" and "them", while others prefer the conventional binary pronouns "her" or "him". Some genderqueer people prefer to be referred to alternately as he and she (and/or gender neutral pronouns), and some prefer to use only their name and not use pronouns at all.[tpl]cite book |last=Feinberg |first=Leslie |authorlink=Leslie Feinberg |title=Transgender Warriors: Making History from Joan of Arc to Dennis Rodman |publisher=Beacon Press |location=Boston |year=1996 |isbn=9780807079409 |oclc=33014093[/tpl]
Many genderqueer people prefer additional neutral language, such as the title "Mx" instead of Mr or Ms.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.lesbilicious.co.uk/non-gendered-titles-see-increased-recognition/ |title=Non-gendered titles see increased recognition |author=Ruth Pearce |date=July 21, 2011 |work=Lesbilicious |accessdate=29 August 2012[/tpl]
In July 2012, Gopi Shankar, a gender activist and a student at The American College in Madurai coined the regional terms for genderqueer people in Tamil during Asia's first genderqueer Pride Parade. According to Shankar, Tamil is the only language besides English that has been given names for all the genders identified so far.[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-06-04/madurai/39739581_1_genders-book-tamil-nadu |title=Madurai student pens book on gender variants |publisher=The Times of India |date=2013-06-04 |accessdate=2013-06-16[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/article3702689.ece |title=Cities / Madurai : Madurai comes out of the closet |publisher=The Hindu |date=2012-07-30 |accessdate=2012-10-10 |location=Chennai, India |first=D. |last=Karthikeyan[/tpl][tpl]cite news|author=A.

===Australia===

First reported in January 2003, Australians can use "X" as their gender. Alex MacFarlane is believed to be the first person in Australia to obtain a birth certificate recording sex as indeterminate, and the first Australian passport with an 'X' sex marker in 2003."X marks the spot for intersex Alex", West Australian, via bodieslikeours.org. 11 January 2003"Ingrid Holme, "Hearing People's Own Stories", in Science as Culture, Volume 17, Issue 3, 2008""Neither man nor woman", Sydney Morning Herald. 27 June 2010Newsletter of the Sociology of Sexualities Section of the American Sociological Association, American Sociological Association Sexualities News, Volume 6, Issue 1, Summer 2003Ten years of ‘X’ passports, and no protection from discrimination, Organisation Intersex International (OII) Australia, 19 January 2013 This is stated by the West Australian to be on the basis of a challenge by MacFarlane, using an indeterminate birth certificate issued by the State of Victoria. The West Australian newspaper reported in January 2003 that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade "had decided to accommodate people whose birth certificates recorded their sex as indeterminate ... Alex is also believed to be the first Australian issued with a birth certificate acknowledging a gender other than male or female. Alex's says “indeterminate - also known as intersex”. It was issued in Alex's birth State of Victoria, which unlike WA, changed its policy to allow the category".
Government policy between 2003 and 2011 was to issue passports with an 'X' marker only to people who could "present a birth certificate that notes their sex as indeterminate".Sex Files: the legal recognition of sex in documents and government records. Concluding paper of the sex and gender diversity project (2009), Australian Human Rights Commission, March 2009.
In 2011, the Australian Passport Office introduced new guidelines for issuing of passports with a new gender, and broadened availability of an X descriptor to all individuals with documented "indeterminate" sex.[tpl]cite news|title=Getting a passport made easier for sex and gender diverse people|url=http://foreignminister.gov.au/releases/2011/kr_mr_110914b.html|accessdate=23 December 2011|newspaper=The Hon Kevin Rudd MP|date=14 September 2011[/tpl]On Australian passports and “X” for sex, Organisation Intersex International (OII) Australia, 9 October 2011 The revised policy stated that "sex reassignment surgery is not a prerequisite to issue a passport in a new gender.

Australian Commonwealth guidelines on the recognition of sex and gender, published in June 2013, now extend the use of an 'X' gender marker to any adult who chooses that option, in all dealings with the Commonwealth government and its agencies. The option is being introduced over a three year period. The guidelines also clarify that the federal government collects data on gender, rather than sex.Australian Government Attorney General's Department, June 2013, "Australian Government Guidelines on the Recognition of Sex and Gender"
Also in 2013, people with non-binary gender identities received formal protection from discrimination, with the addition of a new attribute "gender identity" to anti-discrimination law.On the historic passing of the Sex Discrimination Amendment (Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Intersex Status) Act 2013, OII Australia, 25 June 2013LGBTI groups welcome the passage of “historic” national discrimination laws, OII Australia, NSW Gay and Lesbian Rights Lobby, Transgender Victoria, A Gender Agenda, Victorian Gay and Lesbian Rights Lobby, 26 June 2013
