"Punky Reggae Party" is a reggae song by Bob Marley, recorded and released in 1977. Not appearing on any studio album, it was released in 1977 as a 12-inch single in Jamaica only on the Tuff Gong and Black Art labels, as a b-side to the "Jamming" single on the Island label in some countries and was later released as a live single on Babylon by Bus. Subsequently, it appeared on a number of compilations and 'Best of' albums as well as the Deluxe Edition of Exodus and the 2002 CD reissue of Legend. The two versions of the song on the Jamaican 12-inch single were both featured on disc 2 of the Deluxe Edition of Exodus. The version featured on the 2002 CD reissue of Legend is the b-side version from the "Jamming" 12-inch single. There is also a version of the song released as a b-side on the "Jamming" 7-inch single which is much shorter.
The song was written by Bob Marley as a positive response to the release of a cover version of Junior Murvin's "Police and Thieves" by English punk band The Clash, on their first LP. Referring to the party of the title of the song, the lyrics mention several punk and reggae groups: "The Wailers will be there, The Damned, The Jam, The Clash â€“ Maytals will be there, Dr. Feelgood too", Marley often repeated the words "New Wave" during the song.
Sly Dunbar played drums on this track. The drum track was recorded at Joe Gibbs studio.[tpl]cite web|last=Raver|first=Midnight|title=Ten Things You Did Not Know About Sly and Robbie|url=http://midnightraverblog.com/2013/12/24/sly-and-robbie/|publisher=Midnight Raver Blog|accessdate=4 January 2014[/tpl] 
The song was referred to in the Sublime song "Garden Grove" and the Robyn Hitchcock song "Antwoman."
In 2012, a band called Island Head released an instrumental version of "Punky Reggae Party".  Their version of the song features guitar, synthesizers, saxophone and trumpet instead of vocals.  Island Head (a.k.a. Island Head Musicians), led by drummer/producer Billy Messinetti, also released an album by the same title.
