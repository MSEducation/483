[tpl]nihongo|France Five|フランスファイブ|Furansu Faibu[/tpl], originally titled [tpl]nihongo|Jūshi Sentai France Five|銃士戦隊フランスファイブ|Jūshi Sentai Furansu Faibu|translated as Musketeers Squadron France Five[/tpl] and later known as [tpl]nihongo|Shin Kenjūshi France Five|新剣銃士フランスファイブ|Shin Kenjūshi Furansu Faibu|translated as New Sword Musketeers France Five[/tpl], is a French series produced by Buki X-4 Productions in the 2000s (decade). It is an homage to Toei's ever-popular Super Sentai series, which was extremely popular in France in the 1980s. As a nod to Super Sentai titles having certain motifs, France Five has each member themed after certain aspects of French culture.
There have been four half-hour episodes of France Five produced. The fifth episode aired on May 5, 2012 during a projection in Paris, and will premiere in June for Japan and the French television, Nolife, created by the creators of France Five. The episode includes a preview of the sixth and final episode.
This series is said to be a nod to another Sentai pastiche, Aikoku Sentai Dai-Nippon (Patriot Squadron Great Japan) (1982) by Daicon Films (now Gainax).
Interestingly, the series has become somewhat popular in Japan as well, with singer Akira Kushida singing an original theme for the series starting with episode 4. Prior to that point, the themes were French remixes of older Sentai theme songs (Choujin Sentai Jetman and Choudenshi Bioman) as well as an original French theme.

==Story==

Glou Man Chou, ruler of the Lexos Empire, desires to conquer planet Earth. However, the Eiffel Tower generates a barrier around the planet that keeps him from sending his armies en masse. Glou Man Chou sends his warriors and monsters to Earth in order to destroy the tower and enable a full scale invasion, but they are opposed by France Five.
In the fourth episode, the shield is disabled and Lexos's army is shown prepared to invade the planet. Professor Burgone is captured and France Five go in hiding. In episode 5, France Five reappear to battle Lexos, but they are overpowered by Zakaral and his generals. After being freed from captivity by France Five and his robot assistant Margarine, Professor Burgonde initiates a top-secret program in France Five's system as a last-ditch effort to save them.
