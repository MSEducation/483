George Louis Costanza  is a character in the American television sitcom Seinfeld (1989–1998), played by Jason Alexander. He has variously been described as a "short, stocky, slow-witted, bald man" (by Elaine Benes and Costanza himself), and "Lord of the Idiots" (by Costanza himself). George and Jerry were high school friends and remained friends after.Ricky Gervais' Top 10 TV SitcomsDiary by Marina Hyde, The Guardian He is friends with Jerry Seinfeld, Cosmo Kramer, and Elaine Benes. George appears in every episode except for "The Pen" (third season). The character was originally based on Seinfeld co-creator Larry David, but surnamed after Jerry Seinfeld's real-life New York friend, Mike Costanza.
Alexander reprised his role in an episode of Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee, reuniting with Jerry Seinfeld and Wayne Knight (also reprising their roles as Jerry and Newman, respectively).

==Early life and family==

George is the son of Frank Costanza (Jerry Stiller) and Estelle Costanza (Estelle Harris). Though he never made an appearance on the show, George has mentioned twice that he has a brother. Lloyd Braun is his childhood nemesis who George feels was the son his parents always wanted.[tpl]cite episode|title=The Parking Space|episodelink=The_Parking_Space|series=Seinfeld|serieslink=Seinfeld|airdate=April 22, 1992|credits=Writer: Daniels, Greg; David, Larry; Director: Cherones, Tom|network=NBC|season=3|number=22[/tpl][tpl]cite episode|title=The Suicide|episodelink=The Suicide (Seinfeld)|series=Seinfeld|serieslink=Seinfeld|airdate=January 29, 1992|credits=Writer: Leopold, Tom; Director: Cherones, Tom|network=NBC|season=3|number=15[/tpl] George's best friend Jerry Seinfeld (Jerry Seinfeld) described Frank and Estelle as "psychopaths",[tpl]cite episode|title=The Puffy Shirt|episodelink=The_Puffy_Shirt|series=Seinfeld|serieslink=Seinfeld|airdate=September 23, 1993|credits=Writer: David, Larry; Director: Cherones, Tom|network=NBC|season=5|number=2[/tpl] and said in "The Chinese Woman" that, if they had divorced when George was young, he "could have been normal".[tpl]cite episode|title=The Chinese Woman|episodelink=The_Chinese_Woman|series=Seinfeld|serieslink=Seinfeld|airdate=October 13, 1994|credits=Writer: Mehlman, Tom; Director: Ackerman, Andy|network=NBC|season=6|number=4[/tpl] George also describes himself (and by implication his many neuroses) as the result of his parents having stayed together.[tpl]cite episode|title=The Shoes|episodelink=The Shoes (Seinfeld)|series=Seinfeld|serieslink=Seinfeld|airdate=February 4, 1993|credits=Writer: Seinfeld, Jerry; David, Larry; Director: Cherones, Tom|network=NBC|season=4|number=16[/tpl]

==Personality==

George is neurotic, self-loathing, and dominated by his parents. Throughout Seinfeld[tpl]'[/tpl]s first season, George was portrayed as a moderately intellectual character – at one point, he mentions an intellectual interest in the American Civil War and, in some early episodes, appears almost as a mentor to Jerry – but becomes less sophisticated, to the point of being too lazy even to read a 90-page book (Breakfast at Tiffany's), preferring to watch the movie adaptation at a stranger's house instead. However, one Chicago Tribune reviewer noted that, despite all of his shortcomings, George is "pretty content with himself".[tpl]cite news|title=The 25 Greatest TV Characters of all Time|work=Chicago Tribune|date=December 6, 1995|author=Artner, Alan; Bannon, Tim; Caro, Mark; Christiansen, Richard; Griffin, Jean Latz; Johnson, Steve; May, Mitchell; Nidetz, Steve; Wood, Nancy Watkins; Wilson, Terry; Wiltz, Teresa|page=1[/tpl]
George exhibits a number of negative character traits, among them stinginess, selfishness, dishonesty, insecurity, and neurosis. Many of these traits stem from a dysfunctional childhood with his squabbling parents Frank and Estelle, and often form the basis of his involvement in various plots, schemes, and awkward social encounters. Episode plots frequently feature George manufacturing elaborate deceptions at work or in his relationships in order to gain or maintain some small or imagined advantage or (pretend) image of success. He had success in "The Opposite", in which he begins (with Jerry's encouragement) to do the complete opposite of what his instincts tell him to do, which results in him getting a girlfriend and a job with the New York Yankees. His neurosis is also evident in the episode "The Note", where he starts having doubts on his sexual orientation after receiving a massage from a male masseur.
George sometimes refers to himself in the third person (for example, "George is getting UPSET!"), after befriending a person with a similar trait in "The Jimmy."
George's occasional impulsive bouts often get him into trouble, such as when he flees a burning kitchen, knocking over several children and an elderly woman in the process, so he could escape first during his girlfriend's son's birthday party in "The Fire". However, there are moments where George exhibits remarkable courage, but usually accidentally and usually because of inane lies which have brought him trouble. For instance, in "The Marine Biologist", he goes into the ocean alone to save a beached whale because his date, a woman he had a crush on in college, thinks he is a marine biologist and even tells her the truth about his occupation after he saves the day. Sadly, this causes her to reject him immediately, and he is forced to take the bus home.
George often goes to impressive measures to build and maintain his relationships with women. In “The Conversion”, he goes through the process of converting to the Latvian Orthodox religion as his girlfriend’s parents would not allow her to date someone who is not Latvian Orthodox. Also, in “The Susie” he desires to make a grand entrance at his work’s ball with his attractive girlfriend Allison; however upon finding out that she plans to break up with him, George does everything in his power to avoid breaking up with her before the ball, such as screening his phone calls, stating "If she can't find me, she can't break up with me.” Ultimately though, the one relationship he holds long-term, with his fiancé Susan is the one he is not overly enthusiastic about, as shown by his hopes to postpone their wedding, and his rather calm reaction when she passes away.
George aligns with both Elaine and Kramer in some episodes, but is also frequently pitted against them. With Elaine, while he does get into arguments with her, they also work together, most notably in the episode "The Cadillac", although George states in "The Dinner Party" that he is frightened of Elaine. George and Kramer usually feel awkward around each other, but started working together (and against each other) in episodes "The Busboy", "The Stall", and "The Slicer". "The Susie" is the only episode in which their relationship is as prominent as the relationships between the other characters. Some episodes, such as "The Raincoats", "The Money", "The Doorman", and "The Fusilli Jerry", would suggest that Kramer has a more comfortable rapport with George's parents than with George.
He has an affinity for nice restrooms and lush work facilities. In "The Revenge", he quits his real estate job solely because he is forbidden to use his boss's private bathroom. In "The Busboy", he claims to have an encyclopedic knowledge of the locations of the best bathrooms in the city. He proves this in "The Bizarro Jerry" when he directs Kramer to "the best bathroom in midtown" at the offices of Brand/Leland, even describing the layout, marble, high ceiling and toilets that flush "like a jet engine".  When working for the Yankees, he suggested having the bathroom stall doors stretched all the way to the floor (allowing people's legs not to be seen while in the stalls), and, in many episodes, he shows a fascination with toilet paper and its history. He also displays a fear of diseases, such as lupus and cancer. In "The Wife", George gets into trouble for urinating in the shower at a gym but defends his action with, "It's all pipes! What's the difference?" even threatening to call a plumber to back him up.  
Although occasionally referred to as dumb by his friends, many signs point to the fact that George is actually quite an intelligent man despite his neurotic behavior. George's foolishness is displayed in the episode, "The Cafe", in which George had to take an IQ test and had Elaine take it for him. Apparently, George's neurotic stupidity would progress until it became one of his primary characteristics. By the season six episode "The Couch", he could not even concentrate enough to read a 90-page book (Breakfast at Tiffany's). In "The Abstinence", it is discovered that George actually has what would appear to be genius-level intelligence, but that he can never access it because his mind is always so completely focused on sex. When circumstances allow him to temporarily remove sex from his mind, he is able to reach his true intellectual potential, solving a Rubik's Cube, answering a string of questions on Jeopardy, and giving Derek Jeter and Bernie Williams pointers on hitting based on Newtonian physics.
George and Jerry have been best friends since meeting in high school gym class. The extreme closeness of their friendship is occasionally mistaken for homosexuality. "The Outing" deals with a reporter from a New York University college paper mistaking Jerry and George for a homosexual couple, and, in "The Cartoon", George dates someone whom Kramer insists is merely a "female Jerry". When George is forced to note to himself that the idea of a female Jerry with whom he can have a close personal relationship and also a sexual relationship would be everything he has ever wanted, George, in horror, breaks off his relationship with the woman.

==Development==

Seinfeld co-creator Larry David based George largely on himself.[tpl]cite video|title=Seinfeld Seasons 1 & 2: Notes about Nothing – "The Seinfeld Chronicles"|medium=DVD|publisher=Sony Pictures Home Entertainment[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2004/oct/16/comedy.television|work=The Guardian|author=Davies, Dan|title=Unhappy as Larry|date=October 16, 2004|quote=Spotters will know that Jason Alexander's character in Seinfeld, the stooge George Costanza, is largely based on the real Larry David|accessdate=August 3, 2009[/tpl] Seinfeld and David created the character as a counterpoint to Seinfeld's character.[tpl]cite video|title=Seinfeld Seasons 1 & 2: How it Began: The Making of Seinfeld, Part 1|medium=DVD|publisher=Sony Pictures Home Entertainment[/tpl] In the first draft of the show's pilot script, called "Stand-Up" at the time, George's name was Bennett and he, like Jerry, was a comedian. In that same draft, the scene in the pilot in which George and Jerry discuss a woman Jerry met earlier, saw George and Jerry discussing their stand-up act. This idea however, was quickly abandoned and his name was changed to George, the real estate broker instead. George's last name comes from Michael Costanza, a college classmate of Seinfeld.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/1998/05/04/1998-05-04_seinfeld_book_by_real_charac.html|title=Seinfeld Book by Real Character|work=New York Daily News|author=Tuma, Debbie|date=May 4, 1998|accessdate=August 3, 2009[/tpl] "Louis", George's middle name is a homage to Lou Costello, whose 1950s television series The Abbott and Costello Show, inspired Seinfeld[tpl]'[/tpl]s writing style.[tpl]cite video|title=Seinfeld Season 3: Notes about Nothing – "The Truth"|medium=DVD|publisher=Sony Pictures Home Entertainment[/tpl] Though he is often asked if he wanted to play the character, Larry David has said that he was only interested in writing the show, that, not only did he not want to act on the show, but it had never occurred to him and, even if it had, he highly doubted that NBC would have approved of his being cast.
Casting director Marc Herschfield stated that, during casting for the character, "we saw every actor we could possibly see in Los Angeles", but they could not find the right actor for the part. Among the auditionees were Nathan Lane, Steve Buscemi, David Alan Grier, Brad Hall and Larry Miller.[tpl]cite news|title='Seinfeld' boxed sets: Much ado about 'nothing'|work=The Star-Ledger|date=November 22, 2004|author=Sepinwall, Alan[/tpl] On April 3, 1989, Herschfield sent a partial script to Jason Alexander, who was in New York City at the time. Herschfield had met Alexander when he was working on the CBS sitcom E/R. Alexander enjoyed the script and felt it read like a Woody Allen film; therefore, he did a Woody Allen impression on his audition tape, and bought a pair of glasses to better resemble the character.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,299753,00.html|title="Bye" George|work=Entertainment Weekly|author=Meyers, Kate|date=December 1, 1995|accessdate=August 3, 2009[/tpl] Though Alexander thought his audition was "a complete waste of time", both David and Seinfeld were impressed; Seinfeld stated "the second we saw him, like two lines out of his mouth, we went 'That's the guy'". On April 10, 1989 at 9:00 A.M. Alexander did his first official audition and met David and Seinfeld. While in the waiting room for his final audition, Alexander saw that Larry Miller was also auditioning. Alexander was aware that Miller and Seinfeld were very good friends, and so figured that he would not get the part. After his final audition he returned to New York City, and when he landed he received a phone call informing him that he was hired.
Many of George's predicaments were based on David's past real-life experiences. In "The Revenge", for example, when George quits his job in a fury only to realize he has made a mistake, he goes back the next day as if nothing happened; this mirrors David's actions while working as a writer for Saturday Night Live, when he quit and then returned to his job in the same manner.  As the show progressed, Alexander discovered that the character was based on David. As Alexander explains in an interview for the Seinfeld DVD, during an early conversation with David, Alexander questioned a script, saying, "This could never happen to anyone, and even if it did, no human being would react like this." David replied, "What do you mean? This happened to me once, and this is exactly how I reacted!" After that, Alexander changed his performance from an imitation of Woody Allen to what he has called a "shameless imitation of Larry David."
In 1998, Michael Costanza sued the show for US$100,000,000, claiming that he never gave permission for his name to be used and that, because of the character's appearance and behavior, he was not treated with respect.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/202228.stm|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|title=Entertainment: No joke: Seinfeld sued by 'real-life Costanza'|date= October 27, 1998|accessdate=August 3, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,15451,00.html?iid=digg_share|work=TIME|author=Silverman, Stephen|date=October 27, 1998|title=Seinfeld Sued for $100 Million|accessdate=August 3, 2009[/tpl] Costanza lost the suit, as the New York Supreme Court (the trial court in the State of New York court system) unanimously decided that Seinfeld and David "did not violate Michael Costanza's privacy rights when they created the character".[tpl]cite news|title=Morning Report; Arts and Entertainment Reports from the Times, News Services and the Nation's Press|author=Margulies, Lee|date=January 6, 2001|page=F2|work=Los Angeles Times[/tpl]

==Family and background==

===Susan===

George becomes engaged to Susan Biddle Ross, a wealthy executive at NBC who approved Jerry and George's show-within-a-show sitcom pilot. George and Susan date for a year, during which time the commitment-phobic George is constantly trying to find ways to end their relationship without actually having to initiate the breakup with her. In "The Engagement", he proposes to her in a short-lived bout of midlife crisis, after he and Jerry make a pact to move forward with their lives. When Jerry breaks up with his girlfriend almost immediately thereafter for eating "her peas one at a time" and declares the deal over, George panics and again tries repeatedly to weasel out of his engagement. He gets his wish about two weeks before the wedding in "The Invitations", when he inadvertently causes her death by selecting cheap envelopes for their wedding invitations, not knowing they contained toxic glue. When notified of her death at the hospital, George displays a combination of shock, apathy, and relief (described by the doctor in part two of The Finale as "restrained jubilation"). A few moments after being notified of Susan's passing, he says to Jerry, Kramer, and Elaine, "Well, let's go get some coffee." Susan's parents, recent divorcees, never knowing the specifics behind her poisoning but suspecting that George was somehow involved, never forgive him for this, and they appoint him to the board of directors of the Susan Ross Foundation to keep him trapped under their influence and to ensure that he would never get any of Susan's inheritance.

===Relationships===

George is very bad at picking up women and his relationships usually end badly.[tpl]cite news|title=By George, it's Costanza's fault|page=2|author=Lavin, Cheryl|date=March 5, 2004|work=Chicago Tribune|location=Chicago, Illinois[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/i-want-to-be-larry-david-415155.html|title=I want to be Larry David|date=September 10, 2006|work=The Independent|accessdate=August 4, 2009[/tpl] George also dated other women throughout the series: 
In the season 7 Curb Your Enthusiasm episode "Seinfeld", George has married (and divorced) a woman named Amanda in the time since the finale. It is unclear, however, if these events are considered canon in the Seinfeld series.

===Professional life===

George's professional life is unstable. He is unable to remain in any job for any great length of time before making an embarrassing blunder and getting fired, and he is unemployed for a large amount of time throughout the series. Very often, the blunder is lying and trying to cover it up, only to have it all fall apart.
Over the course of the series, he works for a real estate transaction services firm (Rick Bahr Properties), a rest stop supply company (Sanalac), Elaine's company (Pendant Publishing), the New York Yankees (his longest running job), a playground-equipment company (Play Now), an industrial smoothing company (Kruger Industrial Smoothing), and other places. He is fired from his job at Pendant Publishing for having sex with the cleaning woman on his desk in "The Red Dot" (he professes he has always been attracted to cleaning women).
His original job when the series starts is as a real estate agent; he ends up quitting and getting re-hired, but fired immediately afterward for drugging his boss. He always wanted to be an architect; he first desires to be one in "The Stake Out", and he claims in "The Race" that he had designed "the new addition to the Guggenheim". In "The Van Buren Boys", he denies his young protégé a scholarship from the Susan Ross Foundation when the young man decides he no longer wants to be an architect and wants to become a city planner instead. In "The Marine Biologist", Jerry tells a woman whom George wanted to impress that George is a marine biologist. The plan backfires when George is called upon to save a beached whale with a Titleist golf ball in its blowhole. He saves the whale, but the woman tells him off when he confesses that he is not, in fact, a marine biologist: "She told me to go to hell, and I took the bus home." He then gets a job working for the Yankees, where he frequently encounters a fictionalized version of Yankees owner George Steinbrenner.
During the fourth season of the series, George gains experience as a sitcom writer as he helps Jerry to write the pilot for the fictitious show Jerry. While pitching the concept of a "show about nothing" to NBC executives, George dates executive Susan until The Virgin, when she is fired. Following the first and last episode ("The Pilot"), executive Russell's obsession with Elaine has cost George and Jerry a shot at getting a TV series.

===Fashion and hairstyle===

George is known for his balding hair, which is not as noticeable in the pilot episode "The Seinfeld Chronicles" or a flashback in "The Slicer", but gets thinner as the series progresses. In "The Beard", he begins to wear a toupee, until Elaine throws it out the window in disgust. He also attempts to restore his hair in "The Tape", when he begins using a Chinese cream that is said to be such a great cure for baldness that it will make him "look like Stalin". His hair is rarely seen styled. His clothes are usually very plain. He frequently wears jeans. In "The Pilot", George wears sweatpants; Jerry says that this makes George look like he has given up on life. In "The Subway", when his clothes are taken, he goes to the coffee shop with a blanket, causing a bystander to mistake him for a Hare Krishna. In "The Muffin Tops", he steals clothes from a tourist who asks him to watch his suitcase. "The Gum" has him dressed as Henry the Eighth, which, along with a far too small tuxedo in "The Opera", are the only times he is seen entirely apart from his drab attire. George has, however, mentioned that his clothing is color-coded based on his mood. In "The Trip", Jerry asks him what mood he is in, and George replies, "Morning mist". Several times throughout the show, George mentions a desire to "drape" himself in velvet (if only it were socially acceptable), which he does in "The Doodle". In the episode "The Bizarro Jerry", George can be seen styling his hair based on an Andy Sipowicz (Dennis Franz) poster.[ref]
http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&ep=710[/ref] His clothing on the show was usually a size too small for him, as opposed to Kramer, whose clothes were usually a size too big.
