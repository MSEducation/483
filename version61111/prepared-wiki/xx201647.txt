The Owl, also known as La Chouette,[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.studiohari.com/|title=STUDIO HARI production audiovisuelle animation 2D 3D[/tpl] is a series of short CGI-animated episodes for children's television. The series features the eponymous owl, pink in colour, and with blue feet that "float" below her body. Each of the minute-long fifty-two episodes centres on the owl attempting to overcome unfortunate circumstances (sometimes created by her negative attitude and antisocial behavior), but end in her demise by her various appendages and body being dispensed of in unusual or comical  ways. The series also feature a surrealistic world with floating objects and exploding apples.
