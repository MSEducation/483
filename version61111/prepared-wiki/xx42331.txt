Due to its proximity to the sea, Parañaque is one of the major trade and business centers in the Philippines.

==Etymology==

There are several accounts as to how Parañaque got its name. One such story stated that long ago, at the mouth of what is now known as the Parañaque River, there stood a balete tree that, when viewed from afar, looked like a majestic ship. This earned it the name Palanyag, taken from the term "palayag", which means “point of navigation”.[tpl]cite source |authors=Baybay, D. F. & Marquez-De Guzman, A. |title=Palanyag to Parañaque: A History |url=http://paranaque.gov.ph/history/ |publisher=City of Parañaque |year=2001 |accessdate=25 April 2014|date=April 2014[/tpl] 
Another version of the story was that, before the Spanish colonizers came to the Philippines, there were some natives who lived close to the Manila Bay whose main livelihood was fishing or paglalayag. On the other hand, the neighboring place from the east called Muntinlupa had rice farmers who were referred to as taga-Palayan. One day, the fishermen and rice farmers had a feast and many got drunk from tuba or fermented coconut wine. One farmer suggested that they should name the whole place Palayan as a sign of cooperation and goodwill between them. However, a fisherman protested and stated that they should name it Palalayag instead. As a compromise, they agreed to merge these two words and came up with Palalanyag. However, another drunken guest shouted, “Mabuhay ang Palanyag at ang mga taga-Palanyag!” The rest liked this word better and ever since then, the place was called Palanyag.
In another story handed down to generations, when the Philippines was conquered by the Spaniards, some soldiers riding a horse-drawn carriage asked to be taken to a certain place. However, the coachman did not understand the Spanish soldier’s pronunciation. When they arrived, one of the soldiers said, “Para aqui, Para aqui” meaning, “Stop here, stop here.” The coachman did not understand and kept going whereas the soldier also repeated his instruction, “Para aqui, Para aqui”. The coachman left the carriage and told the townspeople that, “These Spaniards are repeatedly saying para aniya ake… para aniya ake” to which the townspeople just laughed. The incident circulated and was repeated around for days and the term Para Aniya Ake stuck.

==History==

===Early history===

Due their proximity to the sea, the early Paraqueños traded with the Chinese, Japanese, Indonesians, Indians and Malays. Traditional livelihoods included salt-making, fishing, planting rice, shoemaking, slipper-making and weaving.

===Spanish occupation===

Parañaque was officially founded in 1572 by the Augustinian Missionaries from Spain. Early records began in 1580 when Fr. Diego de Espiñar, an Augustinian missionary, was appointed Prior of the town convent. As resident priest, he established the mission house there, with its spiritual jurisdiction reaching up to Kawit in the province of Cavite. The Council of the Definitors (a conference of chiefs of the religious orders) held on 11 May 1580 accepted Palanyag, as Parañaque was then known, as an independent town. The image of Palanyag's patroness, Nuestra Señora del Buen Suceso, was brought to St. Andrew's Church in La Huerta in 1580. Nuestra Señora del Buen Suceso is the third oldest Marian Image in the Philippines.
Early Spanish census dated 1591 to 1593 also mentioned Longalo (or Dongalo) and Parañaque as two villages along Manila Bay composed of some 800 tribute-payers. Politically, Dongalo and Parañaque were then under the Provincia de Tondo. The community was headed by cabezas de barangay, a Westernized version of datus (chieftains), and the principalia, the local aristocrats, who together justified and moderated the demands of the Spanish colonizers. Education was limited to the principalia as they were the only ones who could afford it.
Historical accounts state that the town's strategic location enabled the townspeople to play an important role in Philippine history. Palanyag was located at the crossroads of Manila, between the provinces of Cavite and Batangas. In 1574 during the invasion of the town by the Chinese pirate Limahong, Parañaquenos, particularly those from Barangay Dongalo, heroically aided in preventing the attack in Manila. This incident became known as the "Red Sea Incident" due to the blood that flowed through the sacrifice of the people of barrio Sta. Monica. With the arrival of Spanish forces led by Captain Juan de Salcedo from Ilocos, Limahong was finally repulsed and the occupation of the town was prevented.
When the British invaded Manila in 1762, the townspeople once again remained loyal to the Spanish colonizers, especially the Augustinians. The invasion however showed that the Spaniards was not invincible and that their rule was not to be permanent. More than a hundred years later, this would prove to be true. During the Philippine Revolution of 1896-1898, the Spaniards realized that the town was a practical gateway to Cavite, the bastion of the revolutionary Katipuneros. Conversely, the Katipuneros based in Cavite saw the town as their gateway to Intramuros, the Spanish seat of government in Manila. Prominent Paraqueños such as Manuel Quiogue and secular priest Father Pedro Dandan became leading revolutionary figures.

===American occupation===

During the American occupation of the Philippines, Parañaque became one of the first municipalities in the Metro Manila region.

===World War II===

During the Japanese occupation of the Philippines in World War II, Parañaque supplied leadership to guerilla movements such as the ROTC Hunters, as well as food and arms. Parañaque was one of the first towns to be liberated and its guerillas helped pave the way for the combined American and Philippine Commonwealth forces to enter the south of Manila. As can be gleaned from the above, Parañaque has played and continues to play a strategic role in the Philippines' political and economic progress.
After the liberation and the Battle of Parañaque on 1945 by combined Filipino and American ground troops with local recognized guerrillas, the general headquarters of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and Philippine Constabulary was rebuild and stationed in Parañaque after the war.

===Martial law===

On 21 August 1983 during the authoritarian regime of Ferdinand Marcos, Benigno Aquino, Jr. (a prominent opposition senator and husband of former Philippine President Corazon Aquino), was assassinated in Manila International Airport (now Ninoy Aquino International Airport).

===Parañaque today===

Today, Parañaque is a blossoming city. Due to its strategic location, it is an important centre for trade and business in Metro Manila. Baclaran, where a large number of dry goods stores are located, is one of the busiest markets in the country. Small fishing villages called “fisherman’s wharves” are also situated alongside Barangay La Huerta, where the famous DAMPA, a seaside market with numerous restaurants serving fresh seafood, is found. The country’s international airport as well as the Baclaran Church, one of the most active parishes in Manila, and the Duty Free, where one can buy imported goods, can be found here.
In spite of the rapid growth in infrastructure and the revenue that the city has been gaining in the last few years, Parañaque has yet to go back to its "subdivision" roots and address the rising reports in crime - burglary, hold-ups, rape and street gang violence. Most recently, the city has been plagued with crimes involving current call center workers in and around the city. With the upswing in call center business in last 2 years, Parañaque has yet publicly come out and identify contingencies measures and visibility to protect these wave of employees who are mostly graveyard (9:00 PM to 9:00 AM) shift workers.
