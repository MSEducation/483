===Genoa===

Born in Lisbon, Tavares was a product of Sporting Clube de Portugal's prolific youth system, but never appeared professionally for its first team, moving abroad in 2006 to join Italian side Genoa CFC, where he spent two uneventful seasons which included as much loans.
He spent the 2007–08 season in AC Lugano in Switzerland, with the club also receiving from Genoa Alessandro Di Maio, Tiago and Rivaldo González, for a total of €500,000.Costi di valorizzazione calciatoriGenoa Report and Accounts on 30 June 2008 [tpl]it icon[/tpl], Require purchase in CCIAA
