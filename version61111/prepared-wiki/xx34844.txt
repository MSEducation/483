Botany Bay National Park is a national park in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia approximately 16Â km south-east of the Sydney central business district, on the northern and southern headlands of Botany Bay. The northern headland is at La Perouse and the southern headland is at Kurnell. 
A number of memorials, commemorating Australia's history are located at the entrance to the Kurnell Peninsula portion of the Botany Bay National Park. This area has a coast walk connecting the memorials, and is near the information centre and a museum.
The Kurnell Peninsula portion includes much of the eastern half of the promontory, adjacent to the Caltex Oil Refinery. The area is bordered by sandstone cliffs, eroded to a few metres above sea level in the north and higher in the south. The highest point is about a hundred metres above sea level and there are two mapped lookouts, Kurnell Lookout, and Houston Lookout. Hills of dry sclerophyll bushland include Botany Cone, 55 m, and Long Nose, 101 m. There are many small points and cliff formations and several walking tracks. The carpark and lookout at the end of the Yena Track is popular for whale watching in the migration season.
Also present in the park is Cape Bailey Light, a lighthouse built in 1950.[tpl]cite loa|NSW|Cape%20Bailey|The Cape Bailey Light at the entrance to Botany Bay[/tpl]
