==History==

The land for the cemetery was bought for 60,000 riksdaler from the owner of the Bagaregården estate. The cemetery was designed by architect J. H. Strömberg and inaugurated on 16 November 1860 by dean Peter Wieselgren under the name Begravningsplatsen ("The Burial Place"). The first burial took place on 27 February 1861. During the first year of operation, 348 adults and 648 children were buried there, as measles and diphtheria were raging in the city.
In 1890, the first crematory in Gothenburg was opened, designed by Swedish architect Hans Hedlund. It burned down on 23 December 1920, but was rebuilt.[tpl]cite book | title=Göteborgsbilder 1850-1950 | author=Lignell, Harald | year=1952 | publisher=Nordisk Litteratur | location=Göteborg | pages=447[/tpl] However, it was closed in 1951, and its functions were taken over by the crematory in the nearby district of Kviberg.[tpl]cite web|title=Östra kyrkogården|url=http://www.svenskakyrkan.se/default.aspx?id=655282|publisher=The Church of Sweden|accessdate=30 December 2010[/tpl]
