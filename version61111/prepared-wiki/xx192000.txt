==History==

The Gill Foundation was founded by Tim Gill in 1994, two years after the passage of Amendment 2, a Colorado ballot initiative denying lesbians and gay men equal protection under the law. Through 2012, the foundation had granted more than $243 million to nonprofits sharing its commitment to full equality.[tpl]cite web|title=Center for Effective Philanthropy|url=http://www.effectivephilanthropy.org/assets/pdfs/CEP_BeyondtheRhetoric_Gill.pdf|work=The Gill Foundation: Taking A Strategic Approach To Philanthropy|accessdate=2007[/tpl]

==Today==

The Gill Foundation is most known for its support of nonprofit organizations across the country working to bring about  equality for LGBT people. Beyond its grant making, the foundation also has been recognized for its OutGiving program, through which the foundation seeks to build a larger base of philanthropists giving strategically in support of LGBT equality. In recognition of the OutGiving program, Liberty Hill Foundation honored Tim Gill with its Upton Sinclair Award in 2011 "for his vision, passion and leadership in helping to create and continuing to inspire the modern day LGBTQ donor movement."

The Gill Foundation invests a significant portion of its funding in its home state of Colorado, supporting nonprofits working to improve the quality of life for all Colorado residents. In 2010, $3.7 million out of $11.8 million in grants were to Colorado organizations. The foundation is particularly well known in Colorado for its Gay & Lesbian Fund for Colorado program. The Gay & Lesbian Fund's $1 million challenge grant in 2005 to the Mile High chapter of American Red Cross was one of the largest single donations in the country for Hurricane Katrina disaster relief.
The foundation announced in late 2011 that it would re-evaluate the future direction of the Gay & Lesbian Fund, although it remains committed to its Colorado programs.[tpl]cite news|title=Karen Auge|url=http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_19110007|work=Gill Foundation to re-evaluate Gay & Lesbian Fund's grant-giving|accessdate=14 Oct 2011[/tpl]
