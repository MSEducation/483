[[Taupo Volcanic Zone]]

The Taupo Volcanic Zone is a highly active volcanic V shaped area in the North Island of New Zealand that is spreading east -west at the rate of about 8mm per year. It is named after Lake Taupo, the flooded caldera of the largest volcano in the zone.

==Activity==

There are numerous volcanic vents and geothermal fields in the zone, with Mount Ruapehu, Mount Ngauruhoe and White Island erupting most frequently. The zone's largest eruption since the arrival of Europeans was that of Mount Tarawera in 1886, which killed over 100 people. Early Māori would also have been affected by the much larger Kaharoa eruption from Tarawera around 1300 CE.[tpl]Cite book |last=David |first=Lowe |chapter=Polynesian settlement and impacts of volcanism on early Maori society |pages=50–55 |editor-last=Lowe |editor-first=D.J. |url=http://earth.waikato.ac.nz/staff/lowe/download/Rotorua_Land_and_Lakes_field_trip_NZSSS-1_Dec_06-web.pdf |title=Guidebook for ‘Land and Lakes’ field trip, New Zealand Society of Soil Science Biennial Conference, Rotorua, held in 27–30 November 2006 |publisher=New Zealand Society of Soil Science |place=Lincoln [/tpl]
The last major eruption from Lake Taupo, the Hatepe eruption, occurred in 181 CE. It is believed to have first emptied the lake then followed that feat with a pyroclastic flow that covered about [tpl]convert|20000|km2|0[/tpl] of land with volcanic ash. A total of [tpl]convert|120|km3|abbr=on[/tpl] of material is believed to have been ejected, and over [tpl]convert|30|km3|abbr=on[/tpl] of material is estimated to have been ejected in just a few minutes. The date of this activity is known since the ash expulsion was sufficiently large to turn the sky red over Rome and China (as documented in Hou Han Shu).
Taupo erupted an estimated [tpl]convert|1170|km3|abbr=on[/tpl] of material in its Oruanui eruption 26,500 years ago. This was Earth's most recent eruption reaching VEI-8, the highest level on the Volcanic Explosivity Index.
The Rotorua caldera has been dormant longer, with its main eruption occurring about 240,000 years ago, although lava dome extrusion has occurred within the last 25,000 years.[tpl]cite gvp | vnum =0401042A | title =Rotorua | accessdate = 2010-08-31 [/tpl]

==Extent and geological context==

The Taupo Volcanic Zone is approximately [tpl]convert|350|km|0[/tpl] long by [tpl]convert|50|km|0[/tpl] wide. Mount Ruapehu marks its southwestern end, while the submarine Whakatane volcano ([tpl]convert|85|km|0[/tpl] beyond White Island) is considered its northeastern limit.[tpl]Cite journal | doi=10.1080/00288306.1993.9514588 |last=Gamble |first=J.

It forms a southern portion of the active Lau-Havre-Taupo back-arc basin, which lies behind the Kermadec-Tonga subduction zone.[tpl]Cite journal |year=1996 |title=The Lau-Havre-Taupo back-arc basin: A southward-propagating, multi-stage evolution from rifting to spreading |journal=Tectonophysics |volume=263 |pages=1–22 |doi=10.1016/S0040-1951(96)00029-7 |first=L.

C. |last2=Wright |bibcode=1996Tectp.263....1P[/tpl] Volcanic activity continues to the north-northeast, along the line of the Taupo Volcanic Zone, through several undersea volcanoes (known as Clark, Tangaroa, the Silents and the Rumbles), then shifts eastward to the parallel volcanic arc of the Kermadec Islands and Tonga. Although the back-arc basin continues to propagate to the southwest, with the South Wanganui Basin forming an initial back-arc basin, volcanic activity has not yet begun in this region.[tpl]Cite journal |doi=10.1080/00288306.2006.9515145 |first=P. |last=Villamor |first2=K.

South of Kaikoura the plate boundary changes to a transform boundary with oblique continental collision uplifting the Southern Alps in the South Island. A subduction zone reappears southwest of Fiordland, at the southwestern corner of the South Island, although here the subduction is in the opposite direction. Solander Island is an extinct volcano associated with this subduction zone, and the only one that protudes above the sea.

==Scientific study==

Recent scientific work indicates that the Earth's crust below the Taupo Volcanic Zone may be as little as 16 kilometres thick.  A film of magma 50 kilometres (30 mi) wide and 160 kilometres (100 mi) long lies 10 kilometres under the surface.[tpl]Cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/4202557a11.html |title=Central North Island sitting on magma film |first=Paul |last=Easton |publisher=The Dominion Post |date=15 September 2007 |accessdate=16 March 2008 [/tpl][tpl]Cite journal |first=W. |last=Heise |first2=H.M. |last2=Bibby |first3=T.G. |last3=Caldwell |year=2007 |url=http://www.cosis.net/abstracts/EGU2007/01311/EGU2007-J-01311.pdf?PHPSESSID=e |title=Imaging magmatic Processes in the Taupo Volcanic Zone (New Zealand) with Magnetotellurics |journal=Geophysical Research Abstracts |volume=9[/tpl] 01311. The geological record indicates that some of the volcanoes in the area erupt infrequently but have large, violent and destructive eruptions when they do. There is also some possible rifting in the Taupo Volcanic Zone.
