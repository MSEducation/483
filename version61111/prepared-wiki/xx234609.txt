[[2010 Torneo Descentralizado]]

CATEGORIES: Peruvian Primera División seasons, 2010 in Peruvian football leagues

The 2010 Torneo Descentralizado de Fútbol Profesional (known as the 2010 Copa Cable Mágico for sponsorship reasons) was the ninety-fourth season season of Peruvian football. A total of 16 teams are competing in the tournament, with Universitario de Deportes as the defending champion. The season began on February and concluded on December 12 with the victory of Universidad San Martín over León de Huánuco in the second leg of the final Play-off, giving Universidad San Martín its third Peruvian title.

==Competition modus==

The season was divided into 3 stages. In the first stage the 16 teams played a round-robin home-and-away round for a total of 30 matches each. In the second stage the 16 teams were divided into 2 groups. The 8 teams that ranked an odd number played in the group Liguilla A and the 8 teams that ranked an even number played in Liguilla B. In addition, the team ranked first at the end of the first stage is eligible to play the 2011 Copa Libertadores as Peru 3. Each team carried on their records from the first stage. Both groups played another round-robin home-and-away round for 14 matches played by each team. Bonus points were awarded to two teams based on the performance of their reserve teams in the 2010 Torneo de Promoción y Reserva before the first match of the second stage. The teams ranked first in each group at the end of the 14 matches advanced to the third stage. The two teams with the worst least points at the end of the second stage were relegated. In the third stage the championship was contested in a two-legged Play-off. The Play-off finalists qualified for the Copa Libertadores. The remaining international competition berths were determined by the season aggregate table.

==Changes from 2009==

==Teams==

Sport Áncash and Coronel Bolognesi finished the 2009 season in 15th and 16th place, respectively, in the aggregate table and thus were relegated to the Segunda División. They were replaced by the champion of the 2009 Segunda División, Sport Boys and the champion of the 2009 Copa Perú, León de Huánuco.
