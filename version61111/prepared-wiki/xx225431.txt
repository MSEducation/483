Chínipas was founded as a mission town by the Jesuits Pedro Juan Castini and Julio Pascual on 31 December 1626. They were both killed, and the mission destroyed, during a Native war against the Spaniards, specifically on 1 February 1632. The mission was rebuilt, slightly down-stream, in 1676. 
Gold was found locally in 1798, which led to the towns rapid expansion with European settlers in the late 19th century. Well known local family names include Piero, Sarracino the Santinis from Italy, Balderrama from Spain, the Schultzes from Germany, the Russos from Sicily, the O'Leary's from Ireland (now spelled Alire), the Bridge's from England (now spelled Breach) and the Willis' from England (now spelled Villis). The largest mine was called the Palmarejo and was British owned. The equipment was manufactured in England, shipped to Guaymas on the Sonora coast, transported by mule or donkey to San Bernardo, Sonora and then by over the mountain on peoples backs.Richard Grant.
