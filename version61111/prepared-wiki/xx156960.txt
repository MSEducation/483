Mission College Preparatory Catholic High School is a private Roman Catholic high school in San Luis Obispo, California.  It is located in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Monterey.

==Remodelings and Additions==

In 2004, Mission College Prep (MCP) underwent a major renovation. An entire new wing was built over the parking lot, which was remade into an underground parking facility. Included in this add-on is the Cowitz Gymnasium. The previous gym was transformed into a performing arts auditorium. 
In the summer of 2007 MCP tore out and replaced the football, soccer, and baseball field. This action was done to accommodate the change from 8-man to 11-man football. In addition a removable dugout was placed alongside the field to allow both football and baseball to be played on the same field.
In the summer of 2008 the sections of MCP not renovated in 2004 were retrofitted. Some of the school's older classrooms were also remodeled.

==Athletics==

MCP has sport programs for: football, cross country running, tennis, volleyball, basketball, soccer, golf, track and field, baseball, and softball. MCP is a frequent at the CIFs holding many banners for basketball, volleyball, and cross country running. Among their star athletes is Jordan Hasay.  MCP currently holds the CIF record for most consecutive CIF championships in any sport with 16 straight in girls basketball. 
Mission hosts an annual basketball tournament known as the "Christmas Classic." In this tournament, teams from across the country have come to play.

==The Painting of The M==

Every year a majority of the incoming freshmen hike up Cerro San Luis to repaint the giant cement M on the mountain's east face. This traditionally ends with the students throwing excess paint at each other.
This M has been around for nearly 40 years and was built by Raymond Cattaneo his senior year. The removal of the M has been brought before the City Council of San Luis Obispo. Each time it has been shut down by an outcry from the students at Mission along with a large number of alumni. The dimensions of the M are [tpl]convert|37|ft|m[/tpl] high, and [tpl]convert|32|ft|m[/tpl] wide.

==Academics==

In 2007 every student who graduated from MCP was accepted by a four-year college. In general a large majority of students maintain above a 3.00, and nearly half obtain a 4.00 or higher by senior year.

==Notable Alumni==
