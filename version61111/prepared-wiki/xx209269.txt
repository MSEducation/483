The Wiyot Massacre refers to the incidents on 26 February 1860, at Tuluwat on what is now known as Indian Island, near Eureka in Humboldt County, California.

==History==

Immigrant whites had settled in the area since the California Gold Rush, over the 10 years before the massacre. The Wiyot were a peaceful tribe that had never fought with white settlers and had no reason to expect an attack.[ref]
