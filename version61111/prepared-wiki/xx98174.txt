==Biography==

Simon James Holliday Gray was born on 21 October 1936 on Hayling Island, in Hampshire, England, where his father, James, a G.P. who became a pathologist later, worked.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article4480324.ece|title=Simon Gray: Rakish and Versatile Playwright|work=Times Online, Obituaries|format=Web|publisher=News Corporation|date=2008-09-08|accessdate=2009-03-30[/tpl]  In 1939, during World War II, when he was three years old, he was evacuated to Montreal, Canada, to live in "a house where his grandfather and grandfather's alcoholic wife were attended upon by a younger aunt"; in 1945, when he was nearly 10, he returned to England, where he was educated at Westminster School, in London. In 1957, he received a B.A. from Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia; and, in 1961, another B.A. from Trinity College, Cambridge.[tpl]cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/242639/Simon-Gray|title=Simon Gray|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|format=Web|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|year=2009|accessdate=2009-04-07[/tpl] In 1965, he was appointed a lecturer in English at Queen Mary College, London.
He married his first wife, Beryl Kevern, in 1965; they had two children, a son, Benjamin, and a daughter, Lucy, and were divorced in 1997.  During their marriage, he had an eight-year affair with another Queen Mary lecturer, Victoria Katherine Rothschild (b. 1953), a daughter of Sir Nathaniel Rothschild, 3rd Baron Rothschild;[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person.php?LinkID=mp94341|title=Victoria Katherine Gray (née Rothschild)|work=National Portrait Gallery|format=Web|publisher=npg.org.uk|accessdate=2009-04-06|quote=Academic and lecturer; daughter of Sir Nathaniel Rothschild, 3rd Baron Rothschild.[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Darryl Lundy, comp|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p19564.htm|title=Person Page - 19564: Victoria Katherine Rothschild Gray|work=The Peerage: A Genealogical Survey of the Peerage of Britain as well as the Royal Families of Europe|format=Web|publisher=Darryl Lundy|date=2009-04-06|accessdate=2009-04-06[/tpl] in 1997, after his divorce, they married, living together in west London, until his death on 6 August 2008.[tpl]cite web|author=Josa Young|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/josa-young/the-late-great-simon-gray_b_176306.html|title=The Late Great Simon Gray|format=Web|work=The Huffington Post|date=2009-03-25|accessdate=2009-03-29[/tpl]
In 2004 he was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire for services to drama and literature.
Suffering from both lung cancer and prostate cancer and related ailments at the time of his death, he died of an abdominal aortic aneurysm, on 7 August 2008, at the age of 71.[tpl]cite news|author=Janice Turner|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article3801820.ece|title=Simon Gray Has Lung Cancer, But Won't Stop Smoking|work=Times Online|format=Web|publisher=News Corporation|date=2008-04-24|accessdate=2009-03-29|quote=There is a burning inevitability, of course, that a habit begun aged 7, pursued tirelessly, heroically even, through past health horrors including aneurysms and prostate cancer, peaking at 65 fags a day, would get him in the end.[/tpl]

==Career==

When he was still in his 20s, he began his writing career as a novelist with Colmain, published by Faber and Faber in 1963.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.contemporarywriters.com/authors/?p=auth5181C8790c9332BF8BiTW2C7EFEA|title=Simon Gray|work=Contemporary Writers|format=Web|publisher=British Council|date=2007-08-30|accessdate=2009-03-30[/tpl] His career in drama began when he adapted one of his own short stories, The Caramel Crisis, for television. He subsequently wrote a number of plays for, amongst others, The Wednesday Play and Play for Today BBC anthology series, frequently in collaboration with the producer Kenith Trodd.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/T/htmlT/troddkenith/troddkenith.htm|title=Trodd, Kenith: British Producer|work=Museum of Broadcast Communications|format=Web|publisher=museum.tv|accessdate=2009-03-29[/tpl] Gray wrote 40 plays and screenplays for the stage, television, and film and 8 volumes of memoirs based on his diaries.
Wise Child, an adaptation of a TV play deemed too shocking for the small screen, was his first stage play. It starred Simon Ward and Alec Guinness and was produced by Michael Codron at Wyndham's Theatre in 1967. Subsequently, he wrote original plays for both radio and television and adaptations, including: an TV adaptation of The Rector’s Daughter, by F. M. Mayor; stage adaptations of Tartuffe and The Idiot.  His original television screenplays include Running Late, After Pilkington, Unnatural Pursuits, and A Month in the Country.  His 1971 play Butley, produced by Codron, began a long creative partnership with Harold Pinter as director (of both the play and the film versions) and continued the partnership with the actor Alan Bates begun with Gray's 1967 television play Death of a Teddy Bear; Bates starred in 11 of Gray's works, while Pinter directed 10 separate productions of Gray's works for stage, film, and television, beginning with Butley; the last one was a stage production of The Old Masters, starring Peter Bowles and Edward Fox.[tpl]cite web|author=Karen Rappaport, comp.|url=http://alanbates.com/abarchive/tv/tv.html|title=The Alan Bates Archive: TV|format= Web|accessdate=2009-03-29[/tpl] (Converted to a memorial site after death of Alan Bates.)[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.haroldpinter.org/directing.shtml|title=Stage, TV and Film Productions Directed by Harold Pinter|work=HaroldPinter.org|publisher=Harold Pinter|date=2000–2008|format=Web|accessdate=2009-03-29[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
As with Butley (1971) and Otherwise Engaged (1975), whose London productions and films both starred Bates, and Quartermaine's Terms (1981), starring Fox, Gray "often returned to the subject of the lives and trials of educated intellectuals."
He wrote many other successful stage plays, including The Common Pursuit, The Late Middle Classes, Hidden Laughter, Japes, Close of Play, The Rear Column, and Little Nell, several of which he directed himself.
In 1984, at the suggestion of Robert McCrum, Faber editor-in-chief at that time, he kept a diary of the London premiere of The Common Pursuit (directed by Pinter at the Lyric Hammersmith), resulting in the first of his 8 volumes of theatre-related and personal memoirs, An Unnatural Pursuit (Faber 1985), and culminating in the critically acclaimed trilogy entitled The Smoking Diaries (Granta, 2004–2008).[tpl]cite web|author=Ian Jack|title=In Memory of Simon Gray|url=http://www.granta.com/Magazine/Granta-103/In-Memory-of-Simon-Gray|publisher=Granta 103 (Autumn 2008)|accessdate=2009-02-05[/tpl]
Gray's play about George Blake, Cell Mates (1995), starring Rik Mayall, Stephen Fry and Simon Ward, attracted media attention when Stephen Fry abruptly "fled to Bruges" after the third performance, thus leaving the show without its lead actor.  Gray subsequently wrote his theatrical memoir Fat Chance, providing a scathingly hilarious account of the episode.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.complete-review.com/reviews/grays/fchance.htm|title=Fat Chance|work=The Complete Review|format=Web|publisher=The Complete Review, © 2001-2006|accessdate=2009-03-29[/tpl]
In August 2008, shortly before his death, he attracted further press attention with his criticism of the Royal National Theatre's "cowardice" in dealing with the subject of radical Islam.[tpl]cite web|author=Henry Deedes|title=Pandora: Gray Goes On the Attack over Hytner's 'easy liberalism'|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/columnists/pandora/pandora-gray-goes-onthe-attackover-hytners-easyliberalism-880322.html|work=Independent|format=Web|publisher=Independent News & Media|date=2008-07-30|accessdate=2009-03-29[/tpl]

==Posthumous tributes and related developments==

Gray's final volume of diaries, Coda, "so named because it rounds off the trilogy of 'Smoking Diaries' (The Smoking Diaries, The Year of the Jouncer and The Last Cigarette) … a meditation on death, or rather dying, an account of living on borrowed time," was published posthumously by Faber and Faber and Granta in November 2008.[tpl]cite web|author=Jonathan Sale|title=Coda, by Simon Gray: The Moving and Comic Final Memoir of a Writer at the Fag-end of His Life|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/coda-by-simon-gray-1034910.html|work=Independent|format=Web|publisher=Independent News & Media|date=2008-11-26|accessdate=2009-03-29[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Tony Gould|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/books/2577366/a-rich-harvest.thtml|title=Book Reviews: A Rich Harvest: CODA, Simon Gray|work=The Spectator Book Club|format=Web|publisher=The Spectator (Press Holdings)|date=2008-11-05|accessdate=2009-04-01[/tpl]  From 8 to 12 December 2008, in five 15-minute episodes, actor Toby Stephens read from this "candid and darkly comic account of coming to terms with terminal cancer" for BBC Radio 4's Book of the Week.[tpl]cite web|author=Simon Gray|url=http://search.bbc.co.uk/search?Search=Search&tab=tvradio&scope=all&uri=%2Fradio4%2Farts%2Fbook_week.shtml&q=Simon%20Gray%20Coda|title=Coda|work=Book of the Week|publisher=BBC Radio 4|date=8–12 Dec 2008|accessdate=2009-04-03[/tpl]

Can't think of anything nicer than working on a literary website for a change (instead of magazine ones, which is what I am doing at the moment)."  Young recounts meeting with Victoria Gray to discuss details about creating such a website.
The Late Middle Classes finally received its London premiere on 27 May 2010 at the Donmar Warehouse in London, directed by David Leveaux and starring Helen McCrory, Eleanor Bron, Peter Sullivan and Robert Glenister. The original production of the play, directed by Harold Pinter, was prevented from reaching its intended West End theatre by a musical about a boy band.[tpl]cite web|author=Libby Purves|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/stage/theatre/article7142302.ece|title=The Late Middle Classes|work=Times Online|format=Web|publisher=News Corporation|date=2010-06-02|accessdate=2010-06-06[/tpl] Gray's experience of this production is the subject of his diary "Enter a Fox".
