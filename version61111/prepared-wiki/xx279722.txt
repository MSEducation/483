SXSW V2V is the newest South by Southwest conference; it features a startup competition, panel discussions, and mentoring workshops for entrepreneurs. Hosted in Las Vegas, it is the first SXSW event to take place outside of Austin, Texas.  It began in 2013 as an evolution of the startup competition that is held as part of the SXSW Interactive festival each spring.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.statesman.com/news/technology/sxsw-interactive-expanding-next-year-with-las-vega/nSmFZ/ |title= SXSW Interactive expanding next year with Las Vegas startup conference|last=Gallaga|first=Omar L.|publisher=Austin American-Statesman |date=2012-10-23 |accessdate=2013-08-08[/tpl]
