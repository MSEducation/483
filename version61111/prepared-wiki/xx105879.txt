[[Retina horizontal cell]]

CATEGORIES: Human eye anatomy, Human cells, Neurons

Horizontal cells are the laterally interconnecting neurons having cell bodies in the inner nuclear layer of the  retina of vertebrate eyes. They help integrate and regulate the input from multiple photoreceptor cells. Among their functions, horizontal cells are responsible for allowing eyes to adjust to see well under both bright and dim light conditions.

==Organization==

There are three basic types of horizontal cells, designated HI, HII and HIII.  The selectivity of these three horizontal cells, towards one of the three cone types, is a matter of debate.  According to studies conducted by Boycott and Wassle neither HI cells nor HII cells were selective towards S,M, or L cones. By contrast, Anhelt and Kolb claim that in their observations HI cells connected to all three cone types indiscriminantly, however, HII cells tended to contact S cones the most.  They also identified a third type of horizontal cell, HIII, which was identical to HI but did not make contact with S cones.
The HII cells also make connections with rods, but do so far enough away from the horizontal cell's soma such that they do not interfere with the activities of the cones.
They span across cones and summate inputs from them all to control the amount of GABA released back onto the photoreceptor cells, which hyperpolarizes them. Their arrangement together with the on-center and off-center bipolar cells that receive input from the photoreceptors constitutes a form of lateral inhibition, increasing spatial resolution at the expense of some information on absolute intensity. The eye is thus more sensitive to contrast and differences in intensity.
There is a greater density of horizontal cells towards the central region of the retina. In cat retina it is observed that there is a density of
225 cells/mm2 near the center of the retina and a density of 120 cells/mm2 in the peripherals. [tpl]cite journal|last=Wassle|first=H.|coauthors=Riemann, H.

Horizontal cells and other retinal interneuron cells are less likely to be near neighbours of the same subtype than would occur by chance, resulting in ‘exclusion zones’ that separate them. Mosaic arrangements provide a mechanism to distribute each cell type evenly across the retina, ensuring that all parts of the visual field have access to a full set of processing elements.

==Functional properties==

Horizontal cells are depolarized by the release of glutamate from photoreceptors, which happens in the absence of light. Depolarization of a horizontal cell causes it to release the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA on an adjacent photoreceptor. GABA inhibits this photoreceptor, effectively hyperpolarizing it. Conversely, in the light a photoreceptor does not release or it releases less glutamate onto the horizontal cell, which hyperpolarizes it and prevents or lowers the release of inhibitory GABA on the adjecent photoreceptor. We therefore have the following negative feedback.
To explain diffuse light, then we consider both cases together, and as it turns out, the two effects cancel each other out, and we get little or no net effect. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_surround_antagonism
