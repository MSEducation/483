Thomas Dallam afterwards built many important organs, including that of King's College Chapel, Cambridge.

==Robert Dallam==

Thomas Dallam's son Robert Dallam (born ca. 1602) became an important organ builder.  He and his family relocated to Brittany during the English Commonwealth, when it was impossible to pursue a career as an organ builder in England.
In 1660, following the restoration of the monarchy, Robert Dallam and other members of the family returned to England.  Robert and his sons Ralph and George built an organ for St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, which had been damaged during the civil war.The History of the English Organ

==Thomas Dallam II==

Robert's eldest son was called Thomas and was born around 1630.  As a child, he moved to France with his family. Although his father returned to England in 1660, Thomas remained in France building organs, several of which have been preserved in more or less their original condition.
