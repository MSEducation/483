A-Teens (stylized as A*Teens) was a Swedish pop music group from Stockholm, Sweden, formed by Niklas Berg in 1998 as an ABBA tribute band called ABBA Teens and later renamed to A-Teens. They were composed of Marie Serneholt, Amit Paul, Dhani Lennevald and Sara Lumholdt. The band's debut album became a success around the world and in 2001 it was reported that the band had sold 6 million albums worldwide.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.a-teens.com/?sid=article&pid=read&id=250 |title=The DVD Collection | work = Press Release |publisher=A-teens.com |date= October 4, 2001 |accessdate=2010-05-15[/tpl]

==History==

===The ABBA Generation (1999)===

In 1998, Marie, Sara, Dhani, and Amit were musically united as the ABBA Teens. However, upon the request of Bj√∂rn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson of ABBA, the group's name was changed to the A-Teens to avoid confusion.[tpl]cite web|url=http://weeklywire.com/ww/05-08-00/boston_music_4.html|title=How Swede It Is|accessdate=2007-10-14|author=Douglas Wolk|date=2000-05-08|publisher=Boston Phoenix[/tpl]  This choice allowed the band more freedom in creating their own style of music.
In early 1999, the band started the recording process of what would be their debut album, The ABBA Generation, consisting purely of ABBA covers reinterpreted with a modern pop and electronic flair to appeal to a new generation of young pop fans. Their first single, "Mamma Mia", topped the charts in over ten countries including their home country Sweden where it stayed at number one for eight consecutive weeks. The album hit the peak position in Sweden & Chile and became a top ten hit throughout the world. Further singles enjoyed similar success ensuring top ten placings across the globe, and the album overall sold more than 3 million copies worldwide, being certified Gold or Platinum in over 22 different countries.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.a-teens.com/?sid=article&pid=read&id=107 |title="The ABBA Generation" Certificated Gold & Platinum in 22 Countries |publisher=A-teens.com |date=2001-02-09 |accessdate=2010-05-15[/tpl]
The band's music video for "Dancing Queen" features a plot very similar to the 1985 John Hughes film The Breakfast Club. In addition, the principal seen in the music video was played by Paul Gleason, the same actor who was the principal in the film. The single reached ninety-five on the Billboard Hot 100 and sold over 500,000 copies in the U.S. alone, being certified Gold.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.a-teens.com/?sid=article&pid=read&id=82 |title="Dancing Queen" sells 500,000 copies |publisher=A-teens.com |date=2001-01-04 |accessdate=2010-05-15[/tpl]
In early 2000, the band embarked on a U.S. promotional tour, and on the verge of the release of their album in the United States, the band was invited to tour with Britney Spears that summer in her U.S. Tour. They also made several appearances on Disney and Nickelodeon to promote their music.

===Break-up===

After "Greatest Hits" was released, the band announced a two-year break. On 15 April 2006, Marie Serneholt's Swedish website officially announced that the A-Teens had parted ways[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2009[/tpl]. A reason for the departure was yet to be announced. In one magazine Marie Serneholt stated, "The A-Teens are nothing but a memory now, we have all started our own projects."  Another member of the group, Dhani Lennevald, confirmed his former groupmate's comment.
Amit wrote on his website: "Well for starters we figured that it‚Äôs better to stop when you‚Äôre still on top. And during all the traveling we‚Äôd done we had worn on each other. For me personally though the main reason was that I had started writing songs during the years, and I was beginning to feel that I wanted to do something just for me, in my way.‚Äù
In a later interview, Serneholt indicated that the primary reason why the band stopped was they felt they were burned out due to a grueling schedule which saw them spend 300 days a year on the road over the course of several years.
