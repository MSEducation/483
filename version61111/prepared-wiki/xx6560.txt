Learning theories are conceptual frameworks that describe how information is absorbed, processed, and retained during learning. Cognitive, emotional, and environmental influences, as well as prior experience, all play a part in how understanding, or a world view, is acquired or changed, and knowledge and skills retained.[tpl]cite book | last = Illeris | first = Knud | title = The three dimensions of learning | publisher = Krieger Pub. Co | location = Malabar, Fla | year = 2004 | isbn = 9781575242583 [/tpl][tpl]cite book | last = Ormrod | first = Jeanne | title = Human learning | publisher = Pearson | location = Boston | year = 2012|edition = 6th | isbn = 9780132595186 [/tpl]
Behaviorists look at learning as an aspect of conditioning and will advocate a system of rewards and targets in education. Educators who embrace cognitive theory believe that the definition of learning as a change in behavior is too narrow and prefer to study the learner rather than her environment, and in particular the complexities of human memory. Those who advocate constructivism believe that a learner's ability to learn relies to a large extent on what he already knows and understands, and that the acquisition of knowledge should be an individually tailored process of construction. Transformative learning theory focuses upon the often-necessary change that is required in a learner's preconceptions and world view.
Outside the realm of educational psychology, techniques to directly observe the functioning of the brain during the learning process, such as event-related potential and functional magnetic resonance imaging, are used in educational neuroscience. [tpl]As of|2012[/tpl], such studies are beginning to support a theory of multiple intelligences, where learning is seen as the interaction between dozens of different functional areas in the brain, each with their own individual strengths and weaknesses in any particular human learner.

==Educational psychology==

===Behaviorism===

The term "behaviorism" was coined by John Watson (1878–1959). Watson believed that theorizing thoughts, intentions or other subjective experiences was unscientific and insisted that psychology must focus on measurable behaviors.[tpl]cite book|last=Good and Brophey|title=Realistic Approach|page=155[/tpl] For behaviorism, learning is the acquisition of a new behavior through conditioning.

====Conditioning====

There are two types of conditioning:
Classical conditioning was noticed by Ivan Pavlov when he saw that if dogs come to associate the delivery of food with a white lab coat or with the ringing of a bell, they will produce saliva, even when there is no sight or smell of food. Classical conditioning regards this form of learning to be the same whether in dogs or in humans.[tpl]cite book|last=Myers, David G.|title=Exploring Psychology|year=2008|publisher=Worth|location=New York, New York|page=223[/tpl] Operant conditioning, or radical behaviorism, reinforces this behavior with a reward or a punishment. A reward increases the likelihood of the behavior recurring, a punishment decreases its likelihood.[tpl]cite book|last=Myers|first=David G.|title=Exploring Psychology|year=2008|publisher=Worth|location=New York, New York|page=222[/tpl]
Behaviorists view the learning process as a change in behavior, and will arrange the environment to elicit desired responses through such devices as behavioral objectives, Competency-based learning, and skill development and training.[tpl]cite web|last=Smith|first=M.K.|title=Learning Theory, the encyclopedia of informal education.  |url=http://www.infed.org/biblio/b-learn.htm|publisher=the encyclopedia of informal education|accessdate=June 2011[/tpl] Educational approaches such as applied behavior analysis, curriculum-based measurement, and direct instruction have emerged from this model.Kim, T and Axelrod, S. (2005): "Direct Instruction: An Educators' Guide and a Plea for Action" - The Behavior Analyst Today, 6.(2), p. 111

===Cognitivism===

Cognitive theories grew out of Gestalt psychology, developed in Germany in the early 1900s and brought to America in the 1920s. The German word gestalt is roughly equivalent to the English configuration or pattern and emphasizes the whole of human experience.[tpl]cite book|last=Yount|first=William R.|title=Created to Learn|year=1996|publisher=Broadman & Holman|location=Nashville|page=192[/tpl] Over the years, the Gestalt psychologists provided demonstrations and described principles to explain the way we organize our sensations into perceptions.[tpl]cite book|last=Myers|first=David G.|title=Exploring Psychology|year=2008|publisher=Worth|location=New York, New York|page=163[/tpl]
Gestalt psychologists criticize behaviorists for being too dependent on overt behavior to explain learning. They propose looking at the patterns rather than isolated events.[tpl]cite book|last=Merriam, Sharan B.|title=Learning In Adulthood|year=2007|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco[/tpl] Gestalt views of learning have been incorporated into what have come to be labeled cognitive theories. Two key assumptions underlie this cognitive approach: that the memory system is an active organized processor of information and that prior knowledge plays an important role in learning. Cognitive theories look beyond behavior to consider how human memory works to promote learning, and an understanding of short term memory and long term memory is important to educators influenced by cognitive theory.[tpl]cite journal|last=Lilienfeld|first=Scott|coauthors=Lynn, Steven J., Namy, Laura L., Woolf, Nancy J.|title=A Framework for Everyday Thinking|journal=Psychology|year=2010|volume=1|pages=24–8[/tpl]  They view learning as an internal mental process (including insight, information processing, memory and perception) where the educator focuses on building intelligence and cognitive development. The individual learner is more important than the environment.
Once memory theories like the Atkinson-Shiffrin memory model[tpl]cite book|last=Atkinson|first=R.C. & Shiffrin, R.M.|title=The psychology of learning and motivation|year=1968|publisher=Academic Press|location=New York|pages=89–125|edition=2|editor=K.W. Spence and J.T. Spence[/tpl]  and Baddeley's working memory model[tpl]cite book|title=The psychology of learning and motivation: advances in research and theory|year=1974|publisher=Academic Press|location=New York|pages=47–89|author=Baddeley, A.D.|edition=8|authorlink=Working memory|coauthors=Hitch, G.J.L.|editor=G.A. Bower[/tpl]  were established as a theoretical framework in cognitive psychology, new cognitive frameworks of learning began to emerge during the 1970s, 80s, and 90s. Today, researchers are concentrating on topics like cognitive load and information processing theory. These theories of learning play a role in influencing instructional design.[tpl]cite journal|last=deJong|first=T.|title=Cognitive Load Theory, Educational Research, and Instructional Design: Some Food for Thought|journal=Instructional Science: An International Journal of the Learning Sciences|year=2010|page=38[/tpl] Cognitive theory is used to explain such topics as social role acquisition, intelligence and memory as related to age.

===Constructivism===

Built on the work of Jean Piaget and Jerome Bruner, constructivism emphasizes the importance of the active involvement of learners in constructing knowledge for themselves, and building new ideas or concepts based upon current knowledge and past experience. It asks why students do not learn deeply by listening to a teacher, or reading from a textbook. To design effective teaching environments, it believes, one needs a good understanding of what children already know when they come into the classroom.  The curriculum should be designed in a way that builds on what the pupil already knows and is allowed to develop with them.Smith, M. K. (2002). "Jerome Bruner and the Process of Education."   Retrieved 26 August 2007, fromhttp://www.infed.org/thinkers/bruner.htm. Begin with complex problems and teach basic skills while solving these problems.[tpl]cite book|last=Yount|first=William R.|title=Created to Learn|year=1996|publisher=Broadman & Holman|location=Nashville|page=202[/tpl] This requires an understanding of children's cognitive development, and constructivism draws heavily on psychological studies of cognitive development.
The learning theories of John Dewey, Marie Montessori, and David Kolb serve as the foundation of constructivist learning theory.[tpl]cite book|last=Lombardi|first=S.M.|title=Internet Activities for a Preschool Technology Education Program Guided by Caregivers|year=2011|publisher=Doctoral dissertation, North Carolina State University|pages=139–40[/tpl] Constructivism has many varieties: Active learning, discovery learning, and knowledge building are three, but all versions promote a student's free exploration within a given framework or structure.[tpl]cite journal|last=Devries|first=B.|coauthors=Zan, B.|title=When children make rules|journal=Educational Leadership|year=2003|volume=61|issue=1|pages=64–7[/tpl] The teacher acts as a facilitator who encourages students to discover principles for themselves and to construct knowledge by working to solve realistic problems.

===Transformative learning theory===

Transformative learning theory seeks to explain how humans revise and reinterpret meaning.[tpl]cite book|last=Taylor|first=E.W.|title=Transformative learning theory. New Directions for Adult and Continuing Education|year=2008|publisher=Jossey-Bass|pages=5–15[/tpl] Transformative learning is the cognitive process of effecting change in a frame of reference.[tpl]cite book|last=Mezirow|first=J|title=Transformative Learning: Theory to Practice. New Directions for Adult and Continuing Education|year=1997|publisher=Jossey-bass|pages=5–12[/tpl] A frame of reference defines our view of the world. The emotions are often involved.[tpl]cite journal|last=Ileris|first=K|title=Transformative Learning in the Perspective of a Comprehensive Learning Theory|journal=Journal of Transformative Education|year=2001|month=April|issue=2|pages=79–89|doi=10.1177/1541344603262315[/tpl] Adults have a tendency to reject any ideas that do not correspond to their particular values, associations and concepts.
Our frames of reference are composed of two dimensions: habits of mind and points of view.  Habits of mind, such as ethnocentrism, are harder to change than points of view. Habits of mind influence our point of view and the resulting thoughts or feelings associated with them, but points of view may change over time as a result of influences such as reflection, appropriation and feedback. Transformative learning takes place by discussing with others the “reasons presented in support of competing interpretations, by critically examining evidence, arguments, and alternative points of view.” When circumstances permit, transformative learners move toward a frame of reference that is more inclusive, discriminating, self-reflective, and integrative of experience.

==Educational neuroscience==

American Universities such as Harvard, Johns Hopkins, University of Southern California and others, in the first decade of the twenty-first century, began offering majors and degrees dedicated to educational neuroscience or neuroeducation. Such studies seek to link an understanding of brain processes with classroom instruction and experiences.[tpl]cite book|last=Wolf|first=P.|title=Brain Matters: Translating Research into Classroom Practice (2nd ed.)|year=2010|publisher=ASCD[/tpl]  Neuroeducation seeks to analyze the biological changes that take place in the brain as new information is processed. It looks at what environmental, emotional and social situations are best in order for new information to be retained and stored in the brain via the linking of neurons, rather than allowing the dendrites to be reabsorbed and the information lost. The 1990s were designated "The Decade of the Brain," and advances took place in neuroscience at an especially rapid pace. The three dominant methods for measuring brain activities are: event-related potential, functional magnetic resonance imaging and magnetoencephalography (MEG).[tpl]cite book|last=ed. by Sawyer|first=R. Keith|title=Cambridge Handbook of the Learning Sciences|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York, New York|pages=20[/tpl]
The integration and application to education of what we know about the brain was strengthened in 2000 when the American Federation of Teachers stated: "It is vital that we identify what science tells us about how people learn in order to improve the education curriculum."[tpl]cite journal|last=Radin|first=J.P.|title=Brain-Compatible Teaching and Learning: Implications for Teacher Education.|journal=Educ Horiz|year=2009|month=Fall|volume=88|issue=1[/tpl] What is exciting about this new field in education is that modern brain imaging techniques now make it possible, in some sense, to watch the brain as it learns, and the question then arises: can the results of neuro-scientific studies of brains as they are learning usefully inform practice in this area?[tpl]cite journal|last=Rowland|title=The brain that changes itself: Stories of personal triumph from the frontiers of brain science|journal=Journal of Academic Language and Learning|year=2010[/tpl]    Although the field of neuroscience is young, it is expected that with new technologies and ways of observing learning, the paradigms of what students need and how students learn best will be further refined with actual scientific evidence.  In particular, students who may have learning disabilities will be taught with strategies that are more informed.

===A brain-based theory of learning===

The differences of opinion and theory in psychology indicate that the learning process is not yet understood.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl] Neuroscience shows that the brain can be modelled not with a central processor where ‘'intelligence'’ lies, but in having perhaps 70 functional areas. Mental activity requires several areas to work together. What appear as different types of intelligence result from different combinations of well-developed functional areas. Learning is a process by which neurons join by developing the synapses between them. Knowledge is arranged hierarchically, with new knowledge being linked to existing neural networks.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]

==Multiple intelligences==

The existence of multiple intelligences is proposed by psychologist Howard Gardner, who suggests that different kinds of intelligence exists in human beings.Allen, I. E., J. Seaman, et al. (2007). Blending In: The Extent and Promise of Blended Education in the United States. Needham, M.A., The Sloan Consortium. It is a theory that has been fashionable in continuous professional development (CPD) training courses for teachers.

==Multimedia learning==

Multimedia learning refers to the use of visual and auditory teaching materials that may include video, computer and other information technology.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl] Multimedia learning theory focuses on the principles that determine the effective use of multimedia in learning, with emphasis on using both the visual and auditory channels for information processing.
The auditory channel deals with information that is heard, and the visual channel processes information that is seen. The visual channel holds less information than the auditory channel.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl] If both the visual and auditory channels are presented with information, more knowledge is retained. However, if too much information is delivered it is inadequately processed, and long term memory is not acquired. Multimedia learning seeks to give instructors the ability to stimulate both the visual and auditory channels of the learner, resulting in better progress.

==Other learning theories==

Other learning theories have also been developed for more specific purposes. For example, andragogy is the art and science to help adults learn. Connectivism is a recent theory of networked learning which focuses on learning as making connections.

===Learning style theory===

Learning style theory proposes that individuals learn in different ways, that there are four distinct learning styles – feeling, watching, thinking and doing – and that knowledge of a learner's preferred learning style will lead to faster and more satisfactory improvement.Smith, M., M. Doyle, et al. (2007). "David a. kolb on experiential learning." Retrieved 24 August 2007, fromhttp://www.infed.org/biblio/b-explrn.htm.

===Informal and post-modern theories===

In theories that make use of cognitive restructuring, an informal curriculum promotes the use of prior knowledge to help students gain a broad understanding of concepts.[tpl]cite journal|last=Marzano|first=Robert|title=Fostering thinking across the curriculum through knowledge restructuring|journal=Journal of Reading|year=1991|volume=34|pages=518–25[/tpl] New knowledge cannot be told to students, it believes, but rather the students' current knowledge must be challenged. In this way, students will adjust their ideas to more closely resemble actual theories or concepts.  By using this method students gain the broad understanding they're taught and later are more willing to learn and keep the specifics of the concept or theory. This theory further aligns with the idea that teaching the concepts and the language of a subject should be split into multiple steps.[tpl]cite journal|last=Brown|first=B|coauthors=Ryoo, K|title=Teaching Science as a Language: A "Content-First" Approach to Science Teaching|journal=Journal of Research in Science Teaching|year=2008|volume=45|issue=5|pages=529–53|doi=10.1002/tea.20255[/tpl]
Other informal learning theories look at the sources of motivation for learning. Intrinsic motivation may create a more self-regulated learner,[tpl]cite book|last=Deci|first=E.L.|title=Why We Do What We Do: The Dynamics of Personal Autonomy|year=1995|publisher=Putnam's Sons|location=New York[/tpl] yet schools undermine intrinsic motivation. Critics argue that the average student learning in isolation performs significantly less well than those learning with collaboration and mediation.[tpl]cite journal|last=Wells|first=G.|title=Semiotic Mediation, Dialogue and the Construction of Knowledge|journal=Human Development|year=2007|volume=50|issue=5|pages=244–74|doi=10.1159/000106414[/tpl] Students learn through talk, discussion, and argumentation.[tpl]cite book|last=Wink|first=J.|title=A vision of Vygotsky|year=2002|publisher=Allyn and Bacon|location=Boston[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Vygotsky|first=L|title=Thought and language|year=1986|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Ma[/tpl]

==Philosophical anthropology==

Every well-constructed theory of education has at its center a philosophical anthropology.Theodora Polito, Educational Theory as Theory of Culture: A Vichian perspective on the educational theories of John Dewey and Kieran Egan Educational Philosophy and Theory, Vol. 37, No. 4, 2005

==Criticism of learning theory==

Critics of learning theories that seek to displace traditional educational practices claim that there is no need for such theories; that the attempt to comprehend the process of learning through the construction of theories creates problems and inhibits personal freedom.Holzman, Lois (1997).
