==History==

The original WTUR was an AM radio station at Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts that was shut down by the FCC in the late 1960s when Tufts University students played a prank that violated the station's broadcasting regulations. The students ran a wire from the station's 20-watt transmitter to the MBTA commuter railroad tracks that run directly behind the studio building. The signal could be heard clearly as far as Quincy, Massachusetts 15 miles to the south, and as far north as Nashua, New Hampshire, more than 30 miles beyond the station's permitted broadcasting limits. After WTUR's license was revoked, the studios were reoccupied in 1970 by the FM freeform radio station WMFO.
In 1988 the call letters WTUR were licensed to a commercial FM radio station in Truro, Massachusetts. The station ran into opposition from local government who objected to a radio tower being built within town limits. The station now operates, without a tower, as WCDJ.
