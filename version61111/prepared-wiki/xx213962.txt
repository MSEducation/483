New Line Cinema introduced a twenty-four-hour "cinema tent," showing popular and cult films.  Wireless Internet access was provided by Cisco Systems.  There was a "comedy tent" featuring Jim Breuer as well as some lesser-known comedians and even daily yoga classes. Like 2004, rain marked each day of the festival. The children's area was provided by Kidz Jam.
