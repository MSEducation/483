[[The Dilbert Future]]

CATEGORIES: Dilbert books

The Dilbert Future (1997) is a book published by Scott Adams as a satire of humanity that breaks the net motivations of humanity down into stupidity, selfishness, and "horniness", and presents various ideas for profiting from human nature.  The final chapter invites the reader to ponder upon several open ended questions, such as the nature of gravity and the utility of affirmations, which are further addressed in Godâ€™s Debris.
Adams makes several "predictions" throughout the book intended for humorous effect. 
Scott Adams did publish in issue 15 of his Dilbert Newsletter (sent to all members of Dogbert's New Ruling Class) an excerpt from this book with permission  for it to be re-published (if kept with the copyright text).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dilbert.com/comics/dilbert/dnrc/html/newsletter15.html |title=Dilbert Newsletter #15 |accessdate=2007-09-01[/tpl]
Adams introduced the word confusopoly in this book. The word is a portmanteau of confusion and monopoly (or rather oligopoly), defining it as "a group of companies with similar products who intentionally confuse customers instead of competing on price". Examples of industries in which confusopolies exist (according to Adams) include telephone service, insurance, mortgage loans, banking, and financial services. Adams also explains his belief that positive affirmations can influence external events, claiming that this has worked for him in the past.
