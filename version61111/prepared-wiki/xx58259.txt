[tpl]nihongo|Kuririn|クリリン|[/tpl], spelled Krillin in Funimation's English anime dub, is a fictional character from the Dragon Ball manga series created by Akira Toriyama. He is introduced in chapter #25 [tpl]nihongo|A Rival? Arrival!!|ライバル？参上!!|Raibaru? Sanjō!![/tpl] first published in Weekly Shōnen Jump on June 3, 1985.Weekly Shōnen Jump #25 June 3, 1985 As the series progresses, Kuririn becomes Goku's closest ally. Although he is often depicted as the comic relief, he is the strongest human in Dragon Ball. He eventually starts a relationship with Android #18 and has a daughter named Marron.

==Design and appearance==

Toriyama originally created Kuririn along with the Tenka'ichi Budōkai as a method to help add depth to the story, as his editor Kazuhiko Torishima had stated that the series' protagonist, Goku, was too plain.[tpl]cite book |last=Toriyama|first=Akira|authorlink1= Akira Toriyama|title= ＤＲＡＧＯＮ　ＢＡＬＬ　大全集　➋「ＳＴＯＲＹ　ＧＵＩＤＥ」|date= August 9, 1995|publisher= Shueisha|isbn=4-08-782752-6|pages= 261–264|chapter= 鳥山明的超会見　第２回[/tpl] Like most characters in the series, the name Krillin is a pun. In his case, its Japanese source, Kuririn, is made up of two parts. The first two syllables come from 栗 (kuri), which means "chestnut" in reference to his shaved head (the "chestnut" pun is also carried over to his daughter Marron). The second part of his name comes from 少林 (Shōrin; "Shaolin" in Chinese), as his early character designs were closely modeled on Shaolin monks. Other beliefs are that his name comes from kuri-kuri/kurin-kurin (an onomatopoeia for something cute and round), kuri-kuri shita me (meaning "big round eyes"), or the words kurikuri (which can mean "bald") and rin (a word added to the end of a name to make it sound cute). During the Namek Saga, Krillin's name appears as Akira Toriyama spells it: Krillin is seen wearing a cap with "Kamesen" on it (an abbreviated form of Master Roshi's alternate name Kame-Sen'nin) with his Romaji name, Kulilin, right underneath it. He is also seen wearing a cap with the Japanese name for turtle, "KAME", on it.
Kuririn's appearance stays relatively the same for the majority of the series. He is first introduced at age 13, with a shaved head and still dressed in the yellow-and-orange clothing worn at the monastery at which he had been training. He does not possess a nose, and has six spots of moxibustion burns on his forehead, a reference to the practice of Shaolin monks. Toriyama once stated, seemingly humorously, that Kuririn's lack of a nose is because he has a "physical idiosyncrasy" that allows him to breath through the pores of his skin.[tpl]cite book |last1= Toriyama|first1= Akira|authorlink1= Akira Toriyama|title= Dragon Ball 冒険 Special|trans_title= Dragon Ball: Adventure Special|series= Dragon Ball|date= December 1, 1987|publisher= Shueisha|location= |language= Japanese|isbn= |page= 138 |chapter= |quote= [/tpl] Later, he wears the orange gi uniform that is presented to both himself and Goku by Kame-Sen'nin in honor of their first martial arts competition.Dragon Ball manga, volume 3, chapter ?

==Personality==

Originally a monk of the Orin Temple, after training there for eight years, Krillin came to Master Roshi and became a student of the Turtle School in his first appearance in the series. Originally a jealous and selfish person, Krillin did not respect rules when confronted with Roshi's training. After a short arch-rivalry between the two (Krillin even admitting that he hated Goku at first), he becomes Goku's best friend and his selfish and jealous personality becomes more kind-hearted and a lot more generous (although he still has slight selfish and jealous traits after his reform). Krillin is often used as comic relief or cannon fodder by the author, and has been killed the most amount of times in the Dragon Ball series. As the most prominent full-blooded human character in the Dragon Ball series, Krillin also represents a sense of normalcy to Goku and Gohan, as well as often being the most identifiable. Often when things in the Dragon World turn bizarre, it is left to Krillin to shake his head in disbelief and crack a joke. 
Krillin is brave, loyal and resourceful, and the audience identifies him as a good-natured underdog. Along with Yamcha, Krillin has also, arguably, adjusted to a relatively normal life better than many of his friends by seeking women in his life. He is among the more "normal" human of his friends, as he can be seen wearing normal clothes on days where he's not fighting, other than his typical martial arts dōgi, as well as engaging in other normal every-day activities such as watching TV, going to the beach, etc. In his role as the protagonist Goku's best friend, Krillin was among the only humans to remain a main character for the majority of the series, even as Master Roshi, Yamcha, Tien Shinhan, Chiaotzu, Yajirobe, Chi-Chi and others faded into the background.

==Plot overview==

Once there, they save a young Namekian called Dende from death at the hands of Freeza's henchmen.

This left Goku confused, until Kuririn explained that Android 18 is a cyborg (meaning she is human still), and she was able to have a baby with him. However, after learning of Goku's return from the afterlife to compete in the 25th Tenka'ichi Budōkai, he decides to also participate, after being encouraged to do so for the money by #18.

==Voice actors==

Kuririn is voiced by Mayumi Tanaka in the original Japanese anime and in all related media. Toriyama chose Tanaka after hearing her portrayal of the protagonist Giovanni in the film Night on the Galactic Railroad.[tpl]cite book |last1= Toriyama|first1= Akira|authorlink1= Akira Toriyama|title= Dragon Ball 大全集 3 TV Animation Part 1|trans_title= Dragon Ball Great Complete Collection 3 TV Animation Part 1|series= Dragon Ball|date= September 9, 1995|publisher= Shueisha|location= |language= Japanese|isbn= 4-08-782753-4|page= 202|chapter= 鳥山明的超会見|trans_chapter= Akira Toriyama Super Interview[/tpl] When Dragon Ball received a short-lived English dub by Saban Entertainment, Funimation Entertainment, and Ocean Productions in the mid 1990s, Krillin would be voiced by Terry Klassen. He would reprise his role in the Ocean dub of the latter half of the series produced by AB Groupe for European and Canadian markets. In the Blue Water 2003 re-dub of Dragon Ball, he is voiced by Mike Thiessen. Dan Gascon voiced him in the Blue Water dub of Dragon Ball GT. When the series' full production was taken over by Funimation in the US, Krillin would be voiced by Laurie Steele as a child in Dragon Ball and Sonny Strait as an adult in all media released to the US.

==Abilities==

Kuririn has many abilities including, super-strength, super-speed, and the ability to fly using his ki energy, known as [tpl]nihongo|Bukū-jutsu|舞空術||lit. "Air Dance Technique"[/tpl]. His main techniques include the [tpl]nihongo|Kamehameha|かめはめ波||lit. "Turtle Destruction Wave"[/tpl], an attack he learned from Roshi, which enables him to emit a powerful ki energy blast from his hands.Dragon Ball manga, volume 11, chapter ? [tpl]nihongo|Kakusandan|拡散弾||lit. "Scattershots"[/tpl], another chi attack, involves firing two blasts, one from each hand, and merging them before directing the blast above an opponent where it will break up and rain down on them, he was only seen using this twice—the first time was very successful as he managed to wipe out three Saibamen with it. From Tenshinhan, he obtained the [tpl]nihongo|Taiyōken|太陽拳||lit. "Solar Fist", renamed "Solar Flare" in the English anime dub[/tpl], an attack Kuririn is capable of using to blind his opponents, sometimes used to make a quick escape.Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 6, chapter ? One of his signature techniques is the [tpl]nihongo|Kienzan|気円斬||lit. "Energy Disc Razor", renamed "Destructo Disc" in the English anime dub[/tpl], where he puts a hand in the air to create an electric floating disc, using it to slice through his enemies. Lacking the other protagonists' "advantage" of getting better every time he is injured, Kuririn is however recognized as having great technique by Vegeta (a rather impressive fact considering how the said character respects none but himself) and of being the strongest human on Earth by Yamcha, though he does say this to Krillin's daughter Marron.
