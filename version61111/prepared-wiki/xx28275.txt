The Eurovision Song Contest 1968 was the 13th Eurovision Song Contest. The contest was won by the Spanish song "La, la, la", performed by Massiel.  Originally Spain entered Joan Manuel Serrat to sing "La La La", but his demand to sing in Catalan was an affront to Francoist Spain. Serrat was withdrawn and replaced by Massiel, who sang the same song in Spanish.[tpl]cite web|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1968|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=285|publisher=EBU|accessdate=16 June 2012[/tpl]

==Location==

Located on the River Thames, London is the capital city of England and the United Kingdom, the largest metropolitan area in the United Kingdom, and the largest urban zone in the Europe by most measures.  London has been a major settlement for two millennia, its history going back to its founding by the Romans, who named it Londinium.[tpl]cite web|url=http://classic-web.archive.org/web/20080622181424/http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/English/EventsExhibitions/Permanent/RomanLondon.htm|title=Roman|publisher=The Museum of London|accessdate=7 June 2008[/tpl]
The 1968 venue was the Royal Albert Hall, a concert hall situated on the northern edge of the South Kensington area, in the City of Westminster, London, England, best known for holding the annual summer Proms concerts since 1941.
Since its opening by Queen Victoria in 1871, the world's leading artists from several performance genres have appeared on its stage and it has become one of the UK's most treasured and distinctive buildings. Each year it hosts more than 350 events including classical concerts, rock and pop, ballet and opera, sports, award ceremonies, school and community events, charity performances and banquets.
The hall was originally supposed to have been called The Central Hall of Arts and Sciences, but the name was changed by Queen Victoria to Royal Albert Hall of Arts and Sciences when laying the foundation stone as a dedication to her deceased husband and consort Prince Albert. It forms the practical part of a national memorial to the Prince Consort – the decorative part is the Albert Memorial directly to the north in Kensington Gardens, now separated from the Hall by the road Kensington Gore.

===Vote rigging allegations===

In May 2008, a documentary by Spanish film-maker Montse Fernández Villa, 1968. Yo viví el mayo español, centred on the effects of May 1968 in Francoist Spain,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.publico.es/culturas/077345/massiel/si/madelman/no/asi/mayo/68/espana|title=Massiel sí, Madelman no: así fue el Mayo del 68 en España|date=3 May 2008|publisher=Público |language=Spanish|accessdate=3 December 2009[/tpl] and alleged that the 1968 Eurovision Song Contest was rigged by the Spanish dictator Francisco Franco, who would have sent state television officials across Europe offering cash and promising to buy television series and contract unknown artists.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/375057/tongo/eurovision/massiel/|title=TVE 'compró' los votos para que Massiel ganará Eurovisión|date=5 May 2008|publisher=20 minutos|language=Spanish|accessdate=3 December 2009[/tpl] The allegation was based on a testimony by journalist José María Íñigo, a TVE employee at the time, who claimed the rigging was common knowledge and suggested that Spanish record label representatives offered to release albums by Bulgarian and Czech artists (neither Bulgaria nor Czechoslovakia were members of the European Broadcasting Union at the time).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/375709/massiel/eurovision/franco/|title=Vea el vídeo donde José Maríá Iñigo 'descubre' a Massiel|date=5 May 2008|publisher=20 minutos|language=Spanish|accessdate=3 December 2009[/tpl]
The documentary claimed that the contest should in fact have been won by the United Kingdom's entry – "Congratulations" performed by Cliff Richard – which finished second by one vote.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/1926993/How-General-Franco-cheated-Cliff-Richard-out-of-Eurovision-title.html|title=How Franco cheated Cliff out of Eurovision title|last=Govan|first=Fiona|date=4 May 2008|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=26 April 2012[/tpl] Massiel, the performer of the winning entry, was outraged by the allegations, and claimed that if there had been fixes, "other singers, who were more keen on Franco's regime, would have benefited". José María Iñigo, author of the statement in the documentary, personally apologized to Massiel and said that he had repeated a widespread rumour. Both Massiel and Iñigo accused television channel La Sexta, broadcaster of the documentary, of manufacturing the scandal.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2008/05/05/television/1210021065.html|title=Massiel e Iñigo acusan a La Sexta de "urdir todo para favorecer a Chiquilicuatre"|date=6 May 2008|publisher=El Mundo|language=Spanish|accessdate=3 December 2009[/tpl]
