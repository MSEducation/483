==History==

Aisymi dates back to the ancient times as an ancient settlement.[tpl]cn|date=December 2011[/tpl] With the rest of Western Thrace, it was ruled by the Ottoman Empire since the 14th century. It remained under Turkish rule until the Balkan Wars of 1913. At that time, Aisymi (then known as Doğanhisar, Dugan Hisar in Bulgarian) was a Bulgarian speaking village like many parts of today's Evros prefecture. The population in 1912 consisted of 400 Bulgarians.
After a brief period of Bulgarian rule between 1913 and 1919, it became part of Greece. As a result its Bulgarian and Turkish population was exchanged with Greek refugees, mainly from today's Turkey.
