Baihao Yinzhen ([tpl]zh|t=白 毫 銀 針|s=白 毫 银 针[/tpl]), also known as White Hair Silver Needle, is a white tea produced in Fujian Province in China.[tpl]cite book|last=Huang|first=Lingyun|title=Tao of Chinese tea: A cultural and practical guide|year=2009|publisher=Reader's Digest Association|location=Pleasantville|isbn=9781606520505|page=79[/tpl] Amongst white teas, this is the most expensive variety and the most prized, as only top buds (leaf shoots) are used to produce the tea.陳宗懋，中國茶經，pp 236，上海文化出版社，1992 Genuine Silver Needles are made from cultivars of the Da Bai (Large White) tea tree family.[tpl] cite web | work=The Tea Guardian | title=Lightly Oxidized: White Teas: Silver Needles | url=http://teaguardian.com/Tea_Varieties/white_silverneedles.html | accessdate=28 December 2010[/tpl] It is important to point out that there are other productions that look similar with downy leaf shoots but most are green teas,[tpl] cite web | work=The Tea Guardian | title=White Teas: Health & Market Notes | url=http://teaguardian.com/nature_of_tea/whites_health.html | accessdate=28 December 2010[/tpl] and as green teas, they taste differently and have a different biochemical potency than the genuine white tea Silver Needle.袁弟順，中國白茶，廈門大學出版社，2006 It is commonly included among the China famous teas.

==Production Processing==

A genuine Silver Needle is a white tea. As such, it is only lightly oxidized.[ref]Joseph Needham, Science and Civilization of China, V.6, P.V,
Fermentations and Food Science, pp551, Cambridge University Press, 2000[/ref] The best productions are from the first flushes, which generally take place between late March to early April, when the year's first new buds "flush". For the production of Silver Needle, only the leaf shoots, i.e. the leaf buds before opening, are plucked.陳宗懋，中國茶經，pp 426-427，上海文化出版社，1992 Unlike the plucking of green tea, the ideal time and weather for plucking white tea is a sunny morning when the sun is high enough to have dried any remaining moisture on the buds.
Traditionally, the plucks are laid in shallow baskets to wilt under the sun for an extended period, and the best quality produced today are still made this way.[tpl] cite web | work=The Tea Guardian | title=White & Other Lightly Oxidized Teas | url=http://teaguardian.com/nature_of_tea/whites.html | accessdate=28 December 2010[/tpl] To avoid loss due to sudden rain, gusts, or other accidents, some producers are taking the plucks indoor to wilt in a chamber with artificial warm air flow. The softened shoots are then piled for the required enzyme oxidation (often incorrectly referred to as fermentation) before they are taken for a low temperature bake-dry.
Two regions, Zhenghe and Fuding, spanning the north to north-eastern parts of the Fujian province are the major and original producers of this tea, although neighboring counties have also been producing. The two major cultivars employed by these regions are Fuding Da Bai and Zhenghe Da Bai, named after their origins. These differences are important to distinguish the two major styles of Silver Needles — the Zhenghe style and the Fuding style. The former is usually a lot darker, with significantly longer piled-up time for oxidation, yielding a tea with fuller body than the latter style, which is generally lighter with shorter oxidation. The character of the tea tree leaves of the former allows for the extended piled-up time without turning bad. Both styles have their own group of followers, as taste is a rather personal preference.

==Tasting and brewing==

As with all white teas, it is best prepared with water below boiling (at around 75 to 80 degrees Celsius[tpl]cite web|title=Brewing Tips and Tea Information|url=http://www.adoretea.com.au/Tea-Brewing-Tips-How-To-Make-Perfect-Tea-7.html|publisher=ADORE TEA|accessdate=17 February 2014[/tpl]  or 167 to 176 degrees Fahrenheit) and produces a slightly viscous glittering pale yellow color with evidence of floating white hairs that reflect light. The flavor and fragrance should be delicate, light, fresh, and sweet. Steeping should be longer than other white teas; up to 5 minutes per brew, and the volume of tea to be used can be higher.[tpl] cite web | work=The Tea Guardian | title=On Measurement | url=http://teaguardian.com/tea_preparation/measurements1.html | accessdate=28 December 2010[/tpl] There are few parallels to be drawn as the taste is not similar to any other teas but Bai Mu Dan, except the latter is fuller but not as sweet and delicate.
