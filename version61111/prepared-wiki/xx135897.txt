The cathedral overlooks the Wallis lagoon from Mata-Utu, which is the largest town and capital of Wallis Island and the territory as a whole. The Palace of the King of Uvéa, which features two-storey verandas, adjoins the cathedral. On the opposite side of the wharf is a platform known as Fale Fono which was used by Chief of the local tribes to address people. Several restaurants, markets, hotels and the post office are near the cathedral.[tpl]cite book|author=David Stanley|title=Moon Handbooks South Pacific|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=EDGapfBX-CAC&pg=PA567|accessdate=6 May 2013|publisher=David Stanley|isbn=978-1-56691-411-6|pages=567–[/tpl]
