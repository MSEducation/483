After his retirement from fencing competition, he studied under Prof. Roger Crosnier and was appointed the first official British National Coach, in charge of the National Training System, the day he was awarded his full Professorship. He succeeded Prof. Crosnier as President of the British Academy of Fencing. During the late 1950s to the 1970s he travelled around Britain, and between fencing courses he combined his official duties with television and film work. Eventually emigrating to Canada, he went on to become technical director of the Canadian Fencing Association in Ottawa.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-207_162-57350921/movie-sword-fight-master-bob-anderson-dies/ |title=Movie sword-fight master Bob Anderson dies|work=CBS News |date=2 January 2012 |accessdate=2 January 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ottawacitizen.com/entertainment/movie-guide/lived+sword/5937842/story.html|title=He lived by the sword|work=The Ottawa Citizen|date=2 January 2012 |accessdate=2 January 2012[/tpl]  During the 1960s and 1970s he was also the president of the British Academy of Fencing.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/03/movies/bob-anderson-sword-fight-choreographer-dies-at-89.html|title=Bob Anderson, Sword Master, Dies at 89|work=New York Times|date=2 January 2012 |accessdate=2 January 2012|first=Bruce|last=Weber[/tpl]
Anderson's cinema career began in 1953 when he choreographed fights for and coached Errol Flynn in The Master of Ballantrae. During rehearsal for a scene he accidentally slashed Flynn on his thigh, leading to notoriety in Hollywood as "the man who stabbed Errol Flynn". He went on to work as a stunt performer and/or fight choreographer in films such as The Guns of Navarone and the Bond films From Russia With Love and Casino Royale. His stature in Hollywood was cemented when he was selected by Stanley Kubrick in 1974 to act as the sword master for Barry Lyndon.
Anderson subsequently went on to be involved in all three[tpl]cn|date=February 2014[/tpl] of the original Star Wars films. Anderson did not receive much recognition for his work for years after their initial release. Mark Hamill in 1983 revealed, "Bob Anderson was the man who actually did Vader's fighting. It was always supposed to be a secret, but I finally told George I didn't think it was fair any more. Bob worked so bloody hard that he deserves some recognition. It's ridiculous to preserve the myth that it's all done by one man." Anderson in 1994 specified that for The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi he staged the light-saber duels and also wore the Vader costume in fight scenes.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20471622_302164,00.html | title = British Olympic fencer Bob Anderson trains actors for 'The Three Musketeers' | authorlink=Frank Lovece| first= Frank | last= Lovece | work = Entertainment Weekly | issue= 221 | date= May 6, 1994[/tpl] Published under title "Giving Some Pointers". David Prowse, who played Vader, said he did his own swordplay in Star Wars but afterward, "having one of the principals do his own stunts made filmmakers very weird from an insurance point of view."
Anderson continued to work in cinema for the next 30 years, and was responsible for the swordsmanship in many films, including Highlander, The Princess Bride, The Three Musketeers, The Mask of Zorro, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl and The Lord of the Rings film trilogy. Shortly before his death he was working on The Hobbit. He had a reputation for being a perfectionist, with director Martin Campbell giving him the nickname "Grumpy Bob". Anderson was interviewed at length for the 2009 documentary on cinematic sword-fighting, Reclaiming the Blade, where he commented, "I never took up the sword, I think the sword took me up."
