[[Clontarf (ship)]]

CATEGORIES: Clippers

The Clontarf was an immigration clipper ship which sailed from England to New Zealand between 1858 and 1860 on commission for the Canterbury Provincial Government. Sailing under the flag of Willis, Gann and Co, its first voyage sailed from Plymouth 20 September 1858, and after a journey of 105 days arrived at Lyttelton on 5 January 1859 with 412 immigrants. With one successful run complete it returned to England to collect its next passengers. On 30 November 1859 The Clontarf left London with 430 people on board. This voyage met with unforgiving bad weather, and a rampant plague of measles, whooping cough and tropical diseases swept mercilessly through the ship. It arrived at Lyttelton after 105 days with many fatalities. On a normal voyage for any other immigration ship of that time it was expected that up to five people may die from frailty, accident or birth at sea. On the second voyage of the Clontarf 41 people perished. Among the dead were five adults, but it was the large amount of children death that was to give Clontarf her infamy. Thirty-six children died on board. 
Due to her reputation immigrants chose not to sail on her again, and she was officially dismissed of her duties of ferrying immigrants to New Zealand in 1861.
