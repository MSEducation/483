The 2008 Irish flash floods were a series of flash floods that occurred across the island of Ireland in August 2008. The floods and related weather conditions primarily affected the following counties; Limerick, Cork, Dublin, Antrim, Carlow, Galway, Laois, Louth, Meath, Kildare, Kilkenny, Tipperary, Offaly, Sligo and Donegal. Parts of Ireland's large urban centres, including Dublin and Belfast, were submerged, whilst Carlow town has experienced some of the worst flooding in the country. One person died; 31-year-old Polish dad-of-one Przemyslaw Jablonski. He went missing in the River Fergus, in Ennis, and was found 6 days later (on 18 August) in the same river. He was pronounced dead at the scene.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/0818/ennis.html|title=Body recovered from River Fergus|date=18 August 2008|accessdate=20 August 2008|publisher=RTÉ[/tpl]

==Conditions before the floods==

Rainfall in Cork for the month of July 2008 was the heaviest recorded since 1975. The combined total for June and July was more than twice the normal level of rainfall expected for that time period. Around the country the weather was wetter than normal for July with exceptional rainfall in County Limerick in the last 24 hours of July giving rise to this figure. Met Éireann described July as "a dull month generally". The highest average temperature recorded in July was 15.7 degrees (Shannon Airport); the same location also enjoyed the warmest day of the month at 25.2 degrees on 24 July. The lowest air temperature since the early 1970s was recorded at Mullingar during July –  a figure of 3.6 degrees was recorded on the 5th. The greatest level of sunshine was in the east of the country – Dublin Airport recorded 156 hours of sunshine – whilst the lowest level of rainfall was recorded at Belmullet – 54 millimetres fell during July.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2008/0801/breaking45.html?via=rel|title=July rainfall in Cork heaviest since 1975|date=1 August 2008|accessdate=20 August 2008|publisher=The Irish Times[/tpl]

==Timeline of events==

===1 August===

County Limerick and County Cork were the first areas to be affected. On the night of 31 July/August 1, the River Blackwater in Cork burst its banks, causing severe flooding between Banteer and Mallow. Cork County Council issued a flood warning for Mallow on the morning of the 1st whilst council staff distributed sandbags. Bridge Street in Mallow was closed for a time but later reopened for motorist use. The Town Park Road in Mallow was closed for a longer period. Flood relief works had been ongoing in Mallow for six months but were not expected to finish for another 18 months. Further downstream, floodwaters reached Fermoy at around 10 pm.
In Limerick, it took several hours before electricity was restored to 3,000 homes in Newcastle West, where a major clear-up operation was underway after the River Arra burst its banks earlier in the morning. Up to 20 homes were badly affected by "freak" flash flooding overnight, with residents having to be rescued from their houses. There were few injuries; although an elderly woman was airlifted from her home and immediately diagnosed with hypothermia. Met Éireann said that the average rainfall for the last week of July was about 26mm – three times that amount dropped between 7 pm and midnighton 31 July in Newcastle West. At one rainfall station in the area, a measurement of 90.1mm was recorded in that time. Around 100mm of rain would be expected in one month. The rainfall was said to be "tropical-like in intensity".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2008/0801/breaking21.htm|title=Cork and Limerick suffer severe flooding|date=1 August 2008|accessdate=20 August 2008|publisher=The Irish Times[/tpl] Limerick County Council issued a public drinking water notice residents of Newcastle West to boil their water before use.

In Dublin, it was reported that one vehicle was swept down a road in a torrent of flood water.

He claimed that, between 4 pm and midnight, 800 calls were taken with 600 of these flood-related, going on to say: “We’ve never had anything like that. We wouldn’t generally get that many calls on Halloween.”[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.examiner.ie/breaking/ireland/mhqlmhkfmhey/|title=Flash floods damage homes and cars amid chaos|date=10 August 2008|accessdate=26 August 2008|publisher=Irish Examiner[/tpl] Hundreds of Armagh Gaelic football fans, attending the All-Ireland quarter-final at Croke Park, were stranded by torrential rain when they left the stadium to discover their cars surrounded by water.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/7552251.stm|title=Clean-up after city flash floods|date=10 August 2008|accessdate=26 August 2008|publisher=BBC| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080811012431/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/7552251.stm| archivedate= 11 August 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] The rain prompted GAA officials in Croke Park to turn on the floodlights for the second half of the All-Ireland quarter final between Kerry and Galway in what was to be the first ever floodlight championship game in Croke park, the game was described by many as the greatest game of pure vintage football played in Croke Park in the 2000s (decade) despite the worst rain in Irish history.Kerry 1–21 Galway 1–16

In Northern Ireland, three teenagers from County Down were rescued from the Mourne Mountains in the middle of torrential rainfall. The three girls, aged between 15 and 17, awoke at 05:00 to discover their campsite had been washed away, with a swollen river determining the need for mountain rescue. The chairman of the Mourne Rescue Service, Ed Kilgore had this to say:  "If they had decided to try to get across the river it could have been nasty"  and said the girls were "wet, miserable and relieved" upon rescue. The girls were met by relatives at the foot of the mountain, with dry clothes given out by the rescue team. Elsewhere in the county, a man in his early 40s was killed as a result of a two-vehicle collision near Crossgar, with heavy rain blamed for the treacherous driving conditions. Five other motorists had to be pulled from their vehicles near Moira when flood waters entrapped them.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2008/0813/1218477455157.html?via=rel|title=Down badly affected by rainfall|date=13 August 2008|accessdate=20 August 2008|publisher=The Irish Times[/tpl]

===18 August===

Carlow town remained the worst affected area by the flash floods. Roads were flooded in County Offaly, County Tipperary, County Kilkenny, County Laois and County Galway. Parts of Carlow town were under almost two metres of flood water after the River Barrow burst its banks following heavy rainfall. Approximately 100 people spent the night in a hotel when they had to evacuate their apartment block on Centaur Street. Others were ferried to and from work in the morning by the Civil Defence. Minister for the Environment John Gormley, visited Carlow to view the crisis, and said that the contract for flood defences would proceed "as quickly as possible". Staff at Winnie Dalgarno's flooded pet store in Graiguecullen had to take animals home when electricity was switched off. Winnie said: "We have lost a few reptiles, our birds have been badly affected, we had 20 hamsters floating, I have had to put rabbits in bird cages."Irish Daily Mirror, Tues 19 August 2008, page 9
In County Offaly, the Fire Service and the Civil Defence assisted residents of the Whitehall Estate in Tullamore after the nearby river burst its banks. A number of homes were flooded, but the estate was not evacuated. The organisers of Fleadh Cheoil na hÉireann, which was taking place that week in Tullamore, said they were "coping with the bad weather". Some campsites had to be moved to temporary locations in the wake of the floods.
In Ennis, the body of 31-year-old cook and father-of-one, Przemyslaw Jablonski was recovered from the River Fergus. He was pronounced dead at the scene.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/0814/ennis.html|title=River Fergus search for missing man|date=18 August 2008|accessdate=20 August 2008|publisher=RTÉ[/tpl] Meath County Council advised people in Athboy to boil all water they used from the mains supply. Supply was shut down as a precautionary measure after a local river burst its banks, threatening to contaminate the drinking water supply.
Eircom reported nearly 4,300 faults over the previous weekend, with 6,500 reported faults that day. The worst affected areas included Clontarf, Blanchardstown, Phibsboro, Portmarnock, Leixlip and Clane.
Flooding at Portadown caused delays of up to 90 minutes on the Dublin to Belfast train service.

===19 August===

Drinking water was delivered to hundreds of households in County Sligo where flood water caused problems with the fresh water supply. Sligo County Council issued notice for people to boil water before use. Boil notices were also in place in parts of County Meath – Athboy, Kildalkey and Ráth Cairn – following the bursting of a river's banks. Speaking on RTÉ Radio's News at One, Environment Minister John Gormley said despite the economic downturn, money would be made available to provide flood defences for Carlow whose flood waters were subsiding (although a number of streets remained closed with dozens of residents who were forced to leave their apartments still being housed in temporary accommodation). The Office of Public Works said that contracts for flood defence systems would soon be finalised for towns such as Mallow, Ennis and Clonmel. Speaking on Morning Ireland, Tom Sherlock, principal officer of engineering services at the OPW, expressed confidence that new flood defence schemes already in place in some towns would hold for many years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/0819/floods.html|title=Drinking water sent to flood-hit Sligo|date=19 August 2008|accessdate=20 August 2008|publisher=RTÉ| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080828034522/http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/0819/floods.html| archivedate= 28 August 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
