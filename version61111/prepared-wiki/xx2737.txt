The four points where these axes cross the ellipse are the vertices and are marked as a, −a, b, and −b. In addition to being at the largest and smallest distance from the center, these points are where the curvature of the ellipse is maximum and minimum.[ref]

The two foci  (plural of focus and the term focal points is also used) of an ellipse are two special points F1 and F2  on the ellipse's major axis that are equidistant from the center point. The sum of the distances from any point P on the ellipse to those two foci is constant and equal to the major axis (PF1 + PF2 = 2a). (On the figure to the right this corresponds to the sum of the two green lines equaling the length of the major axis that goes from −a to a.)
The distance to the focal point from the center of the ellipse is sometimes called the linear eccentricity, f, of the ellipse. Here it is denoted by f, but it is often denoted by c. Due to the Pythagorean theorem and the definition of the ellipse explained in the previous paragraph: f2 = a2 −b2.
A second equivalent method of constructing an ellipse using a directrix is shown on the plot as the three blue lines. (See the Directrix section of this article for more information about this method). The dashed blue line is the directrix of the ellipse shown.
The eccentricity of an ellipse, usually denoted by ε or e, is the ratio of the distance between the two foci, to the length of the major axis or e = 2f/2a = f/a. For an ellipse the eccentricity is between 0 and 1 (0 2) from any particular point on an ellipse to one of the foci to the perpendicular distance to the directrix from the same point (line PD), e = PF2/PD.

==Drawing ellipses==

===Pins-and-string method===

The characterization of an ellipse as the locus of points so that sum of the distances to the foci is constant leads to a method of drawing one using two drawing pins, a length of string, and a pencil.[tpl]harvnb|Besant|1907|p=57[/tpl] In this method, pins are pushed into the paper at two points which will become the ellipse's foci. A string tied at each end to the two pins and the tip of a pen is used to pull the loop taut so as to form a triangle.  The tip of the pen will then trace an ellipse if it is moved while keeping the string taut. Using two pegs and a rope, this procedure is traditionally used by gardeners to outline an elliptical flower bed; thus it is called the gardener's ellipse.

===Trammel method===

An ellipse can also be drawn using a ruler, a set square, and a pencil:
The trammel of Archimedes or ellipsograph is a mechanical device that implements this principle. The ruler is replaced by a rod with a pencil holder (point C) at one end, and two adjustable side pins (points A and B) that slide into two perpendicular slots cut into a metal plate.[tpl]cite book |first=Henry T. |last=Brown |title=Five Hundred and Seven Mechanical Movements: Embracing All Those which are Most Important in Dynamics, Hydraulics, Hydrostatics, Pneumatics, Steam Engines, Mill and Other Gearing, Presses, Horology, and Miscellaneous Machinery; and Including Many Movements Never Before Published, and Several which Have Only Recently Come Into Use |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=TFwOAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA41 |year=1881 |publisher=Brown & Brown |pages=40–41 section 152[/tpl] The mechanism can be used with a router to cut ellipses from board material.  The mechanism is also used in a toy called the "nothing grinder".

===Parallelogram method===

In the parallelogram method, an ellipse is constructed point by point using equally spaced points on two horizontal lines and equally spaced points on two vertical lines. It is based on Steiner's theorem on the generation of conic sections.  Similar methods exist for the parabola and hyperbola.

===Approximations to ellipses===

An ellipse of low eccentricity can be represented reasonably accurately by a circle with its centre offset.  To draw the orbit with a pair of compasses the centre of the circle should be offset from the focus by an amount equal to the eccentricity multiplied by the radius.
 

==Mathematical definitions and properties==

===In Euclidean geometry===

====Definition====

In Euclidean geometry, the ellipse is usually defined as the bounded case of a conic section, or as the set of points such that the sum of the distances to two fixed points (the foci) is constant. The ellipse can also be defined as the set of points such that the distance from any point in that set to a given point in the plane (a focus) is a constant positive fraction less than 1 (the eccentricity) of the perpendicular distance of the point in the set to a given line (called the directrix). Yet another equivalent definition of the ellipse is that it is the set of points that are equidistant from one point in the plane (a focus) and a particular circle, the directrix circle (whose center is the other focus).
The equivalence of these definitions can be proved using the Dandelin spheres.

====Equations====

The equation of an ellipse whose major and minor axes coincide with the Cartesian axes is
This means any noncircular ellipse is a compressed (or stretched) circle. If a circle is treated like an ellipse, then the area of the ellipse would be proportional to the length of either axis (i.e. doubling the length of an axis in a circular ellipse would create an ellipse with double the area of the original circle).

====Focus====

The distance from the center C to either focus is f = ae, which can be expressed in terms of the major and minor radii:

====Eccentricity====

Other formulas for the eccentricity of an ellipse are listed in the article on eccentricity of conic sections.
Formulas for the eccentricity of an ellipse that is expressed in the more general quadratic form are described in the article dedicated to conic sections.

====Directrix====

Each focus F of the ellipse is associated with a line parallel to the minor axis called a directrix. Refer to the illustration on the right, in which the ellipse is centered at the origin. The distance from any point P on the ellipse to the focus F is a constant fraction of that point's perpendicular distance to the directrix, resulting in the equality e = PF/PD. The ratio of these two distances is the eccentricity of the ellipse. This property (which can be proved using the Dandelin spheres) can be taken as another definition of the ellipse. 
Besides the well-known ratio e = f/a, where f is the distance from the center to the focus and a is the distance from the center to a vertex (most sharply curved point of the ellipse), it is also true that e = a/d, where d is the distance from the center to the directrix.

====Circular directrix====

The ellipse can also be defined as the set of points that are equidistant from one focus and a circle, the directrix circle, that is centered on the other focus. The radius of the directrix circle equals the ellipse's major axis, so the focus and the entire ellipse are inside the directrix circle.

====Ellipse as hypotrochoid====

The ellipse is a special case of the hypotrochoid when R = 2r.

====Area====

where a and b are the semi-major and semi-minor axes (½ of the ellipse's major and minor axes), respectively.
The area formula πab is easy to understand: start with a circle of radius b
(so its area is πb2) and stretch it by a factor a/b to make an ellipse.
This increases the area by the same factor: πb2(a/b) = πab.
The area formula can also be proven in terms of polar coordinates using the coordinate transformation
We now integrate over the ellipse to find the area:

====Circumference====

may be evaluated directly using the
Carlson symmetric form.  This gives a succinct and rapidly converging method for evaluating the circumference.

A good approximation is Ramanujan's:

For the special case where the minor axis is half the major axis, these become:
or, as an estimate of the better approximation,
More generally, the arc length of a portion of the circumference, as a function of the angle subtended, is given by an incomplete elliptic integral.
The inverse function, the angle subtended as a function of the arc length, is given by the elliptic functions.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2010[/tpl]

====Chords====

The midpoints of a set of parallel chords of an ellipse are collinear.Chakerian, G. D. "A Distorted View of Geometry." Ch. 7 in Mathematical Plums (R. Honsberger, editor). Washington, DC: Mathematical Association of America, 1979.[tpl]rp|p.147[/tpl]

=====Latus rectum=====

The chords of an ellipse which are perpendicular to the major axis and pass through one of its foci are called the latera recta of the ellipse. The length of each latus rectum is [tpl]math|[tpl]sfrac|2b2|a[/tpl][/tpl].

=====Curvature=====

===In projective geometry===

In projective geometry, an ellipse can be defined as the set of all points of intersection between corresponding lines of two pencils of lines which are related by a projective map (see Steiner's theorem). By projective duality, an ellipse can be defined also as the envelope of all lines that connect corresponding points of two lines which are related by a projective map.
This definition also generates hyperbolae and parabolae.  However, in projective geometry every conic section is equivalent to an ellipse.  A parabola is an ellipse that is tangent to the line at infinity Ω, and the hyperbola is an ellipse that crosses Ω.
An ellipse is also the result of projecting a circle, sphere, or ellipse in three dimensions onto a plane, by parallel lines.  It is also the result of conical (perspective) projection of any of those geometric objects from a point O onto a plane P, provided that the plane Q that goes through O and is parallel to P does not cut the object.  The image of an ellipse by any affine map is an ellipse, and so is the image of an ellipse by any projective map M such that the line M−1(Ω) does not touch or cross the ellipse.

To distinguish the degenerate cases from the non-degenerate case, let ∆ be the determinant
that is,
Then the ellipse is a non-degenerate real ellipse if and only if C∆  0, we have an imaginary ellipse, and if ∆ = 0, we have a point ellipse.Lawrence, J. Dennis, A Catalog of Special Plane Curves, Dover Publ., 1972.[tpl]rp|p.63[/tpl]

====Canonical form====

by factors a and b along the two axes.
For an ellipse in canonical form, we have

====General parametric form====

====Parametric form in canonical position====

For an ellipse in canonical position (center at origin, major axis along the X-axis), the equation simplifies to 

====Polar form relative to center====

====Reflexive property====

When a ray of light originating from one focus reflects off the inner surface of an ellipse, it always passes through the other focus.

====Polar form relative to focus====

====General polar form====

The following equation on the polar coordinates (r, θ) describes a general ellipse with semidiameters a and b,  centered at a point (r0, θ0), with the a axis rotated by φ relative to the polar axis:[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]

====Angular eccentricity====

===Degrees of freedom===

An ellipse in the plane has five degrees of freedom (the same as a general conic section), defining its position, orientation, shape, and scale. In comparison, circles have only three degrees of freedom (position and scale), while parabolae have four. Said another way, the set of all ellipses in the plane, with any natural metric (such as the Hausdorff distance) is a five-dimensional manifold. These degrees can be identified with, for example, the coefficients A,B,C,D,E of the implicit equation, or with the coefficients Xc, Yc, φ, a, b of the general parametric form.

==Ellipses in physics==

===Elliptical reflectors and acoustics===

If the water's surface is disturbed at one focus of an elliptical water tank, the circular waves created by that disturbance, after being reflected by the walls, will converge simultaneously to a single point — the second focus.  This is a consequence of the total travel length being the same along any wall-bouncing path between the two foci.
Similarly, if a light source is placed at one focus of an elliptic mirror, all light rays on the plane of the ellipse are reflected to the second focus.  Since no other smooth curve has such a property, it can be used as an alternative definition of an ellipse. (In the special case of a circle with a source at its center all light would be reflected back to the center.)  If the ellipse is rotated along its major axis to produce an ellipsoidal mirror (specifically, a prolate spheroid), this property will hold for all rays out of the source.  Alternatively, a cylindrical mirror with elliptical cross-section can be used to focus light from a linear fluorescent lamp along a line of the paper; such mirrors are used in some document scanners.
Sound waves are reflected in a similar way, so in a large elliptical room a person standing at one focus can hear a person standing at the other focus remarkably well.  The effect is even more evident under a vaulted roof shaped as a section of a prolate spheroid.  Such a room is called a whisper chamber.  The same effect can be demonstrated with two reflectors shaped like the end caps of such a spheroid, placed facing each other at the proper distance.   Examples are the National Statuary Hall at the United States Capitol (where John Quincy Adams is said to have used this property for eavesdropping on political matters); the Mormon Tabernacle at Temple Square in Salt Lake City, Utah; at an exhibit on sound at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago; in front of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Foellinger Auditorium; and also at a side chamber of the Palace of Charles V, in the Alhambra.

===Planetary orbits===

In the 17th century, Johannes Kepler discovered that the orbits along which the planets travel around the Sun are ellipses with the Sun at one focus, in his first law of planetary motion. Later, Isaac Newton explained this as a corollary of his law of universal gravitation.
More generally, in the gravitational two-body problem, if the two bodies are bound to each other (i.e., the total energy is negative), their orbits are similar ellipses with the common barycenter being one of the foci of each ellipse. The other focus of either ellipse has no known physical significance. Interestingly, the orbit of either body in the reference frame of the other is also an ellipse, with the other body at one focus.
Keplerian elliptical orbits are the result of any radially directed attraction force whose strength is inversely proportional to the square of the distance.  Thus, in principle, the motion of two oppositely charged particles in empty space would also be an ellipse. (However, this conclusion ignores losses due to electromagnetic radiation and quantum effects which become significant when the particles are moving at high speed.)
where

===Harmonic oscillators===

The general solution for a harmonic oscillator in two or more dimensions is also an ellipse.  Such is the case, for instance, of a long pendulum that is free to move in two dimensions; of a mass attached to a fixed point by a perfectly elastic spring; or of any object that moves under influence of an attractive force that is directly proportional to its distance from a fixed attractor.  Unlike Keplerian orbits, however, these "harmonic orbits" have the center of attraction at the geometric center of the ellipse, and have fairly simple equations of motion.

===Phase visualization===

In electronics, the relative phase of two sinusoidal signals can be compared by feeding them to the vertical and horizontal inputs of an oscilloscope. If the  display is an ellipse, rather than a straight line, the two signals are out of phase.

===Elliptical gears===

Two non-circular gears with the same elliptical outline, each pivoting around one focus and positioned at the proper angle, will turn smoothly while maintaining contact at all times.  Alternatively, they can be connected by a link chain or timing belt, or in the case of a bicycle the main chainring may be elliptical, or an ovoid similar to an ellipse in form.  Such elliptical gears may be used in mechanical equipment to produce variable angular speed or torque from a constant rotation of the driving axle, or in the case of a bicycle to allow a varying crank rotation speed with inversely varying mechanical advantage.
Elliptical bicycle gears make it easier for the chain to slide off the cog when changing gears.[ref]

An example gear application would be a device that winds thread onto a conical bobbin on a spinning machine. The bobbin would need to wind faster when the thread is near the apex than when it is near the base.[tpl]cite book |first=George B. |last=Grant |title=A treatise on gear wheels |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fPoOAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA72 |year=1906 |publisher=Philadelphia Gear Works |page=72[/tpl]

==Ellipses in statistics and finance==

In statistics, a bivariate random vector (X, Y) is jointly elliptically distributed if its iso-density contours — loci of equal values of the density function — are ellipses.  The concept extends to an arbitrary number of elements of the random vector, in which case in general the iso-density contours are ellipsoids.  A special case is the multivariate normal distribution.  The elliptical distributions are important in finance because if rates of return on assets are jointly elliptically distributed then all portfolios can be characterized completely by their mean and variance — that is, any two portfolios with identical mean and variance of portfolio return have identical distributions of portfolio return.[tpl]cite journal |author=Chamberlain, G. |title=A characterization of the distributions that imply mean—Variance utility functions |journal=Journal of Economic Theory |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=185–201 |date=February 1983 |doi=10.1016/0022-0531(83)90129-1 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022053183901291[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Owen, J.; Rabinovitch, R. |title=On the class of elliptical distributions and their applications to the theory of portfolio choice |journal=Journal of Finance |volume=38 |issue= |pages=745–752 |date=June 1983 |jstor=2328079 |doi=10.1111/j.1540-6261.1983.tb02499.x[/tpl]

==Ellipses in computer graphics==

Drawing an ellipse as a  graphics primitive is common in standard display libraries, such as the MacIntosh QuickDraw API, and Direct2D on Windows.  Jack Bresenham at IBM is most famous for the invention of 2D drawing primitives, including line and circle drawing, using only fast integer operations such as addition and branch on carry bit. M. L. V. Pitteway extended Bresenham's algorithm for lines to conics in 1967.[tpl]cite journal |author=Pitteway, M.L.V. |title=Algorithm for drawing ellipses or hyperbolae with a digital plotter |journal=The Computer Journal |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=282–9 |year=1967 |doi=10.1093/comjnl/10.3.282 |url=http://comjnl.oxfordjournals.org/content/10/3/282.abstract[/tpl] Another efficient generalization to draw ellipses was invented in 1984 by Jerry Van Aken.[tpl]cite journal |author=Van Aken, J.R. |title=An Efficient Ellipse-Drawing Algorithm |journal=IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications |volume=4 |issue=9 |pages=24–35 |date=September 1984 |doi=10.1109/MCG.1984.275994 [/tpl]
In 1970 Danny Cohen presented at the "Computer Graphics 1970" conference in England a linear algorithm for drawing ellipses and circles. In 1971, L. B. Smith published similar algorithms for all conic sections and proved them to have good properties.[tpl]cite journal |author=Smith, L.B. |title=Drawing ellipses, hyperbolae or parabolae with a fixed number of points |journal=The Computer Journal |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=81–86 |year=1971 |doi=10.1093/comjnl/14.1.81 |url=http://comjnl.oxfordjournals.org/content/14/1/81.short[/tpl] These algorithms need only a few multiplications and additions to calculate each vector.
It is beneficial to use a parametric formulation in computer graphics because the density of points is greatest where there is the most curvature. Thus, the change in slope between each successive point is small, reducing the apparent "jaggedness" of the approximation.

===Drawing with Bézier spline paths===

Bézier splines may also be used to draw an ellipse to sufficient accuracy, since any ellipse may be construed as an affine transformation of a circle. The spline methods used to draw a circle may be used to draw an ellipse, since the constituent Bézier curves will behave appropriately under such transformations.

==Line segment as a type of degenerate ellipse==

A line segment is a degenerate ellipse with semi-minor axis = 0 and eccentricity = 1, and with the focal points at the ends.[tpl]cite web |author=Seligman, Courtney |title=Orbital Motions Ellipses and Other Conic Sections |date=1993–2010 |work=Online Astronomy eText |url=http://cseligman.com/text/history/ellipses.htm[/tpl] Although the eccentricity is 1 this is not a parabola. A radial elliptic trajectory is a non-trivial special case of an elliptic orbit, where the ellipse is a line segment.

==Ellipses in optimization theory==

It is sometimes useful to find the minimum bounding ellipse on a set of points. The ellipsoid method is quite useful for attacking this problem.
