The Royal Prince Alfred Hospital (abbreviated RPAH or RPA, and sometimes shortened to PA Hospital) is a major public teaching hospital in Sydney, Australia, located on Missenden Road in Camperdown. It is a teaching hospital of the Central Clinical School of the Sydney Medical School at the University of Sydney and is situated in proximity to the Blackburn Building of the university's main campus. RPAH is the largest hospital in the Sydney Local Health District, with approximately 700 beds (circa 2005). Following a $350 million redevelopment, the perinatal hospital King George V Memorial Hospital has been incorporated into it.http://www.sswahs.nsw.gov.au/rpa/ RPA website
An Australian television documentary, RPA, is filmed there and depicts the everyday workings of a major metropolitan hospital.

==History==

Royal Prince Alfred is one of the oldest hospitals in NSW. The funds were raised by public subscription. This was in an effort to make a monument to commemorate the assassination attempt on Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh by Henry James O'Farrell.

===Teaching===

It was only two years after its establishment in 1882 that the hospital accepted its first medical students from the Medical School of the University of Sydney. Since then, the hospital has benefited from this close relationship at the teaching, research and clinical levels. For example, it is the only public hospital in Australia to offer a comprehensive revision course for the RACP written exam for basic physician trainees.http://www.slhd.nsw.gov.au/rpa/BPTCourse/default.html RPA Revision course for BPTs

==Research==

The RPA campus is also home to the largest volume of medical research undertaken within NSW.
Throughout its history, clinicians at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital have been responsible for many innovations in clinical care, diagnosis and treatment, not only within Australia, but also at an international level.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2007[/tpl] This is reflected in the regular publication of original articles and editorial comments by hospital staff in such medical journals as The Lancet and The New England Journal of Medicine. This reputation for excellence means it has the highest percentage of surgical admissions amongst NSW principal referral hospitals.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2007[/tpl]
RPA is home to more research institutes and specialist units than any other public hospital in Australia, including:
The hospital also sponsors a number of institutes at the University of Sydney, including the Heart Research Institute; Centenary Institute for Cancer Medicine and Cell Biology; Kanematsu Laboratories and General Endocrinology Group.

==Royal Prince Alfred Hospital School==

The Department of Education and Training operates a school within the hospital, known as Royal Prince Alfred Hospital School. Executive, teaching and administrative staffing and funding is provided by the DET in liaison with the hospital's paediatric and nursing units, and may vary according to the changing needs of the school. The school is operated as part of the Botany Bay Network of schools within the Sydney Region.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sydneyr.det.nsw.edu.au/schools/botanybay.htm |title=Botany Bay Network Schools |accessdate=2011-01-04 |publisher=NSW DET [/tpl]
RPA Hospital School provides for the educational needs of school-age children and teenagers while they are short term or long term patients at the hospital. Students undertake exams, just as they would at their home schools, including the NAPLAN, the School Certificate and the Higher School Certificate. Where necessary, the Home-School Liaison Officer continues to work with students on return to their home schools to ensure a smooth transition, and, where necessary, the programming of individualised learning tasks to ease students back into school.
