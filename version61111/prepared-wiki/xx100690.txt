[[Sturmgesch端tz IV]]

CATEGORIES: Assault guns, World War II tank destroyers of Germany

The Sturmgesch端tz IV (StuG IV) (Sd.Kfz. 167), was a German assault gun variant of the Panzer IV used in the mid-late period of the Second World War. Identical in role and concept to the highly successful StuG III assault gun variant of the Panzer III, both StuG models were quickly transitioned to a full-time tank destroyer role in the German retreats following the Battle of Kursk.

==Development==

The Sturmgesch端tz IV resulted from Krupp's effort to supply an assault gun. As Krupp did not build Panzerkampfwagen IIIs, they used the Panzerkampfwagen IV chassis in combination with a slightly modified Sturmgesch端tz III superstructure. 
From December 1943 to May 1945, Krupp built 1,108 StuG IVs and converted an additional 31 from battle-damaged Panzer IV hulls. While the number is smaller than the 9000+ StuG III, the StuG IV supplemented and fought along with StuG III during 1944-45, when they were most needed. 
The StuG IV became known as an effective tank killer, especially on the Eastern Front.
It had a four-man crew, and was issued mainly to infantry divisions.

==Surviving vehicles==

There are presently three surviving examples of the StuG IV.
