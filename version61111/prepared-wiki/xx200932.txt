[[Ultra-low-voltage processor]]

CATEGORIES: Microprocessors

Ultra-low-voltage processors are a class of microprocessor that are deliberately underclocked to use less power at the expense of performance. These processors are commonly used in subnotebooks, netbooks, ultraportables and embedded devices; where low power dissipation and long battery life are required.
