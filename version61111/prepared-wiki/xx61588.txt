Adam Cadre (born February 5, 1974 in Silver Spring, Maryland) is an American writer active in a number of forms ― novels, screenplays, webcomics, essays ― but best known for his work in interactive fiction.  

==Biography==

Cadre's 1998 piece Photopia pioneered a new direction in interactive fiction, removing the gaming elements that had previously been dominant; it has been cited as "hugely influential to IF development" and "important to video games as a whole, to the advancement of our understanding of the interactive medium." His next IF work, 1999's Varicella, won several XYZZY Awards and became the subject of academic study.
Chief among his non-interactive work is a novel, Ready, Okay! (2000).

==Lyttle Lytton Contest==

The Lyttle Lytton Contest, run by Adam Cadre, is a diminutive derivative of the Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest, and was first awarded in the year 2001. Both are tongue-in-cheek contests that take place annually and in which entrants are invited "to compose the opening sentence to the worst of all possible novels." The Lyttle Lytton Contest varies from the Bulwer-Lytton in favoring shorter first sentences, of 25 words or fewer. For the 2008 competition, the maximum combined word count of an entrant's submission was increased to 30 words, and an individual entry may consist of multiple sentences.The limit was raised again to 33 words after the 2010 contest, and for the 2012 contest, a 200-character per submission limit was established instead.
In addition to the main contest, others are offered from year to year. The winners of those are:
