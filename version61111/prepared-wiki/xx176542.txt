The Sriracha Tiger Zoo is a zoo in Sri Racha, a city on the outskirts of Pattaya, a city in the Chonburi Province of Thailand known as the seaside resort of Thailand. It is about 60 miles from Bangkok.  The zoo claims a population of 200 tigers and around 10,000 crocodiles, the largest such populations in the world.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2010[/tpl]  Admission in 2009 (2552) was 350 Baht for foreigners and 120 Baht for Thai.

Photographs of a female tiger nursing piglets wrapped in tiger skin, accompanied by a fictitious story about a zoo in California, were actually taken at Sriracha.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/photos/animals/tigerpig.asp |title=Tiger and Piglets |author=snopes.com |date=1 June 2006 |publisher= snopes.com |accessdate=17 July 2010[/tpl]

==Controversy==

The Animal Welfare Institute reported in 2004 that the zoo had been using tigers and elephants in circus shows, including tigers leaping through rings of fire, walking across a double tightrope, parading around a ring on hind legs, and riding on horseback.[tpl]cite news |title=Too Close for Comfort |first=Adam M.|last= Roberts |newspaper=Awi Quarterly |date=Winter 2005 |url=http://www.awionline.org/ht/display/ContentDetails/i/1907/pid/2506 [/tpl] AWI reported "potentially dangerous human-tiger and human-elephant close interaction", "bizarre multi-species enclosures", tigers being struck with steel poles by trainers and implications that tigers were being bred for export to China.
