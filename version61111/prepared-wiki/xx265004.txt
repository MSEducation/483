The titular character, Moose, is a stereotypically lazy, unemployed, fat middle-class American who can never seem to hold a job. He loves pizza and television, and is constantly struggling to find work, or to simply get off the couch, all the while being nagged by both his wife and his mother-in-law. 
Weber based many of Moose's adventures on his own family's experiences.
