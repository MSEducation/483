Surrey is a city in the province of British Columbia, Canada.  It is a member municipality of Metro Vancouver, the governing body of the Greater Vancouver Regional District. It is the province's second-largest city by population after the city of Vancouver.
The six "town centres" the City of Surrey comprises are: Fleetwood, Whalley/City Centre, Guildford, Newton, Cloverdale, and South Surrey.http://www.surrey.ca/Visiting+Surrey/About+Surrey/Surrey+Is.htm[tpl]Dead link|date=August 2012[/tpl]

==History==

Surrey became incorporated in 1879, and encompasses land formerly occupied by a number of Halqemeylem-speaking aboriginal groups. When Englishman H.J. Brewer looked across the Fraser River from New Westminster and saw a land reminiscent of his native County of Surrey in England, the settlement of Surrey was placed on the map. The area then comprised forests of douglas-fir, fir, red cedar, hemlock, blackberry bushes, and cranberry bogs. A portion of present-day Whalley (named after Harry Whalley, who owned and operated a gas bar at the bend in King George Blvd, (formerly King George Highway) at 108 Avenue, "Whalley's Corner") was used as a burial ground by the Kwantlen (or Qw’ontl’en) Nation.
Settlers arrived first in Cloverdale and parts of South Surrey, mostly to farm, fish, harvest oysters, or set up small stores. Once the Pattullo Bridge was erected in 1937, the way was open for Surrey to expand. In the post-war 1950s, North Surrey's neighbourhoods filled with single family homes and Surrey (not yet a city) became a bedroom community, absorbing commuters who worked in Burnaby or Vancouver.
In the 1980s and 1990s, Surrey witnessed unprecedented growth, as people from different parts of Canada and the world, particularly Asia, began to make the municipality their home. Surrey is projected to surpass the city of Vancouver as the most populous city in BC by 2020–2030.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2009[/tpl]

==Government and politics==

Surrey is governed by an eight-member city council. The current mayor of Surrey is Dianne Watts. The last elections were held in November 2011.
In the recent 2009 provincial elections, the British Columbia New Democratic Party won four of Surrey's seats, all of them in the more urbanized north and centre of the city, while the BC Liberal Party won four seats in the more rural east and south.
Following the 2011 federal election, the Conservative Party of Canada holds two of Surrey's four seats (Fleetwood—Port Kells and South Surrey—White Rock—Cloverdale) in the Canadian House of Commons, while the other two seats (Surrey North and Newton—North Delta) are held by the New Democratic Party.

==Geography and climate==

The city is characterized by low population density urban sprawl, typical of North American cities, which includes areas of residential housing, light industry and commercial centres and is prone to strip development and malls. Approximately 35 percent of the land is designated as part of the Agricultural Land Reserve.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2009[/tpl] The city is mostly hills and flatland, with most of the flatland in Tynehead, Hazelmere, south of Cloverdale, and Colebrook.
The climate is typically inter-coastal Pacific-Northwest: rainy, wet winters, often with heavy rainfall lasting into early spring, with mild, sunny summers and cool autumns.

==Religion==

A predominant religion in Surrey is Christianity. The 2001 census indicates that nearly 50% of the population self-identifies as Christian, including Protestant, Catholic, other Christian, and Orthodox. The next largest religious group are Sikhs with 16.3% self-identifying. Just over 25% identifying no religious affiliation.

==Education==

===Schools===

School District 36 Surrey oversees 100 public elementary and 21 public secondary schools, making it the largest public school district in British Columbia.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2009[/tpl] Private schools in Surrey include Calvary Christian Academy, Holy Cross Regional High School, Pacific Academy, Regent Christian Academy, White Rock Christian Academy, Surrey Christian School, and Southridge School. There are no public middle schools in Surrey, so a typical elementary school includes kindergarten through grade 7, and secondary school starts at grade 8 and continues through grade 12. There are around 65,000 students enrolled in public and private schools.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2009[/tpl]

===Universities and colleges===

Surrey is home to the third campus of Simon Fraser University (SFU), which opened in 2002. SFU took over the space and programming that was initially built for TechBC, a technical university proposed for south of the Fraser River by the then-NDP led provincial government. SFU Surrey offers a number of cutting-edge programs, including TechOne and Explorations; first-year cohort options; and studies in Applied Sciences, Criminology, World Literature, Business Administration, and Interactive Arts and Technology.
Surrey is also the home of Kwantlen Polytechnic University. Kwantlen opened its doors in the Newton Town Centre of Surrey in 1981. Since then, it has expanded to provide satellite campuses in Richmond, Langley, a trades and technology centre in the Cloverdale Town Centre of Surrey. The Surrey campus focuses on sciences, business, arts, and health, including a publicly accessible wellness centre, while the new Cloverdale campus trains apprentices for the skilled trades industries.
Surrey also has many private post-secondary institutions to choose from including; Sprott Shaw College, CDI College, Academy of Learning and Vancouver Career College, among others.

==Transportation==

===History===

The first settlement of Surrey was Crescent Beach, in South Surrey, and Bridgeview/Brownsville, in North Surrey. Early trails and roads helped to encourage the settlement of Surrey. The first trail built by a settler was the 1861 the Kennedy Trail. James Kennedy built the trail to provide a route between New Westminster and the natural pasture land on the Mud Bay Flats next to the Serpentine River.Early Trails and Roads in the Lower Fraser Valley, W. N. Draper, British Columbia Historical Quarterly, January, 1943, Vol. 7, p. 49-56.
The Semiahmoo Wagon Road was built in 1873 between Brownsville opposite New Westminster and Semiahmoo (Blaine).The Semiahmoo Trail: Myths Makers Memories by Ron Dowle, Surrey Historical Society, 1998.
The first regular ferry service across the Fraser River started in 1882 on the steam ferry K de K with the point of departure at Brownsville.[tpl]cite web|url=http://members.shaw.ca/jack_brown/surrey.html |title=Surrey History |publisher=Members.shaw.ca |date=September 11, 1993 |accessdate=March 9, 2011[/tpl] The ferry landed on the Surrey side at the start of the Old Yale Road, which connected directly inland to Yale, and was a major gold rush trail.
The New Westminster Rail Bridge was opened in 1904, allowing personal vehicles to cross the Fraser River on the upper deck. The lower deck, for rail, enabled BC Electric Railway to finally construct the Interurban line, an electric suburb commuter rail route connecting Chilliwack to Vancouver. It opened for service in 1910, and ran through Kennedy, Newton, Sullivan, and Cloverdale. Currently, two of the BCER cars (1225 & 1304) are nearly finished being restored for operation on the mainline between Cloverdale and Sullivan. New car barns and museum currently under construction in Cloverdale(as of 2012)[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fvhrs.org/ |title=Fraser Valley Heritage Railway Society |publisher=Fvhrs.org |date= |accessdate=August 1, 2012[/tpl]
In 1937, the then two-lane Pattullo Bridge linking New Westminster and Surrey was opened.
In the early 1950s, BC Electric Railways ceased operating its interurban line, thus increasing the number of vehicles on Surrey roads. Highway 10 was built in 1953, and Highway 15 in 1957. In 1964, the provincial government completed Highway 401 and the Port Mann Bridge; that section of roadway would later be renamed Highway 1. In 1959, the George Massey Tunnel was opened, along with what is known as Highway 99. With the completion of the new Highways 1 and 99, the Fraser Highway and King George Boulevard became major arteries.
In the early 1990s, Surrey saw the return of rail transit with the SkyTrain Expo Line expansion into Surrey. The four stations added were Scott Road, Gateway, Surrey Central (and bus loop) and King George.

===Current transportation network===

The Canadian National Railway, Canadian Pacific Railway, BNSF Railway, and Southern Railway of British Columbia have trackage running through Surrey.
Public transport, operated by TransLink, connects some of Surrey's centres to each other and to other Lower Mainland municipalities. The SkyTrain Expo Line provides 35-minute service to Downtown Vancouver via four stations: Scott Road, Gateway, Surrey Central (also a bus loop), and King George.
Vancouver International Airport is located [tpl]convert|28|km|mi[/tpl] west of Surrey. Vancouver International Airport offers direct daily service to destinations in Canada, North America, Europe, and Asia.
Bellingham International Airport is located [tpl]convert|32|km|mi[/tpl] south of Surrey, and offers connections to Seattle, Las Vegas, and Hawaii.
Abbotsford International Airport is located [tpl]convert|24|km|mi[/tpl] east of Surrey, and offers daily flights to Calgary and Edmonton.

==Sustainable Development==

In 2008, Surrey city council created and adopted the Surrey Sustainability Charter:[tpl]cite web | title = Sustainability Charter: a commitment to sustainability | publisher = City of Surrey | url = http://www.surrey.ca/files/Sustainability_Charter.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 13 February 2013[/tpl] a comprehensive document spanning 72 pages that takes a comprehensive look at all facets of society and creates an overarching document to guide the urban development of the city for the next 50 years. In 2011, the city council released the second update to the 2008 document indicating the progress made in the three years since the inception of the report.[tpl]cite web | title = Sustainability Charter update 2011 | publisher = City of Surrey | url = http://www.surrey.ca/files/2011FinalSustainabilityReport_web.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 13 February 2013[/tpl]

===Origins===

Since the 1960s, Metro Vancouver has been involved in green advocacy, most prominently by the founding of Greenpeace and advocate David Suzuki.  When the Brundtland Report was published in 1987, it laid the groundwork for the convening of the 1992 Earth Summit and the adoption of Agenda 21, the Rio Declaration  and to the establishment of the Commission on Sustainable Development.
Metro Vancouver has taken steps to introduce initiatives to help reduce the ecological impact with a 1996 report "Liveable Region Plan" and also a 2001 update titled "Sustainable Region Initiative" (SRI for short). While the SRI was not met without criticism, it provided a useful baseline and foundation for Surrey to construct an encompassing plan that includes not only environmental issues, but economic and social issues as well.

===Components===

The Charter is broken down into multiple layers, with high level conceptual goals, a framework for action and low level details such as the implementation strategy. The charter follows the basic structure inspired by the Brundland Commission.
The report heavily incorporates the Triple Bottom Line Accounting methodology and breaks down the facets of Sustainable development onto the three sides of a cube. On one face of the cube, there are the three pillars to sustainability–Socio-Cultural, Economic and Environmental. On the second facet, is the political domain, and lastly, three time frames: short, medium and long term goals. 
 
 "To promote a safe, caring, engaged, and liveable community, with a sense of place, that is inclusive of all aspects of diversity and provides a range of educational, recreational, cultural and employment opportunities, affordable and appropriate housing, transportation options and personal, health and social services that are accessible to all."

 
 "To create a local economy that builds on Surrey’s natural advantages, and uses the land base and human resources efficiently to create a broad range of well located, transit accessible and environmentally friendly businesses that provide attractive local employment opportunities and a sustainable revenue base for the City. "

 
 "To demonstrate good stewardship of the land, water, air and built environment, protecting, preserving and enhancing Surrey’s natural areas and ecosystems for current and future generations while making nature accessible for all to enjoy."

===Hurdles===

Being an all inclusive plan requires an interplay of many complex and sometimes wicked problems. Trying to account for all problems is ambitious, and as the report admits, being at the municipal level reduces the funding, power and resources to implement the vision. The report acknowledges the political hurdle and notes that the city needs to influence players with more power such as the provincial or federal government in order for the vision to be successful. Some other hurdles that have arisen since the inception of the charter include the following:

====Suburban Sprawl and the Gateway Program====

Surrey currently faces the problem of Urban Sprawl, the phenomenon that is characterized by the low density residential, with almost no commercial or industrial zoning. This results in a heavy outflow of traffic in the morning, and inflow in the evening.
The announcement of the Gateway Program in 2005 by the British Columbia Ministry of Transportation meant a large expenditure in transportation infrastructure. Despite the oppositions by the Metro Vancouver and several mayoral councils,[tpl]cite web | title = Burnaby Public Consultation on Provincial Gateway Program | publisher = City of Burnaby | url = http://www.burnaby.ca/Assets/city+services/roads+and+traffic/Transportation+-+Gateway+-+January+15+2007+Council+Report.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 13 February 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web | title = Standing Committee Minutes | publisher = City of Vancouver | url = http://vancouver.ca/ctyclerk/cclerk/20060606/documents/ttmin.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 13 February 2013[/tpl] the project went ahead to create the South Fraser Perimeter Road and the Port Mann Bridge, both which pass through major portions of Surrey. It has been criticized to be contradictory to not only Metro Vancouver's Sustainable Region Initiative,[tpl]cite web | title = Proposed twinning of the Port Mann Bridge and Highway 1 expansion | publisher = David Suzuki Foundation | url = http://www.livableregion.ca/pdf/PortMannBriefingJune06.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 13 February 2013[/tpl] but also Surrey's Sustainability Charter. Studies have shown that with an increase in road capacity, generated traffic increases, that is traffic that is diverted (shifted in time and route) and induced travel (increased total motor vehicle travel).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.vtpi.org/gentraf.pdf |title=Generated Traffic and Induced Travel Implications for Transport Planning |last=Litman |first=Todd |publisher=Victoria Transport Policy Institute |date=10 September 2012 |format=PDF |accessdate=11 February 2013 [/tpl] With the construction of the 10 lane Port Mann Bridge, the problem of suburban sprawl is exacerbated not only with the additional capacity, but RapidBus service was also cancelled despite expectations of a stop in Surrey.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.news1130.com/2012/11/23/dianne-watts-angry-surrey-dropped-from-rapidbus-plans/ |title=Dianne Watts angry Surrey dropped from RapidBus plans |date=23 November 2012 |publisher=News1130 |accessdate=13 February 2013[/tpl]

====Transportation and Land Use====

The Sustainability Charter hinges on a large reduction on automobile dependancy requiring a well established transit infrastructure to the multiple districts of Surrey. In 2008, Gordon Campbell announced the extension of the Expo Line beyond the current terminus to as far as Langley.[tpl]cite news |url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/373127516/abstract?accountid=14656 |title=More Skytrains for Surrey |date=16 January 2008 |publisher=The Leader  |location=Surrey, BC |accessdate=11 February 2013 [/tpl] However, financial shortfall came upon Translink shortly after, and many of the announced plans came to a halt. Plans to expand northward via the Evergreen Line came to fruition prior the vision of extending light rail out to Guildford, Newton and Langley. Trying to make ends meet, Mayor 
Watts attempts to impose equal tolling across the region to assist with funding transit to reduce car reliance.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/a-better-surrey-hinges-on-halted-transit-plans/article4279109/ |title=A better Surrey hinges on halted transit plans |date=15 June 2012 |publisher=The Globe and Mail |accessdate=13 February 2013 [/tpl]
Protecting agricultural land reserves also play an important part in the charter of sustainability. The idea behind the agricultural land reserves is to encourage and increase the role of urban agriculture thus reducing the reliance of food transport and increasing the quality and availability of food to local people. The Charter takes the idea one step further by bringing in value adding food processing agribusiness to complete the supply chain circle.[tpl]cite web | title = Sustainability Charter: a commitment to sustainability | publisher = City of Surrey | url = http://www.surrey.ca/files/Sustainability_Charter.pdf | format = PDF |pages=20 | accessdate = 13 February 2013[/tpl]
In a case study of Toronto completed by Pierre Filion, he claims that while transit and natural area conservation are successful at achieving their respective immediate objectives, they "do not modify metropolitan-wide relations between transportation and land use...in a fashion that is consistent with smart growth". Filion identifies that the largest obstacles are NIMBY reactions from the public and the limited finances from the public sector.[tpl]cite book|last=Vojnovic|first=edited by Igor|title=Urban sustainability : a global perspective|publisher=Michigan State University Press|location=East Lansing|isbn=9781611860559|pages=509–523|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/books/9781609173470/[/tpl]
