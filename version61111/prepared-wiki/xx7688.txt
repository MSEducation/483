[[Military academy]]

CATEGORIES: Military academies, School types

A military academy or service academy (in American English) is an educational institution which prepares candidates for service in the officer corps of the army, the navy, air force or coast guard, which normally provides education in a service environment, the exact definition depending on the country concerned.
Three types of academy exists:  high school-level institutions awarding academic qualifications,  university-level institutions awarding bachelor's degree level qualification, and those preparing officer cadets for commissioning into the armed services of the state.

==History==

The first military academies were established in the 18th century to provide future officers for technically specialized corps, such as engineers and artillery, with scientific training.
The Royal Military Academy, Woolwich was set up in 1720[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.woolwichcentral.com/location-and-lifestyle/woolwich-history/|title=Woolwich History[/tpl] as the earliest military academy in Britain. Its original purpose was to train cadets entering the Royal Artillery and Royal Engineers. In France, the Ecole du Corps Royal du Geme at Mezieres was founded in 1748, followed by a non-technical academy in 1751, the Ecole Royale Militaire offering a general military education to the nobility. French military academies were widely copied in Prussia, Austria, Russia and even minor powers, including Turin and the Kingdom of Savoy, in the late 18th century.
By the turn of the century, under the impetus of the Napoleonic Wars and the strain that the armies of Europe subsequently came under, military academies for the training of commissioned officers of the army were set up in most of the combatant nations. These military schools had two functions; to provide instruction for serving officers in the functions of the efficient staff-officer, and to school youngsters before they gained an officer's commission.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.usafa.edu/df/dfh/docs/Harmon22.pdf|title=Perspectives in the History of Military Education and Professionalism|author=Richard A Harmon[/tpl] The Kriegsakademie in Prussia was founded in 1801 and the Ecole Spéciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr was created by order of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1802 as a replacement for the École Royale Militaire of the Ancien Regime (the institution that Napoleon himself had graduated from).
The Royal Military College, Sandhurst in England was the brainchild of John Le Marchant in 1801,Major-General John Gaspard Le Marchant (1766-1812) Defence Academy who established schools for the military instruction of officers at High Wycombe and Great Marlow, with a grant of £30,000 from Parliament. The two original departments were later combined and moved to Sandhurst. In the United States, the military academy at West Point was founded in 1802 and became popular in the 1860s.

==Canada==

Canada currently has one military-theme private boarding school open for students at the pre-university level, Robert Land Academy (RLA), which is located in West Lincoln, Ontario. Founded in 1978, it is an all-boys' institute whose funding arises solely from tuition fees. The Academy is an institute fully accredited by the province of Ontario, which accepts students from Grade 6 to Grade 12 (the Ontario Academic Credit level).
Canada formerly had three university level service academies, the Canadian Military Colleges.  These included the Royal Military College of Canada (RMC) in Kingston, Ontario, Royal Roads Military College (RRMC) in Victoria, British Columbia and the Collège militaire royal de Saint-Jean (CMR) in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Québec.  RMC was founded in 1876, RRMC in 1941 and CMR in 1954.H16511 Dr. Richard Arthur Preston "To Serve Canada: A History of the Royal Military College of Canada" 1997 Toronto, University of Toronto Press, 1969. By the 60s all three institutions were providing *military education to officer cadets of all three elements in the Canadian Forces; the navy, army and air force; and RMC received the authority to grant academic degrees in Arts, Science and Engineering.4237 Dr. Adrian Preston & Peter Dennis (Edited) "Swords and Covenants" Rowman And Littlefield, London. Croom Helm. 1976.
Graduates of the Colleges are widely acknowledged to have had a disproportionate impact in the Canadian services and society, thanks to the solid foundations provided by their military education.H16511 Dr. Richard Preston "R.M.C. and Kingston: The effect of imperial and military influences on a Canadian community" 1968 In the modern era, emphasis was placed on a broad based, liberal education including core courses in the humanities, social, pure and applied sciences.  Military discipline and training, as well as a focus on physical fitness and fluency in both of Canada's two official languages, English and French, provided cadets with ample challenges and a very fulfilling experience.H1877 R.

Royal Roads reopened as a civilian university in the fall of 1995, and is maintained by the Government of British Columbia. In 2007, the Department of National Defence reopened Collège militaire royal de Saint-Jean as a preparatory and first year college.

The Ecole Polytechnique, though its engineering students are enlisted in the military, is sometimes not considered a military academy, as very few of its graduates remain in the military after graduation.

==Georgia==

National Defense Academy (NDA) of Georgia is a descendant of the first Georgian “Junker School” which was established in 1919 right after the declaration of independence. Establishment of the military school was very important for the identity of a new democratic nation-state. The school was abolished after Soviet occupation of Georgia in 1921.
“Davit Aghmashenebeli National Defense Academy of Georgia” was founded on May 28, 1993. The length of studies at the Academy had been defined for 4 years. In 2005, due to the need of the growth of the personnel strength of the Georgian Armed Forces (GAF), the system of the Academy has been transformed to retain only the 18 month long officer training courses. Bachelor degree has been defined as a prerequisite for the admission of the cadets.
In 2010, the NDA has undergone a new wave of the reforms to include entire officer education system. As a result, in 2011, Cadet Bachelor School, Junior Officer Basic School, Aviation and Air Defense Officer Basic School, Medical Officer School, Captain Career School, Command and General Staff School, School of Advance Defense Studies and Language Training School were included within the NDA.http://eta.mod.gov.ge/index.php?page=home&lang=1
Upon entry into NDA, cadets sign a contract with the MoD for 10 years of military service, of which 4 years are dedicated to studies and 6 years – to consequent military service. Cadets receive the rank of Lieutenant upon graduation.
NDA is established by the MoD with the status of the Legal Entity of Public Law. At the same time, NDA maintains very strong link with The Ministry of Education and Science according to the process of Bologna.

==Germany==

In Germany there exists a system which clearly differs from the common ones. The only true military academies are in fact the Führungsakademie der Bundeswehr where mainly future staff officers and general staff officers are further trained.
The standard education in military leadership is the task of the Offizierschulen (officer's schools) run by the three branches. The contents differ from branch to branch. In the army all officers are at least trained to lead a platoon. There they also have to pass an officer exam to become commissioned later on.
Moreover there exist so called Waffenschulen like infantry school or artillery school. There the officer's learn to deal with the typical tasks of their respective corps.
A specialty of the German concept of officer formation is the academic education. Germany runs two own Universities of the German Federal Armed Forces where almost every future officer has to pass non-military studies and achieve a Bachelor's or Master's degree. During their studies (after at least three years of service) the candidates become commissioned Leutnant (second-lieutenant).
The three officer's schools are:

Akademi Angkatan Bersenjata Republic Indonesia (Indonesia Military Academy)http://www.akmil.ac.id/ Founded in Yogyakarta, October 13, 1945 in order of General Staff Chief of Indonesia Army Lieutenant General Urip Sumohardjo with name Militaire Academie (MA) Yogyakarta.
Currently, Tentara Nasional Indonesia (Indonesian National Armed Forces), under supervision of Commandant General of National Armed Forces Academy (a three-star officer in billet) in the HQ Indonesian National Armed Forces, divided the academies into the respective services:
Indonesian Army
Indonesian Air Force
Indonesian Navy
Each service academy is headed by two-star officer and his/her deputy is one-star officer. All the students (cadets/midshipman) are recruited from senior high school graduates from all of Indonesia. Shortly after graduated, the are commissioned as Letnan Dua (Second Lieutenant) in their respective services and get the Diploma IV (Associate's Degree, 4th Grade) comparable to civil academies or universities. The length term is now 4 (four) years and is divided into 5 (five) grades of cadet's rank; starting from the lowest:
Note: Taruna, Kadet and Karbol are official cadet designation in the Army (Military), Naval and Air Force academy, respectively.
Until 1999, before Indonesian National Police officially separated from the armed forces, Indonesian Police Academy also stood under the National Armed Forces Academy. Presently, the Police Academy, located in Semarang (Central Java), is supervised under Chief of Indonesian National Police.

===Pre-University level institution===

===Undergraduate Service===

Although an undergraduate degree is not a pre-requisite for Officer training, the majority of potential Officers will have attended University before joining the Armed Forces.  At some universities there may be the option for people to join either a University Royal Naval Unit, a University Officer Training Corps (UOTC) or a University Air Squadron; which are designed to introduce students to life in the Forces and show them the careers that are available.  There is no requirement for students in these organisations to join the military after they finish their degree programs, and the great majority have no further contact with the armed forces.  Although service with these organisations may give some initial benefit to cadets attending the military colleges/academies, the next stage of the officer training programs assumes no prior military experience/knowledge, and those that did not partake in military activities at university are not disadvantaged.

===Officer training===

There are four UK military academies.  Although the curriculum at each varies due to the differing nature of the service a person is joining, it is a combination of military and academic study that is designed to turn young civilians into comprehensibly trained military officers.
Officer Training for the Reserve Forces (e.g. Territorial Army, Royal Naval Reserve, RAF Reserves & Royal Marine Reserves) also takes place at the relevant military academies, but under a different curriculum and the courses tend to be concentrated into a much shorter period.

===Postgraduate and staff training===

===No longer operational===

==United States==

===Introduction===

In the United States, unlike most other countries, the term "military academy" does not necessarily mean an institution run by the armed forces to train its own military officers; it may also mean a middle school, high school or tertiary-level college, whether public or private, which instructs its students in military-style education, discipline and tradition.
Many public high schools offer Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps programs sponsored by the United States Armed Forces.
Military academies can be either private or have government sponsorship from a regional (state), or national government.

===Federal Service Academies===

The colleges operated by the U.S. Federal Government are referred to as the Federal Service Academies and are:

===Senior and junior military colleges===

There is a state-sponsored military academy which is:
In addition, these five institutions that were military colleges at the time of their founding maintain both a corps of cadets and a civilian student body:
and State University]], Blacksburg, Virginia
Along with the Virginia Military Institute, these institutions are known as the Senior Military Colleges of the US.
Today six institutions are considered Military Junior Colleges (JMC). These six schools participate in the Army's two-year Early Commissioning Program, an Army ROTC program where qualified students can earn a commission as a Second Lieutenant after only two years of college. The five Military Junior Colleges are:

===Merchant Marine Academies that have military academy style operations===

Six state Merchant Marine academies, Massachusetts Maritime Academy, Maine Maritime Academy, SUNY Maritime College, Texas Maritime Academy, Great Lakes Maritime Academy, and California Maritime Academy, operate on a military college system. Part of the training cadets receive is naval and military in nature. Cadets are required to apply for Naval Reserve, Coast Guard or Marine Corps commissions upon obtaining their Merchant Marine Officer's licenses and must accept the commission if it is offered.

===US Staff Colleges===

The United States staff colleges, mandated to serve the needs of officers for post-graduate studies and other such graduate institutions as mandated by the Department of Defense are:

====United States Air Force Air University attached staff colleges====

====Staff Colleges of the United States Army====

====Staff Colleges of the United States Navy and the United States Marine Corps====

====Joint Service staff colleges====

====Other post graduate colleges operated by the DoD====

==Pre-collegiate institutions==

A military school teaches various ages (middle school, high school, or both) in a manner that includes military traditions and training in military subjects. The vast majority are in the United States and Russia. Many military schools are also boarding schools, and others are simply magnet schools in a larger school system. Many are privately run institutions, though some are public and are run by either a public school system (such as the Chicago Public Schools), or by a state.
A common misconception results because some states have chosen to house their juvenile criminal populations in higher-security boarding schools that are run in a manner similar to military boarding schools. These are also called reform schools, and are functionally a combination of school and prison. They attempt to emulate the high standards of established military boarding schools in the hope that a strict structured environment can reform these children. This may or may not be true. However, this should not reflect on the long and distinguished history of military schools; their associations are traditionally those of high academic achievement, with solid college preparatory curricula, schooling in the military arts, and considerably esteemed graduates.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl]
Popular culture sometimes shows parents sending or threatening to send unruly children off to military school (or boarding school) to teach them good behavior (e.g., in the "Army of One" episode of The Sopranos, Tony and Carmela Soprano consider sending their son, AJ, to the Hudson Military Institute after AJ is expelled from high school but relent when AJ collapses from a panic attack. This also appeared in Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure, while other pop culturisms don't show military academies as punishment (threats) (ex. Damien: Omen II and The Presidio.

==Adult institutions==

A college level military academy is an institute of higher learning of things military. It is part of a larger system of military education and training institutions. The primary educational goal at military academies is to provide a high quality education that includes significant coursework and training in the fields of military tactics and military strategy. The amount of non-military coursework varies by both the institution and the country, and the amount of practical military experience gained varies as well.
Military academies may or may not grant university degrees.  In the U.S., graduates have a major field of study, earning a Bachelor's degree in that subject just as at other universities.  However, in British academies, the graduate does not achieve a university degree, since the whole of the one-year course (nowadays undertaken mainly but not exclusively by university graduates) is dedicated to military training.
There are two types of military academies: national (government-run) and state/private-run.
