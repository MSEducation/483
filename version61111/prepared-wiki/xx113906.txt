The Hermitage Arboretum is an arboretum located on the grounds of The Hermitage, President Andrew Jackson's antebellum cotton plantation outside Nashville, Tennessee.
The arboretum lines the [tpl]convert|1.5|mi|km|adj=on[/tpl] trail between the visitorâ€™s center and the mansion, and contains labeled trees. Although the 1998 Nashville tornado outbreak destroyed many of the older trees on the grounds, several remaining trees may date from Jackson's lifetime.
