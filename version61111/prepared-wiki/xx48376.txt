The Anhinga ([tpl]IPAc-en|æ|n|ˈ|h|ɪ|ŋ|g|ə[/tpl]; Anhinga anhinga), sometimes called Snakebird, Darter, American Darter, or Water Turkey, is a water bird of the warmer parts of the Americas. The word anhinga comes from the Brazilian Tupi language and means devil bird or snake bird.
It is a cormorant-like bird with an average body length of [tpl]convert|85|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl], a wingspan of [tpl]convert|117|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl], and a mass of up to [tpl]convert|1.35|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl].  It is a dark-plumaged piscivore with a very long neck, and often swims with only the neck above water. When swimming in this style the name Snakebird is apparent, since only the colored neck appears above water the bird looks like a snake ready to strike. They do not have external nares (nostrils) and breathe solely through their epiglottis.
The Anhinga is placed in the darter family, Anhingidae, and is closely related to Indian (Anhinga melanogaster), African (A. rufa), and Australian (A. novaehollandiae) Darters.  Like other darters, the Anhinga hunts by spearing fishes and other small prey using its sharp, slender beak.

==Distribution and migration==

Anhinga species are found all over the world in warm shallow waters.[tpl]cite book|title=Common Coastal Birds of Florida and the Caribbean|author=Nellis, David W.|publisher=Pineapple Press, Inc.|year=2001|pages=110|isbn=978-1-56164-191-8[/tpl] The American Anhinga has been subdivided into two subspecies, A. a. anhinga and A. a. leucogaster, based on their location.  A. a. anhinga can be found mainly east of the Andes in South America and also the islands of Trinidad and Tobago.  A. a. leucogaster can be found in the southern United States, Mexico, Cuba, and Grenada.[tpl]cite book|title=Birds of Mexico: a guide for field identification|author=Blake, Emmet Reid|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1953|pages=151–152|isbn=0-226-05641-4[/tpl]
Only birds that do not live in the extreme north and south of their range migrate and do so based on temperature and available sunlight.  Anhingas will migrate towards the equator during winter but this range is "determined by the amount of sunshine to warm the chilled birds".  Although not in their usual range, anhingas have been found as far north as the states of Pennsylvania[tpl]cite book|title=Birds of Pennsylvania|author=Gerald M. McWilliams, Daniel W. Brauning|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1999|pages=43|isbn=978-0-8014-3643-7[/tpl] and Wisconsin[tpl]cite book|title=Wisconsin Birdlife: Population and Distribution Past and Present|author=Robbins,Samuel D.|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|year=1991|pages=127–128|isbn=978-0-299-10260-9[/tpl] in the United States.
Kettles of anhingas often migrate with other birds and have been described as resembling black paper gliders.[tpl]cite book|title=Birdlife of Houston, Galveston, and the Upper Texas Coast|author=Ted L.

==Physical description and taxonomy==

The A. anhinga species is a large bird and measures approximately [tpl]convert|89|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] in length, with a range of [tpl]convert|75|-|95|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl], with a [tpl]convert|1.14|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] wingspan.[tpl]cite book|title=The Sibley Field Guide to Birds of Eastern North America|author=Sibley, David Allen|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf, New York|year=2003|pages=45|isbn=0-679-45120-X[/tpl]http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Anhinga/lifehistory  The A. a. anhinga subspecies is larger than A. a. leucogaster and has "broader buffy tail lips".  They weigh on average around [tpl]convert|1.22|kg|lbs|abbr=on[/tpl], with a range of [tpl]convert|1.04|-|1.35|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]cite book|title=Florida's Birds: A Field Guide and Reference|author=David S.

Chevalier|year=1843|pages=443–457[/tpl]), sharply pointed and yellow as are the webbed feet.
Most of the male Anhinga's body is a glossy black green with the wings, base of wings, and tail being a glossy black blue.  The tip of the tail has white feathers.[tpl]cite book|title=Birds of North America|author=Tom Wood,  Sheri L. Williamson,  Jeffrey Glassberg|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc.|pages=50|isbn=1-4027-2821-2|year=2005[/tpl]  The back of the head and the neck have elongated feathers that have been described as gray[tpl]cite book|title=Handbook of Birds of Eastern North America|author=Chapman, Frank M.|publisher=Harvard University|page=93[/tpl] or light purple white.  The upper back of the body and wings is spotted or streaked with white.
The female Anhinga is similar to the male Anhinga except that it has a pale gray-buff[tpl]cite book|title=International Wildlife Encyclopedia|author=Burton, Maurice; Burton Robert|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|year=2002|pages=646|isbn=0-7614-7271-1[/tpl] or light brown[tpl]cite book|title=Guide to the Lake Okeechobee Area|author=Gregware, Bill; Gregware, Carol|publisher=Pineapple Press Inc|year=1997|pages=54|isbn=1-56164-129-4[/tpl] head, neck, and upper chest.  The lower chest or breast is a chestnut color and as compared to the male, the female has a more brown back.[tpl]cite book|title=Birds of the High Andes|author=Jon Fjeldså, Niels Krabbe, Povl Jørgensen, Jens Ole Byskov|publisher=Apollo Books|year=1990|pages=74|isbn=87-88757-16-1[/tpl]
The hatchling starts out bald but gains tan down within a few days of hatching.  Within two weeks the tan down has been replaced by white down.  Three weeks after hatching, the first juvenile feathers appear.  Juveniles are mostly brown until first breeding after the second or third winter.
This bird is often mistaken for the Double-crested Cormorant due to its similar size and behavior.  However, the two species can be differentiated by their tails and bills.  The tail of the anhinga is wider and much longer than that of the cormorant.  The bill of the anhinga is pointed, while the bill of the cormorant has a hook-tip.[tpl]cite book|title=A Field Guide to the Birds of Texas|author=Peterson, Roger Tory|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year=1998|pages=130|isbn=0-395-92138-4[/tpl]

==Behaviour==

Unlike ducks, the Anhinga is not able to waterproof its feathers using oil produced by the uropygial gland.  Consequently, feathers can become waterlogged, making the bird barely buoyant. However, this allows it to dive easily and search for underwater prey, such as fish and amphibians. It can stay down for significant periods.
When necessary, the Anhinga will dry out its wings and feathers, with the resemblance of the semicircular full-spread shape of its group of tail feathers while drying them out, to that of true meleagrine males lending the name "water turkey" to it. It will perch for long periods with its wings spread to allow the drying process, as do cormorants. If it attempts to fly while its wings are wet, it has great difficulty getting off the water and takes off by flapping vigorously while "running" on the water.
Anhinga will often search for food in small groups.

==Conservation status==

The Anhinga is protected in the US under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918.[tpl]Cite web|author=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service|year=1995|title=Birds Protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act|url=http://www.fws.gov/migratorybirds/intrnltr/mbta/mbtandx.html|accessdate=2008-09-15|postscript= |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080508174755/http://www.fws.gov/migratorybirds/intrnltr/mbta/mbtandx.html |archivedate = 2008-05-08[/tpl]  The number of individual anhingas has not been estimated but they are considered to be of least concern because of the frequency of their occurrence in their [tpl]convert|15000000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl] global range.
