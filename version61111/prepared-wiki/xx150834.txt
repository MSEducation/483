==Professional career==

===New York Giants===

Mix was signed by the New York Giants as an undrafted free agent following the 2006 NFL Draft, in which two fellow Auburn receivers (Devin Aromashodu and Ben Obomanu) were drafted.  Mix spent the entire 2006 season on the Giants practice squad, but after an impressive training camp and preseason he managed to crack into the team's active roster to start the 2007 season.  He played each of the first four games, recording three catches for 39 yards in one game, but was waived on October 3, 2007 to make room on the roster for return specialist Domenik Hixon (who was claimed off waivers from the Denver Broncos).[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.giants.com/news/eisen/story.asp?story_id=26008 |title=Giants make roster moves |publisher=Giants.com |date=2007-10-03 |accessdate=2007-10-03[/tpl]
