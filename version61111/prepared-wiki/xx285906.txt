==Live performances==

"Do or Die" was first performed at the Church of Mars concerts in May 2013, shortly before the release of the album. The song later became a signature part of the opening stages of the Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams Tour which followed, usually appearing as the penultimate song before "Up in the Air".[tpl]cite web|title=30 Seconds to Mars Setlist at Rock am Ring 2013|url=http://www.setlist.fm/setlist/30-seconds-to-mars/2013/nurburgring-nurburg-germany-bd9ed4e.html|publisher=setlist.fm|accessdate=15 August 2013[/tpl] However, after the festival tour in June, which saw the band travel to Rock am Ring and Rock im Park for the first time as headline act, the song was moved to the middle of the setlist, usually played before frontman Jared Leto's acoustic B-stage set.[tpl]cite web|title=30 Seconds to Mars Setlist at Maxidrom 2013|url=http://www.setlist.fm/setlist/30-seconds-to-mars/2013/tushino-air-field-moscow-russia-53d9dbc1.html|publisher=setlist.fm|accessdate=15 August 2013[/tpl]
