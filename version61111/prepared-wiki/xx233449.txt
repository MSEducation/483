Imago commercialized the Local Electrode Atom Probe (LEAP), providing a new type of atom probe microscope which is literally orders of magnitude faster in many performance criteria than any other recently delivered atom probe microscope.http://link.aip.org/link/?RSINAK/78/031101/1 Review of Scientific Instruments March 2007  Imago (name comes from the Latin word for image or picture) has not only improved the instrumentation available for atom probe tomography, but has also developed many sample preparation techniques that are key enablers for the 3D sub-nanometer compositional information that the microscope provides.http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?aid=238971 Advances in Instrumentation and Techniques 2004
