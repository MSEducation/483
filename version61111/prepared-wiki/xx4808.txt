===Permeable reactive barriers===

Zerovalent iron is the main reactive material for permeable reactive barriers.[tpl]cite book | url = http://books.google.de/books?id=0MJap7ncvx8C&pg=PA5 | page = 5 | title = Long-Term Performance of Permeable Reactive Barriers | isbn = 9780080535616 | author1 = Roehl | first1 = K.E. | last2 = Meggyes | first2 = T | last3 = Simon | first3 = F.G. | last4 = Stewart | first4 = D.I. | date = 2005-04-27[/tpl]

==Toxicity==

Large amounts of ingested iron can cause excessive levels of iron in the blood. High blood levels of free ferrous iron react with peroxides to produce free radicals, which are highly reactive and can damage DNA, proteins, lipids, and other cellular components. Thus, iron toxicity occurs when there is free iron in the cell, which generally occurs when iron levels exceed the capacity of transferrin to bind the iron. Damage to the cells of the gastrointestinal tract can also prevent them from regulating iron absorption leading to further increases in blood levels. Iron typically damages cells in the heart, liver and elsewhere, which can cause significant adverse effects, including coma, metabolic acidosis, shock, liver failure, coagulopathy, adult respiratory distress syndrome, long-term organ damage, and even death. Humans experience iron toxicity above 20 milligrams of iron for every kilogram of mass, and 60 milligrams per kilogram is considered a lethal dose. Overconsumption of iron, often the result of children eating large quantities of ferrous sulfate tablets intended for adult consumption, is one of the most common toxicological causes of death in children under six. The Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) lists the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for adults as 45 mg/day. For children under fourteen years old the UL is 40 mg/day.
The medical management of iron toxicity is complicated, and can include use of a specific chelating agent called deferoxamine to bind and expel excess iron from the body.[tpl]Cite journal| last1 =Cheney|first1 =K.| last2 =Gumbiner|first2 =C.| last3 = Benson|first3 =B.| last4 = Tenenbein|first4 =M.|title=Survival after a severe iron poisoning treated with intermittent infusions of deferoxamine |journal=J Toxicol Clin Toxicol |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=61–6 |year=1995 |pmid=7837315 |doi=10.3109/15563659509020217[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal| last = Tenenbein|first = M|title=Benefits of parenteral deferoxamine for acute iron poisoning |journal=J Toxicol Clin Toxicol |volume=34 |issue=5 |pages=485–489 |year=1996 |pmid=8800185 |doi=10.3109/15563659609028005[/tpl]
