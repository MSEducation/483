Greg Broussard (born August 31, 1963 in Los Angeles, California), better known by his stage name Egyptian Lover, is an American musician, vocalist, producer and DJ, and was an important part of the L.A. dance music and rap scene in the early 1980s.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl]

==History==

The Egyptian Lover started out as a DJ in Los Angeles with Uncle Jam's Army DJing dances as large as the L.A. Sports Arena with 10,000 people. He began recording around Los Angeles in 1982 as a member of the Radio Crew, and also Uncle Jam's Army.
In the early days of hip hop albums were rare,[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl] so most of The Egyptian Lover's successful recordings were 12" singles. He would eventually release some of the earliest rap LPs, which was especially unique for being west-coast based,[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl] but they were less popular than his singles. But on the strength of containing an alternate mix of his most popular single "Egypt, Egypt", 1984's On the Nile was moderately successful.  After a break in the early 1990s, Egyptian Lover returned in 1994 (see 1994 in music) with Back from the Tomb. His last full-length album in over ten years. In 2006 The Egyptian Lover recorded another new album "Platinum Pyramids".
The Egyptian Lover also established his own record company, Egyptian Empire Records, which included artists such as Rodney O & Joe Cooley.
