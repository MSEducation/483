The Ushayka was navigable in the 19th century, but now it is no longer used for navigation.  The Ushayka divides Tomsk into northern and southern parts; there are more than ten bridges over it. In its upper reaches the Ushayka is a forest river, very cold even in the middle of summer and clear.  When it gets to the territory of Tomsk, Ushayka becomes rather dirty due to large amount of manufacturing and domestic water flowing into it.
