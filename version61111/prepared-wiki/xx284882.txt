The Philadelphia Independent was a newspaper in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, published from 1931 to 1971 that billed itself as "The World's Greatest Negro Tabloid."[tpl]cite web|title=About The Philadelphia independent.

The paper was run by Forrist Woodard from 1931 until his death in 1958. His wife, Kitty Woodard, then ran the paper until she sold it in 1966. Throughout its history, the Independent competed with the Philadelphia Tribune for black readers. Kitty Woodard told The Philadelphia Inquirer in a 1997 interview, "The Independent was for the masses. The Tribune had always been the paper for the upper class. We were militant. We weren't afraid to take on issues like they were."[tpl]cite news|last=John-Hall|first=Annette|title=Local Treasure Starting Tomorrow, Philadelphia's First Woman Publisher -- Kathryn Fambro Woodard -- Will Be Filling People In On Her Life And Legacy|url=http://articles.philly.com/1997-11-19/living/25545125_1_publisher-conference-organizers-hope-reliving-history|accessdate=11 August 2013|newspaper=The Philadelphia Inquirer|date=19 November 1997[/tpl]
