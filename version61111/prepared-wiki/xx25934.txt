The Scottish National Gallery is the national art gallery of Scotland. It is located on The Mound in central Edinburgh, in a neoclassical building designed by William Henry Playfair, and first opened to the public in 1859. The gallery houses the Scottish national collection of fine art, including Scottish and international art from the beginning of the Renaissance up to the start of the 20th century.

==History==

The origins of Scotland's national collection lie with the Royal Institution for the Encouragement of the Fine Arts in Scotland, founded in 1819. It began to acquire paintings, and in 1828 the Royal Institution building opened on The Mound. In 1826, the Scottish Academy was founded by a group of artists as an offshoot of the Royal Institution, and in 1838 it became the Royal Scottish Academy (RSA). A key aim of the RSA was the founding of a national collection. It began to build up a collection and from 1835 rented exhibition space within the Royal Institution building.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.nationalgalleries.org/visit/history-architecture-121/ | title = Scottish National Gallery - History & Architecture | accessdate = 2014-01-27[/tpl]
In the 1840s plans were put in place for a new building to house the RSA in a new building. William Henry Playfair was commissioned to prepare designs, and on 30 August 1850, Prince Albert laid the foundation stone.[tpl]cite web | url = http://data.historic-scotland.gov.uk/pls/htmldb/f?p=2200:15:0::::BUILDING,HL:27679,the%20mound | title = THE MOUND, NATIONAL GALLERY OF SCOTLAND WITH RAILINGS (Ref:27679) | accessdate = 2014-01-27[/tpl] The building was originally divided along the middle, with the east half housing the exhibition galleries of the RSA, and the western half containing the new National Gallery, formed from the collection of the Royal Institution. In 1912 the RSA moved into the Royal Institution building, which remains known as the Royal Scottish Academy Building. At this time, internal remodelling was carried out by William Thomas Oldrieve. When it re-opened, the gallery concentrated on building its permanent collection of Scottish and European art for the nation of Scotland
Additional basement galleries were constructed in 1970. In the early 21st century, the Playfair Project saw the renovation of the Royal Scottish Academy Building and the construction of an underground connecting space between the Gallery and the Academy Building. Construction took five years and cost Â£32 million.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nationalgalleries.org/aboutus/special-projects/the-playfair-project// |title=Playfair Project |publisher=National Galleries of Scotland |accessdate=3 April 2012[/tpl] The new underground space was opened as the Weston Link in August 2004.[tpl]cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/3533074.stm |title=Opening day for gallery project |publisher=BBC News |date=4 August 2009[/tpl] Designed by John Miller and Partners, the link, now known as the Gardens Entrance, provides a new access from Princes Street Gardens and contains a lecture theatre, education area, shop, restaurant and an interactive gallery.
