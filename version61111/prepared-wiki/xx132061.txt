[[Pegasus Field]]

CATEGORIES: Airports in the Ross Dependency, McMurdo Station

Pegasus Field [tpl]airport codes||NZPG[/tpl] is an airstrip in Antarctica, the southernmost of three airfields serving McMurdo Station. Pegasus is a blue ice runway capable of handling wheeled aircraft year-round. The other two are the snow runways at Williams Field [tpl]airport codes||NZWD[/tpl] that are limited to ski-equipped aircraft, and the Ice Runway [tpl]airport codes||NZIR[/tpl] on the sea-ice available during the summer Antarctic field season.
The field is named after Pegasus, a C-121 Lockheed Constellation, still visible there in the snow after crashing in bad weather on October 8, 1970.  No one on board was injured. 
On September 11, 2008, a United States Air Force C-17 Globemaster III successfully completed the first landing in Antarctica using night-vision goggles at Pegasus Field.[tpl]cite web | url=http://antarcticsun.usap.gov/features/contenthandler.cfm?id=1544 | title=Air Force successfully tests new capability to fly any time of year to McMurdo| work=Antarctic Sun|first=Peter| last=Rejcek| date=September 26, 2008[/tpl] Previously air transport in the permanent darkness of the winter was only used in emergencies, with burning barrels of fuel to outline the runway.
