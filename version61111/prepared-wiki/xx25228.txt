</ref> This raises the question of what inbred lines should be crossed (to produce hybrids) with each other as parents to maximize yield in their hybrid progeny. This is termed the 'combining ability' of the parental lines. The identification of good combining ability at an early stage in the breeding programme can reduce the costs associated with 'carrying' a large number of plants (literally thousands) through it, and thus forms part of efficient selection. Combining ability is assessed by taking into consideration all available information on [[Common descent|descent]] ([[Genetics|genetic]] relatedness), [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]], qualitative (simply inherited) traits and [[biochemical]] and molecular markers. Exceptionally little information exists on the use of molecular markers to predict heterosis in triticale.<ref name="GÃ³ral2005">
