[tpl]nihongo|Liquid Snake|リキッド・スネーク|Rikiddo Sunēku|lead=yes[/tpl] is a fictional character from Konami's Metal Gear series.

==Characteristics and design==

Introduced in Metal Gear Solid, Liquid Snake is Solid Snake's twin brother and Big Boss's second clone via the Les Enfants Terribles project.[tpl]cite video game|title=Metal Gear Solid|year=1998|developer=Kojima Productions|publisher=Konami|quote=Liquid Snake: There's a killer inside you... You don't have to deny it. We were created to be that way. / Solid Snake: Created? / Liquid Snake: Les enfants terribles... the terrible children. That's what the project was called. It started in 1970s. Their plan was to artificially create the most powerful soldier possible. The person that they chose as the model was the man known then as the greatest living soldier in the world...[/tpl] Raised in the United Kingdom following his birth, Liquid served as an operative for the British SAS and later became the field commander of FOXHOUND prior to the events of the game.[tpl]cite video game|title=Metal Gear Solid|developer=KCEJ|year=1999|quote=Roy Campbell: But he never once showed his face in Century House. He was taken prisoner in Iraq, and after that there was no trace of him for several years. After you retired, he was rescued and became a member of FOX-HOUND[/tpl] One of Liquid's motivations is his hatred towards Snake, as Liquid believes that Solid received all of Big Boss's superior genes, and that he was destined to be inferior. After the game's credits, it is revealed that Liquid was intentionally deceived in order to drive him to carry on with Big Boss's legacy.[tpl]cite video game|title=Metal Gear Solid|developer=KCEJ|quote=Revolver Ocelot: Yes. The inferior one was the winner after all. ...That's right. Until the very end, Liquid thought he was the inferior one.[/tpl] Liquid resembles Snake in terms of facial appearance and physique, with the primary differences being his different skin tone and medium-length blond hair, as well as a tattoo of a snake entwined around a sword on his left arm.
It was intended during the finalization of Metal Gear Solid 2 for Liquid Snake to send Arsenal Gear crashing into Manhattan in the game's climax.[tpl]cite video game|title=The Document of Metal Gear Solid 2|developer=KCEJ|quote="Liquid Snake": "Time to say goodbye." / "Liquid Snake" flips a switch inside RAY. / Solid Snake: "What are you doing?" / "Liquid Snake": "I’ve started Arsenal's navigation program. The course will take me straight into Manhattan." / Raiden: "You're planning to -- to crash this thing into New York City!?" / Solid Snake: "It'll be a full scale disaster..." / "Liquid Snake": "Disaster? That has a nice ring to it."[/tpl]  However, the line of dialogue that was intended to explicitly state this was cut from the final release, due to the September 11 attacks occurring as the game was nearing finalization. The dialogue, however, was retained in the novelization.

==Appearances==

Liquid Snake is introduced in Metal Gear Solid as the game's main antagonist. He Is Solid Snake's twin brother and Big Boss's second clone. He and Snake meet for the first time face-to-face in the torture room where the DARPA chief was killed by Revolver Ocelot. His ultimate goal is the restoration of Big Boss's "dying wish" in attempts to sever the world from control from "hypocritical politicians". Liquid battles Snake multiple times throughout the Shadow Moses Incident, such as the Hind D battle, and the battle against Metal Gear REX after Liquid manipulated Snake in activating the PAL codes via his Master Miller disguise. Though REX was armed and ready, Snake managed to destroy the Metal Gear, though Liquid survived and took Snake to the top of REX where he revealed their own "birth" as a result of the "Les Enfants Terribles" project. Both Liquid and Solid battled hand-to-hand atop REX, before Solid prevailed leaving Liquid for dead. However Liquid survived the fall from REX, and pursued Snake and Meryl Silverburgh in a jeep chase that resulted in a crash outside the island's facility. Liquid took one last attempt to kill Snake, but before he could, he realized that he was going to die and faced Solid one last time before he was killed by FOXDIE. Liquid's death left Snake perplexed as to when "his time is up".
Liquid Snake seemingly returns in Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty as a dormant personality that would possess Revolver Ocelot after an arm transplant where Ocelot replaces his own severed hand with one taken from Liquid's corpse thanks to Solidus Snake.[tpl]cite video game|title=Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty|developer=Kojima Productions|quote=Revolver Ocelot (Liquid Snake): The price of physical prodigy... Few more years and you'll be another dead clone of the old man. Our raw materials are vintage, brother. Big Boss was in his late fifties when they created his copies. But I -- I live on, through this arm. / Solid Snake: Liquid's arm?[/tpl] Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots revealed that "Liquid Ocelot" was formed through artificial means in order to fool the Patriots.[tpl]cite video game|title=Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of The Patriots|developer=Kojima Productions|quote=Big Boss: And Ocelot... In order to fool the System... Used nanomachines and psychotherapy to transplant Liquid's personality onto his own. He used hypnotic suggestion to turn himself into Liquid's mental doppelganger.[/tpl] Meanwhile, Liquid's corpse and Solidus's biomort was used to surgically reconstruct Big Boss.
Liquid Snake is alluded in Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops as Big Boss's "son who will bring the world to ruin" and in Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker on a secret tape that implies that Liquid and Solid act as an insurance policy for Cipher (the Patriots) in the event that Big Boss did not return to their fold.
