[[Deep external pudendal artery]]

CATEGORIES: Arteries of the lower limb

The deep external pudendal artery (deep external pudic artery), more deeply seated than the superficial external pudendal artery, passes medially across the Pectineus and the Adductor longus muscles; it is covered by the fascia lata, which it pierces at the medial side of the thigh, and is distributed, in the male, to the integument of the scrotum and perineum, in the female to the labium majus; its branches anastomose with the scrotal (or labial) branches of the perineal artery.
