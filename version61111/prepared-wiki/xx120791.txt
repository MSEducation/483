Wilgus State Park is a state park in Ascutney, Vermont. The park offers canoeing along the Connecticut River and hiking up the Pinnacle Trail. The park has tent and lean-to sites and is quite close to Mount Ascutney and the Saint-Gaudens National Historic Site.
The park was originally constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps and is now administered by the Vermont Department of Forests, Parks, and Recreation as part of the Vermont state park system. It is named after William J. Wilgus, who donated the land for the park in 1933.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.vtstateparks.com/htm/wilgus.htm |title=Wilgus State Park |work=Vermont Department of Forests, Parks, and Recreation |accessdate=December 19, 2012[/tpl]
