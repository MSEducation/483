==History==

The area which was to become Duke's Place was occupied until its dissolution in 1531  by the Priory of Holy Trinity, Christ Church. Henry VIII then gave the land to Sir Thomas Audley who cleared it and built houses on the site,  although fragments of the medieval buildings still survived at the beginning of the nineteenth century. The area was eventually inherited by Audley's son-in-law, the Duke of Norfolk, from whom the name "Duke's Place" is derived.
In the early seventeenth century the residents of the area, who found St Katherine Cree "uncongenial"[tpl]cite book|title='Vanished churches of the City of London|author= Huelin, G.: |location=London|publisher=Guildhall Library Publishing|year=1996|isbn=0-900422-42-4[/tpl]   sought permission from the king,  James I to build a new church.This they did, dedicating it to St James in his honour. It was consecrated on 2 January  1622.[tpl]cite book|author=Noorthouck, John |volume= 2|chapter= Aldgate Ward|title= A New History of London: Including Westminster and Southwark|year=1773|pages= 545–9|url= http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=46748 |accessdate=10 December 2013[/tpl] The  patronage of the church belonged to the lord mayor and commonalty of London, and the parish claimed  exemption from the Bishop of London in ecclesiastical matters. It was notable in the late 17th century as a "marriage factory", with multiple ceremonies each day.
The church survived the Great Fire of London,The Churches of the City of London. Reynolds, H.

George Godwin, writing in 1839, called it "a plain warehouse like construction of brick, quite unworthy of description". It was 65 feet long and 42 feet wide, and  divided into nave and aisles by wooden columns supporting  entablatures and a flat ceiling.[tpl]cite book |last1=Allen |first1=Thomas  |last2=Wright |first2=Thomas|title=The History and Antiquities of  London, Westminster, Southwark and Parts Adjacent|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3fo-AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA69&dq#v  |volume=3 |year= 1839  |publisher= George Virtue|location= London  |page=70[/tpl] The stained glass in the east widow, included the arms of Sir Edward Barkham, the Lord Mayor who had been instrumental in the establishment of the church.  There was a tower; Godwin suspected its trefoil openings were survivals from the priory building.  An organ ("exceedingly small", according to Godwin ) was installed in 1815 and the church  restored in 1823.
The poverty of the area and its increasing  Jewish populationSee Bevis Marks Synagogue made it increasingly difficult to raise funds to maintain the church;  Godwin described it as being "in a very dirty and dilapidated state".[tpl]cite book |last1=Godwin |first1= George |coauthors=John Britton |title=The Churches of London: A History and Description of the Ecclesiastical Edifices of the Metropolis |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AtI9AAAAcAAJ&printsec=frontcover  |accessdate= 18 March 2012 |year=1839  |publisher=C.

The site of the church is now occupied by the Sir John Cass School.
