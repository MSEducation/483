==Civil rights law==

As a lawyer, Ackman has successfully represented taxi drivers in claims against the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC).[tpl]Cite news|title=Lawyer Says Taxi Judges Are Unfair to Cabbies|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/08/nyregion/08taxi.html|publisher=New York Times|first=Sewell|last=Chan|date=2005-01-08|accessdate=2010-04-30[/tpl][tpl]Cite web|title=Jack Trask, Yellow Peril: Good Cabbies Are Being Punished by the TLC|url=http://www.nypress.com/14/7/news&columns/feature.cfm|publisher=New York Press|date=2001-02-14[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=December 2013[/tpl] These victories include:
On March 25, 2011, in Nnebe v. Daus, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated in large part a district court ruling that permitted the TLC to suspend a taxi driver based solely on an arrest (including misdemeanor arrests) and continue that suspension without a meaningful hearing, and without any evidence or suspicion that the driver had ever harmed a passenger. (New York Law Journal, March 28, 2011).[tpl]cite news|publisher = Legal Eagle|url=http://www.leagle.com/xmlResult.aspx?xmldoc=In%20FCO%2020110325080.xml&docbase=CSLWAR3-2007-CURR |title=Nnebe v. Daus|accessdate=2013-12-22[/tpl] (Writing for Forbes about the earlier district court ruling, University of Chicago Law Professor Richard Epstein attacked that ruling, saying the court ignored the "obvious need for an expanded initial hearing that lets the driver give his version of the facts and, if need be, to post a bond to continue to earn his livelihood." [tpl]cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/2009/10/20/due-process-property-forfeiture-opinions-columnists-richard-a-epstein.html|title=A Plea For Procedural Due Process | publisher=Forbes| first=Richard|last=Epstein|date=2009-10-20|accessdate=2013-12-22[/tpl] Professor Epstein noted as well that 90% of the cabbies who were arrested and suspended over the years were ultimately exonerated.)
Another case, Rothenberg v. Daus, contests TLC's practice of revoking taxicab drivers' licenses who are convicted of a crime, including non-violent misdemeanors and even traffic infractions, almost always occurring when the cab driver was off duty.  The TLC had succeeded in winning a motion to dismiss, but the Second Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the district court order and reinstated] all of the cabdrivers' claims.
Ackman is challenging the legitimacy of the city's administrative law tribunals in two lawsuits pending in the New York federal courts and has led the successful effort to discredit the TLC's charges that a majority of the city's taxi drivers have overcharged passengers.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/12/opinion/nyregionopinions/12CIackman.html?n=Top%2FReference%2FTimes%20Topics%2FOrganizations%2FC%2FCharter%20Revision%20Commission|title=The Price of Justice|publisher=New York Times| first=Dan | last=Ackman | date=2006-02-12 | accessdate=2010-04-30[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=The Amazing, Improbable, But Arguably Brilliant Career of Sam Sloan|url=http://dackman.homestead.com/SamSloanSun.htm|first=Dan|last=Ackman|accessdate=2013-12-22[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|title=TLC Statistics are Taking Honest New York City Cabbies for a Ride|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/opinions/2010/03/24/2010-03-24_tlc_data_is_taking_honest_new_york_city_cabbies_for_a_ride.html|first=Dan|last=Ackman|first2=Bhairavi|last2=Desai|publisher=New York Daily News|work=NYDailyNews.com|date=2010-03-23|accessdate=2013-12-22[/tpl][tpl]Cite news| title=High Court Ruling On GPS Tracking Could Affect City Taxi Suit|url=http://www.wnyc.org/blogs/wnyc-news-blog/2012/jan/24/high-court-ruling-gps-tracking-could-affect-city-taxi-suit/|first=Kathleen|last=Horan|publisher=New York Public Radio|work=WNYC.org|date=2012-01-24|accessdate=2013-12-22[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|title=NYC Cabbies Fight GPS Tracking|url=http://www.courthousenews.com/2012/02/03/43604.htm|publisher=Courthouse News Service|work=CourthouseNews.com|date=2012-02-03|accessdate=2013-12-22[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|title=Taking Liberties: Cab Driver Isn't Paranoid, the Government Is Watching Him|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/05/03/taking-liberties-follow-that-cab/|publisher=Fox News|work=FoxNews.com|first=Douglas|last=Kennedy|date=2012-05-03|accessdate=2013-12-22[/tpl]
