Belgarath the Sorcerer is a book by David Eddings and Leigh Eddings.
Set in the same universe as the Eddings' The Belgariad and The Malloreon, it is effectively one big flashback (or a prequel) to the other series, although the framework story is set after the events of The Malloreon.
The book opens shortly after the end of The Malloreon with Belgarion, with help from Durnik, pestering Belgarath to write an autobiographical account of the events prior to The Belgariad. The core of the book is in the form of Belgarath's memoirs starting with his becoming an outcast from his village and becoming first disciple of the god Aldur and ending with the birth of Belgarionâ€”a span of about seven thousand years.
Polgara the Sorceress is a companion book to Belgarath the Sorcerer which form the memoirs of Belgarath's elder daughter, Polgara.

==Inconsistencies==

Belgarath creates inconsistencies with the rest of the books in the series rather than just fill in all the gaps.  Although Belgarath explains that the historical texts used previously had inaccuracies, the real inconsistencies are to do with things that contemporary characters who lived through those times had said but have changed in Belgarath.  Here is a list of inconsistencies:
It should be noted, however, that the original series (Belgariad and Malloreon) are technically considered to be stories told, whereas "Belgarath the Sorcerer" is the truth as he remembers it, and both are therefore to be considered potentially flawed.
