Copyright infringement is the use of works protected by copyright law without permission, infringing certain exclusive rights granted to the copyright holder, such as the right to reproduce, distribute, display or perform the protected work, or to make derivative works. The copyright holder is typically the work's creator, or a publisher or other business to whom copyright has been assigned. In relation to computer software, the Business Software Alliance (BSA) claimed in its 2011 piracy study: "Public opinion continues to support intellectual property (IP) rights: Seven PC users in 10 support paying innovators to promote more technological advances." Following consultation with experts on copyright infringement, the United States Government Accountability Office (GAO) clarified in 2010 that "estimating the economic impact of IP property infringements is extremely difficult, and assumptions must be used due to the absence of data," while "it is difficult, if not impossible, to quantify the net effect of counterfeiting and piracy on the economy as a whole."[tpl]cite web|title=INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY Observations on Efforts to Quantify the Economic Effects of Counterfeit and Pirated Goods|url=http://www.gao.gov/assets/310/303057.pdf|work=Report to Congressional Committees|publisher=United States Government Accountability Office|accessdate=21 April 2014|author=United States Government Accountability Office|format=PDF|date=April 2010[/tpl]  

==Terminology==

In the 21st century, the terms "piracy" and "theft" are often associated with copyright infringement.[tpl]cite web|title=Game of Thrones: Another case for piracy|url=http://www.abc.net.au/technology/articles/2014/04/08/3980980.htm|work=ABC technology+games|publisher=ABC|accessdate=21 April 2014|author=Nick Ross|date=8 April 2014[/tpl] The original meaning of "piracy" is defined as "robbery or illegal violence at sea" by the "Dictionary.com" website;[tpl]cite web|title=piracy|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/piracy?s=t|work=Dictionary.com|publisher=Dictionary.com, LLC|accessdate=21 April 2014|year=2014[/tpl] however, the term has been used as a synonym for acts of copyright infringement for a significant period of time. Theft emphasizes the potential commercial harm of infringement to copyright holders; however, not all copyright infringement results in commercial loss, and the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1985 that infringement does not easily equate with theft.Dowling v. United States (1985), 473 U.S. 207, pp. 217–218.
In the case MPAA v. Hotfile, Judge Kathleen Williams granted a motion to deny the prosecution the usage of pejorative words in the copyright infringement case.https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20131130/15263725410/surprise-mpaa-told-it-cant-use-terms-piracy-theft-stealing-during-hotfile-trial.shtml This list included the words "piracy," "theft," "stealing," and their derivatives—the use of which, even if the defendants had been found to have directly infringed on the Plaintiffs’ copyrights, the defense asserted, would serve no purpose but to misguide and inflame the jury.[ref]
</ref> The plaintiff argued the common use of the terms when referring to copyright infringement should invalidate the motion, but the Judge did not concur.<ref>
</ref> (The case was however settled shortly before it reached the jury phase of the trial.<ref>[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/mpaa-will-collect-80-million-661668 | work=The Hollywood Reporter | first=Eriq | last=Gardner | title=MPAA Will Collect $80 Million Settlement in Big Lawsuit Against Hotfile[/tpl]</ref>)

==="Piracy"===

The practice of labelling the infringement of exclusive rights in creative works as "piracy" predates statutory copyright law. Prior to the Statute of Anne in 1710, the Stationers' Company of London in 1557 received a Royal Charter giving the company a monopoly on publication and tasking it with enforcing the charter. Those who violated the charter were labelled pirates as early as 1603.T. Dekker. Wonderfull Yeare, 1603, reprinted by University of Oregon The term "piracy" has been used to refer to the unauthorized copying, distribution and selling of works in copyright.[tpl]cite web| last = Panethiere| first = Darrell| title = The Persistence of Piracy: The Consequences for Creativity, for Culture, and for Sustainable Development| publisher = UNESCO e-Copyright Bulletin| date = July–September 2005| page=2| url = http://portal.unesco.org/culture/en/files/28696/11513329261panethiere_en.pdf/panethiere_en.pdf[/tpl] Article 12 of the 1886 Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works uses the term "piracy" in relation to copyright infringement, stating "Pirated works may be seized on importation into those countries of the Union where the original work enjoys legal protection."[tpl]cite web| last = Panethiere| first = Darrell| title = The Persistence of Piracy: The Consequences for Creativity, for Culture, and for Sustainable Development| publisher = UNESCO e-Copyright Bulletin| date = July–September 2005| page = 14| url = http://portal.unesco.org/culture/en/files/28696/11513329261panethiere_en.pdf/panethiere_en.pdf[/tpl] Article 61 of the 1994 Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) requires criminal procedures and penalties in cases of "willful trademark counterfeiting or copyright piracy on a commercial scale."[tpl]Cite book| last = Correa| first = Carlos Maria| coauthors = Li, Xuan| title = Intellectual property enforcement: international perspectives| publisher = Edward Elgar Publishing | year = 2009| page = 208| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=bN3o1uwpKF4C&dq=copyright+infringement+international+acta&source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-1-84844-663-2 [/tpl] Piracy traditionally refers to acts of copyright infringement intentionally committed for financial gain, though more recently, copyright holders have described online copyright infringement, particularly in relation to peer-to-peer file sharing networks, as "piracy."
Richard Stallman and the GNU Project have criticized the use of the word "piracy" in these situations, saying that publishers use the word to refer to "copying they don't approve of" and that "they publishers imply that it is ethically equivalent to attacking ships on the high seas, kidnapping and murdering the people on them."[ref]
</ref> 
Certain forms of Anti-Piracy (such as DRM), are considered by consumers to control the use of the products content after sale.
Like any "property" with exclusive ownership rights and profit potential, software too is liable to be misused for commercial or other personal gain, despite all security measures, precautions and insurance protection normally characteristic of all private property. Plagiarism of software (in educational institutions), piracy of software (in industry) for commercial or non-commercial use, copyright infringement of software and its related files such as databases, are all various instances of such unlawful ‘borrowing’ of software. Plagiarism and piracy can amount to copyright infringement and copyright infringement in turn can happen even without actually pirating the software.[ref]
</ref>

==="Theft"===

Copyright holders frequently refer to copyright infringement as theft. In copyright law, infringement does not refer to theft of physical objects that take away the owner's possession, but an instance where a person exercises one of the exclusive rights of the copyright holder without authorization.[tpl]Cite book| last = Clough| first = Jonathan | title = Principles of Cybercrime | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2010| page = 221| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=JVPnCqEuTksC&dq=copyright+infringement+theft&source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-521-72812-6 [/tpl] Courts have distinguished between copyright infringement and theft. For instance, the United States Supreme Court held in Dowling v. United States (1985) that bootleg phonorecords did not constitute stolen property. Instead, "interference with copyright does not easily equate with theft, conversion, or fraud. The Copyright Act even employs a separate term of art to define one who misappropriates a copyright: '... an infringer of the copyright.'" The court said that in the case of copyright infringement, the province guaranteed to the copyright holder by copyright law—certain exclusive rights—is invaded, but no control, physical or otherwise, is taken over the copyright, nor is the copyright holder wholly deprived of using the copyrighted work or exercising the exclusive rights held.

==Motivation==

Some of the motives for engaging in copyright infringement are the following:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tcs.cam.ac.uk/story_type/site_trail_story/interview-gabe-newell/ |title=Interview: Gabe Newell |publisher=Tcs.cam.ac.uk |date=2011-11-24 |accessdate=2012-01-27[/tpl]
Sometimes only partial compliance with license agreements is the cause. For example, in 2013 the US Army settled a lawsuit with Texas-based company Apptricity, which makes software that allows the army to track their soldiers in real time. In 2004, the US Army paid US$4.5 million for a license of 500 users, while allegedly installing the software for more than 9000 users; the case was settled for US$50 million.[tpl]cite news|title=US agrees to pay $50m after 'piracy' of software|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-25137089|accessdate=21 April 2014|newspaper=BBC News|date=28 November 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=US Army settles in $180 million software piracy case|url=http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2013/12/02/us-army-settles-in-180-million-software-piracy-case/|accessdate=21 April 2014|newspaper=Fox News|date=2 December 2013[/tpl] Major anti-piracy organizations, like the BSA, conduct software licensing audits regularly to ensure full compliance.[tpl]cite book|author=IDG Network World Inc|publisher=Network World|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hhsEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA81|date=17 November 1997|title=Surviving an audit|page=81|id=[tpl]ISSN|08877661[/tpl][/tpl]
Cara Cusumano, director of the Tribeca Film Festival, stated in April 2014: "Piracy is less about people not wanting to pay and more about just wanting the immediacy - people saying, 'I want to watch Spiderman right now' and downloading it". The statement occurred during the third year that the festival used the Internet to present its content, while it was the first year that it featured a showcase of content producers who work exclusively online. Cusumano further explained that downloading behavior is not merely conducted by people who merely want to obtain content for free: 
 
 I think that if companies were willing to put that material out there, moving forward, consumers will follow. It's just that they consumers want to consume films online and they're ready to consume films that way and we're not necessarily offering them in that way. So it's the distribution models that need to catch up. People will pay for the content.[tpl]cite news|title=Tribeca Film Festival programmer urges film industry to forget piracy and embrace internet|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-04-17/film-industry-urged-to-forget-piracy-embrace-internet/5388156#comments|accessdate=21 April 2014|newspaper=ABC News|date=17 April 2014|author=Matt Eaton[/tpl] 
In response to Cusumano's perspective, Screen Producers Australia executive director Matt Deaner clarified the motivation of the film industry: "Distributors are usually wanting to encourage cinema-going as part of this process through returns and restrict the immediate access to online so as to encourage the maximum number of people to go to the cinema." Deaner further explained the matter in terms of the Australian film industry, stating: "there are currently restrictions on quantities of tax support that a film can receive unless the film has a traditional cinema release."  

===Developing world===

In Media Piracy in Emerging Economies, the first independent international comparative study of media piracy with center on Brazil, India, Russia, South Africa, Mexico and Bolivia, “high prices for media goods, low incomes, and cheap digital technologies” are the chief factors that lead to the global spread of media piracy, especially in emerging markets.[tpl]cite web| title = Media Piracy in Emerging Economies| url = http://piracy.americanassembly.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/MPEE-PDF-1.0.4.pdf| publisher = Social Science Research Council| year = 2011| pages = i| accessdate = April 2013[/tpl]
According to the same study, even though digital piracy inflicts additional costs on the production side of media, it also offers the main access to media goods in developing countries. The strong tradeoffs that favor using digital piracy in developing economies dictate the current neglected law enforcements toward digital piracy.[tpl]cite web| title = Media Piracy in Emerging Economies| url = http://piracy.americanassembly.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/MPEE-PDF-1.0.4.pdf| publisher = Social Science Research Council| year = 2011| pages = i|  accessdate = April 2013[/tpl]  In China, the issue of digital piracy is not merely legal, but social – originating from the high demand for cheap and affordable pirated goods as well as the governmental connections of the businesses which produce such goods.[tpl]Cite news|date=2013-03-13| title=Stealing Books for the Poor| url = http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/14/opinion/yu-stealing-books-for-the-poor.html| accessdate = 2013-04-28 | publisher = The New York Times| first=Yu| last=Hua[/tpl]

===Motivations due to censorship===

There have been instances where a country's government bans a movie, resulting in the spread of pirated videos and DVDs.  Romanian-born documentary maker Ilinca Calugareanu wrote a New York Times article telling the story of Irina Margareta Nistor, a narrator for state TV under Nicolae Ceauşescu's regime.  A visitor from the west gave her bootlegged copies of American movies, which she dubbed for secret viewings through Romania.  According to the article, she dubbed more than 3,000 movies and became the country's second-most famous voice after Ceauşescu, even though no one knew her name until many years later.[tpl]Cite news|date = 2014-02-17| title = VHS vs. Communism| url = http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/18/opinion/vhs-vs-communism.html?hp&rref=opinion| accessdate = 2014-02-18| publisher = The New York Times| first=Ilinca| last=Calugareanu[/tpl]

==Existing and proposed laws==

Most countries extend copyright protections to authors of works. In countries with copyright legislation, enforcement of copyright is generally the responsibility of the copyright holder.[tpl]Cite book| last = Correa| first = Carlos Maria| coauthors = Li, Xuan| title = Intellectual property enforcement: international perspectives| publisher = Edward Elgar Publishing | year = 2009| page = 211| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=bN3o1uwpKF4C&dq=copyright+infringement+international+acta&source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-1-84844-663-2 [/tpl]  However in several jurisdictions there are also criminal penalties for copyright infringement.Irina D. Manta  Spring 2011 The Puzzle of Criminal Sanctions for Intellectual Property Infringement Harvard Journal of Law & Technology 24(2):469–518

===Civil law===

In the U.S., copyright infringement is sometimes confronted via lawsuits in civil court, against alleged infringers directly, or against providers of services and software that support unauthorized copying. For example, major motion-picture corporation MGM Studios filed suit against P2P file-sharing services Grokster and Streamcast for their contributory role in copyright infringement.McDonald, Paul, and Janet Wasko. The Contemporary Hollywood Film Industry. Malden, MA: Blackwell Pub., 2008. Print. p.202 In 2005, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of MGM, holding that such services could be held liable for copyright infringement since they functioned and, indeed, willfully marketed themselves as venues for acquiring copyrighted movies. The MGM v. Grokster case did not overturn the earlier Sony decision, but rather clouded the legal waters; future designers of software capable of being used for copyright infringement were warned.McDonald, Paul, and Janet Wasko. The Contemporary Hollywood Film Industry. Malden, MA: Blackwell Pub., 2008. Print.p.203
In the United States, copyright term has been extended many times over[tpl]cite web|url=http://copyright.gov/circs/circ1a.html |title=U.S. Copyright Office – Information Circular |publisher=Copyright.gov |accessdate=2012-01-27[/tpl] from the original term of 14 years with a single renewal allowance of 14 years, to the current term of the life of the author plus 70 years. If the work was produced under corporate authorship it may last 120 years after creation or 95 years after publication, whichever is less.
Article 50 of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) requires that signatory countries enable courts to remedy copyright infringement with injunctions and the destruction of infringing products, and award damages.

===Criminal law===

Punishment of copyright infringement varies case-by-case across countries. Convictions may include jail time and/or severe fines for each instance of copyright infringement. In the United States, willful copyright infringement carries a maximum penalty of $150,000 per instance.[tpl]cite web|url=http://copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html |title=U.S. Copyright Office – Copyright Law: Chapter 5 |publisher=Copyright.gov |accessdate=2012-01-27[/tpl]
Article 61 of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) requires that signatory countries establish criminal procedures and penalties in cases of "willful trademark counterfeiting or copyright piracy on a commercial scale". Copyright holders have demanded that states provide criminal sanctions for all types of copyright infringement.
The first criminal provision in U.S. copyright law was added in 1897, which established a misdemeanor penalty for “unlawful performances and representations of copyrighted dramatic and musical compositions” if the violation had been “willful and for profit.”Act of Jan. 6, 1897, ch. 4, 29 Stat. 481-82. Criminal copyright infringement requires that the infringer acted “for the purpose of commercial advantage or private financial gain." [tpl]USC|17|506(a)[/tpl]. To establish criminal liability, the prosecutor must first show the basic elements of copyright infringement: ownership of a valid copyright, and the violation of one or more of the copyright holder’s exclusive rights. The government must then establish that defendant willfully infringed or, in other words, possessed the necessary mens rea. Misdemeanor infringement has a very low threshold in terms of number of copies and the value of the infringed works.
The ACTA trade agreement, signed in May 2011 by the United States, Japan, Switzerland, and the EU, requires that its parties add criminal penalties, including incarceration and fines, for copyright and trademark infringement, and obligated the parties to actively police for infringement.Miriam Bitton (2012) Rethinking the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement’s Criminal Copyright Enforcement Measures The Journal Of Criminal Law & Criminology 102(1):67–117[tpl]cite web| title = The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement – Summary of Key Elements Under Discussion| work = transparency paper| publisher = Swiss federation of Intellectual Property| date = November 2009| url = https://www.ige.ch/fileadmin/user_upload/Juristische_Infos/e/transparency_paper.pdf| format = PDF| accessdate = 8 June 2010 [/tpl]
United States v. LaMacchia 871 F.Supp. 535 (1994) was a case decided by the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts which ruled that, under the copyright and cybercrime laws effective at the time, committing copyright infringement for non-commercial motives could not be prosecuted under criminal copyright law. The ruling gave rise to what became known as the "LaMacchia Loophole," wherein criminal charges of fraud or copyright infringement would be dismissed under current legal standards, so long as there was no profit motive involved.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.loundy.com/CASES/US_v_LaMacchia.html |title=United States of America v. David LaMacchia, Memorandum of Decision and Order on Defendant's Motion to Dismiss|date=28 December 1994[/tpl]
The United States No Electronic Theft Act (NET Act), a federal law passed in 1997 in response to LaMacchia, provides for criminal prosecution of individuals who engage in copyright infringement under certain circumstances, even when there is no monetary profit or commercial benefit from the infringement. Maximum penalties can be five years in prison and up to $250,000 in fines. The NET Act also raised statutory damages by 50%. The court's ruling explicitly drew attention to the shortcomings of current law that allowed people to facilitate mass copyright infringement while being immune to prosecution under the Copyright Act.
Proposed laws such as the Stop Online Piracy Act broaden the definition of "willful infringement", and introduce felony charges for unauthorized media streaming. These bills are aimed towards defeating websites that carry or contain links to infringing content, but have raised concerns about domestic abuse and internet censorship.

===Noncommercial file sharing===

====Legality of downloading====

To an extent, copyright law in some countries permits downloading copyright-protected content for personal, noncommercial use. Examples include Canada[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl] and European Union (EU) member states like Poland,[tpl]cite news | url = http://prawokultury.pl/publikacje/podrecznik-dozwolony-uzytek-prywatny | title = Dozwolony użytek prywatny | accessdate = January 2014 | publisher = Fundacja Nowoczesna Polska[/tpl] The Netherlands,[tpl]cite web|last=Van Der Sar|first=Ernesto|title=Dutch Parliament: Downloading Movies and Music Will Stay Legal|url=http://torrentfreak.com/dutch-parliament-downloading-movies-and-music-will-stay-legal-111224/|work=TorrentFreak|accessdate=16 August 2012[/tpl] and Spain.[tpl]cite web| title = La red P2P es legal | url = http://www.bufetalmeida.com/upload/file/sentenciaelrincondejesus.pdf| format = PDF| accessdate = May 2011[/tpl]
The personal copying exemption in the copyright law of EU member states stems from the EU Copyright Directive of 2001, which is generally devised to allow EU members to enact laws sanctioning making copies without authorization, as long as they are for personal, noncommerical use. The Copyright Directive was not intended to legitimize file-sharing, but rather the common practice of space shifting copyright-protected content from a legally purchased CD (for example) to certain kinds of devices and media, provided rights holders are compensated and no copy protection measures are circumvented. Rights-holder compensation takes various forms, depending on the country, but is generally either a levy on "recording" devices and media, or a tax on the content itself. In some countries, such as Canada, the applicability of such laws to copying onto general-purpose storage devices like computer hard drives, portable media players, and phones, for which no levies are collected, has been the subject of debate and further efforts to reform copyright law.
In some countries, the personal copying exemption explicitly requires that the content being copied was obtained legitimately—i.e., from authorized sources, not file-sharing networks. Other countries, such as the Netherlands, make no such distinction; the exemption there had been assumed, even by the government, to apply to any such copying, even from file-sharing networks. However, in April 2014, the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that "national legislation which makes no distinction between private copies made from lawful sources and those made from counterfeited or pirated sources cannot be tolerated."[tpl]cite web|url=http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2014-04/cp140058en.pdf | date=April 10, 2014 |title=The amount of the levy payable for making private copies of a protected work may not take unlawful reproductions into account |publisher=Court of Justice of the European Union[/tpl] Thus, in the Netherlands, for example, downloading from file-sharing networks is no longer legal.

====Legality of uploading====

Although downloading or other private copying is sometimes permitted, public distribution—by uploading or otherwise offering to share copyright-protected content—remains illegal in most, if not all countries. For example, in Canada, even though it is legal to download any copyrighted file as long as it is for noncommercial use, it is illegal to distribute the copyrighted files (e.g. by uploading them to a P2P network).

====Relaxed penalties====

Some countries, like Canada and Germany, have limited the penalties for non-commercial copyright infringement. For example, statutory damages in Canada for non-commercial copyright infringement is capped at $5,000.For a discussion, see Copyright Infringement Advisor : Cap on Non-Commercial Copyright Damages Germany has even passed a bill to limit the fine for individuals accused of sharing music and movies to $200.Germany Caps Piracy Fines. The Hollywood Reporter (2013-01-07). Retrieved on 2013-07-31.
On September 20, 2013, the Spanish government approved new laws that will take effect at the beginning of 2014. The approved legislation will mean that website owners who are earning “direct or indirect profit,” such as via advertising links, from pirated content can be imprisoned for up to six years. However, peer-to-peer file-sharing platforms and search engines are exempt from the laws.[tpl]cite web|title=Spanish Pirate Site Owners To Get 6 Years Of Jail Time, But Users Off The Hook|url=http://techcrunch.com/2013/09/21/spanish-pirate-site-owners-to-get-six-years-jailtime-but-users-off-the-hook/?ncid=tcdaily|work=TechCrunch|publisher=AOL Inc|accessdate=23 September 2013|author=Mike Butcher|date=21 September 2013[/tpl]

===The DMCA and anti-circumvention laws===

Title I of the U.S. DMCA, the WIPO Copyright and Performances and Phonograms Treaties Implementation Act has provisions that prevent persons from "circumventing a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work". Thus if a distributor of copyrighted works has some kind of software, dongle or password access device installed in instances of the work, any attempt to bypass such a copy protection scheme may be actionable — though the US Copyright Office is currently reviewing anticircumvention rulemaking under DMCA — anticircumvention exemptions that have been in place under the DMCA include those in software designed to filter websites that are generally seen to be inefficient (child safety and public library website filtering software) and the circumvention of copy protection mechanisms that have malfunctioned, have caused the instance of the work to become inoperable or which are no longer supported by their manufacturers.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl]

===Online intermediary liability===

Whether Internet intermediaries are liable for copyright infringement by their users is a subject of debate and court cases in a number of countries.[tpl]cite web| last = Edwards| first = Lilian | last2 = Waelde| first2 = Charlotte| title = Online Intermediaries and Liability for Copyright Infringement| work = Keynote paper at WIPO Workshop on Online Intermediaries and Liability for Copyright, Geneva| publisher = World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO)| year = 2005| page = 2| url = http://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/bitstream/1842/2305/1/wipo-onlineintermediaries.pdf| format = PDF| accessdate = September 2010[/tpl]

====Definition of intermediary====

Internet intermediaries were formerly understood to be internet service providers (ISPs). However, questions of liability have also emerged in relation to other Internet infrastructure intermediaries, including Internet backbone providers, cable companies and mobile communications providers.[tpl]cite web| last = Edwards| first = Lilian | last2 = Waelde| first2 = Charlotte| title = Online Intermediaries and Liability for Copyright Infringement| work = Keynote paper at WIPO Workshop on Online Intermediaries and Liability for Copyright, Geneva| publisher = World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO)| year = 2005| pages = 5–6| url = http://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/bitstream/1842/2305/1/wipo-onlineintermediaries.pdf| format = PDF| accessdate = September 2010[/tpl]
In addition, intermediaries are now also generally understood to include Internet portals, software and games providers, those providing virtual information such as interactive forums and comment facilities with or without a moderation system, aggregators, universities, libraries and archives, web search engines, chat rooms, web blogs, mailing lists, and any website which provides access to third party content through, for example, hyperlinks, a crucial element of the World Wide Web.

====Litigation and legislation concerning intermediaries====

Early court cases focused on the liability of Internet service providers (ISPs) for hosting, transmitting or publishing user-supplied content that could be actioned under civil or criminal law, such as libel, defamation, or pornography.[tpl]cite web| last = Edwards| first = Lilian | last2 = Waelde| first2 = Charlotte| title = Online Intermediaries and Liability for Copyright Infringement| work = Keynote paper at WIPO Workshop on Online Intermediaries and Liability for Copyright, Geneva| publisher = World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO)| year = 2005| page = 4| url = http://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/bitstream/1842/2305/1/wipo-onlineintermediaries.pdf| format = PDF| accessdate = September 2010[/tpl] As different content was considered in different legal systems, and in the absence of common definitions for "ISPs," "bulletin boards" or "online publishers," early law on online intermediaries' liability varied widely from country to country. The first laws on online intermediaries' liability were passed from the mid-1990s onwards.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl]
The debate has shifted away from questions about liability for specific content, including that which may infringe copyright, towards whether online intermediaries should be generally responsible for content accessible through their services or infrastructure.[tpl]cite web| last = Edwards| first = Lilian | last2 = Waelde| first2 = Charlotte| title = Online Intermediaries and Liability for Copyright Infringement| work = Keynote paper at WIPO Workshop on Online Intermediaries and Liability for Copyright, Geneva| publisher = World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO)| year = 2005| page = 5| url = http://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/bitstream/1842/2305/1/wipo-onlineintermediaries.pdf| format = PDF| accessdate = September 2010[/tpl]
The U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act (1998) and the European E-Commerce Directive (2000) provide online intermediaries with limited statutory immunity from liability for copyright infringement. Online intermediaries hosting content that infringes copyright are not liable, so long as they do not know about it and take actions once the infringing content is brought to their attention. In U.S. law this is characterized as "safe harbor" provisions. Under European law, the governing principles for Internet Service Providers are "mere conduit", meaning that they are neutral 'pipes' with no knowledge of what they are carrying; and 'no obligation to monitor' meaning that they cannot be given a general mandate by governments to monitor content. These two principles are a barrier for certain forms of online copyright enforcement and they were the reason behind an attempt to amend the European Telecoms Package in 2009 to support new measures against copyright infringement.[tpl]Cite book| last = Horten| first = Monica | title = The Copyright Enforcement Enigma – Internet Politics and the Telecoms Package | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | year = 2012| pages = 104–106| url = http://www.palgrave.com/products/title.aspx?PID=526246| isbn =9780230321717[/tpl]

====Peer-to-peer issues====

Peer-to-peer file sharing intermediaries have been denied access to safe harbor provisions in relation to copyright infringement. Legal action against such intermediaries, such as Napster, are generally brought in relation to principles of secondary liability for copyright infringement, such as contributory liability and vicarious liability.[tpl]cite web| last = Edwards| first = Lilian | last2 = Waelde| first2 = Charlotte| title = Online Intermediaries and Liability for Copyright Infringement| work = Keynote paper at WIPO Workshop on Online Intermediaries and Liability for Copyright, Geneva| publisher = World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO)| year = 2005| page = 10| url = http://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/bitstream/1842/2305/1/wipo-onlineintermediaries.pdf| format = PDF| accessdate = September 2010[/tpl]
These types of intermediaries do not host or transmit infringing content, themselves, but may be regarded in some courts as encouraging, enabling or facilitating infringement by users. These intermediaries may include the author, publishers and marketers of peer-to-peer networking software, and the websites that allow users to download such software. In the case of the BitTorrent protocol, intermediaries may include the torrent tracker and any websites or search engines which facilitate access to torrent files. Torrent files don't contain copyrighted content, but they may make reference to files that do, and they may point to trackers which coordinate the sharing of those files. Some torrent indexing and search sites, such as The Pirate Bay, now encourage the use of magnet links, instead of direct links to torrent files, creating another layer of indirection; using such links, torrent files are obtained from other peers, rather than from a particular website.
Since the late 1990s, copyright holders have taken legal actions against a number of peer-to-peer intermediaries, such as Napster, Grokster, eMule, SoulSeek, BitTorrent and Limewire, and case law on the liability of Internet service providers (ISPs) in relation to copyright infringement has emerged primarily in relation to these cases.[tpl]cite web| last = Edwards| first = Lilian | last2 = Waelde| first2 = Charlotte| title = Online Intermediaries and Liability for Copyright Infringement| work = Keynote paper at WIPO Workshop on Online Intermediaries and Liability for Copyright, Geneva| publisher = World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO)| year = 2005| page = 7| url = http://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/bitstream/1842/2305/1/wipo-onlineintermediaries.pdf| format = PDF| accessdate = September 2010[/tpl]
Nevertheless, whether and to what degree any of these types of intermediaries have secondary liability is the subject of ongoing litigation. The decentralised structure of peer-to-peer networks, in particular, does not sit easily with existing laws on online intermediaries' liability. The BitTorrent protocol established an entirely decentralised network architecture in order to distribute large files effectively. Recent developments in peer-to-peer technology towards more complex network configurations are said to have been driven by a desire to avoid liability as intermediaries under existing laws.[tpl]cite web| last = Edwards| first = Lilian | last2 = Waelde| first2 = Charlotte| title = Online Intermediaries and Liability for Copyright Infringement| work = Keynote paper at WIPO Workshop on Online Intermediaries and Liability for Copyright, Geneva| publisher = World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO)| year = 2005| page = 9| url = http://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/bitstream/1842/2305/1/wipo-onlineintermediaries.pdf| format = PDF| accessdate = September 2010[/tpl]

==Limitations==

Copyright law does not grant authors and publishers absolute control over the use of their work. Only certain types of works and certain kinds of uses are protected; only unauthorized, protected uses of protected works can be said to be infringing.

===Non-infringing uses===

Article 10 of the Berne Convention mandates that national laws provide for limitations to copyright, so that copyright protection does not extend to certain kinds of uses that fall under what the treaty calls "fair practice," including but not limited to minimal quotations used in journalism and education.Berne Convention Article 10, article 10bis. The laws implementing these limitations and exceptions for uses that would otherwise be infringing broadly fall into the categories of either fair use or fair dealing. In common law systems, these fair practice statutes typically enshrine principles underlying many earlier judicial precedents, and are considered essential to freedom of speech.[tpl]cite court |litigants=Eldred v. Ashcroft |vol=537 |reporter=U.S. |opinion=186 |pinpoint=219, 221 |court=U.S. |date=2003 |url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&court=US&vol=537&page=186 [/tpl] in which the court describes fair use as a "free speech safeguard" and a "First Amendment accommodation"
Another example is the practice of compulsory licensing, which is where the law forbids copyright owners from denying a license for certain uses of certain kinds of works, such as compilations and live performances of music. Compulsory licensing laws generally say that for certain uses of certain works, no infringement occurs as long as a royalty, at a rate determined by law rather than private negotiation, is paid to the copyright owner or representative copyright collective. Some fair dealing laws, such as Canada's, include similar royalty requirements.[tpl]cite web|url=http://library.concordia.ca/help/copyright/canadauscopyright.pdf |title=Canada – U.S. Copyright Comparison |publisher=Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada |accessdate=2014-02-14[/tpl]

===Non-infringing types of works===

In order to qualify for protection, a work must be an expression with a degree of originality, and it must be in a fixed medium, such as written down on paper or recorded digitally.[tpl]cite web |url=http://zvon.org/law/r/bern.html#p~2 |title=Berne Convention, article 2, section 2[/tpl][tpl]UnitedStatesCode|17|102(b)[/tpl], for example. The idea itself is not protected. That is, a copy of someone else's original idea is not infringing unless it copies that person's unique, tangible expression of the idea. Some of these limitations, especially regarding what qualifies as original, are embodied only in case law (judicial precedent), rather than in statutes.
In the U.S., for example, copyright case law contains a substantial similarity requirement to determine whether the work falls under the fair use clause. Likewise, courts may require computer software to pass an Abstraction-Filtration-Comparison test (AFC Test)[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ifosslr.org/ifosslr/article/download/30/54 |title=Copyright in Open Source Software – Understanding the Boundaries |publisher=Ifosslr.org |accessdate=2012-09-20[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2012[/tpl] to determine if it is too abstract to qualify for protection, or too dissimilar to an original work to be considered infringing. Software-related case law has also clarified that the amount of R&D, effort and expense put into a work's creation doesn't affect copyright protection.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ladas.com/Patents/Computer/SoftwareAndCopyright/Softwa06.html#fn30 |title=3.3 The "Abstraction, Filtration, Comparison" Test |publisher=Ladas.com |accessdate=2012-01-27[/tpl]
Evaluation of alleged copyright infringement in a court of law may be substantial; the time and costs required to apply these tests vary based on the size and complexity of the copyrighted material. Furthermore, there is no standard or universally accepted test; some courts have rejected the AFC Test, for example, in favor of narrower criteria.
The POSAR test,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.igi-global.com/book/judiciary-friendly-forensics-software-copyright/94860|title=Judiciary-friendly forensics of software copyright infringement |publisher=IGI Global |accessdate=2014-04-14[/tpl] a recently devised forensic procedure for establishing software copyright infringement cases, is an extension or an enhancement of the AFC test.  POSAR, with its added features and additional facilities, offers something more to the legal and the judicial domain than what the AFC test offers. These additional features and facilities make the test more sensitive to the technical and legal requirements of software copyright infringement.

==Preventative measures==

Corporations and legislatures take different types of preventative measures to deter copyright infringement, with much of the focus since the early 1990s being on preventing or reducing digital methods of infringement. Strategies include education, civil & criminal legislation, and international agreements,Ram D. Gopal and G. Lawrence Sanders. “International Software Piracy: Analysis of Key Issues and Impacts.” Information Systems Research 9, no. 4 (December 1998): 380–397. as well as publicizing anti-piracy litigation successes and imposing forms of digital media copy protection, such as controversial digital rights management (DRM) technology and anti-circumvention laws.
In addition to legal maneuvers to curb copyright infringement, the music and motion picture industries have been trying different methods of digital distribution, reforming and sometimes abandoning the traditional system of "windowing" that keeps content from being available in all forms, worldwide, at the same time. By working with manufacturers, broadcasters, and distributors to deliver content efficiently and maintain acceptable revenue flows, the industries are slowly but increasingly meeting global consumer demand for immediate, in-home access to copyright-protected works. Nevertheless, the industry's position is that with the Internet being a global entity, it will still take a combination of worldwide legal agreements, agencies tasked with enforcement, and new ways of selling products to substantially reduce copyright infringement.
Legislatures have reduced infringement by narrowing the scope of what is considered infringing. Aside from upholding international copyright treaty obligations to provide general limitations and exceptions, nations have enacted compulsory licensing laws applying specifically to digital works and uses. For example, in the U.S., the DMCA, an implementation of the 1996 WIPO Copyright Treaty, considers digital transmissions of audio recordings to be licensed as long as a designated copyright collective's royalty and reporting requirements are met.[tpl]UnitedStatesCode|17|514(f)–(g)[/tpl]; see SoundExchange. The DMCA also provides safe harbor for digital service providers whose users are suspected of copyright infringement, thus reducing the likelihood that the providers themselves will be considered directly infringing.[tpl]UnitedStatesCode|17|512(a)–(d)[/tpl]; see Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act.
Some copyright owners voluntarily reduce the scope of what is considered infringement by employing relatively permissive, "open" licensing strategies: rather than privately negotiating license terms with individual users who must first seek out the copyright owner and ask for permission, the copyright owner publishes and distributes the work with a prepared license that anyone can use, as long as they adhere to certain conditions. This has the effect of reducing infringement—and the burden on courts—by simply permitting certain types of uses under terms that the copyright owner considers reasonable. Examples include free software licenses, like the GNU General Public License (GPL), and the Creative Commons licenses, which are predominantly applied to visual and literary works.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl]
The BSA outlined four strategies that governments can adopt to reduce software piracy rates in its 2011 piracy study results: 

==Economic impact of copyright infringement==

The U.S. GOA's 2010 findings regarding the great difficulty of accurately gauging the economic impact of copyright infringement was reinforced within the same report by the body's research into three commonly cited estimates that had previously been provided to U.S. agencies. The GOA report explained that the sources—a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) estimate, a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) press release and a Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association estimate—"cannot be substantiated or traced back to an underlying data source or methodology."
Deaner explained the importance of rewarding the "investment risk" taken by motion picture studios in 2014:
 
 Usually movies are hot because a distributor has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars promoting the product in print and TV and other forms of advertising. The major Hollywood studios spend millions on this process with marketing costs rivalling the costs of production. They are attempting then to monetise through returns that can justify the investment in both the costs of promotion and production.

===Motion picture industry estimates===

In 2008 the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) reported that its six major member companies lost US$6.1 billion to piracy.[tpl]cite news|title=Movie Pirates|url=http://www.houstonpress.com/2008-03-20/news/movie-pirates/|accessdate=21 April 2014|newspaper=Houston Press|date=19 March 2008|author=Shea Serrano[/tpl] A 2009 Los Angeles Daily News article then cited a loss figure of "roughly $20 billion a year" for Hollywood studios.[tpl]cite news|title=Film piracy heads north of border|url=http://www.dailynews.com/20090407/film-piracy-heads-north-of-border|accessdate=21 April 2014|newspaper=Los Angeles Daily News|date=6 April 2009|author=Bob Strauss[/tpl] 

===Software industry estimates===

According to a 2007 BSA and International Data Corporation (IDC) study, the five countries with the highest rates of software piracy were: 1. Armenia (93%); 2. Bangladesh (92%); 3. Azerbaijan (92%); 4. Moldova (92%); and 5. Zimbabwe (91%). According to the study's results, the five countries with the lowest piracy rates were: 1. U.S. (20%); 2. Luxembourg (21%); 3. New Zealand (22%); 4. Japan (23%); and 5. Austria (25%). The 2007 report showed that the Asia-Pacific region was associated with the highest amount of loss, in terms of U.S. dollars, with $14,090,000, followed by the European Union, with a loss of $12,383,000; the lowest amount of U.S. dollars was lost in the Middle East/Africa region, where $2,446,000 was documented.[tpl]cite web|title=Fifth Annual BSA and IDC Global Software Piracy Study|url=http://globalstudy.bsa.org/2007/studies/2007_global_piracy_study.pdf|work=Fifth Annual BSA and IDC Global Software Piracy Study|publisher=Business Software Alliance (BSA)|accessdate=21 April 2014|format=PDF|year=2007[/tpl]  
In its 2011 report, conducted in partnership with IDC and Ipsos Public Affairs, the BSA stated: "Over half of the world’s personal computer users—57 percent—admit to pirating software." The ninth annual "BSA Global Software Piracy Study" claims that the "commercial value of this shadow market of pirated software" was worth US$63.4 billion in 2011, with the highest commercial value of pirated PC software existent in the U.S. during that time period (US$9,773,000). According to the 2011 study, Zimbabwe was the nation with the highest piracy rate, at 92%, while the lowest piracy rate was present in the U.S., at 19%.[tpl]cite web|title=Shadow Market - In Brief|url=http://globalstudy.bsa.org/2011/downloads/study_pdf/2011_BSA_Piracy_Study-InBrief.pdf|work=2011 BSA Global Software Piracy Study|publisher=Business Software Alliance (BSA)|accessdate=21 April 2014|format=PDF|year=2011[/tpl]
The GAO noted in 2010 that the BSA's research up until that year defined "piracy as the difference between total installed software and legitimate software sold, and its scope involved only packaged physical software." 

===Criticism of industry estimates===

The methodology of studies utilized by industry spokespeople has been heavily criticized. Inflated claims for damages and allegations of economic harm are common in copyright disputes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20100511/1516059386.shtml |title=If It's May It's Time For The Press To Parrot Bogus Stats Announcement From The BSA |publisher=Techdirt |date=2010-05-12 |accessdate=2012-01-27[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20090527/1125035034.shtml |title=BSA's Canadian Piracy Numbers Based On Hunches, Not Actual Surveys |publisher=Techdirt |date=2009-05-27 |accessdate=2012-01-27[/tpl] Some studies and figures, including those cited by the MPAA and RIAA with regards to the economic effects of film and music downloads, have been widely disputed as based on questionable assumptions which resulted in statistically unsound numbers.[tpl]cite web|last=Reid|first=Robert|title=The numbers behind the Copyright Math|url=http://blog.ted.com/2012/03/20/the-numbers-behind-the-copyright-math/|date=March 20, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Salmon|first=Felix E.|title=Beware Copyright Statistics|url=http://upstart.bizjournals.com/views/blogs/market-movers/2007/10/04/beware-copyright-statistics.html?page=all |date=October 4, 2007[/tpl]
In one extreme example, the RIAA claimed damages against Limewire totaling $75 trillion – more than the global GDP – and "respectfully" disagreed with the judges ruling that such claims were "absurd".[tpl]cite web|last= Vijayan|first=Jaikumar|title=Judge rules punitive damages against LimeWire 'absurd'|url=http://news.techworld.com/sme/3267255/judge-rules-punitive-damages-against-limewire-absurd/|date=28 March 2011[/tpl]
However, this $75 trillion figure is obtained through one specific interpretation of copyright law that would count each song downloaded as an infringement of copyright. After the conclusion of the case, Limewire agreed to pay $105 million to RIAA.[tpl]cite news|title=Limewire Settlement: RIAA, Record Labels Win $105M, But Artists May Not Benefit|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/17/riaa-and-record-labels-wi_n_862725.html|publisher=Huffington Post | first=Travis|last=Korte|date=2011-05-17[/tpl]

===Economic impact of infringement in emerging markets===

The 2011 Business Software Alliance Piracy Study Standard estimates the total commercial value of pirated software to be at $59 billion in 2010, with emerging markets accounting for $31.9 billion, over half of the total. Furthermore, mature markets for the first time received less PC shipments than emerging economies in 2010, making emerging markets now responsible for more than half of all computers in use worldwide. In addition with software piracy rates of 68 percent comparing to 24 percent of mature markets, emerging markets thus possess the majority of the global increase in the commercial value of pirated software. China continues to have the highest commercial value of pirated software at $8.9 billion among developing countries and second in the world behind the US at $9.7 billion in 2011.[tpl]cite web| title = Shadow Market: 2011 BSA Global Software Piracy Study| url = http://globalstudy.bsa.org/2011/downloads/study_pdf/2011_BSA_Piracy_Study-Standard.pdf | publisher = Business Software Alliance| year = 2012| page = 4| accessdate = April 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/cri_sof_pir_rat-crime-software-piracy-rate |title=Software piracy rate statistics – countries compared |publisher=Nation Master |accessdate=2012-01-27[/tpl] In 2011, the Business Software Alliance announced that 83 percent of software deployed on PCs in Africa has been pirated (excluding South Africa).[tpl]cite web |url=https://torrentfreak.com/software-piracy-110822/ |title=Software Piracy (Infographic) |date=August 22, 2011[/tpl]
Some countries distinguish corporate piracy from private use, which is tolerated as a welfare service.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl] This is the leading reason developing countries refuse to accept or respect copyright laws. Traian Băsescu, the president of Romania, stated that "piracy helped the young generation discover computers. It set off the development of the IT industry in Romania."Nathan Davis.
