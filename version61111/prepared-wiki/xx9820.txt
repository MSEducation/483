[[File:Runzelmarken.jpg|thumb|250px|This wrinkled "elephant skin" texture is a trace fossil of a non-stromatolite microbial mat.
The image shows the location, in the Burgsvik beds of Sweden, where the texture was first identified as evidence of a microbial mat.]]For about 2,000 million years microbial mats, multi-layered colonies of different types of bacteria, were the dominant life on Earth. The evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis enabled them to play the major role in the oxygenation of the atmosphere from about [tpl]ma|2400[/tpl]. This change in the atmosphere increased their effectiveness as nurseries of evolution. While eukaryotes, cells with complex internal structures, may have been present earlier, their evolution speeded up when they acquired the ability to transform oxygen from a poison to a powerful source of energy in their metabolism. This innovation may have come from primitive eukaryotes capturing oxygen-powered bacteria as endosymbionts and transforming them into organelles called mitochondria.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Gray MW, Burger G, Lang BF |title=Mitochondrial evolution |journal=Science |volume=283 |issue=5407 |pages=1476–81 |date=March 1999 |pmid=10066161 |doi=10.1126/science.283.5407.1476|bibcode = 1999Sci...283.1476G [/tpl] The earliest evidence of complex eukaryotes with organelles such as mitochondria, dates from [tpl]ma|1850[/tpl].

Sexual reproduction may be a prerequisite for specialization of cells, as an asexual multicellular organism might be at risk of being taken over by rogue cells that retain the ability to reproduce.
The earliest known animals are cnidarians from about [tpl]ma|580[/tpl], but these are so modern-looking that the earliest animals must have appeared before then. Early fossils of animals are rare because they did not develop mineralized hard parts that fossilize easily until about [tpl]ma|548[/tpl]. The earliest modern-looking bilaterian animals appear in the Early Cambrian, along with several "weird wonders" that bear little obvious resemblance to any modern animals. There is a long-running debate about whether this Cambrian explosion was truly a very rapid period of evolutionary experimentation; alternative views are that modern-looking animals began evolving earlier but fossils of their precursors have not yet been found, or that the "weird wonders" are evolutionary "aunts" and "cousins" of modern groups. Vertebrates remained an obscure group until the first fish with jaws appeared in the Late Ordovician.
The spread of life from water to land required organisms to solve several problems, including protection against drying out and supporting themselves against gravity.[tpl]cite book |last=Laurin |first=M. |title=How Vertebrates Left the Water |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley, California, USA. |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-520-26647-6 |authorlink=Michel Laurin [/tpl] The earliest evidence of land plants and land invertebrates date back to about [tpl]ma|476[/tpl] and [tpl]ma|490[/tpl] respectively. The lineage that produced land vertebrates evolved later but very rapidly between [tpl]ma|370[/tpl] and [tpl]ma|360[/tpl]; recent discoveries have overturned earlier ideas about the history and driving forces behind their evolution.  Land plants were so successful that they caused an ecological crisis in the Late Devonian, until the evolution and spread of fungi that could digest dead wood.
