==Early Life and Priesthood==

On July 27, 1945, Roger Joseph Foys was born in Chicago, Illinois.  He began his religious studies for the Diocese of Steubenville at St. John Vianney Seminary in Bloomingdale, Ohio, part of the Franciscan University of Steubenville.  He completed his graduate studies at The Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. and the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome.
Bishop Anthony John King Mussio ordained Father Foys on May 16, 1973 in Holy Name Cathedral of Steubenville, Ohio. Throughout his years with the Diocese of Steubenville, Father Foys served as Diocesan Treasurer, Chairman of the Diocesan Presbyteral Council, and Moderator of the Curia. He was appointed Vicar General in 1982 and made a monsignor in 1987. He also taught Canon Law for one year at St. John Vianney Seminary. Pope John Paul II made him a Prelate of Honor in 1986 and a Protonotary Apostolic in 2001.

===Sex Abuse scandal===

Bishop Foys came to the Diocese of Covington as it was in the midst of a class action lawsuit concerning the sexual abuse of minor by over 80 diocesan employees including priests.[tpl]cite news | last = McKee | first = Tom | date = June 6, 2010 | title = Covington Diocese sex abuse settlement - 1 year later | work = KYPost.com | url = http://www.kypost.com/dpps/news/region_northern_kentucky/covington/covington-diocese-sex-abuse-settlement---1-year-later_4622979 | accessdate = February 5, 2012 [/tpl] The lawsuit was filed one day before Bishop Foys was appointed by the pope to the See of Covington. The claim was originally for $50 million,[tpl]cite news | last = O'Neill | first = Tom | date = July 15, 2002 | title = Bishop Foys says he won't be silent | work = The Cincinnati Enquirer | url = http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2002/07/15/loc_new_covington_leader.html | accessdate = February 5, 2012 [/tpl] but eventually grew to be much more over the ensuing years of litigation.
Bishop Foys vowed to meet with every victim of abuse who was willing to meet saying, "Those harmed by these shameful, despicable deeds now need the institutional Church and, more importantly, the pastoral Church to provide as much comfort and peace as possible. Our hearts must remain open, like Christ’s".[tpl]cite web | last = Foys | first = Roger Joseph | date = June 2005 | title = Letter from Bishop Foys About Abuse Cases | work = Diocese of Covington | url = http://www.covingtondiocese.org/index.cfm/NewsItem?id=151500 | accessdate = February 5, 2012 [/tpl] He eventually met with over 70 victims of abuse personally and agree to create a system of payment where victims who were abused between 1948 and 1998 could receive compensation while not having to undergo the process of a trial.[tpl]citation needed|date = February 2012[/tpl]
The settlement eventually cost the diocese $120 million; $80 million of which came from insurance while $40 million came from the mortgage of diocesan properties (most notably Catholic Center/Marydale property in Erlanger). No parish properties were affected by the settlement. Each victim received between $5,000 and $450,000 depending on the severity of their case. Bishop Foys said "While no amount of money can compensate for the atrocities that were committed here, I pray that this settlement will bring victims some measure of peace and healing to victims and their loved ones".[tpl]citation needed|date = February 2012[/tpl]

===Vocations===

The number of priestly vocations in the Diocese dramatically increased under his tenure. This can possibly be attributed to the fact that the Bishop was a vocation director in Diocese of Steubenville and devotes significant diocesan resources to vocation promotion, including the hiring of a full time Vocation Promoter (Father Greg Bach) for the Diocese.[tpl]cite news | last = Ziegler | first = Jeff | date = December 2007 | title = Priestly Vocations in America: Recent Trends | work = The Catholic World Report | url = http://www.catholicworldreport.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=51:zieglerdec2007&catid=34:cwr2007&Itemid=61 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20100918225649/http://catholicworldreport.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=51:zieglerdec2007&catid=34:cwr2007&Itemid=61 | archivedate = September 18, 2010 [/tpl] As of 2013, the diocese had 28 seminarians studying for the priesthood.[tpl]cite news|title=Vocations Supplement|url=http://home.catholicweb.com/covingtondiocese/files/Messenger_2013/Jan1113Messengerweb.pdf|accessdate=15 May 2013|newspaper=The Messenger|date=11 January 2013[/tpl]

===Pater Noster Controversy===

In anticipation of the release of the Third Edition of the Roman Missal and General Instruction of the Roman Missal, Bishop Foys issued a decree that discourages the laity's holding hands during the Pater Noster (or "Our Father") at the celebration of Mass. The decree states, "Special note should also be made concerning the gesture for the Our Father. Only the priest is given the instruction to “extend” his hands. Neither the deacon nor the lay faithful are instructed to do this. No gesture is prescribed for the lay faithful in the Roman Missal; nor the General Instruction of the Roman Missal, therefore the extending or holding of hands by the faithful should not be performed."[tpl]cite news|last=Gibson|first=David|title='Our Father' update: No hands please, we're laity|url=http://www.commonwealmagazine.org/blog/?p=16118|accessdate=15 May 2013|newspaper=Commonweal|date=1 December 2011[/tpl]  The decree caused controversy both in the diocese[tpl]cite news|last=Warren|first=Jay|title=Covington Bishop: No Holding Hands at Mass|accessdate=15 May 2013|newspaper=Kentucky Post|date=30 November 2011[/tpl]  and across the country.[tpl]cite web|title=From the Bishop of Covington, Kentucky|url=http://www.praytellblog.com/index.php/tag/bishop-roger-foys/|publisher=Pray Tell|accessdate=15 May 2013[/tpl]
