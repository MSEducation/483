==History==

Guthrum, King of the Danes, is said to be buried in the grounds of St Mary's Church in the town.D. Dumville and M. Lapidge (eds) Annals of St. Neots Cambridge 1984 He was defeated by King Alfred at  the battle of Edington in 878.
Hadleigh was one of the East Anglian towns that derived its prosperity from its wool and cloth industries. It has a 15th-century timber-framed Guildhall and many fine examples of timber and brick listed buildings, some with highly detailed 17th century plasterwork or "pargeting". Most of these buildings can be found in the High Street, Angel Street, Benton Street, and the immediately surrounding area.
The town has a total of 246 listed buildings.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/england/suffolk/hadleigh |title=Listed Buildings in Hadleigh, Suffolk, England |publisher=britishlistedbuildings.co.uk |accessdate=30 March 2013[/tpl] The Georgian East House, on George Street, has been designated an Grade II listed building since 26 April 1950.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-277656-east-house-hadleigh-suffolk |title=East House, Hadleigh |publisher=britishlistedbuildings.co.uk |accessdate=30 March 2013[/tpl] In March 2013 plans by Babergh District Council to redevelop the site and build houses on the land behind were withdrawn after strong local protest.

The Anglican church of St Mary the Virgin is an active parish church in the archdeaconry of Ipswich in the Diocese of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich. Its earliest parts date from medieval times. On 26 April 1950 the church was designated a Grade I listed building by English Heritage. The Grade I designation is the highest of the three grades and is for buildings that are "of exceptional interest, sometimes considered to be internationally important.”[tpl]Cite web |url = http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/site/about-listed-buildings/ |title = What Are Listed Buildings? |publisher= britishlistedbuildings.co.uk | accessdate=30 March 2013[/tpl]
