After ingesting lithium himself to ensure its safety in humans,<ref name=jack/> Cade began a small-scale trial of lithium citrate and/or lithium carbonate on some of his patients diagnosed with [[mania]], [[schizophrenia|dementia præcox]] or [[melancholia]], with outstanding results.  The calming effect was so robust that Cade speculated that mania was caused by a deficiency in lithium.<ref name=mja/>
While Cade's results appeared highly promising, side-effects of lithium in some cases lead to non-compliance.  Toxicity of lithium led to several deaths of patients undergoing lithium treatment. The problem of toxicity was greatly reduced when suitable tests were developed to measure the lithium level in the blood.  Moreover, as a naturally-occurring chemical, lithium salt could not be patented, meaning that its manufacturing and sales were not considered commercially viable. These factors prevented its widespread adoption in psychiatry for some years, particularly in the United States, where its use was banned until 1970.

==John Cade, Royal Park and RANZCP==

In 1952 Cade was appointed Superintendent and Dean of the clinical school at Royal Park Hospital. Two years later, at the request of the Mental Hygiene Authority which was planning to remodel Royal Park, he visited Britain for six months to inspect psychiatric institutions. On his return, he introduced modern facilities and replaced the rather authoritarian approach to patient care with a lot more personal and informal style that included group therapy. Concerned at the number of alcohol-related cases, he supported voluntary admission to aid early detection and later proposed the use of large doses of thiamine in the treatment of alcoholism.  Cade served as the Superintendent at Royal Park until his retirement in 1977.
He served as the federal president of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists in 1969–70, and also as the president for its Victoria branch from 1963 until his death in 1980. In the end, Dr. Cade's discovery did receive widespread acknowledgements and praise. For his contribution to psychiatry, he was awarded a Kittay International Award in 1974 (with Mogens Schou from Denmark), and he was invited to be a Distinguished Fellow of the American College of Psychiatrists.  In 1976, Cade was one of the first to be made an Officer of the Order of Australia.[ref]
</ref> Dr. Cade remained humble about his chance discovery, describing himself as merely a gold prospector who happened to find a nugget. Finally, in July 2004, the Medical Journal of Australia reported that Cade's 1949 article, "Lithium salts in the treatment of psychotic excitement", was the number one most cited MJA article.<ref>

==Troubled Minds==

In 2004, Film Australia and SBS screened the documentary 'Troubled Minds – The Lithium Revolution',[tpl]IMDb title|1201166|Troubled Minds: The Lithium Revolution [/tpl] a 60-minute documentary portraying John Cade's discovery of the use of Lithium in mental illness.  The documentary received international recognition winning the main prize at the International Vega Awards for Excellence in Scientific Broadcasting.
Troubled Minds was also recognised locally with writer/director Dennis K. Smith winning the AWGIE Award for Best Documentary.[ref]
