Keith Harris of Rolling Stone gave the album 3.5 stars out of 5 and wrote, "Both manic and schizoid, Tankian veers easily from sing-rap rhythm to Korn-ish hysterics to demonic baritone growl to doomily ruminative....the music insists on forward motion without trapping itself in a thrashy lock-step rut" (Sept. 27 2001, p. 70).
Tom Sinclair of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B- and wrote, "Strange and engaging....It all adds up to bizarro type of metal that has a warped majesty and strength" (Sept 7 2001, pp. 161–162). Q gave the album 4 stars out of 5 and wrote, "Matches Slipknot for manic intensity while employing a freeform approach to songcraft which invites comparison to the lunatic-fringe rock of the '60s" (Sept. 2001, p. 121). Spin wrote, "System have an undeniable nerd-prog charm" (February 2005, p. 89).Spin Review
However, not all reviews were favorable. Uncut wrote, "Toxicity is virtually unlistenable: thrash metal splintered into a million pieces by unnecessary time changes, topped off with excruciatingly theatrical vocals."[tpl]Metacritic album|id=toxicity|title=Toxicity[/tpl]
