==Plot==

Chronopolis tells the story of a gargantuan city lurking in the sky colonized by powerful immortals who have become jaded with eternal life. Most of their time is spent monotonously constructing bizarre and unusual objects while waiting for the ultimate gift to arrive in their hands.

==Notes==

With a grant under $400,000 from the Institut National de l'Audiovisuel of Paris and Centre National du Cinema, Piotr Kamler completed the film within a five-year period from 1977 to 1982. Most of the animation and CGI he accomplished on his own. Kamler openly admitted that the script he provided to obtain his funding had nothing to do with his original concept. Only after building the characters and set did the film's "story" take shape.
There exists two versions of the film. The original 1982 version runs at 66 minutes and was released in North America through a company in Boston. The official and final cut, re-released in 1988, has 14 minutes of footage taken out leaving it at 52 minutes. Within that version:
