As a student leader in June 1969 he met John Lennon and drove him around Ottawa while he was hosting him for a "peace conference" he was holding. He had invited Lennon to Ottawa after his famous "bed-in" in Montreal. He tried to introduce Lennon to Pierre Trudeau, but the prime minister was not at home when they dropped by.

==Ministerial career==

In 1993, he was elected as the Member of Parliament for Etobicoke-Centre and named Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada. In that capacity, he introduced significant changes to the Criminal Code, the Canadian Human Rights Act and other federal legislation. He became Minister of Health in 1997, where he facilitated the creation of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) and more than doubled annual health research funding on a national scale.
Subsequently, as Minister of Industry and Minister of Infrastructure, he introduced Canada’s innovation strategy, was responsible for Canada’s three granting councils and introduced legislation to create the Pierre Elliott Trudeau Foundation to promote applied research in the social sciences and the humanities.
Rock initially declared he would run in the Liberal Party of Canada leadership race to replace the retiring Jean Chrétien, raising more money and polling higher numbers than John Manley and Sheila Copps. However, all of the other leadership candidates were unable to affect Paul Martin's commanding lead. In 2003, Rock dropped out of the leadership and announced his support for Martin. He had been mentioned as a potential candidate to replace the departing Prime Minister Paul Martin as the leader of the Liberal Party of Canada but on February 3, 2006, Rock announced that he would not run for leadership of the Liberal Party."Rock sends regrets, won't run to lead Liberals", CBC News, February 3, 2006  He later endorsed Stéphane Dion's successful bid to lead the party.

==Controversies==

===Marc Kelly===

Rock has had several conflicts with a former student, Marc Kelly, who was eventually de-registered and banned from the campus during the winter 2010 semester, thereby barring Kelly from his candidacy for president of the student federation.[tpl]cite web|title=De Bellefeuille disqualifie Kelly: La decision ira en appel|url=http://larotonde.ca|publisher=La Rotonde|accessdate=January 21, 2010[/tpl] On Monday, November 3, 2008, Kelly entered Rock's office, unannounced and without an appointment, to request a meeting to discuss a complaint he felt had been unfairly dealt with. Upon entering President Rock's office, Kelly immediately informed Mr. Rock that he had not received a response to his e-mail, at which point Rock raised his voice and repeatedly demanded that Kelly leave his office. Kelly continued to press Mr. Rock for an answer as to when Rock would respond to his e-mail and did not leave Rock's office until a full minute later, when Rock told Kelly "you'll get it response when you get it. Thank you. Goodbye." Kelly recorded the entire conversation without Rock's knowledge.[tpl]cite web|title=Letter sent to Mr. Kelly on November 4, 2008|url=http://www.president.uottawa.ca/speeches-details_124.html|publisher=Office of the President speeches and messages|accessdate=November 13, 2008[/tpl] On Monday, November 10, 2008, Kelly e-mailed the audio recording from November 3rd to 36,000 uOttawa students, 2,300 uOttawa faculty members and 3,000 uOttawa administrative staff with the subject line "President Rock, Please Stop".http://uofovoice.blogspot.ca/2008/11/true-face-of-allan-rock.html On February 26, 2009, the Canadian Civil Liberties Association wrote to Rock to express its concern over his administration's banning of a student poster and to ask that he redress the situation with a public declaration.[tpl]cite web|title=Canadian Civil Liberties Letter|url=http://ccla.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/2009-02-26-letter-to-ottawa1.pdf|work=Letter|publisher=Canadian Civil Liberties Association|accessdate=March 25, 2011[/tpl]

===Joseph Hickey===

===Ann Coulter===

Amid much media attention, right-wing commentator and author Ann Coulter was scheduled to give a talk at the University of Ottawa on March 23, 2010. The talk was cancelled following left-wing student protests at the talk venue. The organizers of the event blamed the university and the protesters."Ann Coulter's speech in Ottawa cancelled", Globe and Mail, March 24, 2010. Rock responded in a university press release suggesting that the organizers may have needlessly cancelled the talk.  At the centre of the controversy was a letter sent to Coulter before her scheduled talk in Ottawa and signed by the Vice President Academic. The letter by the Vice President Academic warned that Coulter could be arrested for hate speech. The letter was condemned as a violation of academic freedom by the Canadian Association of University Teachers and widely criticized in the media."University to Ann Coulter: 'Please watch your mouth'", National Post, March 22, 2010.Free Speech. What a Concept!, Rex Murphy on The National, March 25, 2010. Three weeks after the cancelled Coulter event, Rock publicly stated having pre-approved the letter as the institution's response.Video - University Senate meeting, April 12, 2010."The Coulter affair - University of Ottawa president Allan Rock is of two minds about how it all went down", The Ottawa Citizen, April 17, 2010.
