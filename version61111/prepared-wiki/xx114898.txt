==Style==

Aces Brass is the most prominent voice of 1970s music groups in collegiate pep band today.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl]  The band's repertoire is a delicate blend of 70's funk and rock arrangements.  However, the ensemble also plays several pep band classics such as Carry On My Wayward Son and Pretty Fly (for a White Guy).  Much of the band's unique repertoire was arranged by its former director, Dean Musson.
