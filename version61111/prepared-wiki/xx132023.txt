The University Centre in Svalbard is a Norwegian state-owned limited company that provides university-level education in arctic studies. As of August 2012, the universities of Oslo, Bergen, Tromsø, Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim and the Norwegian University of Life Sciences in Ås are represented on its board. The centre is known as UNIS and forms part of the University of the Arctic. It is led by a director appointed by the board for a three-year term. The university is the world’s northernmost higher education institution, in Longyearbyen at 78° N latitude. The courses offered fall into four main science disciplines: Arctic biology, Arctic geology, Arctic geophysics and Arctic technology.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.unis.no/30_ABOUT_UNIS/4010_Root/intro.htm|title=Arctic science for global challenges[/tpl]

==Organization==

The university was established in 1993 in Longyearbyen, a town of 2,100 inhabitants on the western coast of Spitsbergen island. The main idea behind establishing UNIS was that the unique geographic location of the island permits the study of Arctic sciences in situ, right outside the university walls. The university was established with an international spirit – its official language is English, and about half of its 450 students originate from outside Norway (in 2012, foreign students came from 23 countries).http://www.unis.no/30_ABOUT_UNIS/4010_Root/annual_reports.htm The tuition is free of charge and is carried out by 20 full-time professors, 21 assistant professors and 160 guest lecturers. The latter are invited from Norwegian and foreign institutions within various joint research projects. Those projects are also instrumental for the enrollment of master and PhD students – UNIS does not accept its own graduates for those courses and requires potential candidates to present a letter of support from their home institution.Rules of entry for studies at UNIS One important collaboration is the educational exchange program with Russia. The funding for UNIS is provided by the Norwegian government, research councils and private industry.

==Safety and well-being==

All students must participate in UNIS safety training in the initial phase of their stay at UNIS. The students will be introduced to some of the safety guidelines that apply on Svalbard. The safety guidelines form a foundation, upon which the students may continue to build.http://www.unis.no/10_STUDIES/1040_Student_Life/safety.htm
