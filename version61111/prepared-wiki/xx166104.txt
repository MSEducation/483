Antonio Olmo Ramírez (born 18 January 1954) is a Spanish retired football defender and manager.

==Club career==

Born in Sabadell, Barcelona, Catalonia, Olmo began his career on loan at amateurs FC Calella. He's senior career was entirely spent with FC Barcelona, his first two seasons being spent with the B-team in Segunda División. He made his La Liga debut on 5 September 1976 in a 4–0 home win against UD Las Palmas, going on to be first-choice in that and the following five seasons, often partnering Migueli as stopper.
During his spell with the Blaugrana Olmo won a total of seven major titles, including three Copa del Rey trophies and two UEFA Cup Winners' Cup tournaments, contributing with 16 games and one goal combined to the latter conquests. He retired in June 1984 at the age of only 30.
As a manager Olmo was connected to two clubs, Barcelona and hometown's CE Sabadell FC, in various levels. In the 1991–92 campaign, with the latter side, he had his first and only experience at the professional level, being one of three coaches during the campaign for the ninth-placed team.Entrenadors del CE Sabadell (CE Sabadell managers); Sabadell's official website [tpl]ca icon[/tpl]
