The Spanish fly is an emerald-green beetle in the family Meloidae, Lytta vesicatoria.From Greek lytta, rage and Latin vesica, blister. Other species of blister beetle used by apothecaries are often called by the same name. Lytta vesicatoria is sometimes incorrectly called Cantharis vesicatoria, but the genus Cantharis is in an unrelated family, Cantharidae.Richardg B. Selander (1991). On the Nomenclature and Classification of Meloidae (Coleoptera). Insecta Mundi 5 (2): 65–94.
Cantharidin (etymology: Greek kantharis, beetle) is a powerful irritant vesicant (blister-inducing) substance obtained from many blister beetles, and sometimes given the nickname "Spanish fly." Cantharidin is claimed to have aphrodisiac properties, as a result of its irritant effects upon the body's genitourinary tract, and can result in poisoning if ingested.[tpl]cite journal|last=Karras|first=David J.|title=Poisoning from "Spanish fly" (cantharidin)|journal=The American Journal of Emergency Medicine|year=1996|doi=10.1016/S0735-6757(96)90158-8 |quote=While most commonly available preparations of Spanish fly contain cantharidin in negligible amounts, if at all, the chemical is available illicitly in concentrations capable of causing severe toxicity.

==The beetle==

Lytta vesicatoria is [tpl]convert|15|mm|in[/tpl] to [tpl]convert|22|mm|in[/tpl]  long and [tpl]convert|5|mm|in[/tpl] to [tpl]convert|8|mm|in[/tpl] wide. Adult beetles feed on leaves of ash, lilac, amur privet and white willow trees; larvae are parasitic on the brood of ground nesting bees. The beetle lives in scrublands and woods throughout southern Europe and eastward to Central Asia and Siberia."Spanish fly." Grzimek's Animal Life Encyclopedia. The Gale Group, Inc, 2005.

==Cantharidin==

Cantharidin, the principal irritant in Spanish fly, was first isolated and named in 1810 by Pierre Robiquet, a French chemist then living in Paris, from Lytta vesicatoria. Robiquet demonstrated that cantharidin was the actual principle responsible for the aggressively blistering properties of the coating of the eggs of that insect, and established that cantharidin  had very definite toxic and poisonous properties comparable in degree to that of the most violent poisons known in the 19th century, such as strychnine.Expériences sur les cantharides, Robiquet. M., Annales de Chimie, 1810, vol. 76, pp. 302–322.
Cantharidin, a terpenoid, is produced by various insect species. The body of the beetle contains up to 5% cantharidin. The crushed powder is of yellowish brown to brown-olive color with iridescent reflections, of disagreeable scent and bitter flavor.

==Uses==

The potency of the insect species has been known since antiquity and used in various ways, in particular prepared and sold in powdered form obtained from dried and ground beetles, known as cantharides (the Greek plural form of the singular cantharis).

===Aphrodisiac===

As it passes through the body, cantharidin irritates the genitals resulting in increased blood flow that can mimic the engorgement that occurs with sexual excitement. For this reason, various preparations of desiccated Spanish flies have been used as some of the world's oldest alleged aphrodisiacs, with a reputation dating back to the early western Mediterranean classical civilizations. The ease of toxic overdose makes this highly dangerous, and for this reason the sale of such products as Spanish Fly has been made illegal in most countries. Nevertheless, there are many historical examples:

===Medical uses===

Medical use dates back to descriptions from Hippocrates. Plasters made from wings of these beetles have been used to raise blisters.  Cantharides was used as an abortifacient,AJ Giannini, HR Black. The Psychiatric, Psychogenic and Somatopsychic Disorders Handbook. Garden City, New York. Medical Examination Publishing Co., 1978. p. 97. ISBN 0-87488-596-5. a stimulant (since one of its effects was producing insomnia and nervous agitation), and as a poison. Cantharidin is used today as a topical application for treatment of benign epithelial growths including most warts.[tpl]cite journal|last=Moen|first=L.|coauthors=Shwayder, T., Chang M.|title=Cantharidin revisited: a blistering defense of an ancient medicine|journal=Archives of Dermatology|date=October 2001|issue=137|pages=1357–1360[/tpl] 
It has been suggested that Simón Bolívar may have been accidentally poisoned by the application of spanish fly.Ledermann W. (Oct 2007) Simón Bolívar y las cantáridas, Rev. chil. infectol. v.24 n.5 Santiago

===Poison===

In powder, mixed with the food, cantharides could go unnoticed and has thus been employed as a poison: Aqua toffana, or aquetta di Napoli, was one of the poisons associated with the Medicis. Thought to be a mixture of arsenic and cantharides, this was reportedly created by an Italian countess, Toffana. Four to six drops of this poison in water or wine was enough to deliver death in a few hours.[tpl]Harv|Stevens|1990|p=6[/tpl] Symptoms of cantharidin poisoning including burning of the mouth, dysphagia, nausea, hematemesis, gross hematuria, and dysuria. 
In order to determine if a death had taken place by the effects of Spanish fly, investigators resorted to the vesicación test. One of those test methods consisted of rubbing part of the internal organs of the deceased, dissolved in oil, on the shaved skin of a rabbit; the absorption of the cantharides and its blistering effect are such that they became visible on the skin of the rabbit.

===Culinary uses===

Dawamesk, a spread or jam made in North Africa and containing hashish, almond paste, pistachio nuts, sugar, orange or tamarind peel, cloves and other various spices, occasionally included cantharides.
In Morocco and other parts of North Africa, spice blends known as ras el hanout sometimes included cantharides as an ingredient. However, the sale of cantharides in Moroccan spice markets was banned in the 1990s.[tpl]Harv|Davidson|1999[/tpl]

===Other uses===

In ancient China, the beetles were mixed with human excrement, arsenic and wolfsbane to make the world's first recorded stink bomb.[tpl]Harv|Theroux|1989|p=54[/tpl]
In Santería, cantharides are used in incense.[tpl]Harv|Gonzalez-Wippler|2002|p=221[/tpl]
