==Location==

Fairy Meadows is approachable by a twelve kilometer-long jeepable trek starting from Raikhot bridge on Karakoram Highway to the village Tato.[tpl]cite news|title=Over the top: Misreporting on location of Nanga Parbat attack|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/580848/over-the-top-misreporting-on-location-of-nanga-parbat-attack/|accessdate=26 August 2013|newspaper=The Express Tribune|date=28 July 2013|author=Danial Shah[/tpl] Further from Tato, it takes about three to four hours hiking by a five kilometer trek to Fairy Meadows. The grassland is located in the Raikhot valley, at one end of the Raikhot glacier which originates from the Nanga Parbat and feeds a stream that finally falls in the River Indus. Since 1992, locals have operated camping sites in the area.[tpl]cite book|title=High Mountain Pastoralism in Northern Pakistan|publisher=Franz Steiner Verlag|isbn=978-3515076623|pages=168–169, 186|author=Jurgen Clemens|author2=Marcus Nusser|editor=Eckart Ehlers, Herrmann Kreutzmann|chapter=Pastoral Management Strategies in Transition|date=1 December 2000[/tpl]

==Tourism==

The six-month tourist season at Fairy Meadows starts in April and continues until the end of September. Tourists lodge at the camping site spread over two acres, known as "Raikot Serai". The site of Fairy Meadows, though partially developed, generates about PKR 17 million revenue from tourism, mainly by providing food, transportation and accommodation services.[tpl]Cite report | author = Vaqar Zakaria | date = December 2009 | title = Central Karakoram Conservation Complex | url = http://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/pk_hkkh_sp_tdp.pdf| publisher  = International Union for Conservation of Nature | format = PDF | chapter = | section = | pages = 21, 27 | accessdate = 28 August 2013[/tpl] A project by Shangri La Resorts of establishing a hotel at the resort was cancelled after it was declared a National Park. The local community stopped the extraction of timber to conserve the forest and promote tourism in the area.

==Flora and fauna==

The grassland is surrounded by thick alpine forest.[tpl]cite news|title=Postcards from Pakistan: Karakoram and beyond|url=http://x.dawn.com/2011/06/22/postcards-from-pakistan-karakoram-and-beyond/|accessdate=26 August 2013|newspaper=Dawn|date=22 June 2011|author=Syagfiqah Omar[/tpl] The high altitude area and north-facing slopes mostly consist of coniferous forest having Pinus wallichiana, Picea smithiana and Abies pindrow trees, while in the high altitude areas with little sunlight are birch and willow dwarf shrubs. The southern slopes are concentrated with juniper and scrubs, namely Juniperus excelsa and J. turkesticana. In the low altitudes, the major plant found is Artemisia, with yellow ash, stone oaks and Pinus gerardiana spread among it. Research has suggested similarities between Pinus wallichiana found in the meadows with a sister species, Pinus peuce, found in the Balkans, based on leaf size.[tpl]cite journal|last=Businský|first=Roman|title=A Revision of the Asian Pinus Subsection Strobus (Pinaceae)|journal=Willdenowia|date=25 August 2004|volume=34|issue=1|page=248|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/3997476|accessdate=30 August 2013|publisher=Botanischer Garten und Botanisches Museum|location=Berlin|issn=0511-9618[/tpl] Researchers have found thirty-one species of Rust fungi in the area.[tpl]cite journal|title=Some new rust fungi (Uredinales) from Fairy Meadows,  Northern Areas, Pakistan|journal=Journal of Yeast and Fungal Research|date=November 2012|volume=3|issue=5|pages=65–73|url=http://www.academicjournals.org/jyfr/PDF/pdf2012/Nov/Afshan%20et%20al.pdf|accessdate=28 August 2013|author=N.S.
