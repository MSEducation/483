[[OCS Inventory]]

CATEGORIES: Free software programmed in Perl

Open Computer and Software Inventory Next Generation (OCS inventory NG) is free software that enables users to inventory their IT assets. OCS-NG collects information about the hardware and software of networked machines running the OCS client program ("OCS Inventory Agent"). OCS can be used to visualize the inventory through a web interface. Furthermore, OCS comprises the possibility of deploying applications on the computers according to search criteria. Agent-side IpDiscover makes it possible to know the entirety of networked computers and devices.

==Internal operation==

The dialogue between OCS client machines and the server is based on the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and the formatting of the data is done in XML.

===Server===

The management server uses Apache, MySQL and Perl. OCS is multi-platform: it runs under Unixes as well as under Microsoft Windows (95 or later).
With its simple design and the use of mod_perl, server-side performance is good and a modest machine can thus inventory several thousands of machines.

===Agents===

In order to collect detailed information, agents can be installed on the client machines in the inventory.
Client agents are available for :-

===Web interface===

An optional web interface written in PHP offers complementary services:

==Extension==

OCS Inventory can be used to feed the manager of GLPI and thus offers part of an IT asset management solution.

==Modularity==

Since version 1.0rc3, most of OCS Inventory functionality can be adapted or extended via a module system.

==License==

OCS Inventory is a free software published under GNU GPL v2. The copyright is owned by the developers.
