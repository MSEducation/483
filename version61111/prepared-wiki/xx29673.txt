==Novelist==

After becoming an investigative reporter, Hiaasen began to write novels. His first three were co-written by fellow journalist Montalbano: Powder Burn (1981), Trap Line (1982), and A Death in China (1986). Hiaasen's first venture into writing children's novels was Hoot (2002), which received the Newbery Honor Award and was made into a 2006 film of the same name (starring Logan Lerman). His second children's novel was Flush, then Scat, and most recently Chomp.  Hiaasen's young adult novels follow the theme of environmental issues.  They also have his characteristic unique characters and some theme of adventure.
Hiaasen is also noted as the person who discovered and helped bring the young adult fantasy novel Eragon to the public. The book, written by Christopher Paolini, was self-published and self-promoted by tour throughout the United States without much attention until it came to Hiaasen's notice in 2002. Hiaasen immediately recommended the novel to publishing house Alfred A. Knopf. The novel went on to become an astounding success, marking the start of a book series that sold over 30 million copies worldwide.
