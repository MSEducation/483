Sculpture in the Parklands began as an international sculpture symposium in 2002 when seven Irish and international artist created works of art over a three week residency.http://www.emigrant.ie/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=74315&Itemid=69, The success of the symposium led to the formation of Sculpture in the Parklands and eight site-specific sculptures created during the symposium form the nucleus of the project. Currently there are 20 site specific sculptures in the Parklands.

==Mission==

Inviting artists to create significant site-specific works of art during the artist in residency programme each year, the mission of Sculpture in the Parklands is to inspire artists to create artworks in response to the unique landscape and industrial heritage of the cut away bogland and to build awareness of the arts within the community through public participation and interaction. In addition to permanent sculpture and time-based work, the project has a commitment to commissioning video artists, composers, choreographers, and performance artists to interpret and document this unique landscape, folklore and industrial history.
