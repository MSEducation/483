[[Car-free movement]]

CATEGORIES: Car-free movement, Environmentalism

The car-free movement is a broad, informal, emergent network of individuals and organizations including social activists, urban planners and others brought together by a shared belief that cars are too dominant in most modern cities.  The goal of the movement is to create places where car use is greatly reduced or eliminated, to convert road and parking space to other public uses and to rebuild compact urban environments where most destinations are within easy reach by walking, cycling or public transport.[tpl]cite book|last=Zehner|first=Ozzie|title=Green Illusions|year=2012|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|location=London|url=http://greenillusions.org[/tpl] 

==Context==

Before the twentieth century, cities and towns were normally compact, containing narrow streets busy with human activity. In the early twentieth century, many of these settlements were adapted to accommodate the car with wider roads, more space allocated for car parking, and lower population densities where most space between urban buildings was reserved for automotive use. Lower population densities led to urban sprawl with longer distances between places, and traffic congestion which made the alternatives to the car unattractive or impractical, and created the conditions for more traffic and sprawl; the car system was "increasingly able to 'drive' out competitors, such as feet, bikes, buses and trains".[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.lancs.ac.uk/fass/sociology/cemore/word%20docs/urry-systemofautomobility.pdf| title=The ‘System’ of Automobility|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-01-12|author=John Urry|publisher=University of Lancacaster[/tpl] This process led to changes in urban form and living patterns where it was virtually impossible for people to live without a car.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.racfoundation.org/files/Transport_and_Social_Exclusion.pdf|format=PDF|title= Transport and Social Exclusion – a survey of the G7 nations: FIA Foundation and RAC Foundation|date=2004-02-01|accessdate=2008-01-12|publisher=RAC Foundation[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
Some governments have responded to this emerging situation with policies and regulations aimed at reversing this trend by increasing urban densities, encouraging mixed use development, reducing space allocated to the private cars, and lending greater support to cycling, walking, and public transport.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/sustainable/|title=Sustainable travel|publisher=UK Department for Transport|accessdate=2008-01-13[/tpl] In contrast with private automotive travel, car sharing, where people can easily rent a car for a few hours rather than own one, is emerging as an increasingly important element for urban transportation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cfit.gov.uk/mf/reports/carclubs/conclusions/index.htm|title=Car Clubs / Car Sharing Research Project - Motorists' Forum Conclusions and Recommendations|publisher=UK Commission for integrated transport|accessdate=2008-01-13[/tpl]

==Urban design==

Proponents of the car-free movement focus on both sustainable transportation options and on urban design, zoning, school placement policies, urban agriculture, telecommuting options, and housing developments that create proximity or access so that long distance transportation becomes less of a requirement of daily life.
New urbanism is an American urban design movement that arose in the early 1980s. Its goal has been to reform all aspects of real estate development and urban planning, from urban retrofits to suburban infill. New urbanist neighborhoods are designed to contain a diverse range of housing and jobs, and to be walkable.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newurbanism.org/|title=New Urbanism|publisher=New Urbanism.org|accessdate=2008-01-13[/tpl]
World Squares for all is a scheme to remove much of the traffic from major squares in London, including Trafalgar Square and Parliament Square.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.london.gov.uk/mayor/parliament_square/wsfa.jsp|title=World Squares for All|publisher=The Mayor of London|accessdate=2008-01-13 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070808152752/http://www.london.gov.uk/mayor/parliament_square/wsfa.jsp  |archivedate = 2007-08-08[/tpl]
Car-free cities are, as the name implies entire cities (or at least the inner parts therof) which have been made entirely car-free.
Car-free zones are area of a city or town where use of cars is prohibited or greatly restricted.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-1525727,00.html|title=Paris bans cars to make way for central pedestrian zone|date=2005-03-15|accessdate=2008-01-13|author=Charles Bremner|work=The Times | location=London[/tpl]
Bicycle boulevards are motorways that have been optimized for bicycle usage. Right of way goes to the bicycles instead of cars; cars however can still make use of the street (hence different from Segregated cycle facilities).[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl]
Segregated cycle facilities are streets designed solely for bicycle usage. They are much more narrow than motorways.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl]
Living streets provide for the needs of car drivers secondary to the needs of users of the street as a whole. They are designed to be shared by pedestrians, playing children, bicyclists, and low-speed motor vehicles.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.urban.nl/childstreet2005/downloads/Concept%20Development%20woonerf.pdf|title=Concept Development: ‘Woonerf’|year=2005|accessdate=2008-01-13|publisher=The International Institute for the Urban Environment|format=PDF[/tpl]
Community bicycle programs provide bicycles within an urban environment for short term use. The first successful scheme was in the 1960s in Amsterdam and can now be found in many other cities with 20,000 bicycles introduced to Paris in 2007 in the Vélib' scheme.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/16/world/europe/16paris.html?ref=world|title=A New French Revolution’s Creed: Let Them Ride Bikes|work=New York Times|date=2007-07-16|accessdate=2008-01-13 | first=Katrin | last=Bennhold[/tpl]

==Advocacy groups==

The Environmental Transport Association was formed in 1990 to inform people of the impact that transport has on the environment.  It inaugurated Green Transport Week in 1993 and within that Car-Free Day in 1997.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl]
The Campaign for Better Transport (formerly known as Transport2000) was formed in 1972 in Britain to challenge proposed cuts in the British rail network and since then has promoted public transport solutions to our transport needs.
The New Mobility Agenda is an international initiative formed in 1988 that challenges car-based ideas and practices in the field of urban transport.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ecoplan.org/general/overview.htm|title= New Mobility 2006 Program Overview|accessdate=2008-01-13|publisher=ecoplan[/tpl]
Car Free Walks is a UK-based website encouraging walkers to use public transport to reach the start and end of walks, rather than using a car.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.carfreewalks.org|title= Car Free Walks|accessdate=2008-02-29[/tpl]
Car-Free.org is a U.S. educational non-profit organization supporting walking, bicycling, transit (bus) and ride-sharing modes of transportation.

==Activism groups==

Road protests rose to prominence in the UK in the early 1990s in response to a major road building program both in urban communities and also rural areas.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/7/newsid_2536000/2536089.stm|title=1993: Activists lose battle over chestnut tree|work=BBC|accessdate=2008-01-13 | date=1993-12-07[/tpl]
Reclaim the Streets, a movement formed in 1991 in London, "invaded" major roads, highway or freeway to stage parties. While this may obstruct the regular users of these spaces such as car drivers and public bus riders, the philosophy of RTS is that it is vehicle traffic, not pedestrians, who are causing the obstruction, and that by occupying the road they are in fact opening up public space.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/544778.stm|title=The group reclaiming the headlines|date=1999-12-01|work=BBC News|accessdate=2008-01-13[/tpl]
Critical Mass rides emerged in 1992 in San Francisco where cyclists take to the streets en masse to dominate the traffic, using the slogan "we are traffic". The ride was founded with the idea of drawing attention to how unfriendly the city was to bicyclists.[ref]

==Official events==

Car Free Days are official events with the common goal of taking a fair number of cars off the streets of a city or some target area or neighborhood for all or part of a day, in order to give the people who live and work there a chance to consider how their city might look and work with significantly fewer cars. The first events were organised in Reykjavík (Iceland), Bath (UK) and La Rochelle (France) in 1995.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ecoplan.org/carfreeday/general/origins.htm|title=World Car Free Days Timeline: 1961-2007|accessdate=2008-01-13|publisher=ecoplan[/tpl]
In town without my car! is an EU campaign and day every autumn (Northern Hemisphere) for an increased use of other vehicles than the car. It has since spread beyond the EU, and in 2004 more than 40 countries participate.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/sustainable/awareness/itwmc/whatisintownwithoutmycar|title=What is In Town, Without My Car?|publisher=UK Department for Transport|accessdate=2008-01-13 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080120214829/http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/sustainable/awareness/itwmc/whatisintownwithoutmycar  |archivedate = 2008-01-20[/tpl]

Towards Carfree Cities is the annual conference of the World Carfree Network and provides a focal point for diverse aspects of the emerging global carfree movement. The conference is in Portland, Oregon, USA in 2008 (its first time in North America), and has also been in Istanbul, Turkey; Bogota, Colombia; Budapest, Hungary; Berlin, Germany; Prague, Czech Republic; Timisoara, Romania; and Lyon, France. The conference series attempts to bridge the gap between many of the diverse people and organizations interested in reducing urban dependence on the automobile.
Transportation Alternative's Annual Commuter Race pits a bicyclist against both a subway rider and a cab rider in a race from Queens to Manhattan. The Fifth Annual Commuter race took place in May 2009, where bicyclist Rachel Myers beat straphanger Dan Hendrick and cab rider Willie Thompson to make it the fifth year the contestant on the bicycle won. Myers took the 2009 title with a time of 20 minutes and 15 seconds to make the 4.2 mile trek from Sunnyside, Queens to Columbus Circle in Manhattan. Hendrick showed up 15 minutes later off the subway and Thompson arrived via cab nearly a half-hour after that. Transportation Alternatives is a group that "seeks to change New York City's transportation priorities to encourage and increase non-polluting, quiet, city-friendly travel and decrease—not ban—private car use. They seek a rational transportation system based on a 'Green Transportation Hierarchy,' which gives preference to modes of travel based on their benefits and costs to society. To achieve our goals, T.A. works in five areas: Bicycling, Walking and Traffic Calming, Car-Free Parks, Safe Streets and Sensible Transportation." The 2009 Commuter Race came on the heels of a Times Square traffic ban in NYC that drew national media attention.[tpl]cite news|url = http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/26/nyregion/26broadway.html?_r=1&ref=nyregion|title = Mayor Plans to Close Parts of Broadway to Traffic|accessdate = 2011-09-15|date=February 2009|work=The New York Times|first1=William|last1=Neuman|first2=Michael|last2=Barbaro[/tpl]

==Carfree development==

===Definitions and types===

There are many areas of the world where people have always lived without cars, because no road access is possible, or none has been provided.  In developed countries these include islands and some historic neighbourhoods or settlements, the largest example being the canal city of Venice.  The term carfree development implies a physical change - either new building or changes to an existing built area. 
Melia et al. (2010)Melia, S., Barton, H. and Parkhurst, G. (2010) Carfree, Low Car - What's the Difference? World Transport Policy & Practice 16 (2), 24-32.  define carfree development as follows:
Carfree developments are residential or mixed use developments which:
This definition (which they distinguish from the more common "low car development") is based mainly on experience in Northwestern Europe, where the movement for carfree development began.  Within this definition three types are identified:

===Vauban===

Vauban, Freiburg, Germany is according to this definition, the largest carfree development in Europe, with over 5,000 residents.  Whether it can be considered carfree is open to debate: many local people prefer the term "stellplatzfrei" - literally "free from parking spaces" to describe the traffic management system there.  Vehicles are allowed down the residential streets at walking pace to pick up and deliver but not to park, although there are frequent infractions.  Residents of the stellplatzfrei areas must sign an annual declaration stating whether they own a car or not.  Car owners must purchase a place in one of the multi-storey car parks on the periphery, run by a council-owned company.  The cost of these spaces – € 17,500 in 2006, plus a monthly fee – acts as a disincentive to car ownership.

===Limited access type===

The more common form of carfree development involves some sort of physical barrier, which prevents motor vehicles from penetrating into a carfree interior.  Melia et al. describe this as the "Limited Access" type.  In some cases such as Stellwerk 60 in Cologne, there is a removable barrier, controlled by a residents' organisations.  In others such as Waterwijk (Amsterdam) (article in Dutch) vehicular access is only available from the exterior.

===Pedestrianised centres===

Whereas the first two models apply to newly built carfree developments, most pedestrianised city, town and district centres have been retro-fitted.  Pedestrianised centres may be considered carfree developments where they include a significant number of residents, mostly without cars, due to new residential development within them, or because they already included dwellings when they were pedestrianised.  The largest example in Europe is Groningen (city) with a city centre population of 16,500http://gemeente.groningen.nl/gemeente/de-stad-in-cijfers/statistische-jaarboeken Gemeente Groningen, (2008) Statistisch Jaarboek.]

===Benefits and problems of carfree developments===

Several studies have been done on European carfree developments.  The most comprehensive was conducted in 2000 by Jan Scheurer.Scheurer, J. (2001) Urban Ecology, Innovations in Housing Policy and the Future of Cities: Towards Sustainability in Neighbourhood CommunitiesThesis (PhD), Murdoch University Institute of Sustainable Transport.  Other more recent studies have been made of specific carfree areas such as Vienna's Florisdorf carfree development.Ornetzeder, M., Hertwich, E.G., Hubacek, K., Korytarova, K. and Haas, W. (2008) The environmental effect of car-free housing: A case in Vienna. Ecological Economics 65 (3), 516-530.
The main benefits found for carfree developments (summarised in Melia et al. 2010) found in the various studies are:
The main problems related to parking management.  Where parking is not controlled in the surrounding area, this often results in complaints from neighbours about overspill parking.
