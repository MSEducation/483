CATEGORIES: Free desktop environments, Software that uses FLTK

EDE or Equinox Desktop Environment is a small desktop environment that is meant to be simple and fast. Previous 1.x versions were based on a modified version of FLTK called eFLTK, while later versions are based on pure FLTK 1.x.

==EDE 2==

In EDE 2, eFLTK has been replaced with FLTK 1.x and EDE's own library, edelib (have nothing in common with EDELIB, the first library EDE used when the project was started).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.equinox-project.org/page/news|title=EDE news archive|accessdate=20 May 2012[/tpl] edelib contains functionality for creating a window, saving program configuration, communicating via D-Bus, loading icon themes, etc.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.equinox-project.org/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/wiki/DevelopmentHowTo|title=edelib development HowTo|accessdate=26 October 2008[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] EDE 2 follows FreeDesktop.org guidelines.

==History==

Equinox (later renamed to the "Equinox Desktop Environment") is an open-source, X Window System desktop project that started in 2000 by Martin Pekar, with help of others, most notably Mikko Lähteenmäki who wrote the (original) EDELIB, Dejan Lekic, and Szasz Pal. The original EDE GNU Savannah project is still available for visitors who want to look at the early source code. In September 2002 the project moved to SourceForge [tpl]cite web|url=http://savannah.nongnu.org/forum/forum.php?forum_id=1050|title=Migration to SourceForge|accessdate=15 Jul 2012[/tpl] mainly because SourceForge offered Subversion as VCS and had compile-farms so they could test FLTK on different platforms. Soon after the project was moved to SourceForge, Sanel Zukan joined the project, and few years after, Vedran Ljubović. All former authors except Sanel and Vedran abandoned project due to the lack of interest. Today, Sanel and Vedran are major driving force of the project.
