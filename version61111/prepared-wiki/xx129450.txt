CFCB is an AM radio station in Corner Brook, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, broadcasting at 570 kHz. Owned by Newcap Radio, CFCB first went on the air on October 3, 1960. The year 2010 marked CFCB's 50th anniversary of broadcasting. The station was founded by Dr. Noel Murphy. On March 26, 2012 CFCB rebranded, which included a new slogan, logo, programming, and more. The "Local News Now" slogan was adopted from VOCM in St. John's who had rebranded just weeks before. The new CFCB logo also features the VOCM color scheme, which includes yellow, and red.

==Shows and music format==

Being owned by Newcap, CFCB carries VOCM's Open Line, Backtalk, and Night Line live phone-in shows, Saturday Evening (Lions Club & VOCM Cares Radio Bingo) Host Greg Smith, Producer Jordan Keating,   and the Saturday Night Cabin Party, which is devoted to classic country music from the 1950s to the 1980s, as well as the 1:00 PM and 5:30 PM VOCM newscasts (though those newscasts are carried on weekdays only), but not the 7:45 AM newscast, or the 5:00 newscast, as CFCB has its own 8:00 AM and 5:00PM newscast. The station's regular music format is primarily country music. Prior to the early 2000s, CFCB was an adult contemporary station.
The longest-running radio show on the station is This One's For You, which is broadcast every Sunday morning from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM.

==Repeat transmitters==

CFCB also operates repeat transmitters in the following locations:
For some time now, the repeater CFNW-AM in Gros Morne National Park has been off-the-air leaving the Northern Peninsula without radio service from CFCB. The cause of this transmitter failure is due to an ice and wind storm in late 2011 which damaged the tower. When the transmitter site was constructed in 1971, the area was not a national park. Now that the station has to construct a new facility for their equipment, there are some issues with disturbing the environment in the park, all that have yet to be resolved. As of 2012 the signal in this area is still off-the-air. On October 3, 2012, Newcap Broadcasting applied to convert CFNW Port aux Choix from the AM band to the FM band. Newcap's application - CRTC to convert CFNW Port aux Choix from the AM band to the FM band - October 3, 2012 On January 25, 2013, the CRTC approved Newcap's application to convert CFNW from the AM band to the FM band. CFNW's new transmitter in Port aux Choix will operate at 96.7 MHz. Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2013-24, CFCB Corner Brook â€“ New transmitter at Port au Choix, CRTC, January 25, 2013 
In September 2013, the CFCB transmission tower on Lewin Parkway in Corner Brook was taken down. Construction on a new AM tower at the same site has begun. No CRTC or Industry Canada records indicate the station filed any application to do this work. While tower construction continues, CFCB-AM is currently transmitting from an unknown location at a very low power leaving many areas unserviced. As of October 28, 2013 this is still the case.
1 In the daytime, CFSX operates independent of CFCB aside from the phone-in shows and the weekday 1:00 PM and 5:30 PM news. CFGN and CFCV serve as repeaters of CFSX. At night, CFSX and its repeaters serve as repeaters to CFCB.
