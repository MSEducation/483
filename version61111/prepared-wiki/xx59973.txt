Haxby Hall is an estate in York Road, village of Haxby, York, England. It was built in 1790 on 22 acres (89,000 m²) of land.
In 1950, the owner of the estate, Kenneth Ward, donated the pleasure grounds around the building to the village (which is now part of the City of York), to build the Ethel Ward Memorial Playing Field. The playing field now contains a children's playground, ball playing courts, a scout center, and more. It is also the location of the village fairs and celebrations, and the home of the Haxby football teams, including Haxby United F.C who play in the York and District League.
Haxby Hall itself, now with only 3 acres (12,000 m²) of land, was demolished in 1960, and in 1965 it was replaced by the Haxby Hall Residential Home for the elderly (with accommodations for 52 elderly people), and an adjoining ambulance station.
