London Metropolitan University, commonly known as London Met, is a public research university located in London, United Kingdom. It was established on 1 August 2002 by the amalgamation of the University of North London (formerly the Polytechnic of North London, established in 1896) and London Guildhall University (formerly the City  of London Polytechnic, established in 1848).[tpl]Cite web| title=160 years of London Met| url=http://www.londonmet.ac.uk/about/160-years.cfm| publisher=London Metropolitan University| accessdate=27 August 2012[/tpl][tpl]Cite news| url=http://student.independent.co.uk/into_university/az_uni_colleges/article2807263.ece| title=A-Z Unis & Colleges: London Metropolitan University| author=Chris Green| date=| publisher=The Independent[/tpl] The University has campuses in the City of London and in the London Borough of Islington, with a museum, as well as archives and libraries.

In 2011, following a review of its undergraduate education provision which revealed that 80% of its students were on just 80 courses, London Met announced it would be reducing the number of courses on offer. 
On 30 August 2012, the University's "highly-trusted status" with the UK Border Agency of the Home Office was revoked, revoking the University's right to sponsor new visa applications for non-EU/EEA foreign students, as well as revoking the existing visas of the University's pre-existing non-European foreign students, causing them to be excluded from the University, and compelling them to seek places with alternative institutions. The university's licence to recruit international students has now been reinstated.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/student/news/london-metropolitan-university-allowed-to-admit-foreign-students-again-after-licence-restored-8565931.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Richard | last=Garner | title=London Metropolitan University allowed to admit foreign students again after licence restored | date=9 April 2013[/tpl]

==History==

London Metropolitan University was formed on 1 August 2002 by the merger of London Guildhall University and the University of North London. In October 2006, the University opened a new Science Centre, part of a £30m investment in its science department at the North campus close to Holloway Road, with a "Super Lab" claimed to be one of Europe's most advanced science teaching facilities,[tpl]Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/6127546.stm| title=Science centre 'best in Europe'| publisher=BBC World Service| date=8 November 2006| accessdate=27 August 2012[/tpl][tpl]Cite news| url=http://education.guardian.co.uk/clearing/video/londonmet/0,,2142839,00.html| title=Brought to you in association with London Metropolitan University| publisher=Guardian Unlimited| year=2007| accessdate=27 August 2012[/tpl][tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.internationaleducationmedia.com/unitedkingdom/londonmet/londonmet.htm| title=Science ‘superlab’ opens at London Met United Kingdom| publisher=International Education Media| accessdate=27 August 2012[/tpl] and 280 workstations equipped with digital audio visual interactive equipment.

===London Guildhall University===

In 1848 Charles Blomfield, the Bishop of London, called upon the clergy to establish evening classes to improve the moral, intellectual and spiritual condition of young men in London. In response, the bishop Charles Mackenzie, who instituted the Metropolitan Evening Classes for Young Men in Crosby Hall, Bishopsgate, London, with student fees at one shilling per session. Subjects on the original curriculum included Greek, Latin, Hebrew, English, History, Mathematics, Drawing and Natural Philosophy. This fledgling college came under royal patronage following the visit of Prince Albert to the classes in 1851. In 1860 the classes moved to Sussex Hall, the former Livery Hall of the Bricklayers' Company, in Leadenhall Street. By this time, some 800 students were enrolled annually.
In 1861 the classes were reconstituted and named the City of London College. Over the next twenty years, the College was one of the pioneers in the introduction of commercial and technical subjects. The college built new premises in White Street at a cost of £16,000 (contributions were received from Queen Victoria and the Prince of Wales) and were opened in 1881. In 1891 the college joined Birkbeck Institute and the Northampton Institute to form the City Polytechnic by a Charity Commissioners' scheme to facilitate funding for these institutions by the City Parochial Foundation, and to enable the three institutions to work cooperatively. However this attempted federation did not function in practice, as each institution continued to operate more or less independently. The City Polytechnic concept was dissolved in 1906 and the City of London College came under the supervision of London County Council.
In December 1940 the college's building was destroyed by a German air raid. City of London College subsequently moved into premises at 84 Moorgate in 1944. In 1948, the City of London College celebrated its centenary with a service of thanksgiving addressed by the Archbishop of Canterbury at St Paul's Cathedral. In 1970 the college merged with Sir John Cass College to form the City of London Polytechnic. From 1992 to July 2002, the institution was known as London Guildhall University.
Under the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 the Polytechnic was awarded University status, previously having awarded the degrees of the former Council for National Academic Awards. London Guildhall University was named in order to show its links with the City of London and the City's many guilds/livery companies. It was unassociated with the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, based at the Barbican Centre. The schools was ranked 30th out of the UK's 43 new universities in the 2001 Research Assessment Exercise.
The former LGU campus is now the city campus and is located at the intersection of the City of London financial district and the old East End, near Aldgate East, Tower Hill and Liverpool Street tube stations. There are buildings located at Minories, Jewry Street, Central House, Moorgate, Whitechapel High Street, Calcutta House, Commercial Road and Goulston Street. There is a gymnasium for the use of staff and students at the Whitechapel High St. building, thumb|Calcutta House which was named after the Indian port of Calcutta

===University of North London===

Founded as the Northern Polytechnic Institute in 1896, it merged in 1971 with the North Western Polytechnic which was established in 1929, to become the Polytechnic of North London. Until the passing of the Education Reform Act 1988, the Polytechnic was under the control of the Inner London Education Authority – part of the then Greater London Council and awarded the degrees of the former Council for National Academic Awards. Under the Further and Higher Education Act 1992, the institution, a pioneer of widening participation and access to higher education, was granted University status and the right to award its own degrees. Following the merger with London Guildhall University, London Metropolitan University became the largest unitary university in Greater London.
The former UNL campus is now the North campus and is located on Holloway Road, near Holloway Road and Highbury & Islington tube stations.

===Student number controversy===

In July 2008 it was reported that a financial crisis was looming for the University. London Met had been misreporting data on student drop-outs for several years and, consequently, the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) was proposing to claw back at least £15 million for the overpayment in 2008-9.[tpl]cite web|last=Attwood |first=Rebecca |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=402684&sectioncode=26 |title=Hefce clawback means cuts loom |publisher=Times Higher Education |date=10 July 2008 |accessdate=2011-10-21[/tpl]
News of the crisis led to a demonstration of staff and students outside the universities Tower Building in January 2009. They were calling for the vice-chancellor to be sacked and standing against possible job cuts.
In February 2009 the figure of overpayment was revised to £56 million by HEFCE, who were seeking to recover the money.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2009/feb/03/brian-roper| work=The Guardian| location=London| title=Balancing the books| date=3 February 2009| accessdate=11 May 2010| first=Maureen| last=Paton[/tpl] Local newspaper the Islington Gazette reported on the high stress levels among staff, including those on long-term sick leave. Alan Pike, a UNISON official, was quoted as saying "In the past two months, we have had about 20 support staff come to us with stress."[tpl]Citation needed| date=August 2012[/tpl]
On 19 March 2009, in response to the crisis, vice-chancellor Brian Roper resigned his position with immediate effect but continued to receive his salary until December 2009.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2009/mar/19/brian-roper-resignation-london-met| work=The Guardian| location=London| title=Vice-chancellor of London Metropolitan quits| first=Polly| last=Curtis| date=19 March 2009| accessdate=11 May 2010[/tpl] Controversially, he received a series of bonuses during the period when the University was returning inaccurate data to HEFCE.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2010[/tpl]
On 29 April 2009, the University and College Union (UCU) announced that members at London Metropolitan University voted overwhelmingly in favour of strike action and 'action short of a strike' against the loss of at least 550 jobs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ucu.org.uk/index.cfm?articleid=3838 |title=University and College Union – London Met lecturers vote for strike action |publisher=UCU |date=29 April 2009 |accessdate=2011-10-21[/tpl]
In May 2009 Alfred Morris, former vice-chancellor of the University of the West of England and University of Wales, Lampeter, was appointed interim vice-chancellor.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=406616&c=1| title=Governors have explored the legal scenarios if London Met goes bust| publisher=Times Higher Education| date=21 May 2009| accessdate=2009-05-21| author=Melanie Newman[/tpl]
The government announced in May 2009 that there would be an independent inquiry, exploring the possibility that HEFCE had colluded with London Met by failing to query implausibly low drop-out rates.Melanie Newman, "Government announces inquiry into London Met crisis", Times Higher Education, 21 May 2009 It concluded in November 2009 and was reported to cast responsibility to Brian Roper, other senior administrators, and the Board of Governors. Following conclusion of the report, the chair of HEFCE called on "senior staff" and the entire Board of Governors to resign, noting that HEFCE was not convinced that the University's management could effectively safeguard public funds.Lucy Hodges and Richard Garner, "University accused of £36m student scam" The Independent, 22 November 2009 After the deadline indicated by HEFCE chief executive Alan Langlands had passed, there were ruminations among staff and ministers that HEFCE could withdraw funding, effectively forcing the University to close.Lucy Hodges and Richard Garner, "London Met warned that it could be closed", The Independent, 7 December 2009
A report commissioned by the University, published in November 2009, found that Roper had "the major responsibility and culpability" for the financial situation: Roper and some members of the executive were aware that the University had been applying its own interpretation of funding rules on student dropouts – rather than the funding council’s – since 2003, but took no action. The University’s board of governors and audit committee had an oversight role, which made them ultimately "accountable for a financial failure of this magnitude" and meant that they "must take overall responsibility".[tpl]Cite journal|first=Rebecca|last=Attwood|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=409180&c=2|title=Roper is to blame for fiasco, but London Met’s board bears responsibility|journal=Times Higher Education|date=20 November 2009[/tpl]

===2011 course changes===

In early 2011, London Metropolitan University announced an overhaul of undergraduate education for students entering courses in 2012. This included a reduction in the number of courses from 557 to 160. The announcement also signalled a move from semester-long to year-long modules, and thirty weeks of teaching, a gain of six weeks on the current average. The University argues that the longer learning time will help increase the opportunity for development and guidance before students move to final examinations.London Metropolitan University, "New directions at London Met", New directions at London Met, 6 May 2011 There will be a transition to this new course offering in 2011/12 and this has led to applicants for some courses being contacted and offered alternative programmes.John Morgan, "London Met applicants trapped in limbo by course closures and Ucas deadline", Times Higher Education, 5 May 2011

===Proposed alcohol-free zones===

In April 2012 the University was reported to be considering creating alcohol-free zones and events to enable Muslim students (who form 20% of the student population) to take part more comfortably.[tpl]cite news| title=University where 20% of students are Muslim considers alcohol-free zones| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/apr/12/university-alcohol-free-zones-muslim-students| publisher=The Guardian| date=12 April 2012| author=Jessica Shepherd| location=London[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/9199759/London-Metropolitan-University-mulls-alcohol-ban-for-conservative-Muslim-students.html| title=London Metropolitan University mulls alcohol ban for 'conservative Muslim students'| publisher=Daily Telegraph| author=Matthew Holehouse| date=12 April 2012[/tpl] This provoked criticism from the University's Islamic societies,[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/9235874/Muslim-students-condemn-divisive-and-irresponsible-university-alcohol-ban.html| title=Muslim students condemn 'divisive and irresponsible' university alcohol ban| publisher=Daily Telegraph| author=Hannah Furness| date=30 April 2012| location=London[/tpl] and other organisations such as  the Muslim Council of Britain, but positive comments from representatives of the National Union of Students and the Federation of Student Islamic Societies.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-17701963| title=London Metropolitan University's alcohol-free zone plan| publisher=BBC News| date=13 April 2012[/tpl]

===UK Home Office/Border Agency action, and consequences===

On 16 July 2012 the UK Border Agency of the UK Home Office suspended the University's "highly-trusted status" with the Border Agency, a status required in order for the University to be eligible to sponsor both new student visa applications as well as existing student visas, for foreign students from outside of the European Union and the European Economic Area (or Switzerland). The University was one of three institutions to have such a status suspended.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/9418013/Ban-on-university-overseas-recruits-after-missing-students-failure.html| title=Ban on university overseas recruits after 'missing' students failure| publisher=The Telegraph| date=22 July 2012|accessdate=28 August 2012| location=London| first=David| last=Barrett[/tpl][tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=420965&c=1| title=Home Office 'to strip' London Met of highly trusted status| publisher=Times Higher Education| date=26 August 2012|accessdate=28 August 2012[/tpl]

The Immigration Minister, Damian Green, cited a number of reasons for the decision, including the discovery that more than a quarter of the students in the test sample did not in fact have leave to remain in the UK, that the University did not have and could not provide sufficient proof of English-language proficiency standards for some of its students, and the fact that the University was unable to confirm the attendance of its students, in some 57% of the sampled cases.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-19419395| title=London Metropolitan University students fear deportation| publisher=BBC News| date=30 August 2012|accessdate=30 August 2012[/tpl]
