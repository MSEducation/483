The Royal Architectural Institute of Canada (RAIC), also known since 2012 as Architecture Canada, is a Canadian association, founded in 1907, that represents over 3,600 Canadian architects and faculty and graduates of Canadian schools of architecture. It acts as the voice for architecture and its practice in Canada and provides the national framework for the development and recognition of architectural excellence.
In 2006, the RAIC signed on for the 2030 Â°Challenge, which urges the global architecture community to adopt targets to ensure building practices are carbon-neutral by 2030.
There are three classes of membership in the RAIC: Members (post-nominal letters MRAIC), fellows (FRAIC), and honorary fellows (FRAIC(hon)).
