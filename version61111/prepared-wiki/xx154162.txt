==History==

St. Gerard Majella Church Parish was established in 1944. The high school was opened in September, 1947, with an enrollment of forty-three freshmen and sophomores. Louisiana accreditation was obtained in December 1950, and the first class was graduated in May of that year. In 1958, Redemptorist High School was approved by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. The high school was operated by St. Gerard Parish until it became an interparochial school in 1963. Redemptorist then became a Regional Diocesan School on July 1, 1995. The school is governed by a Regional Diocesan School Board consisting of priests and elected and appointed lay persons. The faculty consists of laymen and laywomen, one priest, and one Redemptorist Brother.Redemptorist High School website
