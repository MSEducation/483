He attended Wake Forest University where he helped lead the Demon Deacons to the 1986 NCAA Championship.  He played on the U.S. team in the 1987 Walker Cup, and turned professional in the same year. He has four wins on the PGA Tour: the 1991 Kemper Open and Buick Classic, the 1998 Bell Canadian Open, and the 2000 Invensys Classic.  He was the first golfer to win on the PGA Tour using the ProV1 golf ball at the 2000 Invensys Classic at Las Vegas. He has been featured in the top 50 of the Official World Golf Ranking. Andrade continues to play on a limited basis, and finished T5 at the Sanderson Farms Championship on the PGA Tour in July 2013, earning $114,000.  He is eligible to compete on the Champions Tour as of January 25, 2014 when he turns 50 years old. He will have exempt status on the Champions Tour due to his position on the career earnings money list and his multiple victories on the PGA Tour. 
Andrade is also an active contributor to charity. He and fellow PGA Tour professional Brad Faxon received the Golf Writers of America's 1999 Charlie Bartlett Award for their "unselfish contributions to society", and the American Heart Association's 2002 Gold Heart Award in recognition of their charity efforts. Also in 2002, Andrade and Faxon were named winners of the 2002 Ambassadors of Golf Award. Together, they run Billy Andrade/Brad Faxon Charities for Children, Inc., a non-profit organization that, as of 2005, has donated over $3 million to needy children in Rhode Island and southern Massachusetts. Since 1999, Andrade and Faxon have also served as hosts of the CVS Charity Classic, a golf tournament held at the Rhode Island Country Club each June, whose proceeds benefit the two players' charity.
Andrade resides in Atlanta, Georgia and Bristol, Rhode Island, with his wife, Jody, and their children Cameron and Grace.
