At the 1904 Summer Olympics, two golf events were contested â€“ men's individual and team tournaments. The competitions were held from September 17, 1904 to September 24, 1904.
It was the second and final appearance of the sport at the Olympics until the upcoming 2016 Summer Olympics.  The men's team event was new, replacing the women's individual.  The men's individual event was switched to a match play tournament rather than the stroke play used four years earlier.
