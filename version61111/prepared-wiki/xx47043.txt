This is the list of cities and towns in Montenegro. According to the statistic criteria of Monstat (Montenegrin Statistical Office), the following settlements are classified as "urban" (i.e. cities and towns), as opposed to "rural" (villages). These criteria are not limited to settlement size, but also include the percentage of residents engaged in agriculture, population density etc. Thus, not all towns in statistical sense are greater than villages.
