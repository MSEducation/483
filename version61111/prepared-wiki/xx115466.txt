CATEGORIES: Salticidae, Endemic fauna of Vanuatu

Araneotanna is a spider genus of the Salticidae family (jumping spiders) with only one species, A. ornatipes, that occurs only on the New Hebrides.

==Name==

The genus was named Tanna until 2006, when it had to be replaced due to a conflict with a genus of the same name in the Homopteran family Cicadidae, Tanna Distant, 1905.
Tanna is an island of Vanuatu. The salticid genus Efate is also named after an island of Vanuatu.
