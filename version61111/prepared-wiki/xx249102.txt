==Life==

Williams was born on April 7, probably in Parkmill, near Swansea. Having apprenticed as a carpenter in Parkmill, he then found work with a William Clement, later his father-in-law, a member of the Christadelphian Ecclesia in Mumbles, and was immersed on Sunday January 15, 1868. He married Elizabeth Clement and the couple had eight children - Clement, William, Katherine, in Wales, and Gershom, Fred, May, George and Bessie in America. 
In 1872 he moved from Wales to Riverside, Iowa where he worked as a carpenter and joined the local "ecclesia" of 12 membersThe Advocate, Life and Works of Thomas Williams p4The Christadelphian Magazine, 1872.The Christadelphian Magazine, 1875 where he reports ecclesial news, and two mentions in 1880. In March 1885 he commenced publication of The Christadelphian Advocate Magazine at Waterloo, Iowa."They are served by a monthly periodical, The Christadelphian Advocate. This publication was begun in 1885 by Thomas Williams..." J. Gordon Melton ed., Encyclopedia of American religions 4th Ed.1993, Page 537[ref]Henry Ormal Severance, A guide to the current periodicals and serials of the United States and Canada 1914 Page 89

In 1891 Williams began to publish a second magazine, The Truth Gleaner aimed at non-Christadelphians, and in 1892 relocated to Chicago. In 1893, in response to the expected visitors to Chicago for the World's Columbian Exposition, Williams published 10,000 copies of the booklet The Great Salvation.Lippy, C. The Christadelphians in North America.Life and works of Thomas Williams. 1974. 194 pages By 1972 105,000 copies had been published.Life and works, p.9 In 1905 J.G. Miller of Waterloo, Iowa translated the booklet as Die grosse Erlösung.
Williams was also active travelling throughout North America as a preacher and Christadelphian speaker. As was typical of religious speakers of the period Williams participated in lengthy public debates with other religious groups.1889 "March 18 Elder D. S. Crawley, writing from Weir, Kansas, reports a twelve-night debate with a Mr. Thomas Williams, a Christadelphian, on the subjects of the Book of Mormon, conscious condition of the dead, laying on of hands, perpetuity of spiritual gifts, and the kingdom of God.", 1889 debate in Illinois, "between Elder EL Kelley and Elder Thomas Williams of the Christadelphians, commencing November 12, involving consciousness after death."

==The 1898 division==

In 1898 a controversy in London, England caused the Birmingham Central Ecclesia meeting at Temperance Hall to amend its statement of faith to include an extra bracketed sentence specifying that God could and would raise at least some unbaptised believers at the resurrection. Although 10 members had already been "disfellowshipped" for not accepting this teaching in Sydney, Australia in 1883,The Christadelphian Magazine 1884, p.190 commented favourably by Roberts p.382. and some British ecclesias already had similar amendments,e.g. Statement of Faith of the North London Ecclesia, 1887, with John James Andrew among the authors.  the status of Birmingham as, then, in the words of sociologist Bryan R. Wilson, primus inter pares, led to an escalation which saw many ecclesias without similar amendments being isolated,Wilson, Bryan R. Sects and Society, 1961 particularly in areas directly affected by the controversy such as London.
Following the death of Robert Roberts in 1898 the role of editor of The Christadelphian Magazine in Britain was taken by Charles Curwen Walker. From May to August 1900 Williams visited Britain, meeting Walker and Henry Sulley in Birmingham and John James Andrew, in London. Walker was reluctant to speak as any kind of "representative" of the British Christadelphians, but strongly counselled Williams to support and accept the amendment.
From October 1903 to June 1904 Williams visited Britain again at the invitation of Albert Hall of the Sowerby Bridge ecclesia in Yorkshire.,Advocate 1904 p336 and of John Owler of the Barnsbury Hall, Islington ecclesia in London. Hall and Owler had previously followed Andrew in the "resurrectional responsibility" controversy, although by 1903 Andrew himself would not fellowship with his previous supporters and reportedly been rebaptised in 1901. At a lecture in Leeds, which 40 visitors from those aligned with Birmingham Temperance Hall attended, Williams failed to state clearly that God could and would raise some unbaptised, and this was taken as supporting Andrew's teaching. However the next year Williams in print rejected Andrew's views as "extreme".Brother Andrew's extremes: "he still still strives to justify his extreme claim and fellowship attitude on the question of resurrection, namely, that God has so circumscribed His power by the law of resurrection that it is impossible for Him in the future to raise anyone to life again, for any purpose." Advocate July 1905. Correspondence with Andrew continued till the latter's death in 1907. The result of the visit was a further distancing of the two sides.Reports in both The Christadelphian Magazine and The Christadelphian Advocate Magazine, 1904
In 1906 Williams held a public lecture in Toronto against the "Hell-fire" teaching of R. A. Torrey which drew an audience of 4,000, and was later published as a booklet "Hell Torments". Notes of an earlier debate in 1888 with the atheist Charles Watts led to publication of "The Divinity of the Bible" in 1906.
From June 1907 to August 1908 Williams made a third visit to England, leaving James Leask to run the magazine. In Wales he persuaded four ecclesias which were in fellowship with the "Fraternal Visitor" magazine of J.J. Hadley ("Suffolk Street") to separate into a third grouping having fellowship neither with Birmingham Temperance Hall or Birmingham Suffolk St. groupings.,Advocate Committee. Life and Works of Thomas Williams p.34 but with Owler and Hall of the "Up and Be Doing Movement". 
The process of division was cemented in November 1909 when Williams published an Unamended Statement of Faith, which was in effect the old 1878 Birmingham Statement of Faith (BSF) with 7 minor changes, and naturally the omission of the 1898 Clause 24 Amendment, causing the new statement to colloquially be known as "BUSF" till today (though the 'B' for 'Birmingham' had in fact been dropped) and defining the Unamended Christadelphians.Pursell, Richard A. Christadelphians The Untold Story, Colorado 2006
In 1911 Williams relocated both home and magazine from Chicago to Orlando, Florida
In 1913 he made a fourth visit to Britain visiting Sowerby Bridge, Heckmondike, Leeds and Huddersfield in Yorkshire arranged by Hall, then London for meetings arranged by Owler. Heading back by train from London to Mumbles he collapsed and died on December 8, aged 66."Thomas Williams, Orlando, Fla., editor of the Christadelphian Advocate, notice of whose death was received a week ago by cablegram from England, ..."

Zilmer, formerly a Lutheran pastor, then a Church of God Abrahamic Faith minister, then as a Christadelphian the associate editor of The Faith magazine, which he resigned on taking up William's position.The Faith, March 1914 After two years he was replaced with John Owler, mentioned above.The Advocate, October 1916 Some years later editorship also passed to Albert Hall, also mentioned above, who had emigrated to British Columbia.
