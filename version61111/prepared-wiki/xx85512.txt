When Ian Scott resigned his legislative seat in late 1992, a by-election was called for April 1, 1993 to replace him.

St. George—St. David, which is now part of Toronto Centre, included the Church and Wellesley neighbourhood, the largest gay village in Ontario.  Although Murphy is not himself gay, he soon emerged as a leading spokesperson in the Ontario legislature for progressive legislation pertaining to the rights of same-sex couples, introducing a private member's bill in 1993 which would have partially extended spousal benefits.David Rayside, On the Fringe: Gays & Lesbians in Politics. He was one of only three Liberal MPPs, along with Jean Poirier and Dianne Poole, to support Bill 167, the Bob Rae government's more sweeping same-sex benefits package in 1994, and was critical of Liberal leader Lyn McLeod's decision to oppose the bill.
Murphy was defeated in the 1995 provincial election, losing his seat to Progressive Conservative Al Leach by 337 votes while New Democrat candidate Brent Hawkes was a close third.[tpl]cite web |url=http://results.elections.on.ca/results/1995_results/valid_votes.jsp?e_code=36&rec=0&district=st.+george&flag=E&layout=G |title=Summary of Valid Ballots by Candidate |publisher=Elections Ontario |date=June 8, 1995 |accessdate=2014-03-02[/tpl]
