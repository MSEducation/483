Rogers Park is a Metra commuter railroad station in the Rogers Park neighborhood on the north side of Chicago.  It is located at 7000 N. Ravenswood Avenue, between W. Greenleaf Avenue and W. Lunt Avenue.  In Metra's zone-based fare system, Rogers Park is in zone B. The neighborhood that surrounds the station is residential, with single-family houses and small apartment buildings, but just a block to the east is Clark Street, a major north-south artery with buses and shopping.
The station has two side platforms, and although it does not contain a ticket agent booth, a heated waiting room is available on the Lunt side between 5:45 AM - 2:00 PM. This line retains the "left-hand main" policy of the original builder, the Chicago and North Western Railway: northbound trains stop on the west platform and southbound trains stop on the east platform.  
Rogers Park is served by Metra's Union Pacific/North Line trains, traveling between Ogilvie Transportation Center in Chicago and points as far north as Kenosha, Wisconsin.  Rogers Park is the northernmost Union Pacific/North Line station in Chicago.  Travel time to Ogilvie is usually 20 minutes, but can be as fast as 15 minutes on a rush hour express train and as slow as 23 minutes during overcrowding.
The closest CTA Red Line station is Morse, located five blocks to the east of Rogers Park station.
