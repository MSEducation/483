The pilot episode, "Bring Me the Head of Boba Fett," was written by Evan Dorkin and directed by Chuck Sheetz. It was rated TV-14 in the United States. It originally aired in the United States on Cartoon Network's late night programing block, Adult Swim, on March 3, 2002.
The pilot, as well as the comic, are based on Dorkin's days as a comic store employee at Jim Hanley's Universe's Richmond Avenue store in Staten Island, New York (Eltingville is one of Staten Island's neighborhoods). The pilot's storyline was partially based on issue #6 of Dork!
The opening and closing themes were written and performed by The Aquabats.
Welcome to Eltingville features mc chris, who had recently started working under the Adult Swim brand through Space Ghost Coast to Coast, in a small role as a short boy disliked by the rest of the cast.
Dorkin has stated that he would like to have had the opportunity to produce further episodes or a miniseries for the failed pilot episode. Dorkin has also stated that if the series had been picked up, one of the potential plot lines would have been a "Klingon vs. Elf war" between a local Klingon camp and a Renaissance fair.THE FUTURE OF 'ELTINGVILLE' ON TV AND IN COMICS Comic Book Resources
