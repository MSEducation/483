[[Domino (Squeeze album)]]

Domino is a 1998 album by the British New Wave group Squeeze. It is the band's twelfth studio album. After a career struggling with various major labels, the band decided to record and release Domino independently, on Glenn Tilbrook's own Quixotic Records. Core members Tilbrook and Chris Difford were joined by three brand new Squeeze members for this effort: drummer Ashley Soan, bassist Hilaire Penda, and keyboardist Chris Holland (Jools's younger brother). 
The album was hastily made, and received negative reactions from fans and critics. Difford and Tilbrook have both since denounced Domino as a weak effort, marred by time constraints and increasing friction between the two songwriters. Following a 1999 tour during which Difford failed to show up for a single show (he blamed troubles with alcoholism and an increasing hatred of touring), Squeeze decided to call it quits. 
The band's dislike of the album was highlighted when, after reforming in 2007, no tracks from Domino were performed during the band's UK and US tours until 2012 when "Without You Here" was played.  The only other Squeeze album that did not feature at all in the post-2007 tours was Play.
