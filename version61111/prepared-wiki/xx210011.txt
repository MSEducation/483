This list of playing card nicknames has the common nicknames for the playing cards in a 52-card deck, as used in some common card games, such as poker.

==Single cards==

The following is a list of nicknames used for playing cards used in most card games which use the standard 52-card pack. Such games usually require the revealing or announcement of held cards, at which point the nicknames may be used.

===One-eyed Royals===

The phrase one-eyed royals is jargon referring to the 3 face cards showing only 1 eye: the Jack of Spades ([tpl]cards|J♠[/tpl]), Jack of Hearts ([tpl]cards|J♥[/tpl]) and King of Diamonds ([tpl]cards|K♦[/tpl]). The terminology results from the depiction of the face on the card as being shown in profile, so only one eye is visible (all other face cards show 2 eyes). The jacks are also referred to, separately, as one-eyed jacks: Jack of Spades ([tpl]cards|J♠[/tpl]), Jack of Hearts ([tpl]cards|J♥[/tpl]).
They are frequently used in home games of draw poker as wildcards. Because the King of Diamonds is the only king card bearing an axe (the others show swords), a common phrase for the one-eyed royals is "One-eyed Jacks, the Man with the Axe". Those three cards are the only cards of differing rank and suit in a common deck that share an identifying trait.
Another common phrase s "One-eyed Jacks and Suicide Kings" denoting the kings bearing a sword through their head.

==Texas hold 'em pocket card nicknames==

[tpl]note|6h[/tpl]The Six of Hearts is known as loyalty at the risk of death or Grace's Card. This is because in 1688 an Irish Jacobite soldier, Colonel Richard Grace of Moynelly House, Athlone, used this card to write a refusal to surrender and sent it to William of Orange. Colonel Grace was loyal to King James II of England, and risked being shot or hanged for his refusal to give up. The words Colonel Grace wrote were, "Tell your master I despise his offer, and that honor and conscience are dearer to a gentleman than all the wealth and titles a prince can bestow"[ref]
