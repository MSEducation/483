Sangeeth Sivan is an Indian film director and screenwriter who works in Malayalam and Hindi film industries. He is probably best known for directing the 1992 Malayalam film Yodha.
Sangeeth Sivan is the son of filmmaker Sivan. His brothers Santosh Sivan and Sanjeev Sivan are also famed names in the industry. He started his career in films as a director with Malayalam films. His directorial debut Vyooham was well noticed but it was through the highly acclaimed and successful Yodha that he established himself as a leading director in Malayalam. After directing more than half a dozen Malayalam films, he directed his first Bollywood film, Zor, starring Sunny Deol. However, the film did not do well at the box office but the directorial ability of Sangeeth was well appreciated by many producers. After a brief gap he started working on Jackie Shroff's film Sandhya followed by Pantaloon's Chura Liyaa Hai Tumne. 
Sangeeth Sivan's collaboration with actor Mohanlal in three of his films, namely Yodha, Gandharvam and Nirnayam, were remarkably successful.
In 2012 Sangeeth went to the UK to direct the comedy Yamla Pagla Deewana 2 along with the Deol family.
