The Church of St. Martin de Porres is a Roman Catholic parish church under the authority of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, located in Poughkeepsie, Dutchess County, New York.

==History==

The parish was established in 1852 as the Church of the Nativity for the German community of Poughkeepsie, who previously were attended to in St. Peter's Church by German priests from New York City. That same year, the first church was started and a cornerstone laid. The first pastor was the Rev. Joseph Schaeffer, who had served the community previously at St. Peter's, and he swiftly raised the capital to erect a rectory and school. The congregation swelled so much that by 1859 a new church was erected at a cost of $4,500. Partly due to its isolated nature, there was a quick succession of pastors. Among those the Rev. Dr. George Schrader (pastor from 1878 to 1879) purchased the cemetery, installed an organ, and added a steeple.
In 1962, Nativity Church in the City of Poughkeepsie was forced to close because the building was deemed unsafe."Parish History Highlights", St. Martin de Porres, Poughkeepsie, New York A new parish was formed in the Red Oaks Mill section of the Town of Poughkeepsie.
