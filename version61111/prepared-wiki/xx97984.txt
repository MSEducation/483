==Biography==

===Early life===

Schwartz was born in Brooklyn, New York on November 25, 1900.[tpl]cite news|journal=Songwriters Hall of Fame|url=http://www.songwritershalloffame.org/exhibits/C224|title=Arthur Schwartz|accessdate=November 23, 2013[/tpl] He taught himself to play the harmonica and piano as a child, and began playing for silent films at age 14. He earned a B.A. in English at New York University and an M.A. in that subject at Columbia. Forced by his father, an attorney, to study law, Schwartz graduated from NYU Law School and was admitted to the Bar in 1924.[tpl]cite web|website=ArtistDirect.com|title=Artist Bio: Arthur Schwartz|url=http://www.artistdirect.com/artist/bio/arthur-schwartz/490509#GfwB5Uj608TF5MWL.99|accessdate=November 23, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|journal=Songwriters Hall of Fame|url=http://www.songwritershalloffame.org/exhibits/C224|title=Arthur Schwartz|accessdate=November 23, 2013[/tpl]

===Career===

While studying law, he supported himself by teaching English in the New York school system. He also worked on songwriting concurrently with his studies and published his first song ("Baltimore, Md., You're the Only Doctor for Me", with lyrics by Eli Dawson) by 1923.[tpl]cite news|journal=Songwriters Hall of Fame|url=http://www.songwritershalloffame.org/exhibits/C224|title=Arthur Schwartz|accessdate=November 23, 2013[/tpl] Acquaintances such as Lorenz Hart and George Gershwin encouraged him to stick with composing. He attempted to convince Howard Dietz, an MGM publicist who had collaborated with Jerome Kern, to work with him, but Dietz initially declined.[tpl]cite web|website=ArtistDirect.com|title=Artist Bio: Arthur Schwartz|url=http://www.artistdirect.com/artist/bio/arthur-schwartz/490509#GfwB5Uj608TF5MWL.99|accessdate=November 23, 2013[/tpl]
As Artist Direct documents: Schwartz placed his first songs in a Broadway show, The New Yorkers (March 10, 1927). By 1928, he had closed his law office and convinced Dietz to write with him. Their first songs together were used in the Broadway revue The Little Show (April 30, 1929) and included "I Guess I'll Have to Change My Plan", which belatedly became a hit three years later when it was recorded by Rudy Vallée. Schwartz's career was launched, and in 1930 he contributed songs to six shows, three in London and three in New York, the most successful of which was Three's a Crowd (October 15, 1930), which featured the same cast as The Little Show and featured the hit "Something to Remember You By". Schwartz also started contributing songs to motion pictures, beginning with "I'm Afraid of You" (lyrics by Ralph Rainger and Edward Eliscu) in Queen High (1930).[tpl]cite web|website=ArtistDirect.com|title=Artist Bio: Arthur Schwartz|url=http://www.artistdirect.com/artist/bio/arthur-schwartz/490509#GfwB5Uj608TF5MWL.99|accessdate=November 23, 2013[/tpl]
Among other Broadway musicals for which Schwartz wrote the music are: The Band Wagon (1931), A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (1951), By the Beautiful Sea (1954), The Gay Life (1961), and Jennie (1963). His films include the MGM musical The Band Wagon (1953) with lyricist Howard Dietz.
Schwartz also worked as a producer, for Columbia Pictures. His work includes the musical Cover Girl (1944) and the Cole Porter biographical film Night and Day (1946).[tpl]cite web|website=ArtistDirect.com|title=Artist Bio: Arthur Schwartz|url=http://www.artistdirect.com/artist/bio/arthur-schwartz/490509#GfwB5Uj608TF5MWL.99|accessdate=November 23, 2013[/tpl]
