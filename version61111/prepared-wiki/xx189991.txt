CATEGORIES: 1900 births, 1990 deaths, New Zealand female models

Esther Marion Pretoria James (5 November 1900 â€“ 7 January 1990) was one of New Zealand's first professional fashion models and a keen supporter of "buy nz made." James walked the length of New Zealand in 1931-2 to raise awareness of New Zealand-made goods and improve trade during the depression. She was the first person ever to do this walk from Spirits Bay to Stewart Island and wore only New Zealand-made clothing and shoes. The walk took 6 months.
