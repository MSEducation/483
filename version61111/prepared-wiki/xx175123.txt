Return of the Pride is the fifth studio album featuring original material by White Lion. The album was released in 2008 on March 14 (Europe), April 9 (Japan), April 29 (North America). This is the first original White Lion studio album since their 1991 album Mane Attraction and is the first studio album with the new line up which still features original lead singer Mike Tramp. The album is also a sequel to the band's 1987 album Pride. 
Following the release of the compilation album The Best of White Lion the band was mostly known as Tramp's White Lion or White Lion 2 due to legal reasons with former members but is now once again simply known as White Lion.[tpl]cite web|url=http://heavymetaladdiction.com/2008/07/22/white-lion-return-of-the-pride-2008/|title=White Lion - Return of the Pride |publisher=Heavy Metal addiction|year=2008 |accessdate=2012[/tpl]
