Christopher Douglas "Chris" Haviland (born 27 February 1952) was an Australian politician. Born in Sydney, he was a public servant with the Commonwealth Department of Health. In 1993, he was elected to the Australian House of Representatives as the Labor member for Macarthur, succeeding Stephen Martin, who contested Cunningham instead. In 1996, however, he lost his Labor endorsement and retired from politics.[tpl]cite web|last=Carr|first=Adam|title=Australian Election Archive|work=Psephos, Adam Carr's Election Archive|url=http://psephos.adam-carr.net/countries/a/australia|year=2008|accessdate=2008-05-23|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5QSilacl0 |archivedate = 2007-07-19|deadurl=no[/tpl]
In 2013 he returned as a parliamentary candidate when he was preselected as the ALP candidate for Bradfield in that year's federal election but Bradfield is a safe Liberal seat and as expected Haviland was not successful in taking Bradfield at that election.http://www.abc.net.au/news/federal-election-2013/guide/brfd/http://www.nswalp.com:7000/people/federal-candidates/chris-haviland-(bradfield)/http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/north-shore/labor-announce-ex-macarthur-mp-chris-haviland-as-bradfield-candidate/story-fngr8h9d-1226687589247http://www.tallyroom.com.au/archive/aus2013/bradfield2013
