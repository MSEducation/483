==History==

[tpl]Prose|section|date=May 2014[/tpl]Ellison took inspirationOracle's 30th Anniversary page 26. Retrieved July 16, 2010. from the 1970 paper written by Edgar F. Codd on relational database management systems (RDBMS) named "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks."
He heard about the IBM System R database from an article in the IBM Research Journal provided by Ed Oates (a future co-founder of Oracle). System R also derived from Codd's theories, and Ellison wanted to make Oracle's product compatible with System R, but IBM stopped this by keeping the error codes for their DBMS secret. Ellison co-founded Oracle Corporation in 1977 with Bob Miner and Ed Oates under the name Software Development Laboratories (SDL). In 1979 SDL changed its name to Relational Software, Inc. (RSI).[tpl]cite book | last = Niemiec | first = Richard | title = Oracle9i Performance Tuning Tips & Techniques | publisher=McGraw-Hill/Osborne | location = New York | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-07-222473-8 [/tpl] In 1982, RSI renamed itself Oracle Systems Corporation

In 1995, Oracle Systems Corporation changed its name to Oracle Corporation.Oracle Systems Corporation Renamed Oracle Corporation The company is officially named Oracle, but sometimes referred to as Oracle Corporation, which is in fact the name of the holding company.Frequently Asked Questions | Investor Relations.

Part of Oracle Corporation's early success arose from using the C programming language to implement its products. This eased porting to different operating systems (most of which support C).

===Manageability claim===

Oracle stated in its product announcements that manageability for DBAs had improved from Oracle9i to 10g. Lungu & VatuiuLungu, I., & VÃtuiu, T. (2008). Manageability Comparison: Oracle Database10g and Oracle9i. Annals Of The University Of Petrosani Economics, 8(1), 295-300. assessed the relative manageability by performing common DBA tasks and measuring the time. They performed their tests on a single Pentium CPU (1.7 GHz) with 512 MB RAM,running Windows Server 2000.Summarizing the results from Oracle9i to 10g: Installation improved 36%,Day-to-day Administration 63%, Backup and Recovery 63%, and Performance Diagnostics and Tuning 74% for a weighted Total of 56%. The researcher’s conclusion is that “Oracle10g represents a giant step forward from Oracle9i in making the database easier to use and manage.”

==Products and services==

Oracle designs, manufactures and sells both software and hardware products, as well as offers services complementing them (such as financing, training, consulting and hosting services). Many of the products have been added to Oracle's portfolio through acquisitions.

===Software===

====Databases====

In 2004 Oracle Corporation shipped release 10g (g standing for "grid") as the then latest version of Oracle Database. (Oracle Application Server 10g using Java EE integrates with the server part of that version of the database, making it possible to deploy web-technology applications. The application server comprises the first middle-tier software designed for grid computing.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl] The interrelationship between Oracle 10g and Java allows developers to set up stored procedures written in the Java language, as well as those written in the traditional Oracle database programming language, PL/SQL.) - 
Release 11g became the current Oracle Database version in 2007. Oracle Database 11g Release 2 is the database version currently available, available since September 2009. This version is available in four commercial editions – Enterprise Edition, Standard Edition, Standard Edition One, Personal Edition – and one free edition – the Express Edition. The licensing of these editions shows various restrictions and obligations and is complex.[tpl]cite web|title=Top 60 Licensing Pitfalls For Oracle Databases And Oracle Technology Products|url=http://omtco.eu/references/oracle/top-60-licensing-pitfalls-for-oracle-databases-and-oracle-technology-products/|publisher=OMT-CO Operations Management Technology Consulting GmbH|accessdate=21 April 2013[/tpl] The Enterprise Edition (DB EE), as it is the most expensive of the Database Editions, has the least restrictions – but nevertheless has a complex licensing. The Standard Edition (DB SE) and Standard Edition One (SE1), are constrained by more licensing restrictions, which reflects their lower price.
Release 12c has been made available on the first of July, 2013.[tpl]cite web|title=Oracle Announces General Availability of Oracle Database 12c, the First Database Designed for the Cloud|url=http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/press/1967380|publisher=|accessdate=1 July 2013[/tpl]
The following are additional database technologies that have been acquired and developed by the Oracle Corporation:

[/ref]

====Middleware====

=====Oracle Secure Enterprise Search=====

Oracle Secure Enterprise Search (SES), Oracle's enterprise-search offering, gives users the ability to search for content across multiple locations, including websites, file servers, content management systems, enterprise resource planning systems, customer relationship management systems, business intelligence systems, and databases.

=====Oracle Beehive=====

Released in 2008, the Oracle Beehive collaboration software provides team workspaces (including wikis, team calendaring and file sharing), email, calendar, instant messaging, and conferencing on a single platform. Customers can use Beehive as licensed software or as software as a service ("SaaS").

====Applications====

Oracle also sells a suite of business applications. The Oracle E-Business Suite includes software to perform various enterprise functions related to, for instance, financials, manufacturing, customer relationship management (CRM), enterprise resource planning (ERP) and human resource management.  The Oracle Retail Suite covers the retail industry vertical providing merchandise management, price management, invoice matching, allocations, store operations management, warehouse management, demand forecasting, merchandise financial planning, assortment planning and category management. Users can access these facilities through a browser interface over the Internet or via a corporate intranet.
Following a number of high-value acquisitions beginning in 2003, especially in the area of applications, Oracle Corporation [tpl]As of|2008|alt= currently[/tpl] maintains a number of product lines:
-Oracle has developed a Social Engagement and Monitoring Cloud service that allows businesses to capture relevant brand conversation from global web and social channels to understand what is being said about their product. The Social Engagement and Monitoring cloud provides the most effective and efficient responses across social and customer experience channels. SEM is able to route correct responses to the right team, member, or customer experience channel to ensure the best customer service. The analysis helps to understand what is important to a business’s customers. It identifies trends, spikes, and anomalies to make real time course corrections. It also can identify brand advocates. The SEM cloud identifies customer intention and interests by analyzing the common ways customers talk about a product or a service.oracle.com
Development of applications commonly takes place in Java (using Oracle JDeveloper) or through PL/SQL (using, for example, Oracle Forms and Oracle Reports/BIPublisher). Oracle Corporation has started[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2008[/tpl] a drive toward "wizard"-driven environments with a view to enabling non-programmers to produce simple data-driven applications.

==Marketing==

===Sales practices===

In 1990 Oracle laid off 10% (about 400 people) of its work force because of accounting errors. This crisis came about because of Oracle's "up-front" marketing strategy, in which sales people urged potential customers to buy the largest possible amount of software all at once. The sales people then booked the value of future license sales in the current quarter, thereby increasing their bonuses.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/23/business/truth-or-consequences-hardly.html|author=Ree Abelson|date=June 23, 1996|title=Truth or Consequences? Hardly|work=The New York Times[/tpl] This became a problem when the future sales subsequently failed to materialize. Oracle eventually had to restate its earnings twice, and also settled (out of court) class-action lawsuits arising from its having overstated its earnings. Ellison stated in 1992 that Oracle had made "an incredible business mistake."[ref]Oracle cuts rewards for last-minute deals  Gilbert, Alorie (2002-06-20). CNET News.com via zdnetasia.com
[/ref]

===Competition===

Although IBM dominated the mainframe relational-database market with its DB2 and SQL/DS database products, it delayed[tpl]When|date=June 2009[/tpl]entering the market for a relational database on UNIX and Windows operating systems. This left the door open for Sybase, Oracle, and Informix (and eventually Microsoft) to dominate mid-range and microcomputers.
Around this time[tpl]When|date=June 2009[/tpl], Oracle technology started to lag technically behind that of Sybase.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2008[/tpl] In 1990–1993 Sybase became the fastest-growing database company and the database industry's darling vendor,[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2009[/tpl] but soon fell victim to its merger mania and to technical issues with System X.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2007[/tpl] Sybase's 1993 merger with Powersoft resulted in its losing its focus on its core database technology. In 1993, Sybase sold the rights to its database software running under the Windows operating system to Microsoft Corporation, which [tpl]As of|2008|alt= now[/tpl] markets it under the name "SQL Server."
In 1994, Informix overtook Sybase and became Oracle's most important rival. The intense war between Informix CEO Phil White and Ellison made front-page news in Silicon Valley for three years. Informix claimed that Oracle had hired away Informix engineers to disclose important trade secrets about an upcoming product. Informix finally dropped its lawsuit against Oracle in 1997.[tpl]cite web |work=CNet |url=http://news.cnet.com/Informix-drops-Oracle-lawsuit/2100-1023_3-200353.html |title=Informix drops Oracle lawsuit |last=Galante |first=Suzanne |date=June 9, 1997 [/tpl] In November 2005 a book detailing the war between Oracle and Informix was published, titled The Real Story of Informix Software and Phil White. It gave a detailed chronology of the battle of Informix against Oracle, and how Informix Software's CEO Phil White landed in jail because of his obsession with overtaking Ellison.
Once it had overcome Informix and Sybase, Oracle Corporation enjoyed years of dominance in the database market until use of Microsoft SQL Server became widespread in the late 1990s and IBM acquired Informix Software in 2001 (to complement its DB2 database). [tpl]As of|2008|alt= Today[/tpl] Oracle competes for new database licenses on UNIX, Linux, and Windows operating systems primarily against IBM's DB2 and Microsoft SQL Server (which only runs on Windows). IBM's DB2 [tpl]As of|2008|alt= still[/tpl] dominates the mainframe database market.
In 2004 Oracle's sales grew at a rate of 14.5% to $6.2 billion, giving it 41.3% and the top share of the relational-database market (InformationWeek – March 2005), with market share estimated at up to 44.6% in 2005 by some sources.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oracle.com/corporate/analyst/reports/infrastructure/dbms/idc-201692.pdf |title=Infrastructure | Oracle Analyst Reports |publisher=Oracle.com |date=September 7, 2010 |accessdate=July 7, 2011[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=June 2009[/tpl]
Oracle Corporation's main competitors in the database arena remain IBM DB2 and Microsoft SQL Server, and to a lesser extent Sybase and Teradata[tpl]Dead link|date=June 2009[/tpl], with open-source databases such as PostgreSQL and MySQL also having a significantDB-Engines Ranking - popularity ranking of database management systems. Db-engines.com. Retrieved on 2013-07-14. share of the market. EnterpriseDB, based on PostgreSQL, has [tpl]As of|2008|alt= recently[/tpl] made inroadsVonage places call for EnterpriseDB database  Eric Lai, Nov 20, 2006, computerworld.com by proclaiming that its product delivers Oracle compatibility features[tpl]Clarify|date=February 2009[/tpl] at a much lower price-point.
In the software-applications market, Oracle Corporation primarily[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2008[/tpl] competes against SAP. On March 22, 2007 Oracle sued SAP, accusing them of fraud and unfair competition.
In the market for business intelligence software, many other software companies – small and large – have successfully competed in quality with Oracle and SAP products. Business intelligence vendors can be categorized into the "big four" consolidated BI firms such as Oracle, who has entered BI market through a recent trend of acquisitions (including Hyperion Solutions), and the independent "pure play" vendors such as MicroStrategy, Actuate, and SAS.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bi-verdict.com/fileadmin/FreeAnalyses/consolidations.htm |title=Consolidations in the BI industry |date=March 7, 2008 |last=Pendse |first=Nigel |work=The OLAP Report[/tpl]

====Oracle and SAP====

From 1988 Oracle Corporation and the German company SAP AG had a decade-long history of cooperation, beginning with the integration of SAP's R/3 enterprise application suite with Oracle's relational database products. The marketplace[tpl]Who|date=May 2008[/tpl] regarded the two firms' products as complementing one another, rather than as substitutes. Despite the current SAP partnership with Microsoft, and the increasing integration of SAP applications with Microsoft products (such as Microsoft SQL Server, a competitor to Oracle Database), Oracle and SAP continue their cooperation. According to Oracle Corporation, the majority of SAP's customers use Oracle databases.
In [tpl]As of|2008|alt= recent[/tpl] years, however, competition between Oracle and SAP has increased, and as a result, the rivalry between the two companies has grown, even developing into a feud between the co-founders of the two companies, where one party would frequently voice strong negative comments about the other company.
In 2004 Oracle began to increase its interest in the enterprise-applications market (in 1989, Oracle had already released Oracle Financials). A series of acquisitions by Oracle Corporation began, most notably those of PeopleSoft, Siebel Systems and Hyperion.
SAP recognized that Oracle had started to become a competitor in a market where SAP had the leadership, and saw an opportunity to lure in customers from those companies that Oracle Corporation had acquired. SAP would offer those customers special discounts on the licenses for its enterprise applications.
Oracle Corporation would resort to a similar strategy, by advising SAP customers to get "OFF SAP" (a play on the words of the acronym for its middleware platform "Oracle Fusion for SAP"),Oracle Helping SAP Customers to get "OFF SAP"  Oracle press release, Jun 14, 2005, oracle.com
and also by providing special discounts on licenses and services to SAP customers who chose Oracle Corporation products.
[tpl]As of|2008|alt=Currently[/tpl] Oracle and SAP (the latter through its recently acquired subsidiary TomorrowNow) compete in the third-party enterprise software maintenance and support market. On March 22, 2007, Oracle filed a lawsuit against SAP. In Oracle Corporation v. SAP AG Oracle alleged that TomorrowNow, which provides discount support for legacy Oracle product lines, used the accounts of former Oracle customers to systematically download patches and support documents from Oracle's website and to appropriate them for SAP's use.Oracle sues SAP July 3, 2007 oracle.com
Some analysts have suggested the suit could form part of a strategy by Oracle Corporation to decrease competition with SAP in the market for third-party enterprise software maintenance and support.[ref]

The lawsuit As barometer: SAP finally scores big with TomorrowNow  Joshua Greenbaum, Mar 22, 2007, blogs.ZDNet.com[/ref]
On July 3, 2007, SAP admitted that TomorrowNow employees had made "inappropriate downloads" from the Oracle support web site. However, it claims that SAP personnel and SAP customers had no access to Oracle intellectual property via TomorrowNow. SAP's CEO Henning Kagermann stated that "Even a single inappropriate download is unacceptable from my perspective. We regret very much that this occurred." Additionally, SAP announced that it had "instituted changes" in TomorrowNow's operational oversight.SAP Responds to Oracle Complaint
On November 23, 2010 a U.S. district court jury in Oakland California found that SAP AG must pay Oracle Corp $1.3 billion for copyright infringement, awarding damages that could be the largest-ever for copyright infringement. While admitting liability, SAP estimated the damages at no more than $40 million, while Oracle claimed that they are at least $1.65 billion. The awarded amount is one of the 10 or 20 largest jury verdicts in U.S. legal history. SAP said they were disappointed by the verdict and might appeal.[ref]
</ref> On September 1, 2011, a federal judge overturned the judgment and offered a reduced amount or a new trial, calling Oracle's original award "grossly" excessive.<ref>[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.itworld.com/it-managementstrategy/199445/bulletin-judge-overturns-oracles-13b-award-against-sap|title=Judge overturns Oracle's $1.3B award against SAP|publisher=ITworld|date=September 1, 2011|accessdate=September 5, 2011[/tpl]</ref> Oracle chose a new trial.
On August 3, 2012 SAP and Oracle agreed on a judgment for $306 million in damages, pending approval from the U.S. district court judge, “to save time and expense of a new trial". After the accord has been approved, Oracle can ask a federal appeals court to reinstate the earlier jury verdict. In addition to the damages payment, SAP has already paid Oracle $120 million for its legal fees.

==Controversies==

===Trashgate===

In 2000 Oracle gained attention from the computer industry and the press after hiring private investigators to dig through the trash of organizations involved in an antitrust trial involving Microsoft.[ref]
Oracle Rethinks Its Dumpster-Diving Ways  April 29, 2004, Lisa Vaas, eweek.com[/ref]
The Chairman of Oracle Corporation, Larry Ellison, staunchly defended his company's hiring of an East Coast detective agency to investigate groups that supported rival Microsoft Corporation during its antitrust trial, calling the snooping a "public service." The investigation reportedly included a $1,200 offer to janitors at the Association for Competitive Technology to look through Microsoft's trash. Asked how he'd feel if others were looking into Oracle's business activities, Ellison said: "We will ship our garbage to Redmond, and they can go through it. We believe in full disclosure."[ref]

==="Can break it, can break in"===

At one point, Oracle Corporation marketed many of its products using the slogan "Can't break it, can't break in," or "Unbreakable."[tpl]cite web| title=Bugs bust open 'unbreakable' Oracle 9i |url=http://www.zdnet.co.uk/news/application-development/2002/02/07/bugs-bust-open-unbreakable-oracle-9i-2103903/ | date=February 7, 2002[/tpl] This signifies a demand on information security. Oracle Corporation also stresses the reliability of networked databases and network access to databases as major selling points.
However, two weeks after its introduction in 2002, David Litchfield, Alexander Kornbrust, Cesar Cerrudo and others demonstrated a whole suite of successful attacks against Oracle products.[ref]

===Relationship with John Ashcroft===

In 2004, then-United States Attorney General John Ashcroft sued Oracle Corporation to prevent it from acquiring a multi-billion dollar intelligence contract. After Ashcroft's resignation from government, he founded a lobbying firm, The Ashcroft Group, which Oracle hired in 2005. With the group's help, Oracle went on to acquire the contract.[ref]
