==Early life==

Gowen was diagnosed with cancer as a child, and as a result lost his left leg due to amputation at the age of eight.

==Professional wrestling career==

===Early career===

After being trained by Truth Martini, Gowen made his professional wrestling debut on March 16, 2002, in a loss to Martini. While training Gowen made the decision to wrestle without his prostethetic leg as he found it difficult to wrestle with the "dead weight".

===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2003, 2005, 2006)===

Gowen first gained national exposure wrestling for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling during early 2003 under the name Tenacious Z, but soon left TNA, after signing a developmental contract with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE).
Gowen later returned to TNA on May 15, 2005 at their Hard Justice pay-per-view event, as the second entrant in the 20-Man Gauntlet for the Gold match. He lasted just under five minutes in the ring before being eliminated by Shark Boy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/PPVReports/2005/05/16/1041895.html|title=Styles ends Jarrett's reign at Hard Justice|date=May 16, 2005|last=Clevett|first=Jason|accessdate=April 28, 2012|work=Slam!

===World Wrestling Entertainment (2003â€“2004)===

He made his World Wrestling Entertainment debut on the May 15, 2003 episode of SmackDown! as a planted fan in the audience, who attempted to help Mr. America when he was being attacked by Roddy Piper and Sean O'Haire. During the segment, Piper pulled off Gowen's prosthetic leg.[tpl]cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2003/05/16/88992.html|title=Smackdown!: Mr. America to pay the Piper|date=May 16, 2003|last=Plummer|first=Dale|accessdate=April 28, 2012|work=Slam! Sports|publisher=Canadian Online Explorer[/tpl] This began a short collaboration of Gowen and Mr. America, and a feud pitting the two against Roddy Piper and Sean O'Haire. This storyline culminated at the Judgment Day pay-per-view when Mr. America, accompanied by Gowen, defeated Piper, who was accompanied by O'Haire.[tpl]cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2003/05/19/90523.html|title=J-Day just pure vomit|date=May 19, 2003|last=Powell|first=John|accessdate=April 28, 2012|work=Slam! Sports|publisher=Canadian Online Explorer[/tpl]
Gowen's partnership with Mr. America put him on bad terms with Mr. McMahon, as McMahon was convinced Mr. America was Hulk Hogan in disguise.[tpl]cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2003/05/23/94254.html|title=Smackdown!: Mr. McMahon outsmarts Mr. America|date=May 23, 2003|last=Plummer|first=Dale|accessdate=April 28, 2012|work=Slam!

Sports|publisher=Canadian Online Explorer[/tpl] On the June 26 episode of SmackDown!, McMahon told Gowen that if he would join his "Kiss My Ass Club", he would be awarded a WWE contract. Instead Gowen attacked McMahon.[tpl]cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2003/06/27/121353.html|title=Smackdown!: Vince makes Zach a deal|date=June 27, 2003|last=Plummer|first=Dale|accessdate=April 28, 2012|work=Slam! Sports|publisher=Canadian Online Explorer[/tpl] As a result, Gowen and Stephanie McMahon were put in a match against The Big Show, in what McMahon billed as the first "real" handicap match (referring to Gowen and his amputee status in addition to the two vs. one parameters of the match). With help from both Kurt Angle and Brock Lesnar, Gowen and Stephanie McMahon defeated the Big Show, winning Gowen a contract.[tpl]cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2003/07/04/127013.html|title=Smackdown!: Dream comes true for Gowan|date=July 4, 2003|last=Clevett|first=Jason|accessdate=April 28, 2012|work=Slam!

====Juggalo Championship Wrestling (2007â€“2008; 2011â€“present)====

Gowen debuted in Juggalo Championship Wrestling as a part of their 2007 internet wrestling show SlamTV!.[tpl]cite video|date=September 18, 2007|title=JCW SLAM TV, Volume 1|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1194583|medium=DVD|publisher=Psychopathic Video|location=Royal Oak, Michigan|accessdate=June 6, 2008[/tpl] Initially a villain, his hard work ethic and wrestling abilities earned him the respect of the juggalo audience, per storyline. Following a failed attempt to win the JCW Heavyweight Championship from then-champion Trent Acid, Gowen formed the tag team Pimp & Gimp Connection with Human Tornado.[tpl]cite video|date=October 30, 2007|title=JCW SLAM TV, Volume 2|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1194584/|medium=DVD|publisher=Psychopathic Video|location=Royal Oak, Michigan|accessdate=June 6, 2008[/tpl] The team made an immediate impact and earned themselves a spot in the 8 Team Tag-Team Elimination match for the JCW Tag Team Championship at Bloodymania. They failed to capture the championship after Gowen was eliminated by Doug Basham.
In the following season, Zach formed a tag team with Conrad Kennedy to compete in the JCW Tag Team Tournament for the vacant championship.[tpl]cite episode|title=Slam TV Season 2 â€“ Episode 1|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1ph1KX5BiQ|series=SlamTV!|credits=Creator and Producer: Insane Clown Posse|city=Toledo, Ohio|airdate=June 16, 2008|season=2 [/tpl] Tornado, though, saw villainous manager Scott D'Amore leaving Kennedy's dressing room and grew suspicious.[tpl]cite episode|title=Slam TV Season 2 â€“ Episode 2|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5CKy3xgU3k|series=SlamTV!|credits=Creator and Producer: Insane Clown Posse|city=Evansville, Indiana|airdate=July 17, 2008|season=2[/tpl] Two weeks later, Kennedy attacked Gowen after the team lost their match against The Bloody Brothers.

Zach returned to the company on March 23, 2011, where he defeated Jimmy Jacobs. He formed a tag team at Up in Smoke with U-Gene, who believed that he could be Gowen's second leg. Though U-Gene cost his team the match by distracting the referee, Gowen forgave him and announced that the team would wrestle again at the next event. On July 28, Gowen and U-Gene defeated the Ring Rydas to win the JCW Tag Team Championship.[tpl]cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/otherppvs/article_51746.shtml|title=Radican's JCW "F--- The Police" iPPV coverage 7/28: U-Gene & Zack Gowen, Rhino, Cabana, Sabu & Raven|last=Radican|first=Sean|date=July 28, 2011|publisher=Pro Wrestling Torch|accessdate=July 29, 2011[/tpl] However, Gowen forfeited the championship after realizing that U-Gene cheated to win, causing U-Gene to attack him and disband the team. Both men wrestled each other at Bloodymania 5, with Gowen emerging victorious after U-Gene was caught cheating again.
