[[List of anarchist communities]]

CATEGORIES: Anarchist communities, Anarchism lists

This is a list of anarchist communities, representing any society or portion thereof founded by anarchists, that functions according to anarchist philosophy and principles. Anarchists have been involved in a wide variety of community experiments since the 19th century.
There are numerous instances in which a community organizes itself along philosophically anarchist lines, to promote regional anarchist movements, counter-economics, and countercultures. These have included intentional communities founded by anarchists as social experiments, and community oriented projects, such as collective organizations and cooperative businesses. However, there are only a few instances of mass society "anarchies" that have come about from explicitly anarchist revolutions, including the Free Territory of Ukraine, and the Shinmin autonomous region in Manchuria.
