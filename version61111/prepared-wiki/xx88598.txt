Yuzhny ([tpl]lang-ru|Южный, Southern[/tpl]) is the southern island of the Novaya Zemlya archipelago, lying north of Russia.  It has an area of [tpl]convert|33275|km2|sqmi|-2[/tpl], which while smaller than the northern island of Severny, makes it one of the largest islands in the world. It is separated from Severny Island by the narrow Matochkin Strait, which is covered with ice most of the year. West of Yuzhny Island lies the Barents Sea, and to the east the Kara Sea.
Originally home to the Nenets people, the island was largely evacuated in the 1950s to make way for nuclear tests.[tpl]cite web | title=Nuclear Explosions in the USSR: The North Test Site Reference Material | publisher=The Division of Nuclear Safety and Security: International Atomic Energy Agency |url=http://www-ns.iaea.org/downloads/rw/waste-safety/north-test-site-final.pdf| date=December 2004 | accessdate=March 14, 2012[/tpl]
