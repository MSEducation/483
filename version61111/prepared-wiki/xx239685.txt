He was succeeded by a series of distinguished Soviet musical giants that has included Nikolai Anosov (1945 – 1950) and Leo Ginzburg(1950 – 1954), Mikhail Terian (1954 – 1960) and Veronica Dudarova (1960 – 1989). Owing to the collaboration with such figures the orchestra became one of most prominent national symphonic ensembles, but in the first place it was known by the performances of Russian and Soviet classical music, involving many premieres of Nikolai Myaskovsky, Sergei Prokofiev, Dmitri Shostakovich, Reinhold Gliere.  
The Moscow State Symphony Orchestra becomes renowned around the globe under the leadership of  Pavel Kogan. In 1989 Maestro was engaged as Music Director and Chief Conductor and immediately enriched the orchestra repertoire by the works of European and American musical literature.

Strauss, Mendelssohn, Mahler, Bruckner, Sibelius, Dvorak, Tchaikovsky, Glazunov, Rachmaninov, Prokofiev, Shostakovich, Scriabin, Berlioz, Debussy, and Ravel. The orchestra wide-ranging programs balance great orchestral, operatic, and choral classics with equally significant music of the 21st century, lots of many forgotten and neglected pieces.
It plays some 100 concerts annually. Along with the series in the Great Hall of the Moscow Conservatory and in Tchaikovsky Concert Hall, the Moscow State Symphony Orchestra performs in the Great Hall of the Saint-Petersburg D.D. Shostakovich Philharmonic Society and at the stages of the other Russian cities, as well as on tours abroad. The MSSO constantly appears in 59 countries, holding the major musical centers of the world, such as USA, Great Britain, Japan, Spain, Austria, Italy, Germany, France, South Korea, Australia, China and Switzerland.
