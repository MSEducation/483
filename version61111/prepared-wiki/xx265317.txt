CATEGORIES: 2011 National Football League season by team, Minnesota Vikings seasons

The 2011 Minnesota Vikings season was the franchise's 51st season in the National Football League, and the first full season under head coach Leslie Frazier, who served as the team's interim head coach for the final six games of the 2010 season. It was also supposed to mark the first season with new starting quarterback Donovan McNabb, however, he was benched in Week 6 in favor of rookie Christian Ponder, and McNabb was later waived on December 1, 2011. The team failed to improve on their 6–10 record from 2010, stumbling out of the gate, going 2–6 before their bye week, before being eliminated from playoff contention in week 12 with a 2–9 record. The team also suffered its first six-game losing streak since the 1984 season. Despite a poor year for the team, Jared Allen set a franchise record for most sacks in a season with 22. The team led the league in sacks with 50, but also tied a team record for fewest interceptions caught in a season with only 8.
