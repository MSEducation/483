The City of Mandurah is a local government area of Western Australia. It covers an area of approximately 174 km² in the Peel region of Western Australia just beyond the southern boundary of metropolitan Perth, and lies about 75 km south of the Perth central business district. 
It is bordered by the City of Rockingham to the north, Shire of Murray to the east (the border being for the most part the Harvey Estuary and Serpentine River), and Shire of Waroona to the south.

==History==

The area that is now Mandurah was part of the Murray district until 1949. In that year, it split away to form the Mandurah Road District,[tpl]Gazette WA|file=P.W. 400/48|date=20 April 1949|page=1949:904|title=Road Districts Act 1919-1945 - Formation of the Mandurah Road District[/tpl] and held its first meeting on 1 September 1949. The council was suspended on 12 July 1956 by an Order in Council and placed under the administration of Commissioner Richard Rushton, who ultimately served in the role for almost four years.[tpl]Gazette WA|file=L.G.D. 259/56|page=1956:1724|date=13 July 1956|title=Road Districts Act 1919-1954 - Mandurah Road District - Appointment of Commissioner - Order in Council[/tpl]
After the Local Government Act 1960 came into being, it became the Shire of Mandurah on 1 July 1961. It gained town status on 1 July 1987 and city status on 14 April 1990.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mandurah.wa.gov.au/news/documents/information_statement.pdf/file/at_download|title=City of Mandurah Information Statement|author=City of Mandurah|date=31 January 2004|accessdate=2006-11-01[/tpl]
