==History==

The legal department at Howard University opened on January 6, 1869.Harriet Jackson Scarupa, The Howard School of Law. 125 Years of Changing Lives. . .And the Nation. Nat’l B.A. Mag., Nov./Dec., 1994, at 9. The founders of Howard Law recognized “a great need to train lawyers who would have a strong commitment to helping black Americans secure and protect their newly established rights” during the country’s tumultuous Reconstruction era.History of Howard School of Law, http://www.law.howard.edu/19 (last visited April 17, 2013) The year the legal department was opened, the school declared a nondiscriminatory admissions policy.J. Clay Smith, Jr., Emancipation: The Making of the Black Lawyer 1844–1944, 54 (1993). It was the first school to declare such a policy and Howard admitted white male and female students along with black students from its opening. In the 20th century, it became not only a school, but also the embodiment of legal activism. It emerged as a "clinic" on justice and injustice in America, as well as a clearinghouse for information on the civil rights struggle.

==Classes and first graduates==

The first class consisted of six students, all black men, who met three evenings a week in the homes and offices of the four teachers.Harriet Jackson Scarupa, The Howard School of Law. 125 Years of Changing Lives. . .And the Nation. Nat’l B.A. Mag., Nov./Dec., 1994, at 9. Classes were held in various locations throughout the years before the law school settled into its current location at 2900 Van Ness Street, N.W., in 1974.History of Howard School of Law, http://www.law.howard.edu/19 (last visited April 17, 2013).

==Women in the History of Howard Law== 
Howard Law was the first school in the nation to have a nondiscriminatory admissions policy.J. Clay Smith, Jr., Emancipation: The Making of the Black Lawyer 1844–1944, 54 (1993). The school admitted white male and female students along with black students from its opening. It was a progressive policy at the time to admit women, but despite this, only eight women graduated from Howard Law during the entire first thirty years of its existence.Virginia G. Drachman, Sisters in Law: Women Lawyers in Modern American History, 45 (1998). The nation’s first black woman lawyer, Charlotte E. Ray, was a graduate of Howard’s law program. Despite Howard University’s policy of nondiscrimination, it is reported that Charlotte applied to the law program using her initials as a ruse to disguise her gender because she was “aware of the school’s reluctant commitment to the principle of sexual equality.”Virginia G. Drachman, Sisters in Law: Women Lawyers in Modern American History, 45 (1998). Ray was admitted in 1869 and graduated in 1872. 
Another woman claimed to have been admitted to Howard’s law program prior to Ray.  Mary Ann Shadd Carey claimed to have been admitted in 1869, but was barred from graduating on time because of her gender.  Carey graduated in 1883, making her the second black woman to do so.Lelia J. Robinson, Women Lawyers in the United States, II The Green Bag 28 (Horace W. Fuller, ed.) (1890). 
Eliza A. Chambers was an early white female graduate of Howard’s law program.  Chambers was admitted in 1885 and successfully completed the three year course of study.  However, “the Law School faculty refused to hand in Eliza’s name to the examiners, for admission to practice, omitting her from the list of her male classmates whom they recommended, simply because she was a woman.”Lelia J. Robinson, Women Lawyers in the United States, II The Green Bag 28 (Horace W. Fuller, ed.) (1890).
