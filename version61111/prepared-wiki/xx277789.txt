The Zamboanga City Council (Chavacano: Consejo de la Ciudad de Zamboanga) is Zamboanga City's Sangguniang Panlungsod or local legislature. 
Composed of 18 members, with 16 councilors elected from Zamboanga City's two legislative districts and two members composed of the President of the Liga ng mga Barangay ng Lungsod ng Zamboanga (English: League of Barangays of the City of Zamboanga) and the President of the Pederasyon ng Sangguniang Kabataan (English: Federation of Youth Councils). 
The presiding officer of the council is the Vice Mayor, who is elected citywide.
The council is responsible for creating laws and ordinances under Zamboanga City's jurisdiction. The mayor can veto proposed bills, but the council can override it with a two-thirds supermajority.

==Evolution==

The first legislative body of Zamboanga was established in 1914 composed of councilors who represented the different districts of barrios of then-municipality of Zamboanga. When the City Charter of Zamboanga was signed on October 12, 1936, the municipal council was replaced by the City Council presided by the mayor and consisted of five councilors, the city treasurer and the city engineer. All members are appointed by the President of the Philippine Commonwealth.
With the passage of Republic Act No. 1210 on April 29, 1955, the position of mayor became elective and the post of vice-mayor was created. The Council also became elective and its membership was increased to eight presided by the vice-mayor.
During the Marcos regime, the city council was renamed to Sangguniang Panglungsod and its membership shuffled. The mayor became the presiding-officer while the vice-mayor became a regular member. Other representatives such as the agriculture, business and labor sectoral representatives; chairman of the Kabataan Barangay Federation and the president of the Association of Barangay Captains was added to the council. All members of the council except for the mayor and the vice-mayor are all appointed by the President
After Marcos was deposed, a new Local Government Code was enacted in 1991 and the mayor was restored to the executive branch. The city council organization existed since.

==Manner of election==

Each of Zamboanga City's two legislative districts elects eight councilors to the council. In plurality-at-large voting, a voter may vote up to eight candidates, with the candidates having the eight highest number of votes being elected. In addition, the Barangay chairmen and the SK chairmen throughout the city elect amongst themselves their representatives to the council. Hence, there are 18 councilors.
City council elections are synchronized with other elections in the country. Elections are held every first Monday of May every third year since 1992.
