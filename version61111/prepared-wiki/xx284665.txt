==Design and development==

The X2 was designed to comply with the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale microlight category and the US light-sport aircraft rules. It is listed on the Federal Aviation Administration's list of accepted SLSAs.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.sportpilot.org/learn/slsa/|title = EAA's Listing of Special Light-Sport Aircraft|accessdate = 11 August 2013|last = Experimental Aircraft Association|year = 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url = http://www.faa.gov/aircraft/gen_av/light_sport/media/SLSA_Directory.xls|title = SLSA Make/Model Directory|accessdate = 11 August 2013|last = Federal Aviation Administration|date = 15 July 2013[/tpl]
The X2 features a strut-braced hang glider-style high-wing, weight-shift controls, a two-seats-in-tandem open cockpit with a cockpit fairing, tricycle landing gear with wheel pants and a single engine in pusher configuration.
The aircraft is made from bolted-together aluminum tubing, with its double surface wing covered in Dacron sailcloth. Its [tpl]convert|9.6|m|ft|1|abbr=on[/tpl] span wing is supported by struts and uses an "A" frame weight-shift control bar. The SLSA's powerplant is a twin cylinder, liquid-cooled, two-stroke, dual-ignition [tpl]convert|64|hp|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl] Rotax 582 engine. Other engines are available for the kit-built versions, including the four cylinder, air and liquid-cooled, four-stroke, dual-ignition [tpl]convert|80|hp|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl] Rotax 912UL and the [tpl]convert|60|hp|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl] HKS 700E engine. With the Rotax 582 engine the aircraft has an empty weight of [tpl]convert|450|lb|kg|0|abbr=on[/tpl] and a gross weight of [tpl]convert|1060|lb|kg|0|abbr=on[/tpl], giving a useful load of [tpl]convert|610|lb|kg|0|abbr=on[/tpl].
A number of different wings can be fitted to the basic carriage, including the North Wing Apache 3 or the North Wing Quest GT5. The North Wing M-Pulse 2 was formerly the standard wing.
