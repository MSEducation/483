Barnard Point is a headland which marks the south-east side of the entrance to False Bay on the south side of Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica.  It is situated on Rozhen Peninsula, [tpl]convert|1.5|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] north-north-west of Botev Point and [tpl]convert|6.6|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] south-east of Miers Bluff (British mapping in 1968, and Bulgarian in 2005 and 2009).

==History==

The point was known to sealers as early as 1822.  The name was applied about a century later, probably after Mount Barnard (now Mount Friesland) which surmounts it to the north-east. Charles H. Barnard, captain of the ship Charity of New York, was a sealer in the South Shetlands in 1820–21.

==Important Bird Area==

The site has been identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports a large breeding colony of Chinstrap Penguins (13,000 pairs), as well as about 30 pairs of Southern Giant Petrels.  The 175 ha IBA comprises the ice-free area at the point, which rises to a height of over 250 m at its easternmost extent.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.birdlife.org |title= Barmard Point, Livingston Island|accessdate=2012-12-09 |work= BirdLife data zone: Important Bird Areas |first= |last= |publisher= BirdLife International |date= 2012[/tpl]
