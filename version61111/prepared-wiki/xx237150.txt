First Premier Bank, headquartered in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, is the 10th largest issuer of Visa and MasterCard brand credit cards in the United States.http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-10-19/americas-worst-credit-card-first-premier-banks-dubious-distinction/?cid=hp:beastoriginalsL3 The bank is known for specializing in a wide range of subprime credit cards that are marketed to individuals with "less than perfect" credit.
In 2007, the bank settled a case with the New York Attorney General who claimed the bank used deceptive practices to market its credit cards. The bank paid $4.5 million as part of the deal.http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-10-19/americas-worst-credit-card-first-premier-banks-dubious-distinction/?cid=hp:beastoriginalsL3
In October 2010, the bank was cited for providing the nation's worst credit cards by the Consumers Union.http://www.consumersunion.org/pub/core_financial_services/016976.html The group reported the bank charged as much as 59% interest on credit cards limited to $300. These cards are marketed under the names Centennial and Aventium as well as First Premier. 
As of December 2010, Premier Bank was reportedly offering a credit card with a 79.9% interest rate and a $300 limit.  This 
was cited by Senator Bernie Sanders as an example of what he called "extortion and loan sharking". [ref]http://www.c-span.org/Watch/Media/2010/12/10/HP/A/41780/Sen+Sanders+Held+a+Tax+Cut+Filibuster.aspx

As of August 2011, Premier Bank is offering a credit card with a 49.9% interest rate and a $300 limit.  Additionally, it requires a security deposit of $95, and a $75 annual fee the first year.  After the first year, the annual fee becomes $45 and a $6.50 monthly servicing fee is added (a total of $125 in fees annually).  Cash advances are charged a minimum fee of $6 and limited to 10% of the total credit limit for at least the first 90 days.  Any credit limit increases are charged a limit increase fee of 25% the amount of the increase, and increases may happen automatically after the first 13 months, though the customer may request the automatic increase be reversed within 30 days and the fee will be refunded.  The contract also allows Premier Bank or any third party it chooses to contact customers via cell phone or text message even if the number was obtained without the consumer's consent via a third party.https://www.applyformypremier.com/CardDetails.aspx?appid=GY1108061548D3W9R retrieved 8-6-2011
