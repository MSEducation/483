Child's Ercall is a village and civil parish in Shropshire, England. It is located in a rather remote rural area between the small towns of Market Drayton and Newport: the civil parish had a total population of 599 at the 2001 census.Child's Ercall CP, Office for National Statistics The closest neighbouring village is Ollerton, around 1 mile to the west.
Its name is thought to derive from a Celtic word, perhaps the old Welsh name Ercal,Gelling, M. The place-names of Shropshire, pt.1, English Place-Name Society, 1990, pp.125-6 along with "child" in its mediaeval sense, meaning "knight".Raven, M. A Guide to Shropshire, 2005, p.50 The parish is sometimes referred to as Ercall Parva, which turned into "Little Ercall". This name saved it from confusion with the other Ercall in Shropshire - Ercall Magna, now called "High Ercall". The change from use of the names Ercall Magna and Ercall Parva to High Ercall and Little and later Child's Ercall, better suggests that the use of the term "Child's" merely alludes to it being 'Little' like a child, compared to the 'adult' High(er) Ercall, rather than any link to a term for a young knight.
The village church has a 12th-century doorway, a 13th-century arcade and 14th-century aisle, as well as stained glass by Charles Eamer Kempe.
Childs Ercall Football Club are a member of the Mercian Regional League Division 2 and play their home games in the village.
