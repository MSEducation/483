The German newspaper Die Rote Fahne ("The Red Flag") was created on 9 November 1918 by Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg in Berlin, first as organ of the left wing revolutionary Spartakusbund. After the founding of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) on 1 January 1919, it became the central publication of the party, until 1933. Outlawed after the end of the Weimar Republic and the Reichstag fire in 1933, it was illegally distributed during the Nazi dictatorship by underground groups close to the Communist Party until 1942. 
Since the 1970s, a number of projects by different left-wing socialist groupings or small parties tried to publish Die Rote Fahne again. At present, at least two internet publications use the name, each claiming to be the successor of the historical newspaper.
