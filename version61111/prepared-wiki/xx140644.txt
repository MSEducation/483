A few of the events occurring under her administration:

==Retirement==

DeFleur resigned in July 2010 to focus on her personal life.
DefLeur retired when it became clear that details of her unethical conduct  would soon become public. It is widely accepted that she resigned in complete disgrace. Her announcement on January 13, 2010 coincided with the announcement that an outside audit, one that resulted in the Kaye Report, would be conducted to explore impropriety as it pertained to the basketball scandal. The scathing report revealed a host ethical violations even though it was limited to those associated with athletics.  http://www.hhpcommunities.com/sportmanagement/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=272:current-issues-update-march-30&catid=34:colligiate-athletics&Itemid=28               http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304370304575151704097966286http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2010/02/12/binghamton#sthash.EO75pGjq.dpbs
