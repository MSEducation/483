Fallon released a statement through the band's Facebook page saying "Dear friends, this week I've learned that a childhood injury to the neck, a genetic predisposition for spinal disease, and 20 some years of head banging will exact a toll. I've been diagnosed with an ugly case of cervical spinal stenosis and two herniated discs." Fallon was set to have surgery on September 17, 2013 and the band is expected to resume their tour sometime in October.
Fallon currently lives in Silver Spring, MD with his family.http://www.fredericknewspost.com/arts_and_entertainment/arts_and_entertainment_topics/music/article_8db45ae3-1e55-50f4-9b4c-b8c68b21f8a5.html
