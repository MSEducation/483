In logic, inference is the process of deriving logical conclusions from premises known or assumed to be true. In checking a logical inference for formal and material validity, the meaning of only its logical vocabulary and of both its logical and extra-logical vocabulary 
is considered, respectively.

==Examples==

For example, the inference "Socrates is a human, and each human must eventually die, therefore Socrates must eventually die" is a formally valid inference; it remains valid if the nonlogical vocabulary "Socrates", "is human", and "must eventually die" is arbitrarily, but consistently replaced.
A completely fictitious, but formally valid inference obtained by consistent replacement is e.g. "Buckbeak is a unicorn, and each unicorn has gills, therefore Buckbeak has gills".
In contrast, the inference "Montreal is north of New York, therefore New York is south of Montreal" is materially valid only; its validity relies on the extra-logical relations "is north of" and "is south of" being converse to each other. 
A completely fictitious, but materially (and formally) invalid inference obtained by consistent replacement is e.g. "Hagrid is younger than Albus, therefore Albus is larger than Hagrid". Consistent replacement doesn't respect conversity.

==Material inferences vs. enthymemes==

Classical formal logic considers the above "north/south" inference as an enthymeme, that is, as an incomplete inference; it can be made formally valid by supplementing the tacitly used conversity relationship explicitly: "Montreal is north of New York, and whenever a location x is north of a location y, then y is south of x; therefore New York is south of Montreal".
In contrast, the notion of a material inference has been developed by Wilfrid Sellars [tpl]cite book| author=Wilfrid Sellars| title=Inference and Meaning| year=1980| pages=261f| publisher=| editor=J.

==Non-monotonic inference==

Robert Brandom adopted Sellars' view,[tpl]cite book| author=Robert Brandom| title=Articulating Reasons: An Introduction to Inferentialism| year=2000| publisher=Harvard University Press| isbn=0-674-00158-3[/tpl]; Sect. 2.III-IV arguing that everyday (practical) reasoning is usually non-monotonic, i.e. additional premises can turn a practically valid inference into an invalid one, e.g.
Therefore, practically valid inference is different from formally valid inference (which is monotonic - the above argument that Socrates must eventually die cannot be challenged by whatever additional information), and should better be modelled by materially valid inference. While a classical logician could add a ceteris paribus clause to 1. to make it usable in formally valid inferences:
However, Brandom doubts that the meaning of such a clause can be made explicit, and prefers to consider it as a hint to non-monotony rather than a miracle drug to establish monotony.
Moreover, the "match" example shows that a typical everyday inference can hardly be ever made formally complete. In a similar way, Lewis Carroll's dialogue "What the Tortoise Said to Achilles" demonstrates that the attempt to make every inference fully complete can lead to an infinite regression.[tpl]cite journal |author=Carroll, Lewis |title=What the Tortoise Said to Achilles |journal=Mind, n.s. |volume=4 |issue=14 |date=Apr 1895 |pages=278â€“280 |url=http://courseweb.stthomas.edu/kwkemp/logic/R/Tortoise.pdf[/tpl]
