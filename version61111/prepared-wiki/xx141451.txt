==History==

The site has been occupied by four buildings named Colston Hall since the 1860s.History of Colston Hall (1200s–1800s), Official Web Site
In the thirteenth century, the site was occupied by a Carmelite friary, known as Whitefriars. Subsequently, the location held a large Tudor-era mansion known as the Great House, used by Queen Elizabeth I in 1574 on a visit to the city. In 1707, Edward Colston established the Colston Boys' School in this building, which was acquired by the Colston Hall Company in 1861. Colston Hall opened as a concert venue on 20 September 1867.
The architects were the prolific Bristol firm of Foster & Wood, working in the Bristol Byzantine style.[tpl]cite web | title=The Colston Hall  | work=Philharmonic Orchestra | url=http://www.philharmonia.co.uk/concerts/venues/colstonhall/?PHPSESSID=pf74fnqnv263gd70u | accessdate=19 May 2007[/tpl]
It has been designated by English Heritage as a grade II listed building.[tpl]cite web | title=The Colston Hall  | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=379355 | accessdate=13 March 2007[/tpl]
Most of the building was damaged during a fire on 1 September 1898; the auditorium suffered immense structural damage, and the interior was more or less destroyed. The second hall opened in 1901,History of Colston Hall (1900s–1930s), Official Web Site
and in 1919, the Corporation of Bristol purchased it from the Colston Hall Company. The City Council continues to manage the hall. The second hall was closed for remodelling in 1935.
In December 1936, the third hall was opened.
This survived the Luftwaffe air raids of the Second World War, but was burned down in 1945 after a discarded cigarette started a fire.History of Colston Hall (1940s), Official Web Site
The hall was rebuilt once more, and the fourth reopened in 1951 to mark the Festival of Britain.History of Colston Hall (1950s), Official Web Site
The first computerised booking system was installed in February 1983,[tpl]cite web | url= http://www.colstonhall.org/aboutthehall/history/history7 | publisher= Colston Hall | title=History of Colston Hall 1960s | accessdate= 27 April 2010[/tpl]
and a £500,000 modernisation programme was conducted at the start of the 1990s, which included extensive rewiring, and various backstage improvements.History of Colston Hall (1990s), Official Web Site
The installation of removable seating in the front half of the stalls in 2005
improved the hall as a venue for pop concerts, providing space for fans to move around and dance in front of the stage; it also increased the overall capacity of the auditorium.
Campaigners, many from the city’s Afro-Caribbean community, have called for the hall’s name to be changed because of Edward Colston’s link to the slave trade, much of his wealth having come from that trade, and his investments in the Royal African Company. The Bristol group Massive Attack vowed not to play at the venue while it retained its present name.Jamie Doward, "How Bristol's gracious mansions mask the shameful past of Britain's links to slavery", The Observer, 12 January 2014. The proposal sparked a heated controversy in the pages of the local press, although the majority of letters printed favoured retaining the Colston name.
From 2007 to 2009, the Colston Hall underwent extensive refurbishment with the construction of a new foyer alongside the present building, topped by a wind turbine.[tpl]cite news | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/7887608.stm | publisher= BBC News | title= Roof-top turbine for music venue | date= 13 February 2009 | accessdate= 23 February 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/bristol/hi/people_and_places/arts_and_culture/newsid_8262000/8262409.stm | publisher= BBC News | title= In pictures: Colston Hall foyer | accessdate= 23 February 2011 | date= 18 September 2009[/tpl]
