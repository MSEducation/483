Porter Goss, in his early 2005 summary to the Select Intelligence Committee, spoke of the continuing radical Islamist threat. He observed an extremist killed a prominent Dutch citizen. 
Also in 2005 an agency employee "forgot" to inform the Dutch intelligence service of an ongoing 
operation concerning nuclear proliferation, in the Netherlands.
Due to this, the Dutch intelligence service AIVD made the employee a persona non-grata in the Netherlands, and was asked to leave the country. [ref]
