Stein Huysegems ([tpl]IPA-nl|ˈstɛi̯n ˈɦœy̆.zə.ˌʝɛms[/tpl]) (born 16 June 1982) is a Belgian attacker who plays for the Wellington Phoenix in the A-League.

==Career==

He started his career at Belgian club Lierse SK, and has also played for the Dutch Eredivisie powerhouses like AZ, Feyenoord and FC Twente.
On 16 January 2009, Huysegems signed a contract at K.R.C. Genk lasting until 30 June 2013. 
In September 2010, he went out on loan until the end of the season to the Dutch Eredivisie club Roda JC, but his deal was terminated on 22 March 2011. Before the start of the 2011-12 season of the Belgian Pro League, he was deemed surplus to requirements at Genk and his contract was terminated by mutual consent. Some weeks later, he signed an achievement based one-year contract with Lierse on 3 September 2011. As the contract between Genk and Huysegems had not been terminated before 30 June 2011, the Royal Belgian Football Association ruled that he was not allowed to play for his new team before 2012, causing him to be sidelined for almost 5 months, earning only a basic wage without bonuses.
On the 14th of September 2012 he was signed by Wellington Phoenix of New Zealand playing in the A-League.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.footballaustralia.com.au/news-display/Phoenix-sign-Belgian-striker/49110|title=Phoenix sign Belgian striker|date=14 September 2012|publisher=Football Federation Australia|accessdate=15 September 2012[/tpl] Huysegems scored on his Wellington Phoenix debut on 6 October 2012 in a 2-0 home win over Sydney FC in the opening game of the season. He increased his tally to three goals after four games - scoring away to Adelaide United and at home against the Brisbane Roar. Huysegems lost his form somewhat during the middle of the season, but rediscovered it later on. He broke his goal scoring drought on March 17, 2013, the second-to-last game of the season, with a header that saw the Phoenix beat Perth Glory 2-1. Huysegems scored his fifth goal for the Phoenix in his last match of the season vs. Melbourne Victory from a well-controlled chested volley.
Huysegems is currently in his second year for the Phoenix in the 2013–14 A-League. Huysegems has so far scored 9 goals in 18 games in the 2013-14 season, including a double in a match-winning performance away to Western Sydney Wanderers. Huysegems was released by the Wellington Phoenix on 13th April 2014 after the club would not offer a two year deal to Huysegems, stating they would only offer him a one year deal, which both parties couldn't agree to, so Huysegems and the Phoenix both parted ways

==International==

Huysegems has represented the Belgium national football team 16 times.
