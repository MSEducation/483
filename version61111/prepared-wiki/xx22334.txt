==History==

It is generally accepted that dry ice was first observed in 1835 by French inventor Adrien-Jean-Pierre Thilorier (1790-1844), who published the first account of the substance.[tpl]cite journal|title = Solidification de l'Acide carbonique|author = Thilorier|journal = Comptes rendus|volume = 1|year = 1835|pages = 194–196|language = French|url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k29606/f194.table [/tpl]  See also:  "Solidification of carbonic acid," The London and Edinburgh Philosophical Magazine, 8 : 446-447 (1836).[ref]Note:
In 1925, this solid form of CO2 was trademarked by the DryIce Corporation of America as "Dry ice", thus leading to its common name.[tpl]Cite book| title = The Trade-mark Reporter| publisher = United States Trademark Association| year = 1930| issue = v. 20| isbn = 1-59888-091-8[/tpl]
That same year the DryIce Co. sold the substance commercially for the first time; marketing it for refrigerating purposes.
The alternative name "Cardice" is a registered trademark of Air Liquide UK Ltd.[tpl]cite web|title = Case details for Trade Mark 516211|publisher = UK Intellectual Property Office|url = http://www.ipo.gov.uk/domestic?domesticnum=516211|accessdate = 2009-07-25[/tpl] It is sometimes written as "card ice".[tpl]Harvnb|Treloar|2003|p=175[/tpl]

==Manufacture==

Dry ice is easily manufactured.[tpl]cite web|publisher = Continental Carbonic Products, Inc.|title = What is Dry Ice?|url =http://www.continentalcarbonic.com/dryice/|accessdate = 2009-07-26[/tpl][tpl]cite web|publisher = Universal Industrial Gases, Inc.|title = Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Properties, Uses, Applications: CO2 Gas and Liquid Carbon Dioxide|url =http://www.uigi.com/carbondioxide.html|accessdate = 2009-07-26[/tpl] First, gases with a high concentration of carbon dioxide are produced. Such gases can be a byproduct of another process, such as producing ammonia from nitrogen and natural gas, or large-scale fermentation. Second, the carbon dioxide-rich gas is pressurized and refrigerated until it liquifies. Next, the pressure is reduced. When this occurs some liquid carbon dioxide vaporizes, causing a rapid lowering of temperature of the remaining liquid. As a result, the extreme cold causes the liquid to solidify into a snow-like consistency. Finally, the snow-like solid carbon dioxide is compressed into either small pellets or larger blocks of dry ice.Good plant design and operation for onshore carbon capture installations and onshore pipelines. The Energy Institute. London. September 2010. p. 10
A common teaching laboratory demonstration for the production of dry ice is to use a carbon dioxide fire extinguisher with a porous fabric collecting sock over the nozzle. The expansion of the gas lowers the temperature enough to produce a dry ice snow that is collected in the bag. This is an inefficient process though and unsuitable for even lab-scale production. The expansion is inefficient, fire extinguishers are an expensive way to buy carbon dioxide and there is the safety risk that extinguishers are left empty by it and not refilled.
Dry ice is typically produced in two standard forms: blocks and cylindrical pellets. A standard block weighing approximately 30 kg[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl] is most common. These are commonly used in shipping, because they sublimate relatively slowly due to a low ratio of surface area to volume. Pellets are around [tpl]convert|1|cm|1|abbr=on[/tpl] in diameter and can be bagged easily. This form is suited to small scale use, for example at grocery stores and laboratories.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2009[/tpl]

==Applications==

===Commercial===

The most common use of dry ice is to preserve food, using non-cyclic refrigeration.
It is frequently used to package items that need to remain cold or frozen, such as ice cream or biological samples, without the use of mechanical cooling, and medical supplies.
Dry ice can be used to flash freeze food[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.airgas.com/content/details.aspx?id=7000000000103 |title=Cool Uses for Dry Ice |publisher=Airgas.com |accessdate=2009-07-25[/tpl] or laboratory biological samples,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.personal.psu.edu/dsg11/labmanual/DNA_manipulations/Comp_bact_by_RF1_RF2.htm |title=Preparing Competent E. coli with RF1/RF2 solutions |publisher=Personal.psu.edu |accessdate=2009-07-25[/tpl] carbonate beverages, and make ice cream.[tpl]cite news|last=Blumenthal|first=Heston|title=How to make the best treacle tart and ice cream in the world|publisher=The Sunday Times|date=2006-10-29|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/food_and_drink/heston_blumenthal/article607734.ece?print=yes|accessdate=2007-06-12 |location=London[/tpl]
Dry ice can be used to arrest and prevent insect activity in closed containers of grains and grain products, as it displaces oxygen, but does not alter the taste or quality of such foods. For the same reason, it can prevent or retard food oils and fats from becoming rancid.
When dry ice is placed in water, sublimation is accelerated, and low-sinking, dense clouds of smoke-like fog are created. This is used in fog machines, at theaters, haunted house attractions, and nightclubs for dramatic effects. Unlike most artificial fog machines, in which fog rises like smoke, fog from dry ice hovers above the ground.[tpl]cite web|publisher = HowStuffWorks|title = How does dry ice work?|url =http://www.howstuffworks.com/question264.htm|accessdate = 2009-07-26[/tpl] Dry ice is useful in theater productions that require dense fog effects.[tpl]Harvnb|McCarthy|1992[/tpl]
It is occasionally used to freeze and remove warts.[tpl]cite journal|title = Management of warts|author = Lyell A.|journal = British Medical Journal|volume = 2|issue = 5529|year = 1966|pages = 1576–9|pmid = 5926267|doi = 10.1136/bmj.2.5529.1576|pmc = 1944935[/tpl] However, liquid nitrogen performs better in this role, since it is colder so requires less time to act and less pressure. However, dry ice has the advantage of having fewer problems with storage, since it can be generated from compressed carbon dioxide gas as needed.[tpl]Harvnb|Goroll|Mulley|2009|page=1317[/tpl]
Plumbers use equipment that forces pressurised liquid CO2 into a jacket around a pipe; the dry ice formed causes the water to freeze, forming an ice plug, allowing them to perform repairs without turning off the water mains. This technique can be used on pipes up to 4 inches (100 mm) in diameter.[tpl]Harvnb|Treloar|2003|p=528[/tpl]
Dry ice can be used as bait to trap mosquitoes, bedbugs, and other insects, due to their attraction to carbon dioxide.[tpl]cite journal|title = Comparative effectiveness of three adult mosquito sampling methods in habitats representative of four different biomes of California|author = Reisen WK, Boyce K, Cummings RC, Delgado O, Gutierrez A, Meyer RP, Scott TW.|journal = J Am Mosq Control Assoc.|volume = 15|issue = 1|year = 1999|pages = 24–31|pmid = 10342265[/tpl]

===Industrial===

Dry ice can be used for loosening asphalt floor tiles or car sound deadening making it easy to pry off,[tpl]cite journal|year= 1961|author1= Horrell, Bill |month=February |title=Dry ice pops off Asphalt Tile |journal=Popular Mechanics |volume=115 |issue=2 |page=169|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=R9wDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA169[/tpl] as well as freezing water in valveless pipes to enable repair.[tpl]cite journal|year=1960|author1=Mundis, Warren J. |month=July |title=Dry Ice as a Plumbing Aid |journal=Popular Science |volume=177 |issue=1 |page=159|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VCYDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA159[/tpl]
One of the largest mechanical uses of dry ice is blast cleaning. Dry ice pellets are shot out of a nozzle with compressed air, combining the power of the speed of the pellets with the action of the sublimation. This can remove residues from industrial equipment. Examples of materials being removed include ink, glue, oil, paint, mold and rubber. Dry ice blasting can replace sandblasting, steam blasting, water blasting or solvent blasting. The primary environmental residue of dry ice blasting is the sublimed CO2, thus making it a useful technique where residues from other blasting techniques are undesirable.[tpl]cite news|last=Wolcott|first=John|title=Ice-blasting firm offers a cool way to clean up|publisher=The Daily Herald| date=January 2008|url=http://www.heraldbusinessjournal.com/archive/jan08/iceblasting-jan08.htm|accessdate=2008-01-20[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=July 2009[/tpl] Recently, blast cleaning has been introduced into the industry of removing smoke damage from structures after fires.
Dry ice is also useful for the de-gassing of flammable vapours from storage tanks — the sublimation of dry ice pellets inside an emptied and vented tank causes an outrush of CO2 that carries with it the flammable vapours.Dry ice
The removal and fitting of cylinder liners in large engines requires the use of dry ice to chill and thus shrink the liner so that it freely slides within the block. When warmed in place the resulting interference fit prevents motion. Similar procedures may be used in fabricating mechanical assemblies with a high resultant strength, replacing the need for pins, keys or welds.Bushing and Plain Bearings Press or Shrink Fit Design and Application
It is also useful as a cutting fluid.

===Scientific===

In laboratories, a slurry of dry ice in an organic solvent is a useful freezing mixture for cold chemical reactions and for condensing solvents in rotary evaporators.[tpl]Harvnb|Housecroft|2001|page=410[/tpl]
The process of altering cloud precipitation can be done with the use of dry ice. It was widely used in experiments in the US in the 1950s and early 60s before being replaced by silver iodide. Dry ice has the advantage of being relatively cheap and completely non-toxic. Its main drawback is the need to be delivered directly into the supercooled region of clouds being seeded.[tpl]Harvnb|Keyes|2006|page=83[/tpl]

===Dry ice bombs===

A "dry ice bomb" is a balloon-like device using dry ice in a sealed container such as a plastic bottle.  Water is usually added to accelerate the sublimation of the dry ice. As the dry ice sublimates, pressure increases, causing the bottle to burst.
The device was featured on MythBusters, episode 57 Mentos and Soda, which first aired on August 9, 2006.[tpl]cite web|url=http://mythbustersresults.com/episode57|title=Mythbusters episode 57|work=mythbustersresults.com[/tpl] It was also featured in an episode of Time Warp.

==Occurrence on Mars and Venus==

Following the Mars flyby of the Mariner 4 spacecraft in 1966, scientists concluded that Mars' polar caps consist entirely of dry ice.[tpl]Cite book|title = Mars Poles Covered by Water Ice, Research Shows|publisher = National Geographic|date = 13 February 2003|accessdate = 2009-07-26|url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/02/0213_030213_marspoles.html[/tpl] However, findings made in 2003 by researchers at the California Institute of Technology have shown that Mars' polar caps are almost completely made of water ice, and that dry ice only forms a thin surface layer that thickens and thins seasonally.[tpl]Cite journal|journal=Science|publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science|date=2003-02-14|accessdate=2009-07-30|volume=299|issue=5609|doi=10.1126/science.1080148|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/299/5609/1051|title=A Sublimation Model for Martian South Polar Ice Features|last1=Byrne|first1=S.|pages=1051–3|pmid=12586939|last2=Ingersoll|first2=AP|bibcode = 2003Sci...299.1051B[/tpl] A phenomenon named dry ice storms was proposed to occur over the polar regions of Mars. They are comparable to Earth's thunderstorms, with crystalline CO2 taking the place of water in the clouds.[tpl]Cite book|title = Dry Ice Storms May Pelt Martian Poles, Experts Say|publisher = National Geographic|date = 19 December 2005|accessdate = 2009-07-26|url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/12/1219_051219_mars_ice.html[/tpl]
In 2012, the European Space Agency's Venus Express probe detected a cold layer in the atmosphere of Venus where temperatures are close to the triple point of carbon dioxide and it is possible that flakes of dry ice precipitate.A curious cold layer in the atmosphere of Venus. European Space Agency (1 October 2012).

==Safety==

Prolonged exposure to dry ice can cause severe skin damage through frostbite, and the fog produced may also hinder attempts to withdraw from contact in a safe manner. Because it sublimates into large quantities of carbon dioxide gas, which could pose a danger of hypercapnia, dry ice should only be exposed to open air in a well-ventilated environment. For this reason, dry ice is assigned the S-phrase [tpl]S9[/tpl] in the context of laboratory safety. Industrial dry ice may contain contaminants that make it unsafe for direct contact with foodstuffs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.emedmag.com/html/pre/tox/0500.asp|title=Carbon Dioxide Poisoning |last=Nelson|first=Lewis |year=2000|publisher=Emergency Medicine |accessdate=2009-07-28[/tpl]
Although dry ice is not classified as a dangerous substance by the European Union, or as a hazardous material by the United States Department of Transportation for ground transportation, when shipped by air or water, it is regulated as a dangerous good and IATA packing instruction 954 (IATA PI 954) requires that it be labeled specially, including a diamond-shaped black-and white label, UN 1845. Also, arrangements must be in place to ensure adequate ventilation so that pressure build-up does not rupture the packaging. The Federal Aviation Administration in the US allows airline passengers to carry up to 2.5 kg per person either as checked baggage or carry-on baggage, when used to refrigerate perishables.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ash/ash_programs/hazmat/media/MaterialsCarriedByPassengersAndCrew.pdf|title=Hazardous Materials Information for Passengers|accessdate=2009-07-26[/tpl] available on the FAA website: http://www.faa.gov/
