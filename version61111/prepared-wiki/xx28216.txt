[[Shalman (Bible)]]

CATEGORIES: Monarchs of the Hebrew Bible

Shalmaneser is documented by The Bible as an Assyrian king (Hosea 10:14), identified with Shalmaneser II
(by Archibald Sayce) or IV (by Fran√ßois Lenormant), the successor of Pul on the throne of Assyria (728 BC). He made war against Hoshea, the king of Israel, whom he subdued and compelled to pay an annual tribute. Hoshea, however, soon after rebelled against his Assyrian conqueror. Shalmaneser again marched against Samaria, which, after a siege of three years, was taken (2 Kings 17:3-5; 18:9) by Sargon. A revolution meantime had broken out in Assyria, and Shalmaneser was deposed. Sargon usurped the vacant throne. Eberhard Schrader thought that this is probably the name of a king of Moab mentioned on an inscription of Tiglath-Pileser[tpl]dn|date=July 2013[/tpl] as Salamanu.
