The Ikon Gallery ([tpl]gbmapping|SP060866[/tpl]) is an English gallery of contemporary art, located in Brindleyplace, Birmingham. It is housed in the Grade II listed, neo-gothic former Oozells Street Board School, designed by John Henry Chamberlain in 1877. The gallery's current director is Jonathan Watkins.
Ikon was set up to encourage the public to engage in contemporary art. As a result of this, the gallery runs an off-site 'Education and Interpretation' scheme that educates audiences, promotes artists and their art. The gallery is open every day of the week except Mondays, though it opens on bank holiday Mondays.
Featured artworks include all forms of media including sound, sculpture and photography as well as paintings. Exhibitions rotate throughout the year so that as many pieces can be displayed as possible. Ikon is a registered charity which is partly funded by Birmingham City Council and Arts Council of England.

==History==

"The Ikon" (as it is colloquially known) was founded by Angus Skene and four artists from the Birmingham School of Art - David Prentice, Sylvani Merilion, Jesse Bruton and Robert Groves - after Skene bought Prentice's painting Kate and the Waterlilies in 1964, and the two started discussing the lack of support for contemporary artists provided by Birmingham's existing artistic institutions.[tpl]cite news |first=Rose |last=Jennings |title=Birmingham on the cutting-edge - A groundbreaking gallery deserves this long-overdue retrospective |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/reviews/observer/story/0,,1292925,00.html |work=The Observer |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited |date=2004-08-29 |accessdate=2008-03-07[/tpl] Originally conceived as a "gallery without walls" (exhibitions were planned to tour unconventional locations such as cinemas and post offices in a motorcycle sidecar)[tpl]cite news |first=Rachel |last=Campbell-Johnston |title=Lip service paid to a Sixties icon |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/article473796.ece |work=The Times |publisher=Times Newspapers Ltd |date=2004-08-25 |accessdate=2008-03-24 | location=London[/tpl] it was eventually established in 1965 in an octagonal glass-walled kiosk in Birmingham's then-new Bull Ring shopping centre. The first exhibition was of work by John Salt, and the venue was staffed by the founding artists and sometimes their spouses on a voluntary basis.
The venture was funded by Skene, but control was left in the hands of the artists.[tpl]cite book |author=Watkins, Jonathan |editor=Watkins, Jonathan; Stevenson, Diana |title=Some of the best things in life happen accidentally: the beginning of Ikon |year=2004 |publisher=Ikon Gallery |location=Birmingham |isbn=1-904864-02-3 |pages=36–38 |chapter=Some of the best things in life happen accidentally[/tpl] The name of the gallery was coined by Groves, who was interested in the icons of the Eastern Orthodox Church. The name was agreed by the other founders partly on the basis that it "divides beautifully geometrically and was splendid in all directions".[tpl]cite book |author=Stevenson, Diana |editor=Watkins, Jonathan; Stevenson, Diana |title=Some of the best things in life happen accidentally: the beginning of Ikon |year=2004 |publisher=Ikon Gallery |location=Birmingham |isbn=1-904864-02-3 |pages=114 |chapter=Interview - Robert Groves[/tpl] Ikon's founding prospectus declared: "Ikon is intended as an antithesis to exclusive art establishments and galleries … it has been formed because of the need for an accessible place where the exchange of visual ideas can become a familiar reality"[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.ikon-gallery.co.uk/programme/past/event/106/some_of_the_best_things_in_life_happen_accidentally/ |title=Some of the Best Things in Life Happen Accidentally 28 July – 12 September 2004 |accessdate=2008-03-24 |work=Programme - Past |publisher=Ikon Gallery[/tpl]
The lease on the kiosk expired after three years, but with Arts Council support the gallery was able to move to the former mortuary in the basement of Queens College in Swallow Street in 1968 and appointed Jeanette Koch as gallery manager.3 During the next 4 years Ikon held 93 exhibitions and 40 group shows,6 by which time the lease on the Swallow Street premises came to an end.  Under the direction of Simon Chapman (who had previously run the Birmingham Arts Lab) assisted by Jeanette Koch, the gallery embarked on an ambitious expansion of broadening the exhibition programme to include the works of nationally and internationally recognised artists, and to move to a busier location in order to gain greater interest from a wider public.  In the autumn of 1972, with increased financial support of The Arts Council together with new funding from West Midlands Arts Association, The Gulbenkian Foundation and a number of local charitable trusts and industry, Ikon re-located in The Birmingham Shopping Centre, a newly built shopping mall above New Street Station.  The fitting out of the gallery was designed by Walter Thomson of Associated Architects and provided a space four times larger than the Swallow Street gallery and virtually forty times larger than the original Bull Ring kiosk.  The number of visitors to the gallery rocketed into the hundreds and on occasions peaked at over a thousand a day providing many with their first opportunity of seeing modern art by living artists.  The opening show of large chalk on blackboard wall drawings by John Walker firmly established Birmingham as a city with a gallery devoted to the contemporary visual arts.  
During the next 6 years, Ikon became positioned as one of the most important contemporary art galleries outside London, attracting both exhibitors and visitors from far beyond the city. Among the artists who had solo exhibitions were Ivor Abraham, Allen Barker, Barry Burman, John Copnall, Vaughan Grylls, Trevor Halliday, David Hepher, Harry Holland, David Leveritt, John Mitchell, John Salt, Peter Sedgely, David Shepherd, William Tillyer and Roger Westwood.  Notable group shows included Midland Art Now featuring the work of 20 of the most prominent Midlands based artists including Roy Abell, Barrie Cook, John Farrington, Dick French, William Gear, Colin Hitchmough, John Melville, David Prentice and Peter Tarrant, and which was accompanied by a full colour printed broadsheet catalogue distributed free to the 40,000 readers of the Birmingham Post. Ikon replaced the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery as the venue for travelling exhibitions of contemporary art such as Diane Arbus curated by John Szarkowski, Chris Orr curated by Nick Serota, Objects and Documents featuring works selected by Richard Smith, An Element of Landscape curated by Jeremy Rees, The Human Clay featuring works selected by R B Kitaj, and Berenice Abbott.
By 1978, Ikon had again outgrown its premises and it moved to a former carpet shop in John Bright Street adjacent to the Alexandra Theatre.7

The gallery moved to its current site in 1997 with the cost of the conversion partly funded by a grant from the National Lottery. The refurbishment work was designed by Levitt Bernstein, who reinstated the tower which had been demolished during the 1960s. Café Ikon, on the ground floor, was designed by Birmingham-based architects The Space Studio and opened in December 1998. Form, Space & Order were the contractors.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.thespacestudio.com/work/ikon.html |title=Cafe Ikon |publisher=The Space Studio |accessdate=2008-06-07[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] In July 2006, it opened a second site in Digbeth - Ikon Eastside.
