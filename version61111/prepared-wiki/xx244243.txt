The B 242, also known as the Harz High Road (Harzhochstraße), runs right across the Harz mountains in central Germany. From Seesen on the northwestern edge of the Harz near the A 7 motorway it runs through the Upper Harz past Clausthal-Zellerfeld, the High Harz, where it is combined for several kilometres with the B 4, past Braunlage and then through the eastern Harz foothills into Mansfelder Land. There it joins the  B 180 east of Klostermansfeld.
An extension of the B 242 via Polleben and Salzmünde to Halle (Saale) is being planned.
