The Adirondack League Club is an organization that owns a large piece of wilderness land in the New York State Adirondack Park. The club was founded in the 1890s as a club for hunting and fishing. The club was involved in a protracted legal dispute with the Sierra Club over the right of public access to streams and other waterways.[tpl]cite web|url=http://prfamerica.org/stats/Stats-AdirondackLeagueClub.html|accessdate=13 October 2011|title=Adirondack League Club[/tpl]
