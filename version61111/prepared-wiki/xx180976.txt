The River Drumragh runs through Omagh, the county town of County Tyrone in Northern Ireland. It is also the name of the surrounding townland and the local football team.
A small river known as the Quiggery Water flows through Fintona, with bridges crossing it at Kiln Street and Mill Street. This river then joins with the Ballynahatty Water to form the Drumragh River.[tpl]cite web | title=History of Fintona | work=Supporting Communities NI | url=http://www.supportingcommunitiesni.org/directory/?module=Item%20Detail&itemid=dc9ee527-ff0d-4847-9af1-b70c847802fb&directoryid=0e2a996a-ad52-4320-9457-c656ff228179&directorytabid=0 | accessdate=1 March 2009[/tpl] Omagh is sited at the confluence of the Camowen, Strule and Drumragh Rivers.[tpl]cite web | title=Omagh Farmland Landscape | work=Northern Ireland Environment Agency| url=http://www.ni-environment.gov.uk/landscape/country_landscape/22/22-land.htm | accessdate=1 March 2009[/tpl] The Camowen and Drumragh Rivers actually meet at Omagh to form the Strule.[tpl]cite web | title=Angling Game - Drumragh and Camowen Rivers | work=Omagh District Council| url=http://www.omagh.gov.uk/culture_leisure_and_tourism/things_to_do/activities/angling_game/item.php?id=12 | accessdate=1 March 2009[/tpl] In 2006 a new Omagh Throughpass road scheme, developed at a cost of £9.7m, was opened.
