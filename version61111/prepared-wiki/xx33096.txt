Rainmaking is a weather modification technique that invokes rain.
Among the most well known examples of weather modification techniques are North American rain dances, historically performed by many Native American tribes, particularly in the Southwestern United States. Some of these weather modification techniques are still implemented today.[tpl]cite web|title=Rain Dance|url=http://www.indians.org/articles/rain-dance.html|work=Indians.org|publisher=American Indian Heritage Foundation|accessdate=4 September 2011[/tpl]
