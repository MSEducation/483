Jane Seymour (c. 1508[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]24 October 1537) was Queen of England from 1536 to 1537 as the third wife of King Henry VIII. She succeeded Anne Boleyn as queen consort following the latter's execution for high treason, incest and adultery in May 1536. She died of postnatal complications less than two weeks after the birth of her only child, a son who reigned as Edward VI. She was the only one of Henry's wives to receive a queen's funeral, and his only consort to be buried beside him in St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle. She was the only consort of Henry VIII to have a male heir to survive infancy.

==Early life==

Jane Seymour was likely born at Wulfhall, Savernake Forest, Wiltshire, the daughter of Sir John Seymour and Margery Wentworth. Through her maternal grandfather, she was a descendant of King Edward III of England through Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence.[tpl]sfn|Norton|2009|p=8[/tpl] Because of this, she and King Henry VIII were fifth cousins. She was a half-second cousin to her predecessor Anne Boleyn, sharing a great-grandmother, Elizabeth Cheney.[tpl]sfn|Norton|2009|p=9[/tpl]
She was not educated as highly as King Henry's previous wives, Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn. She could read and write a little, but was much better at needlework and household management, which were considered much more necessary for women.[tpl]sfn|Brown|2005|p=244[/tpl] Jane's needlework was reported to be beautiful and elaborate; some of her work survived as late as 1652, when it is recorded to have been given to the Seymour family. After her death, it was noted that Henry was an "enthusiastic embroiderer".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.royal-needlework.co.uk/content/129/henry_viii_embroiderer_king |title=Henry VIII – the Embroiderer King |publisher=Royal School of Needlework |accessdate=19 October 2009[/tpl]
She became a maid-of-honour in 1532 to Queen Catherine, but may have served her as early as 1527, and went on to serve Queen Anne. The first report of Henry VIII's interest in Jane Seymour was in early 1536, sometime before Catherine's death.
Jane was noted to have a childlike face, as well as a modest personality.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl] According to the Imperial Ambassador Eustace Chapuys, Jane was of middling stature and very pale; he also commented that she was not of much beauty. However, John Russell stated that Jane was "the fairest of all the King's wives"[tpl]sfn|Norton|2009|p=65[/tpl] Polydore Vergil commented that she was "a woman of the utmost charm in both character and appearance."[tpl]sfn|Vergil|1950|p=337[/tpl]

==Marriage and birth of heir==

King Henry VIII was betrothed to Jane on 20 May 1536, just one day after Anne Boleyn's execution. The couple married at the Palace of Whitehall, Whitehall, London, in the Queen's closet by Bishop Gardiner[tpl]sfn|Weir|2007|p=344[/tpl] on 30 May 1536. As a wedding gift the King made her a grant of 104 manors in four counties as well as a number of forests and hunting chases, for her jointure, the income to support her during their marriage.[tpl]sfn|Weir|2007|p=344[/tpl] She was publicly proclaimed as queen consort on 4 June. Jane’s well-publicized sympathy for the late Queen Catherine and the Lady Mary showed her to be compassionate, and made her a popular figure with the common people and most of the courtiers.[tpl]sfn|Weir|2007|p=340[/tpl] She was never crowned, due to a plague in London where the coronation was to take place. Henry may have been reluctant to crown Jane before she had fulfilled her duty as a queen consort by bearing him a son and a male heir.[tpl]sfn|Wagner|2012|p=1000[/tpl]
As queen, Jane Seymour was said to be strict and formal. Her motto was "Bound to obey and serve." [tpl]sfn|Wagner|2012|p=1000[/tpl] [tpl]Henryviiiwives[/tpl]
She was close to her female relations, Anne Stanhope (her brother's wife) and her sister, Elizabeth.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl] Jane was also close to the Lady Lisle[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl] along with her sister-in-law the Lady Beauchamp. Jane considered Lisle's daughters as maids-of-honour and she left many of her possessions to Beauchamp. Jane would form a very close relationship with Mary Tudor. The lavish entertainments, gaiety, and extravagance of the Queen's household, which had reached its peak during the time of Anne Boleyn, was replaced by a strict enforcement of decorum. For example, she banned the French fashions that Anne Boleyn had introduced. Politically, Seymour appears to have been conservative.[tpl]cite web|title=Jane Seymour: Third Wife of Henry VIII of England|url=http://www.a-london-tourist-guide.com/jane-seymour.html|publisher=A-london-tourist-guide.com|accessdate=22 October 2010[/tpl] Her only reported involvement in national affairs, in 1536, was when she asked for pardons for participants in the Pilgrimage of Grace. Henry is said to have rejected this, reminding her of the fate her predecessor met with when she "meddled in his affairs".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/sixwives/meet/js_handbook_king.html|title= The Six Wives of Henry VIII: Jane Seymour|publisher=PBS|accessdate=22 October 2010[/tpl]
Jane put forth much effort to restore Henry's first child, Princess Mary, to court and heir to the throne behind any children that Jane would have with Henry. Jane brought up the issue of Mary's restoration both before and after she became Queen. While Jane was unable to restore Mary to the line of succession, she was able to reconcile her with Henry.[tpl]sfn|Wagner|2012|p=1000[/tpl] Eustace Chapuys wrote to Charles V of Jane's compassion and efforts on behalf of Mary's return to favour. A letter from Mary to Jane shows that Mary was grateful to Jane. While it was Jane who first pushed for the restoration, Mary and Elizabeth were not reinstated in the succession until Henry's sixth wife, Queen Catherine Parr, convinced him to do so.[tpl]sfn|Farquhar|2001|p=72[/tpl]
In early 1537, Jane became pregnant. During her pregnancy, she developed a craving for quail, which Henry ordered for her from Calais and Flanders. During the summer, she took no public engagements and led a relatively quiet life, being attended by the royal physicians and the best midwives in the kingdom.[tpl]sfn|Weir|2007|p=362[/tpl] She went into confinement in September 1537 and gave birth to the coveted male heir, the future King Edward VI, at two o'clock in the morning[tpl]sfn|Weir|2007|p=367[/tpl] on 12 October 1537 at Hampton Court Palace.[tpl]sfn|Seal|2001|p=129[/tpl] Edward was christened on 15 October 1537, without his mother in attendance, as was the custom. Both of the King's daughters, Mary and Elizabeth, were present and carried the infant's train during the ceremony.[tpl]sfn|Walder|1973|p=47[/tpl]

==Death and funeral==

Jane Seymour's labour had been difficult, lasting two nights and three days, probably because the baby was not well positioned.[tpl]sfn|Walsh|2009[/tpl] After the christening, it became clear that she was seriously ill.[tpl]sfn|Norton|2009|p=145[/tpl] Jane Seymour died on 24 October 1537 at Hampton Court Palace at Kingston upon Thames. Within a few weeks of the death of Queen Jane there existed conflicting testimonies concerning the cause of her demise. According to King Edward's biographer, Jennifer Loach, Jane Seymour's death may have been due to an infection from a retained placenta. According to Alison Weir, death could have also been caused by puerperal fever due to a bacterial infection contracted during the birth or a tear in her perineum which became infected.
