[[Good to Be Alive (DJ Rap song)]]

CATEGORIES: 1999 songs, Music videos directed by Jeff Richter

Good to Be Alive is the most famous song from the DJ Rap album Learning Curve and is also featured on the soundtrack of the 1999 movie Go. Its heavy, plodding bass beat and flowing lyrics make it stand out from DJ Rap's typical fast-paced drum and bass style. Because of the noticeable difference between the album version and the radio remix of the song (the album version was slower and deeper, while the radio remix was more of an upbeat club song), two different music videos were released. The album version (directed by David Slade) featured DJ Rap in a futuristic sci-fi setting with people trapped in red capsules (like in the Matrix movies). The radio remix version (directed by Jeff Richter) featured DJ Rap mixing and dancing in a club environment.
