[[Nicylla]]

CATEGORIES: Salticidae

Nicylla is a spider genus of the Salticidae family (jumping spiders). Its only species, N. sundevalli, occurs only in Burma.Murphy & Murphy 2000: 272
Thorell described a male and a female in 1890. While Eugène Simon was unsure where to place the genus, Proszynski (1968) drew the male pedipalp, chelicera and habitus, which indicate that the species is close to Thiania bhamoensis, which also occurs in Burma.

==Name==

The genus name is derived from Νίκυλλα, a Greek name.
The species is named in honor of Swedish zoologist Carl Jakob Sundevall, who described a number of spider species and genera in the 1830s.
