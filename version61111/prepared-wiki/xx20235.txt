Used in 1542 by Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo to describe a Pacific Coast Range (Santa Cruz Mountains), the term "sierra nevada" was a general identification of less familiar ranges toward the interior.[tpl]cite journal |last=Farquhar |first=Francis P. |date=March 1925 |title=Exploration of the Sierra Nevada |journal=California Historical Society Quarterly |url=http://www.yosemite.ca.us/library/exploration_of_the_sierra_nevada/ |doi=10.2307/25177743 |volume=4 |page=3[/tpl]  In 1777, Pedro Font's map applied the name to the range currently known as the Sierra Nevada.[tpl]cite book|last=Farquhar|first=Francis P.|year=1926|title=Place Names of the Sierra Nevada |chapterurl=http://www.yosemite.ca.us/library/place_names_of_the_high_sierra/s.html|chapter=S|publisher=Sierra Club|location=San Francisco[/tpl]
The literal translation is "snowy mountains," from sierra "a range of hills," 1610s, from Spanish sierra "jagged mountain range," lit. "saw," from Latin serra "a saw";
and from fem. of Spanish nevado "snowy."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=sierra|title=Sierra|work=Etymology Online[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=nevada|title=Nevada|work=Etymology Online[/tpl]

===Initial European-American exploration===

European-American exploration of the mountain range started in 1827. Although prior to the 1820s there were Spanish missions, pueblos (towns), presidios (forts), and ranchos along the coast of California, no Spanish explorers visited the Sierra Nevada.[tpl]cite book|title=Yosemite: A Visitors Companion|first=George|last=Wuerthner|publisher=Stackpole Books|year=1994|isbn=0-8117-2598-7|pages=13–14[/tpl] The first European Americans to visit the mountains were amongst a group led by fur trapper Jedediah Smith, crossing north of the Yosemite area in May 1827, at Ebbetts Pass.
In 1833, a subgroup of the Bonneville Expedition led by Joseph Reddeford Walker was sent westward to find an overland route to California. Eventually the party discovered a route along the Humboldt River across present-day Nevada, ascending the Sierra Nevada, starting near present day Bridgeport and descending between the Tuolumne and Merced River drainage. The group may have been the first non-indigenous people to see Yosemite Valley.[tpl]cite book|title=Yosemite National Park: A Natural History Guide to Yosemite and Its Trails|first=Jeffrey P.|last=Schaffer|publisher=Wilderness Press|location=Berkeley|year=1999|isbn=0-89997-244-6[/tpl] The Walker party probably visited either the Tuolumne or Merced Groves of Giant Sequoia, becoming the first non-indigenous people to see the giant trees, but journals relating to the Walker party were destroyed in 1839, in a print shop fire in Philadelphia.[tpl]cite book| title = Geology of U.S. Parklands| edition = 5th| first = Eugene P.| last = Kiver| coauthors = Harris, David V.|publisher = John Wiley & Sons|location = New York|year = 1999|isbn = 0-471-33218-6[/tpl]

===Gold rush===

The California Gold Rush began at Sutter's Mill, near Coloma, in the western foothills of the Sierra.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.consrv.ca.gov/CGS/minerals/images/Big_AUMap.pdf|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061214035847/http://www.consrv.ca.gov/cgs/minerals/images/Big_AUMap.pdf|archivedate=2006-12-14|title=California Historic Gold Mines|publisher=State of California[/tpl] On January 24, 1848 James W. Marshall, a foreman working for Sacramento pioneer John Sutter, found shiny metal in the tailrace of a lumber mill Marshall was building for Sutter on the American River.[tpl]Cite book|last=Bancroft |first=Hubert Howe |title=History of California, Volume 23: 1843–1850 |publisher=The History Company |year=1889 |location=San Francisco|pages=32–34| url = http://www.archive.org/stream/bancrohistofcali23huberich/bancrohistofcali23huberich_djvu.txt [/tpl] Rumors soon started to spread and were confirmed in March 1848 by San Francisco newspaper publisher and merchant Samuel Brannan. Brannan strode through the streets of San Francisco, holding aloft a vial of gold, shouting "Gold! Gold! Gold from the American River!"
On August 19, 1848, the New York Herald was the first major newspaper on the East Coast to report the discovery of gold. On December 5, 1848, President James Polk confirmed the discovery of gold in an address to Congress.[tpl]Cite book|last=Starr |first=Kevin |title=California: a history |publisher=The Modern Library |year=2005 |location=New York[/tpl][tpl]rp|80[/tpl] Soon, waves of immigrants from around the world, later called the "forty-niners", invaded the Gold Country of California or "Mother Lode". Miners lived in tents, wood shanties, or deck cabins removed from abandoned ships.[tpl]Cite book|last=Holliday |first=J. S. |title=Rush for riches; gold fever and the making of California |publisher=Oakland Museum of California and University of California Press |year=1999 |location=Oakland, California, Berkeley and Los Angeles |page=60 [/tpl] Wherever gold was discovered, hundreds of miners would collaborate to put up a camp and stake their claims. 
Because the gold in the California gravel beds was so richly concentrated, the early forty-niners simply panned for gold in California's rivers and streams, a form of placer mining.[tpl]Cite book|last=Brands|first=H. W. |title=The age of gold: the California Gold Rush and the new American dream |location=New York |publisher=Anchor (reprint ed.) |year=2003[/tpl][tpl]rp|198-200[/tpl] However, panning cannot take place on a large scale, and miners and groups of miners graduated to more complex placer mining. Groups of prospectors would divert the water from an entire river into a sluice alongside the river, and then dig for gold in the newly exposed river bottom.[tpl]rp|90[/tpl] 
By 1853, most of the easily accessible gold had been collected, and attention turned to extracting gold from more difficult locations. Hydraulic mining was used on ancient gold-bearing gravel beds on hillsides and bluffs in the gold fields.[tpl]rp|89[/tpl] In hydraulic mining, a high-pressure hose directed a powerful stream or jet of water at gold-bearing gravel beds. By the mid-1880s, it is estimated that 11 million ounces (340 t) of gold (worth approximately US$15 billion at December 2010 prices) had been recovered by "hydraulicking".[tpl]cite web|url=http://virtual.yosemite.cc.ca.us/ghayes/goldrush.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061203062554/http://virtual.yosemite.cc.ca.us/ghayes/goldrush.htm|archivedate=2006-12-03|title=Mining History and Geology of the Mother Lode[/tpl] A byproduct of these extraction methods was that large amounts of gravel, silt, heavy metals, and other pollutants went into streams and rivers.[tpl]rp|32–36[/tpl] [tpl]As of | 1999[/tpl], many areas still bear the scars of hydraulic mining, since the resulting exposed earth and downstream gravel deposits do not support plant life.[tpl]rp|116-121[/tpl]
By 1855, it is estimated at least 300,000 gold-seekers, merchants, and other immigrants had arrived in California from around the world.[tpl]rp|25[/tpl] The huge numbers of newcomers brought by the Gold Rush drove Native Americans out of their traditional hunting, fishing and food-gathering areas. To protect their homes and livelihood, some Native Americans responded by attacking the miners. This provoked counter-attacks on native villages. The Native Americans, out-gunned, were often slaughtered.[tpl]Cite book|editor1-last=Rawls|editor1-first=James J.|editor2-last=Orsi|editor2-first=Richard J.|title=A golden state: mining and economic development in Gold Rush California (California History Sesquicentennial Series, 2) |year=1999 |location=Berkeley and Los Angeles|publisher=University of California Press[/tpl]

===Thorough exploration===

The Gold Rush populated the western foothills of the Sierra Nevada. However, even by 1860, most of the Sierra was unexplored.[tpl]cite book|last=Roper|first=Steve|title=Sierra High Route: Traversing Timberline Country|year=1997|publisher=The Mountaineers Press|isbn=0-89886-506-9[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Moore|first=James G.|title=Exploring the Highest Sierra|year=2000|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=0-8047-3703-7[/tpl] The state legislature authorized the California Geological Survey to officially explore the Sierra (and survey the rest of the state). Josiah Whitney was appointed to head the survey.   Men of the survey, including William H. Brewer, Charles F. Hoffmann and Clarence King, explored the backcountry of what would become Yosemite National Park in 1863. In 1864 they explored the area around Kings Canyon.  In 1869, John Muir started his wanderings in the Sierra Nevada range,[tpl]cite book|title=My First Summer in the Sierra|first=John|last=Muir|url=http://www.yosemite.ca.us/john_muir_writings/my_first_summer_in_the_sierra/|year=1911|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|isbn=1-883011-24-8[/tpl] and in 1871 King was the first to climb Mount Langley and that year fishermen were the first to climb Mount Whitney.  From 1892–7 Theodore Solomons made the first attempt to map a route along the crest of the Sierra.
Other people finished exploring and mapping the Sierra. Bolton Coit Brown explored the Kings River watershed in 1895–1899. Joseph N. LeConte mapped the area around Yosemite National Park and what would become Kings Canyon National Park. James S. Hutchinson, a noted mountaineer, climbed the Palisades (1904) and Mount Humphreys (1905). By 1912, the USGS published a set of maps of the Sierra Nevada, and the era of exploration was over.[tpl]rp|81[/tpl]

===Conservation===

The tourism potential of the Sierra Nevada was recognized early in the European history of the range.
Yosemite Valley was first protected by the federal government in 1864. The Valley and Mariposa Grove were ceded to California in 1866 and turned into a state park.[tpl]cite book|last=Schaffer|first=Jeffrey P.|title=Yosemite National Park: A Natural History Guide to Yosemite and Its Trails|publisher=Wilderness Press|location=Berkeley|year=1999|isbn=0-89997-244-6.[/tpl] John Muir perceived overgrazing by sheep and logging of Giant Sequoia to be a problem in the Sierra. Muir successfully lobbied for the protection of the rest of Yosemite National Park: Congress created an Act to protect the park in 1890. The Valley and Mariposa Grove were added to the Park in 1906. In the same year, Sequoia National Park was formed to protect the Giant Sequoia: all logging of the Sequoia ceased at that time.
In 1903, the city of San Francisco proposed building a hydroelectric dam to flood Hetch Hetchy Valley. The city and the Sierra Club argued over the dam for 10 years, until the U.S. Congress passed the Raker Act in 1913 and allowed dam building to proceed. O'Shaughnessy Dam was completed in 1923.[tpl]cite book | title=Dam!: Water, Power, Politics, and Preservation in Hetch Hetchy and Yosemite National Park | last=Simpson | first=John W. | year=2005 | isbn=0-375-42231-5[/tpl][tpl]cite book | title=The Battle over Hetch Hetchy: America's Most Controversial Dam and the Birth of Modern Environmentalism | last=Righter | first=Robert W. | year=2005 | isbn=0-19-531309-7[/tpl]
Between 1912 and 1918, Congress debated three times to protect Lake Tahoe in a national park. None of these efforts succeeded, and after World War II, towns such as South Lake Tahoe grew around the shores of the lake. By 1980, the permanent population of the Lake Tahoe area grew to 50,000, while the summer population grew to 90,000.[tpl]cite web|title=Stream and Ground-Water Monitoring Program, Lake Tahoe Basin, Nevada and California|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/FS-100-97/|publisher=USGS|accessdate=2010-05-31[/tpl] The development around Lake Tahoe affected the clarity of the lake water. In order to preserve the lake's clarity, construction in the Tahoe basin is currently regulated by the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.trpa.org/default.aspx?tabindex=1&tabid=40|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5yfLGRBaL|archivedate=2011-05-14|title=Construction Monitoring|publisher=Tahoe Regional Planning Agency[/tpl]
As the 20th century progressed, more of the Sierra became available for recreation: other forms of economic activity decreased. The John Muir Trail, a trail that followed the Sierra crest from Yosemite Valley to Mount Whitney, was funded in 1915 and finished in 1938.[tpl]cite journal|last=Starr|first=Walter A.|date=November 1947|title=Trails|journal=Sierra Club Bulletin|publisher=Sierra Club|location=San Francisco|volume= 32|issue= 10[/tpl] Kings Canyon National Park was formed in 1940 to protect the deep canyon of the Kings River.
By 1964, the Wilderness Act protected portions of the Sierra as primitive areas where humans are simply temporary visitors. Gradually, 20 wilderness areas were established to protect scenic backcountry of the Sierra. These wilderness areas include the John Muir Wilderness (protecting the eastern slope of the Sierra and the area between Yosemite and Kings Canyon Parks), and wilderness within each of the National Parks.
