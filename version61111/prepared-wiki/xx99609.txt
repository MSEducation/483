[[South Ferry Basin]]

CATEGORIES: Liverpool docks

The South Ferry Basin is a dock on the River Mersey, England and part of the Port of Liverpool. Situated near the southern dock system, it is only connected directly to the river.
From 4 April 1865 a ferry service was established between the South Ferry Basin and New Ferry on the Wirral Peninsula, with additional sailings to Liverpool Pier Head. Facilities at the basin consisted of a pontoon moored against the dock wall. The "South End" service appeared to be relatively short-lived, as by 1876, these facilities had been removed and sold for scrap.[tpl]citebook|title=Mersey Ferries - Volume 1 |first=TB|last=Maund|publisher=Transport Publishing Co.

This small dock was also known locally as the 'Cocklehole' and was a place that Liverpool ceded to the poor cocklefishers and oystercatchers for the mooring and repair of their boats whilst the main port of Liverpool handled the large trade. It was little known under its own name and often confused as being part of Coburg Dock. The dock is open to the river and is currently heavily silted up. It isn't used for anything.
Although the basin remains unaltered, the surrounding area has since been redeveloped for residential purposes.
