[[Pseudomonas infection]]

CATEGORIES: Bacterial diseases

Pseudomonas infection refers to a disease caused by one of the species of the genus Pseudomonas.
"Pseudomonas sp. KUMS3" could be considered
as an opportunistic pathogen, which can survive on the
fish surface or in water or in the gut and may cause disease
when unfavorable conditions develop.[ref]

P. aeruginosa is an opportunistic human pathogen, most commonly affecting immunocompromised patients, such as those with cystic fibrosis[tpl]cite journal | author = Elkin S, Geddes D | title = Pseudomonal infection in cystic fibrosis: the battle continues | journal = Expert review of anti-infective therapy | volume = 1 | issue = 4 | pages = 609–18 | year = 2003 | pmid = 15482158 | doi = 10.1586/14787210.1.4.609[/tpl] or AIDS.[tpl]cite journal | author = Shanson DC | title = Septicaemia in patients with AIDS | journal = Trans.

Treatment of such infections can be difficult due to multiple antibiotic resistance.[tpl]cite journal | author = McGowan JE | title = Resistance in nonfermenting gram-negative bacteria: multidrug resistance to the maximum | journal = Am.

P. oryzihabitans can also be a human pathogen, although infections are rare. It can cause peritonitis,[tpl]cite journal | author = Levitski-Heikkila TV, Ullian ME | title = Peritonitis with multiple rare environmental bacteria in a patient receiving long-term peritoneal dialysis | journal = Am.

Similar symptoms although also very rare can be seen by infections of P. luteola.[tpl]cite journal | author = Kodama K, Kimura Nm Komagata K | title = Two new species of Pseudomonas: P. oryzihabitans isolated from rice paddy and clinical specimens and P. luteola isolated from clinical specimens | journal = Int J Syst Bacteriol | volume = 35 | issue = Pt 2 | pages = 467–74 | year = 1985 | doi = 10.1099/00207713-35-4-467 | pmid=[/tpl]
P. plecoglossicida is a fish pathogenic species, causing hemorrhagic ascites in the ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis).[tpl]cite journal | author = Nishimori E, Kita-Tsukamoto K, Wakabayashi H | title = Pseudomonas plecoglossicida sp. nov., the causative agent of bacterial haemorrhagic ascites of ayu, Plecoglossus altivelis | journal = Int.

Due to their hemolytic activity, even non-pathogenic species of Pseudomonas can occasionally become a problem in clinical settings, where they have been known to infect blood transfusions.[tpl]cite journal | author = Khabbaz RF, Arnow PM, Highsmith AK, et al. | title = Pseudomonas fluorescens bacteremia from blood transfusion | journal = Am.
