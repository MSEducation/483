[[Scared of the Police]]

CATEGORIES: 2002 singles, Reuben songs

"Scared of the Police" is the debut single by Surrey-based rock band Reuben. It was recorded in December 2001 at EMI studios in London with Idlewild/80's Matchbox producer Paul Tipler, and was the first recording to be released with Guy Davis on drums. The band's press company had suggested that they release a single, so they approached Andy Ross of Food records to release it as the first record on his new label, Bossmusic. It was released in March 2002 and reached #87 in the UK chart, impressive for a small release, and received good reviews from the music magazines, most notably a KKKKK rating from Andrew W.K in that week's issue of Kerrang! magazine. The accompanying video, the band's first to be played on TV, was a surprise success and reached #2 in MTV2's Most Wanted chart.
