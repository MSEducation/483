===Fourier Analysis in Number Fields and Hecke's Zeta-Functions===

Description: Generally referred to simply as Tate's Thesis, Tate's Princeton Ph.D. thesis, under Emil Artin, is a reworking of Erich Hecke's theory of zeta- and L-functions in terms of Fourier analysis on the adeles. The introduction of these methods into number theory made it possible to formulate extensions of Hecke's results to more general L-functions such as those arising from automorphic forms.

===Automorphic Forms on GL(2)===

Description: This publication offers evidence towards Langlands' conjectures by reworking and expanding the classical theory of modular forms and their L-functions through the introduction of representation theory.

===La conjecture de Weil. I.===

Description: Proved the Riemann hypothesis for varieties over finite fields, settling the last of the open Weil conjectures.

===Endlichkeitssätze für abelsche Varietäten über Zahlkörpern===

Description: Faltings proves a collection of important results in this paper, the most famous of which is the first proof of the Mordell conjecture (a conjecture dating back to 1922). Other theorems proved in this paper include an instance of the Tate conjecture (relating the homomorphisms between two abelian varieties over a number field to the homomorphisms between their Tate modules) and some finiteness results concerning abelian varieties over number fields with certain properties.

===Modular Elliptic Curves and Fermat's Last Theorem===

Description: This article proceeds to prove a special case of the Shimura–Taniyama conjecture through the study of the deformation theory of Galois representations. This in turn implies the famed Fermat's Last Theorem. The proof's method of identification of a deformation ring with a Hecke algebra (now referred to as an R=T theorem) to prove modularity lifting theorems has been an influential development in algebraic number theory.

===The geometry and cohomology of some simple Shimura varieties===

Description: Harris and Taylor provide the first proof of the local Langlands conjecture for GL(n). As part of the proof, this monograph also makes an in depth study of the geometry and cohomology of certain Shimura varieties at primes of bad reduction.

===Le lemme fondamental pour les algèbres de Lie===

Description: Ngô Bảo Châu proved a long standing unsolved problem in the classical Langlands program, using methods from the Geometric Langlands program.

===Introductio in analysin infinitorum===

Description: The eminent historian of mathematics Carl Boyer once called Euler's Introductio in analysin infinitorum the greatest modern textbook in mathematics.[ref]
