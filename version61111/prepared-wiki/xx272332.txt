[[State league (sport)]]

CATEGORIES: Australian sports-related lists

In Australian football codes the term state league is used to describe a competition that is at a level below that of the national leagues. Most of these competitions are based in a single state, and this is where the term originates.

==History==

The Australian federation consists of six states and two territories. Historically the highest level of club based sport were the various leagues based in each state and territory. The change to single national based leagues began in 1977 when the National Soccer League was formed with clubs in most capital cities. Australian football and rugby league followed suit during the 1980s when the Victorian and New South Welsh leagues respectively began to admit clubs from other states.
