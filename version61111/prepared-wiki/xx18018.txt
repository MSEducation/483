Sir Sidney Poitier, KBEBecause Poitier is a citizen of The Bahamas, a Commonwealth realm, this is a substantive (as opposed to honorary) knighthood, which entitles him to the style "Sir".

==Early life==

Sidney Poitier's parents were Evelyn (née Outten) and Reginald James Poitier,Sidney Poitier Film Reference biography  Bahamian farmers who owned a farm on Cat Island and traveled to Miami in the U.S.A. to sell tomatoes and other produce. Reginald worked as a cab driver in Nassau, Bahamas.Davis Smiley interviews Sidney Poitier[tpl]Dead link|date=July 2011[/tpl] Poitier was born in Miami while his parents were visiting. His birth was two months premature and he was not expected to survive, but his parents remained three months in Miami to nurse him to health.Adam Gourmand, Sidney Poitier: Man, Actor, Icon (2004), p.8. Poitier grew up in the Bahamas (then a British colony) but because of his birth in the U.S., he automatically gained U.S. citizenship.
Poitier lived with his family on Cat Island until he was ten, when they moved to Nassau.[tpl]cite episode|title=Sidney Poitier|series=Oprah Presents Master Class|network=Oprah Winfrey Network|season=1|number=7|airdate=April 22, 2012|url=http://www.oprah.com/topics/entertainment/movies/actors/sidney-poitier.htm[/tpl]Poitier, Sidney.

===Acting career===

Poitier joined the American Negro Theater, but was rejected by audiences. Contrary to what was expected of black actors at the time, Poitier's tone deafness made him unable to sing.Goudsouzian; Sidney Poitier; p 69, 133 Determined to refine his acting skills and rid himself of his noticeable Bahamian accent, he spent the next six months dedicating himself to achieving theatrical success. On his second attempt at the theater, he was noticed and given a leading role in the Broadway production Lysistrata, for which he received good reviews. By the end of 1949, he had to choose between leading roles on stage and an offer to work for Darryl F. Zanuck in the film No Way Out (1950). His performance in No Way Out, as a doctor treating a white bigot (played by Richard Widmark), was noticed and led to more roles, each considerably more interesting and more prominent than those most black actors of the time were offered. Poitier's breakout role was as a member of an incorrigible high school class in Blackboard Jungle (1955).
Poitier was the first male black actor to be nominated for a competitive Academy Award (for The Defiant Ones, 1958). He was also the first black actor to win the Academy Award for Best Actor (for Lilies of the Field in 1963). (James Baskett was the first black male to receive an Oscar, an Honorary Academy Award for his performance as Uncle Remus in the Walt Disney production of Song of the South in 1948, while Hattie McDaniel predated them both, winning as Best Supporting Actress for her role in 1939's Gone with the Wind, making her the first black person to be nominated for and receive an Oscar). His satisfaction at this honor was undermined by his concerns that this award was more of the industry congratulating itself for having him as a token and it would inhibit him from asking for more substantive considerations afterward.[tpl]cite book|last=Harris|first=Mark|title=Pictures at a Revolution: Five Films and the Birth of a New Hollywood|year=2008|publisher=Penguin Press|pages=58–9[/tpl] Poitier worked relatively little over the following year; he remained the only major black actor and the roles offered were predominately typecast as a soft-spoken appeaser.[tpl]cite book|last=Ibid|pages=81–2[/tpl]
He acted in the first production of A Raisin in the Sun on Broadway in 1959, and later starred in the film version released in 1961. He also gave memorable performances in The Bedford Incident (1965), and A Patch of Blue (1965) co-starring Elizabeth Hartman and Shelley Winters. In 1967, he was the most successful draw at the box office, the commercial peak of his career, with three popular films, Guess Who's Coming to Dinner; To Sir, with Love and In the Heat of the Night. The last film featured his most successful character, Virgil Tibbs, a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, detective whose subsequent career was the subject of two sequels: They Call Me MISTER Tibbs! (1970) and The Organization (1971).
Poitier began to be criticized for being typecast as over-idealized black characters who were not permitted to have any sexuality or personality faults, such as his character in Guess Who's Coming To Dinner. Poitier was aware of this pattern himself, but was conflicted on the matter: he wanted more varied roles, but also felt obliged to set a good example with his characters to defy previous stereotypes, as he was the only major black actor in the American film industry at the time. For instance, in 1966 he turned down an opportunity to play the lead in an NBC production of Othello with that spirit in mind.[tpl]cite book|last=Harris|page=161[/tpl] In 2001, Poitier received an Honorary Academy Award for his overall contribution to American cinema.  With the death of Ernest Borgnine in 2012, Poitier became the oldest living man to have won the Academy Award for Best Actor.[tpl]cite web|title=Ernest Borgnine's death makes Sidney Poitier the oldest living best actor Oscar winner|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-31749_162-57469520-10391698/ernest-borgnines-death-makes-sidney-poitier-the-oldest-living-best-actor-oscar-winner/|work=Celebrity Circuit|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=July 27, 2012|author=Lauren Moraski|date=July 10, 2012[/tpl] On March 2, 2014, Poitier appeared with Angelina Jolie at the 86th Academy Awards, to present the Best Director award. He was given a standing ovation.
