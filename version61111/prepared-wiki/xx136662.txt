The Ford Quadricycle was the first vehicle developed by Henry Ford. Ford's first car was a simple frame with an ethanol-powered engine and four bicycle wheels mounted on it.
The earliest cars were hand built, one by one, and very expensive.  The peculiar machines were seen as toys for the rich.[tpl]cite book |title=Crazy Cars |last=Doeden |first=Matt |year=2007 |publisher=Lerner Publications |isbn= 978-0-8225-6565-9|url=http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=Nzvq_4WqIjQC&oi=fnd&pg=PA4&dq=quadricycle+ford&ots=uzqmRIUD-D&sig=0qmQCUnGkdmFpU_AGOCrTSOJB5M#v=onepage&q=quadricycle%20ford&f=false[/tpl]
In the 1890s, the "horseless carriage" was a relatively new idea, with no one having a fixed, universal idea of what a car should look like or how it should work.  Most of the first car builders were inventors, rather than businessmen, working with their imaginations and the parts they had on hand.  Thus, the invention of the Quadricycle marks an important innovation as a proto-automobile that would lay the foundation for future, more practical designs to follow.

Ford put the finishing touches on his pure ethanol-powered motor After more than two years of experimentation, Ford, at the age of 32, had completed his first experimental automobile. He dubbed his creation the "Quadricycle," so named because it ran on four bicycle tires, and/or because of the means through which the engine drove the back wheels.Brinkley, David, Wheels for the World: Henry Ford, His Company, and a Century of Progress, (New York: Penguin Group, 2003), p.22 The success of the little vehicle led to the founding of the Henry Ford Company and then later the Ford Motor Company in 1903.The Showroom of Automotive History: 1896 Quadricycle
