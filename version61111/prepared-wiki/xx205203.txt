Floyd Kuptana (born 1964) is an Inuit sculptor born in the former settlement at Cape Parry, later moving with his family to nearby Paulatuk, Northwest Territories, Canada. He began his career by helping his cousins Francis and Abraham Angik Ruben to sand and polish their carvings, later working as an apprentice to David Ruben Piqtoukun. He has produced his own work since leaving the apprenticeship in 1992, and now resides in Toronto. He is brother to carver Robert Kuptana.
Floyd Kuptana's sculptures of soapstone, serpentine, alabaster and other stone are noted for their imagery of transformation between animal and human. The artist's work relates both to the shamanic beliefs of the Inuit, and his own experiences.
