The BMW Championship is a professional golf tournament which is the third of four FedEx Cup playoff events on the PGA Tour schedule. Introduced in 2007, the BMW Championship was previously known as the Western Open. The Western Golf Association, which founded and ran the Western Open, runs the BMW Championship. In 2012 and 2013, the PGA Tour named the BMW Championship its Tournament of the Year. https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/usa/pressDetail.html?title=2013-bmw-championship-earns-pga-tour%25E2%2580%2599s-tournament-of-the-year-honor&outputChannelId=9&id=T0160644EN_US&left_menu_item=node__5122

==Tournament format==

The BMW Championship is open to the top 70 PGA Tour golfers following the Deutsche Bank Championship. Only 70 players qualify for the event, therefore there is no cut after two days. FedEx Cup points amassed during the regular PGA Tour season and then during the two preceding playoff events determine the participants. The top 30 FedEx Cup points leaders following the BMW Championship advance to The Tour Championship, where the FedEx Cup Champion will be determined.
The BMW Championship was primarily held at Cog Hill Golf & Country Club in Lemont, Illinois. In 2008, the championship was held at Bellerive Country Club in the St. Louis suburb of Town and Country, Missouri. In 2012, due to the Ryder Cup being contested at nearby Medinah Country Club, Crooked Stick Golf Club in Carmel, Indiana hosted the championship. The championship will be at Cherry Hills Country Club in Cherry Hills Village, Colorado in 2014.Cherry Hills to host 2014 BMW Championship

==Western Open==

The Western Open was first played in 1899. For many years, the Western was played in and out of the state of Illinois, before eventually settling down in the greater Chicago area itself. The Western Golf Association (WGA) ran the Western Open throughout its entire history (1899–2006), and continues to run the tournament under its new title. These are, however, two entirely different events in terms of playing format and invitational criteria. The Western Open was like any other regular PGA Tour stop – although it was once considered to be one of golf's majors. Its invitational criteria mirrored the PGA Tour Exemption Categories with one exception - the winner of the Western Amateur, another WGA-sponsored event, was invited to play in the Western Open. The BMW Championship is part of the FedEx Cup Playoffs, and only the top 70 FedEx Cup points leaders at the start of the BMW event will be eligible to play.
