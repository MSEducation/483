Nannette Streicher née Stein (2 January 1769, Augsburg – 16 January 1833, Vienna) was a German piano maker, composer, music educator and writer.

==Life==

Nannette was the sixth child of the organ and piano maker Johann Andreas Stein in Augsburg (1728–1792) and his wife Magdalena (born Euphrosina Large 1742-1800). Early on, she received piano lessons from her father, who was influenced by his friend Ignaz von Beeck. In Augsburg Nannette Stein played piano at concerts, sometimes with her friend Nanette von Schaden. In 1787 she sang "some minor arias" in a concert. She had to give up singing later for health reasons. After her father's death on 29 February 1792, she continued the piano workshop independently.
In 1793 she married the musician Johann Andreas Streicher (1761–1833) and moved with him to Vienna in 1794. She took over her father's business, initially with her younger brother Matthias Andreas Stein (1776-1842), and after 1802 continued under her name (Nannette Streicher née Stein). With the support of her husband and from 1824 to 1825 with their son, Johann Baptist (1796–1871) as a partner, the business became an important piano manufacturer. Johann Baptist Streicher was the sole owner of the factory, which under his leadership acquired many patents and became world famous. The company was sold in 1896 to the brothers Stingl.
Nannette Streicher and Andreas were not only piano makers. The concerts she organised were an important contribution to Viennese musical life, first in her apartment, then from 1812 in a piano salon she organized, which offered young artists welcome opportunities for performance. The friends and customers of the couple included Ludwig van Beethoven and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.
Nannette Streicher sometimes played in private before the friends and visitors of the music circle, sometimes together with her daughter Sophie (1797–1840), an equally gifted piano player. Her circle included many great musicians of Vienna, and her friendship with Beethoven is documented in more than sixty letters, in which the composer sought advice and assistance in household and educational questions, after he was granted custody of his nephew Karl.
Nanette Streicher died on 16 January 1833 after two months of illness.
