==Education, war & business==

Owen was born at Penllwyn, Aberystwyth. He was educated at Ardwyn Grammar School and the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth where he gained an MA degree.  He worked as a schoolteacher in London until 1914 but then joined the London Welsh Battalion (15th Royal Welch Fusiliers) as an officer. He served in France and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order in 1916. He was promoted to Brigade Major and twice mentioned in dispatches. By 1948 however he was being referred to as having achieved the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel.The Times, 15.10.48 After the war, he was called to the Bar by Grays Inn but the law was a subordinate interest to business and politics. He became a member of the London Stock Exchange and went into the oil business. He became president of British Controlled Oilfields which had interests in Venezuela and the Caribbean and was on the board of the  Trinidad Petroleum Development Company as well as having interests in other commercial and trading companies.The Times, 27 September 1963

==Politics==

Owen was elected as Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for Caernarvonshire at the 1923 general election. He defended the seat at the 1929 general election as a Liberal, beating Labour, Conservative and Welsh Nationalist opposition with a majority of 3,460.Colin Cross (ed.) Life with Lloyd George; The Diaries of A J Sylvester, 1931-45, Macmillan, 1975 p46 At the 1931 election he was styled an Independent Liberal. He held his seat  against Labour and two Nationalist opponents but by the much narrower majority of 694.Cross, op cit p46 At the next election in 1935, Owen again stood as an Independent Liberal  against Labour and Nationalist opposition, increasing his majority to 1,497.Cross, op cit p136 At Labour’s landslide victory in the 1945 general election, he again had no Conservative candidate to contend with but he once more faced Labour and Welsh Nationalist challenge. He was beaten by the similarly named Labour candidate Goronwy Owen Roberts by a majority of over 6,000.Not updated: UK General Election results: July 1945

==The Lloyd George Family Group of MPs==

Goronwy Owen was distantly related to David Lloyd George by marriage;Mervyn Jones, A Radical Life: The Biography of Megan Lloyd George; Hutchinson, 1991 p.92 his wife Gladwyn, whom he married in 1925, was the sister of Edna, the wife of Gwilym Lloyd George. During the Liberal splits of the 1930s Owen was therefore part of Lloyd George’s so-called family group of four Independent Liberal MPs which also comprised,Lloyd George, his daughter Lady Megan Lloyd George and his son Gwilym.The Times, 31.10.31 In August 1931 the Lloyd George family group initially supported the formation of the National government. Gwilym became a junior minister at the Board of Trade and Owen became a government whip, taking the post of Comptroller of the Household. However they broke with the coalition over the issue of Free Trade and resigned their government posts in October.Cross, op cit pp 37 & 40 For a brief time also in 1931 Owen was Liberal Chief Whip in the House of Commons.David & Gareth Butler, British Political Facts, 1900-1994, Macmillan 1994 He was knighted in the New Years Honours List of 1944 for political and public services.The Times, 1.1.44 The family group re-took the Liberal Whip immediately after the 1935 General Election.
