[[Canadian federal election, 1874]]

CATEGORIES: Canadian federal elections by year, 1874 elections in Canada

The Canadian federal election of 1874 was held on January 22, 1874, to elect members  of the Canadian House of Commons of the 3rd Parliament of Canada.  Sir John A. Macdonald, who had recently been forced out of office as prime minister, and his Conservatives were defeated by the Liberal Party under their new leader Prime Minister Alexander Mackenzie.
Macdonald's government had been forced to resign on November 5, 1873 because of allegations of corruption relating to the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway (see the Pacific Scandal).  The Liberals under Mackenzie formed a government two days later with an election called for January. The Tories were unable to recover from the scandal and lost the election as a result. 
The election was the first to occur following Prince Edward Island's entry into Confederation, and the first to use secret ballots in Canada.
Voter turn-out: 69.6%
