==Life and career==

Geisler entered show business as a child actor in 1994 through the phenomenal variety kiddie/teen gag show Ang TV. A year later, he became officially a part of ABS-CBN's roster of rising homegrown talents as a member of the elite Star Circle Batch 5. He was considered as one of the network's most promising young stars alongside John Lloyd Cruz and Marc Solis in the boy trio "Koolits", where he was once paired up with Kristine Hermosa. 
Geisler is one of the most controversial young actors in his generation. While his performance as an actor is stellar and his career becoming stiff, he has confessed to being addicted to alcohol and has been involved in numerous brawls. One of the said brawls is a bar scuffle, in fact, left him with two visible scars on his left cheek. His own mother eventually signed him up in a detox facility (for 10 days) thus helping him earn the nickname as the "Wild Child"  of Pinoy Big Brother: Celebrity Edition 2 and recently as the newest "Bad Boy" image in Philippine Showbiz.
He is currently facing a lawsuit against fellow former Pinoy Big Brother housemate Yayo Aguila's daughter Patricia accusing him of an alleged sexual harassment in which Geisler has denied engaging. The case is on-going as Geisler still appeared in his several TV series projects such as Eva Fonda, Tayong Dalawa (The Two of Us), The Wedding and others to name a few. Geisler also faced a lawsuit filed by actress Yasmien Kurdi for another alleged sexual harassment case.  
Geisler has considered changing network from ABS-CBN to GMA Network after being offered to be a part of SRO Cinemaserye of GMA.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/161500/New-Kapuso-star-Baron-Geisler-hoping-to-get-positive-publicity |title=New Kapuso star Baron Geisler hoping to get positive publicity | Showbiz | GMA News Online |publisher=Gmanews.tv |date=2009-05-16 |accessdate=2014-02-20[/tpl] Yet, he remained a free lance actor appearing to both networks.

He was released less than 24 hours after a mutual settlement from both parties as the file was withdrawn by dela Rosa. Geisler claimed that the incident was just for self-defense purposes. It was also later found out that Geisler was intoxicated that time.
