On January 30, 2014, Senator Liu voted in favor of California Senate Constitutional Amendment No.5.[tpl]cite web|url=http://legiscan.com/CA/rollcall/SCA5/id/313934|title=Bill documents|accessdate=30 Jan 2014[/tpl]"Prop 209 changes spark protests" China Daily USA 2014-02-28 The proposed bill asks California voters to repeal provisions of Proposition 209 and permit state universities to consider an applicant's race, ethnicity or national origin in making admissions decisions. Introducing racial consideration back to the public education system caused massive controversy. Only days after her vote on SCA-5, angry people flocked to her facebook page questioning her vote on SCA-5. In a response,[tpl]cite web| url=https://www.facebook.com/SenatorLiu | title=Senator Liu on Facebook[/tpl] Liu indicated that California Proposition 209 set "outdated barriers" to groups of "underrepresented students eligible for U.C. and C.S.U." and that their enrollment "has not kept pace with the proportion of the high school graduating class they now represent."  On February 27, after hearing strong opposition to the bill from the Asian-American community, Senator Liu, along with Senators Leland Yee and Ted Lieu, who had also voted for the bill, jointly issued a statement calling for the bill to be withheld pending further consultations with the "affected communities."André Coleman & Kevin Uhrich, "A Giant Awakens" Pasadena Weekly Mar. 12, 2014
