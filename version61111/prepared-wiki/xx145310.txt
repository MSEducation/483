Hemipsilichthys nimius is a species of catfish belonging to the family Loricariidae. The species is only known from two small rivers in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil: the Perequê-Áçu and the Taquari.
This is a fairly typical loricariid with a broad head and large mouth used for adhesion to rocks in fast-flowing water. Colouring is generally pale brown with darker blotches with standard length up to [tpl]convert|10.5|cm|in[/tpl]. It can be distinguished from all its congeners by the anatomy of the dorsal fin: eight branched rays are present instead of seven and there is a membrane connecting the last ray to the back of the fish.
