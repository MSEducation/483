[[Human68k]]

CATEGORIES: Disk operating systems

Human68k is an operating system for Sharp Corporation's personal workstation X68000. It was developed by SHARP and Hudson Soft.
Generally, it looks like Microsoft's MS-DOS, but does not have IO.SYS and MSDOS.SYS. This is because the Human68K developers did not plan to port the software to other hardware platforms. Hardware-dependent operations are performed by the X68000's IOCS.
The file extension of executable programs is ".X". The command line shell can be started by executing COMMAND.X.
Recently, a relocatable COMMAND.R was developed and released as free software.
