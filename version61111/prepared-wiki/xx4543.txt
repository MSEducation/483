A hedge fund is a pooled investment vehicle administered by a professional management firm, and often structured as a limited partnership, limited liability company, or similar vehicle.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9zqVDo9_hQQC&pg=PA7&dq=pooled+investment+hedge+fund&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ETU3UtelDuaQigLGuYFA&ved=0CFQQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=pooled%20investment%20hedge%20fund&f=false |author=Stuart A.

Hedge funds are made available only to certain sophisticated or accredited investors and cannot be offered or sold to the general public. As such, they generally avoid direct regulatory oversight, bypass licensing requirements applicable to investment companies, and operate with greater flexibility than mutual funds and other investment funds.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zVubHUSOxpoC&pg=PT52&dq=hedge+funds+structure+oversight&hl=en&sa=X&ei=LlllUveGB-m6yAGYi4H4BA&ved=0CH8Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=hedge%20funds%20structure%20oversight&f=false |title= Handbook of Hedge Funds |author= François-Serge Lhabitant |year=2007 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=0470026634[/tpl] Hedge funds have existed for many decades, but have become increasingly popular in recent years, growing to be one of the world's major investment vehicles and sources of capital.Lemke, Lins, Hoenig & Rube, Hedge Funds and Other Private Funds: Regulation and Compliance (Thomson West, 2013-2014 ed.).
Hedge funds are most often open-ended and allow additions or withdrawals by their investors (generally on a monthly or quarterly basis).Gerald T. Lins, Thomas P. Lemke, Kathryn L. Hoenig & Patricia Schoor Rube, Hedge Funds and Other Private Funds:  Regulation and Compliance §§ 5:19 - 5:22 (2013 - 2014 ed.). A hedge fund's value is calculated as a share of the fund's net asset value, meaning that increases and decreases in the value of the fund's investment assets (and fund expenses) are directly reflected in the amount an investor can later withdraw.
Many hedge fund investment strategies aim to achieve a positive return on investment regardless of whether markets are rising or falling ("absolute return"). Hedge fund managers often invest money of their own in the fund they manage, which serves to align their own interests with those of the investors in the fund.[tpl]cite book |title=The Handbook of Alternative Assets |last=Anson |first=Mark J.P. |year=2006 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |location=|isbn=0-471-98020-X |page=123[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Hedge Fund Manager's Farewell |first=Joe |last=Nocera |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/16/business/16nocera.htm |newspaper=The New York Times |date=16 May 2009 |accessdate=16 March 2011[/tpl] A hedge fund typically pays its investment manager an annual management fee (for example 1 percent of the assets of the fund), and a performance fee (for example 20% of the increase in the fund's net asset value during the year).Gerald T. Lins, Thomas P. Lemke, Kathryn L. Hoenig & Patricia Schoor Rube, Hedge Funds and Other Private Funds:  Regulation and Compliance §§ 3:24 - 3:33 (2013 - 2014 ed.). Some hedge funds have several billion dollars of assets under management (AUM).

Because hedge funds are not sold to the general public or retail investors, the funds and their managers have historically been exempt from some of the regulation that governs other funds and investment managers with regard to how the fund may be structured and how strategies and techniques are employed. Regulations passed in the United States and Europe after the 2008 credit crisis were intended to increase government oversight of hedge funds and eliminate certain regulatory gaps.[tpl]cite news |title=Institutions Damp Hedge Fund 'Startup Spirit,' Citi's Roe Says |first=Netty |last=Ismail |url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-02-21/institutions-damp-hedge-fund-startup-spirit-citi-s-roe-says.html |newspaper=Bloomberg Businessweek |date=21 February 2011 |accessdate=11 March 2011[/tpl]

==History==

During the US bull market of the 1920s, there were numerous private investment vehicles available to wealthy investors. Of that period the best known today is the Graham-Newman Partnership, founded by Benjamin Graham and Jerry Newman, which was cited by Warren Buffett in a 2006 letter to the Museum of American Finance as an early hedge fund.[tpl]cite web|author=Commentary by Chet Currier - 29 September 2006 00:06 EDT |url=http://www.bloomberg.com-citations.us/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=a1UhnH5DkE34 |title=Buffett Says Hedge Funds Are Older Than You Think: Chet Currier |publisher=Bloomberg |date=29 September 2006 |accessdate=26 November 2011[/tpl]

In the 1970s, hedge funds specialized in a single strategy and most fund managers followed the long/short equity model.[tpl]clarify|date=February 2013[/tpl] Many hedge funds closed during the recession of 1969–70 and the 1973–1974 stock market crash due to heavy losses. They received renewed attention in the late 1980s. During the 1990s, the number of hedge funds increased significantly, funded with wealth created during the 1990s stock market rise. The increased interest was due to the aligned-interest compensation structure (i.e. common financial interests) and the promise of above high returns.[tpl]cite book |title=Hedge funds of funds investing: an investor's guide |last=Nicholas |first=Joseph G. |year=2004 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=1-57660-124-2 |page=11[/tpl] Over the next decade hedge fund strategies expanded to include: credit arbitrage, distressed debt, fixed income, quantitative, and multi-strategy. US institutional investors such as pension and endowment funds began allocating greater portions of their portfolios to hedge funds.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]

==Strategies==

Hedge funds employ a wide range of trading strategies but classifying them is difficult due to the rapidity with which they change and evolve.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.iam.uk.com/press/lse-publications/An-Introduction-to-Hedge-Fund-Strategies.pdf |title=An Introduction to Hedge Fund Strategy |first=Gregory |last=Connor |first=Teo |last=Lasarte |work=The London School of Economics and Political Science |publisher=International Asset Management Ltd. |accessdate=17 March 2011[/tpl] However, hedge fund strategies are generally said to fall into four main categories: global macro, directional, event-driven, and relative value (arbitrage).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.capitalbeacon.com/Hedge_Fund_Tools.html |title=Hedge Fund Tools – Investment Strategies |publisher=Capital Beacon |accessdate=18 March 2011[/tpl] These four categories are distinguished by investment style and each have their own risk and return characteristics. Managed futures or multi-strategy funds may not fit into these categories, but they are, nonetheless, popular strategies with investors.[tpl]cite news |title=Hottest alternative?Managed-futures funds, research shows |url=http://www.investmentnews.com/article/20101010/REG/310109957 |work=Investment News |date=10 October 2010 |accessdate=31 March 2011[/tpl] It is possible for hedge funds to commit to a certain strategy[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fortress-strategy.com/Decimation.pdf |title=Decimation of Fortunes: Where Do We Go From Here? |first=Bill |last=Sadek |publisher=Fortress Strategy USA |format=PDF |accessdate=17 March 2011[/tpl] or employ multiple strategies to allow flexibility, for risk management purposes, or to achieve diversified returns. The hedge fund's prospectus, also known as an offering memorandum, offers potential investors information about key aspects of the fund, including the fund's investment strategy, investment type, and leverage limit.
The elements contributing to a hedge fund strategy include: the hedge fund's approach to the market; the particular instrument used; the market sector the fund specializes in (e.g. healthcare); the method used to select investments; and the amount of diversification within the fund. There are a variety of market approaches to different asset classes, including equity, fixed income, commodity, and currency. Instruments used include: equities, fixed income, futures, options and swaps. Strategies can be divided into those in which investments can be selected by managers, known as "discretionary/qualitative", or those in which investments are selected using a computerized system, known as "systematic/quantitative".[tpl]cite book |title=Absolute Returns: the risks and opportunities of hedge fund investing |first=Alexander|last=Ineichen |year=2002 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |location= |isbn=0-471-25120-8 |page=192[/tpl] The amount of diversification within the fund can vary; funds may be multi-strategy, multi-fund, multi-market, multi-manager or a combination.
Sometimes hedge fund strategies are described as absolute return and are classified as either market neutral or directional. Market neutral funds have less correlation to overall market performance by "neutralizing" the effect of market swings, whereas directional funds utilize trends and inconsistencies in the market and have greater exposure to the market's fluctuations.[tpl]cite book |title=Guide to Hedge Funds |last=Coggan |first=Philip |year=2011 |publisher=The Economist Newspaper Ltd |edition=2nd[/tpl]

===Global macro===

Hedge funds utilizing a global macro investing strategy take sizable positions in share, bond or currency markets in anticipation of global macroeconomic events in order to generate a risk-adjusted return. Global macro fund managers use macroeconomic ("big picture") analysis based on global market events and trends to identify opportunities for investment that would profit from anticipated price movements. While global macro strategies have a large amount of flexibility due to their ability to use leverage to take large positions in diverse investments in multiple markets, the timing of the implementation of the strategies is important in order to generate attractive, risk-adjusted returns.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cai.emory.edu/documents/HF_Strategies.pdf |title=Hedge Fund Strategies Guide |first=Michael |last=Bartolo |date=September 2008 |work=Goizueta Business School |publisher=Emory University |accessdate=17 March 2011[/tpl] Global macro is often categorized as a directional investment strategy.
Global macro strategies can be divided into discretionary and systematic approaches. Discretionary trading is carried out by investment managers who identify and select investments; systematic trading is based on mathematical models and executed by software with limited human involvement beyond the programming and updating of the software. These strategies can also be divided into trend or counter-trend approaches depending on whether the fund attempts to profit from following trends (long or short-term) or attempts to anticipate and profit from reversals in trends.
Within global macro strategies, there are further sub-strategies including "systematic diversified", in which the fund trades in diversified markets, or "systematic currency", in which the fund trades in currency markets.[tpl]cite book |title=Wave Theory for Alternative Investments |first=Stephen |last=Walker |year=2010  |publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies |location= |isbn=0-07-174286-7 |page=348[/tpl] Other sub-strategies include those employed by commodity trading advisors (CTAs), where the fund trades in futures (or options) in commodity markets or in swaps.[tpl]cite book |title=Investment strategies of hedge funds |first=Filippo |last=Stefanini |year=2006  |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |location= |isbn= 0-470-02627-8 |page=223[/tpl] This is also known as a managed future fund. CTAs trade in commodities (such as gold) and financial instruments, including stock indices. In addition they take both long and short positions, allowing them to make profit in both market upswings and downswings.[tpl]cite book |title=Evaluating hedge fund performance |last=Tran |first=Vinh Q. |year=2006 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=0-471-68171-7 |page=54[/tpl]

===Directional===

Directional investment strategies utilize market movements, trends, or inconsistencies when picking stocks across a variety of markets. Computer models can be used, or fund managers will identify and select investments. These types of strategies have a greater exposure to the fluctuations of the overall market than do market neutral strategies. Directional hedge fund strategies include US and international long/short equity hedge funds, where long equity positions are hedged with short sales of equities or equity index options.
Within directional strategies, there are a number of sub-strategies. "Emerging markets" funds focus on emerging markets such as China and India,[tpl]cite book |title=Wave Theory for Alternative Investments |first=Stephen |last=Walker |year=2010  |publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies |location= |isbn=0-07-174286-7 |page=351[/tpl] whereas "sector funds" specialize in specific areas including technology, healthcare, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, energy and basic materials. Funds using a "fundamental growth" strategy invest in companies with more earnings growth than the overall stock market or relevant sector, while funds using a "fundamental value" strategy invest in undervalued companies.[tpl]cite book |title=Wave Theory for Alternative Investments |first=Stephen |last=Walker |year=2010  |publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies |location= |isbn=0-07-174286-7 |page=344[/tpl]  Funds that use quantitative and Financial signal processing techniques for equity trading are described as using a "quantitative directional" strategy.[tpl]cite book |title=Wave Theory for Alternative Investments |first=Stephen |last=Walker |year=2010  |publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies |location= |isbn=0-07-174286-7 |page=345[/tpl] Funds using a "short bias" strategy take advantage of declining equity prices using short positions.[tpl]cite book |title=Create Your Own ETF Hedge Fund |first=David |last=Fry |year=2008  |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |location= |isbn= 0-470-13895-5 |page=68[/tpl]

===Event-driven===

Event-driven strategies concern situations in which the underlying investment opportunity and risk are associated with an event.[tpl]cite book |title=Absolute Returns: the risks and opportunities of hedge fund investing |first=Alexander|last=Ineichen |year=2002 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |location= |isbn=0-471-25120-8 |page=182[/tpl] An event-driven investment strategy finds investment opportunities in corporate transactional events such as consolidations, acquisitions, recapitalizations, bankruptcies, and liquidations. Managers employing such a strategy capitalize on valuation inconsistencies in the market before or after such events, and take a position based on the predicted movement of the security or securities in question. Large institutional investors such as hedge funds are more likely to pursue event-driven investing strategies than traditional equity investors because they have the expertise and resources to analyze corporate transactional events for investment opportunities.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.barclayhedge.com/research/educational-articles/hedge-fund-strategy-definition/hedge-fund-strategy-event-driven.html |title=Understanding Event-Driven Investing |publisher=BarclayHedge LTD. |accessdate=17 March 2011[/tpl]
Corporate transactional events generally fit into three categories: distressed securities, risk arbitrage, and special situations. Distressed securities include such events as restructurings, recapitalizations, and bankruptcies. A distressed securities investment strategy involves investing in the bonds or loans of companies facing bankruptcy or severe financial distress, when these bonds or loans are being traded at a discount to their value. Hedge fund managers pursuing the distressed debt investment strategy aim to capitalize on depressed bond prices. Hedge funds purchasing distressed debt may prevent those companies from going bankrupt, as such an acquisition deters foreclosure by banks. While event-driven investing in general tends to thrive during a bull market, distressed investing works best during a bear market.
Risk arbitrage or merger arbitrage includes such events as mergers, acquisitions, liquidations, and hostile takeovers. Risk arbitrage typically involves buying and selling the stocks of two or more merging companies to take advantage of market discrepancies between acquisition price and stock price. The risk element arises from the possibility that the merger or acquisition will not go ahead as planned; hedge fund managers will use research and analysis to determine if the event will take place.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.barclayhedge.com/research/educational-articles/hedge-fund-strategy-definition/hedge-fund-strategy-merger-arbitrage.html |title=Understanding Merger Arbitrage |publisher=BarclayHedge LTD. |accessdate=17 March 2011[/tpl]
Special situations are events that impact the value of a company's stock, including the restructuring of a company or corporate transactions including spin-offs, share-buy-backs, security issuance/repurchase, asset sales, or other catalyst-oriented situations. To take advantage of special situations the hedge fund manager must identify an upcoming event that will increase or decrease the value of the company's equity and equity-related instruments.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.hedgefundresearch.com/index.php?fuse=indices-str#2703|title=HFR I Strategy Definitions |publisher=Hedge Fund Research Inc. |accessdate=17 March 2011[/tpl]
Other event-driven strategies include: credit arbitrage strategies, which focus on corporate fixed income securities; an activist strategy, where the fund takes large positions in companies and uses the ownership to participate in the management; a strategy based on predicting the final approval of new pharmaceutical drugs; and legal catalyst strategy, which specializes in companies involved in major lawsuits.

===Relative value===

Relative value arbitrage strategies take advantage of relative discrepancies in price between securities. The price discrepancy can occur due to mispricing of securities compared to related securities, the underlying security or the market overall. Hedge fund managers can use various types of analysis to identify price discrepancies in securities, including mathematical, technical or fundamental techniques.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.barclayhedge.com/research/definitions/Relative-Value-Arbitrage-definition.html  |title=Relative Value Arbitrage definition |publisher=BarclayHedge LTD. |accessdate=20 March 2011[/tpl] Relative value is often used as a synonym for market neutral, as strategies in this category typically have very little or no directional market exposure to the market as a whole. Other relative value sub-strategies include:

===Miscellaneous===

In addition to those strategies within the four main categories, there are several strategies that do not fit into these categorizations or can apply across several of them.

==Risk==

Because investments in hedge funds can add diversification to investment portfolios, investors may use them as a tool to reduce their overall portfolio risk exposures.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.dealbook.nytimes.com/2009/09/17/to-reduce-hedge-fund-risk-let-everyone-in/ |title=To Reduce Hedge Fund Risk, Let Everyone In |last1=Davidoff |first1=Steven M. |last2= |first2= |date=17 September 2009 |work=The New York Times |publisher= |accessdate=27 March 2011[/tpl] Managers of hedge funds use particular trading strategies and instruments with the specific aim of reducing market risks to produce risk-adjusted returns, which are consistent with investors' desired level of risk.

According to a report by the Hennessee Group, hedge funds were approximately one-third less volatile than the S&P 500 between 1993 and 2010.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.thehedgefundjournal.com/news/2010/07/22/hennessee-protecting-capital-during-market-downturns.php |title=Hennessee: Protecting capital during market downturns |date=22 July 2010 |work=Hedge Fund Journal |accessdate=30 March 2011[/tpl]

===Risk management===

Investors in hedge funds are, in most countries, required to be sophisticated qualified investors who are assumed to be aware of the investment risks, and accept these risks because of the potential returns relative to those risks. Fund managers may employ extensive risk management strategies in order to protect the fund and investors. According to the Financial Times, "big hedge funds have some of the most sophisticated and exacting risk management practices anywhere in asset management."[tpl]cite news |title=Hedge funds: Stringent controls on losses and investment |first=Sam |last=Jones |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5f253ab8-5371-11e0-86e6-00144feab49a.html#ixzz1ICqUvUmv |newspaper=Financial Times |date=21 March 2011 |accessdate=30 March 2011[/tpl] Hedge fund managers may hold a large number of investment positions for short durations and are likely to have a particularly comprehensive risk management system in place. Funds may have "risk officers" who assess and manage risks but are not otherwise involved in trading, and may employ strategies such as formal portfolio risk models. A variety of measuring techniques and models may be used to calculate the risk incurred by a hedge fund's activities; fund managers may use different models depending on their fund's structure and investment strategy.Jaeger, Robert. A. (2003) Mcgraw Hill, All About Hedge Funds "A hedge fund is an actively managed investment fund" Some factors, such as normality of return, are not always accounted for by conventional risk measurement methodologies. Funds which use value at risk as a measurement of risk may compensate for this by employing additional models such as drawdown and "time under water" to ensure all risks are captured.[tpl]Citation|title=López de Prado, M. and A. Peijan: Measuring Loss Potential of Hedge Fund Strategies| work=Journal of Alternative Investments, Vol. 7, No. 1, pp. 7–31, Summer|year=2004|ssrn=641702[/tpl]
In addition to assessing the market-related risks that may arise from an investment, investors commonly employ operational due diligence to assess the risk that error or fraud at a hedge fund might result in loss to the investor. Considerations will include the organization and management of operations at the hedge fund manager, whether the investment strategy is likely to be sustainable, and the fund's ability to develop as a company.[tpl]cite book |title=Hedge funds: crossing the institutional frontier |last=Jaffer |first=Sohail |year=2006 |publisher=Euromoney Books |isbn=1-84374-268-3 |pages=113–4[/tpl]

Since hedge funds are private entities and have few public disclosure requirements, this is sometimes perceived as a lack of transparency.[tpl]cite book |title=Absolute Returns: the risks and opportunities of hedge fund investing |first=Alexander |last=Ineichen |year=2002 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=0-471-25120-8 |pages=441–4[/tpl] Another common perception of hedge funds is that their managers are not subject to as much regulatory oversight and/or registration requirements as other financial investment managers, and more prone to manager-specific idiosyncratic risks such as style drifts, faulty operations, or fraud. New regulations introduced in the US and the EU as of 2010 require hedge fund managers to report more information, leading to greater transparency.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.asiaone.com/Business/News/My%2BMoney/Story/A1Story20101129-249737.html |title=Call For Joint Effort to Protect Hedge Fund Business |first= Felda |last=Chay |date=27 November 2010 |work=The Business Times Singapore |publisher=Singapore Press Holdings |accessdate=8 March 2011[/tpl] In addition, investors, particularly institutional investors, are encouraging further developments in hedge fund risk management, both through internal practices and external regulatory requirements. The increasing influence of institutional investors has led to greater transparency: hedge funds increasingly provide information to investors including valuation methodology, positions and leverage exposure.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.benefitscanada.com/investments/other-investments/institutional-investors-changing-the-rules-of-hedge-fund-investing-9126 |title=Institutional investors changing the rules of hedge fund investing |last1=White |first1=Jody |date=25 January 2010 |work=BenefitsCanada.com |accessdate=30 March 2011[/tpl]

===Risks shared with other investment types===

Hedge funds share many of the same types of risk as other investment classes, including liquidity risk and manager risk.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.math.ethz.ch/~embrechts/RM/jaeger.pdf |title=Risk Management for Hedge Fund Portfolios |first=Lars |last=Jaeger |date=28 April 2005 |work=Presentation at ETHZ Technische Hochschule Zürich |publisher=Partners Group |format=PDF |accessdate=17 March 2011[/tpl] Liquidity refers to the degree to which an asset can be bought and sold or converted to cash; similar to private equity funds, hedge funds employ a lock-up period during which an investor cannot remove money. Manager risk refers to those risks which arise from the management of funds. As well as specific risks such as style drift, which refers to a fund manager "drifting" away from an area of specific expertise, manager risk factors include valuation risk, capacity risk, concentration risk and leverage risk. Valuation risk refers to the concern that the net asset value of investments may be inaccurate;[tpl]cite book |title=Fund of Funds Investing: A Roadmap to Portfolio Diversification |last1=Strachman |first1=Daniel A.  |last2=Bookbinder |first2=Richard S.  |year=2009 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=0-470-25876-4 |pages=120–1[/tpl] capacity risk can arise from placing too much money into one particular strategy, which may lead to fund performance deterioration;[tpl]cite web |url= http://math.nyu.edu/faculty/avellane/HFCapacity.pdf |title=What is a Hedge Fund |first=Gregory |last=Avellanda |first=Marco |last=Besson |first=Paul |publisher=New York University |accessdate=28 March 2011[/tpl] and concentration risk may arise if a fund has too much exposure to a particular investment, sector, trading strategy, or group of correlated funds.[tpl]cite web |url= http://knowledgebase.abcquant.com/index.php?option=com_kb&task=article&article=11 |title=Concentration Risk |year=2008 |publisher=Quant Risk Group |accessdate=29 March 2011[/tpl] These risks may be managed through defined controls over conflict of interest, restrictions on allocation of funds, and set exposure limits for strategies.
Many investment funds use leverage, the practice of borrowing money, trading on margin, or using derivatives to obtain market exposure in excess of that provided by investors' capital. Although leverage can increase potential returns, the opportunity for larger gains is weighed against the possibility of greater losses. Hedge funds employing leverage are likely to engage in extensive risk management practices.[tpl]cite web |url=http://efmaefm.org/0EFMSYMPOSIUM/Toronto-2011/papers/Gerakos.pdf |title=How Do Hedge Funds Manage Portfolio Risk? |first1=Gavin |last1=Cassar |first2=Joseph |last2=Gerakos |work=EFM Symposium |publisher=European Financial Management Association |format=PDF |accessdate=17 March 2011[/tpl] In comparison with investment banks, hedge fund leverage is relatively low; according to a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper, the average leverage for investment banks is 14.2, compared to between 1.5 and 2.5 for hedge funds.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Ang |first1=Andrew |last2=Gorovyy |first2=Sergiy |last3=van Inwegen |first3=Gregory |year=2011 |title=Hedge Fund Leverage: NBER Working Paper No. 16801 |journal= |volume= |issue= |pages= |publisher=NBER |doi= |url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w16801.pdf |accessdate=4 April 2011[/tpl]
Some types of funds, including hedge funds, are perceived as having a greater appetite for risk, with the intention of maximizing returns,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.barclayhedge.com/research/educational-articles/hedge-fund-strategy-definition/what-is-a-hedge-fund.html |title=What is a Hedge Fund |publisher=BarclayHedge LTD |accessdate=28 March 2011[/tpl] subject to the risk tolerance of investors and the fund manager. Managers will have an additional incentive to increase risk oversight when their own capital is invested in the fund.

==Fees and remuneration==

===Fees paid to hedge funds===

Hedge fund management firms typically charge their funds both a management fee and a performance fee.
Management fees are calculated as a percentage of the fund's net asset value and typically range from 1% to 4% per annum, with 2% being standard.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/cf7f91e2-f3f0-11dd-9c4b-0000779fd2ac.html |title=Hedge fund investors have a great chance to cut fees |work=Financial Times |date=6 February 2009 |accessdate=14 August 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news |last=Hulbert |first=Mark |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/04/business/yourmoney/04stra.html |title=2 + 20, And Other Hedge Math |work=The New York Times |date=4 March 2007 |accessdate=26 November 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_20/b4034053.htm |title=Hedge Fund Fees: The Pressure Builds |publisher=Businessweek.com |date=4 March 2007 |accessdate=26 November 2011[/tpl] They are usually expressed as an annual percentage, but calculated and paid monthly or quarterly. Management fees for hedge funds are designed to cover the operating costs of the manager, whereas the performance fee provides the manager's profits. However, due to economies of scale the management fee from larger funds can generate a significant part of a manager's profits, and as a result some fees have been criticized by some public pension funds, such as CalPERS, for being too high.Imogen Rose-Smith, "Public Pension Plans Bet Their Future On Hedge Funds," Institutional Investor, 20 June 2011
The performance fee is typically 20% of the fund's profits during any year, though they range between 10% and 50%. Performance fees are intended to provide an incentive for a manager to generate profits.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eipny.com/pdf/HedgeFundMathWhyFeesMatter110907.pdf |title=Hedge Fund Math: Why Fees Matter (Newsletter), Epoch Investment Partners Inc. |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=14 August 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/lists/2006/54/biz_06rich400_Steven-A-Cohen_PZMO.html |title=Forbes 400 Richest Americans: Stephen A. Cohen |publisher=Forbes.com |date=19 September 2006 |accessdate=14 August 2010[/tpl] Performance fees have been criticized by Warren Buffett, who believes that because hedge funds share only the profits and not the losses, such fees create an incentive for high-risk investment management. Performance fee rates have fallen since the start of the credit crunch.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.opalesque.com/IndustryUpdates/691/HFR_Hedge_fund_liquidations_fall_to_levels217.html |title= Incentive fees fall since start of the financial crisis |date=10 March 2010|author=Opalesque[/tpl]
Almost all hedge fund performance fees include a "high water mark" (or "loss carryforward provision"), which means that the performance fee only applies to net profits (i.e., profits after losses in previous years have been recovered). This prevents managers from receiving fees for volatile performance, though a manager will sometimes close a fund that has suffered serious losses and start a new fund, rather than attempting to recover the losses over a number of years without performance fee.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/aug2005/nf2005088_1711_db042.htm |title=Hedge Funds: Fees Down? Close Shop |publisher=Businessweek.com |date=8 August 2005 |accessdate=14 August 2010[/tpl]
Some performance fees include a "hurdle", so that a fee is only paid on the fund's performance in excess of a benchmark rate (e.g. LIBOR) or a fixed percentage.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aima.org/download.cfm/docid/6133E854-63FF-46FC-95347B445AE4ECFC |title=AIMA Roadmap to Hedge Funds |date= |accessdate=14 August 2010[/tpl] A "soft" hurdle means the performance fee is calculated on all the fund's returns if the hurdle rate is cleared. A "hard" hurdle is calculated only on returns above the hurdle rate.Cathleen M. Rittereiser, Lawrence E. Kochard, A  "Top Hedge Fund Investors: Stories, Strategies, and Advice", John Wiley & Sons, 20 July 2010 p. 110 A hurdle is intended to ensure that a manager is only rewarded if the fund generates returns in excess of the returns that the investor would have received if they had invested their money elsewhere.
Some hedge funds charge a redemption fee (or withdrawal fee) for early withdrawals during a specified period of time (typically a year) or when withdrawals exceed a predetermined percentage of the original investment.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hedgeworld.com/education/index.cgi?page=hedge_fund_basics |title=Hedge Funds | HedgeWorld | The Definitive Hedge Fund Community |publisher=HedgeWorld |date= |accessdate=26 November 2011[/tpl] The purpose of the fee is to discourage short-term investing, reduce turnover and deter withdrawals after periods of poor performance. Unlike management fees and performance fees, redemption fees are usually kept by the fund.

===Remuneration of portfolio managers===

Hedge fund management firms are usually owned by their portfolio managers, who are therefore entitled to any profits that the business makes. As management fees are intended to cover the firm's operating costs, performance fees (and any excess management fees) are generally distributed to the firm's owners as profits. Many managers also have large stakes in their own funds.
Top hedge fund managers earn what has been termed "extraordinary" amounts of money, with the highest-grossing getting up to $4 billion per year.[tpl]cite news |title=Pay of Hedge Fund Managers Roared Back Last Year |author=Nelson D.

==Structure==

A hedge fund is an investment vehicle that is most often structured as an offshore corporation, limited partnership or limited liability company.Gerald T. Lins, Thomas P. Lemke, Kathryn L. Hoenig & Patricia Schoor Rube, Hedge Funds and Other Private Funds:  Regulation and Compliance §§ 2:7 - 2:12 (2013 - 2014 ed.).  The fund is managed by an investment manager in the form of an organization or company that is legally and financially distinct from the hedge fund and its portfolio of assets.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=uI-cJ0ZAf5sC&pg=PA122&dq=hedge+fund+no+employees&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ZqWOUOi-L-eOiAKC5YC4DA&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=hedge%20fund%20no%20employees&f=false |title=Business Knowledge for IT in Hedge Funds  |year=2008 |isbn=0955412455 |publisher=Essvale Corporation Limited  |page=122[/tpl][tpl]cite book |author=Daniel A.

===Domicile and taxation===

The legal structure of a specific hedge fund—in particular its domicile and the type of legal entity used—is usually determined by the tax expectations of the fund's investors. Regulatory considerations will also play a role. Many hedge funds are established in offshore financial centers to avoid adverse tax consequences for its foreign and tax exempt investors.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=AA017P5CIssC&pg=PA112&lpg=PA112&dq=hedge+fund+legal+structure+offshore&source=bl&ots=e8lBIV0w2H&sig=aL4vpXHhaXkBZG9CWq7C_l0gbNc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Fg13UOWZBK3MigKOvYDwBg&ved=0CDMQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q=hedge%20fund%20legal%20structure%20offshore&f=false |author=Guy Fraser-Sampson |title=Alternative Assets: Investments for a Post-Crisis World |year=2010 |isbn=0470661372 |publisher=Wiley |page=112[/tpl][tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Hqgyll9MgkcC&pg=PA174&lpg=PA174&dq=hedge+fund+domicile+legal+structure&source=bl&ots=gMnEYDEBHr&sig=h3fqjYRYhjVCwOjVuGUEvh7gwXk&hl=en&sa=X&ei=y_Z2UK6_MonMigKW14FI&ved=0CDMQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q=hedge%20fund%20domicile%20legal%20structure&f=false |author=Mark J.

===The legal entity===

Hedge fund legal structures vary depending on location and the investor(s). US hedge funds aimed at US-based, taxable investors are generally structured as limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Limited partnerships and other flow-through taxation structures assure that investors in hedge funds are not subject to both entity-level and personal-level taxation.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zVubHUSOxpoC&pg=SA2-PA64&lpg=SA2-PA64&dq=hedge+fund+limited+partnership&source=bl&ots=qXb0JZGmH0&sig=Ch378cTQ3Zc1hq8pLHzvFDM9u8s&hl=en&sa=X&ei=-jKAUPLJKarIigKqwoHgBw&ved=0CDkQ6AEwATgK |title=Handbook of Hedge Funds |page=4.2 |author= François-Serge Lhabitant |year=2007 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=0470026634[/tpl] A hedge fund structured as a limited partnership must have a general partner.

===Types of funds===

===Side pockets===

A side pocket is a mechanism whereby a fund compartmentalizes assets that are relatively illiquid or difficult to value reliably.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fOUKPCVl29QC&pg=SA7-PA98&lpg=SA7-PA98&dq=hedge+fund+side+pocket&source=bl&ots=X4nWAKSZzQ&sig=uZsG90gDITnXr0-ixzErJKr7siU&hl=en&sa=X&ei=-cKGUNWzLYGGjALcuYGgCw&ved=0CEcQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=hedge%20fund%20side%20pocket&f=false |title=Hedge Fund Analysis: An In-Depth Guide to Evaluating Return Potential and Assessing Risks |author=Frank J.

Profits or losses from the investment are allocated on a pro rata basis only to those who are investors at the time the investment is placed into the side pocket and are not shared with new investors.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jQ_W-2vqw-4C&pg=PA16&lpg=PA16&dq=hedge+fund+side+pocket&source=bl&ots=OYVN7mmwDO&sig=1RoTU77zJ9zccGPaR6-F0nNcLNw&hl=en&sa=X&ei=y8aGUIjPMYP6iwLz34HoBw&ved=0CFMQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=hedge%20fund%20side%20pocket&f=false |title=Market Risk Management for Hedge Funds: Foundations of the Style and Implicit Value-at-Risk |last1=Duc |first1=Francois |last2=Schorderet |first2=Yann |year=2008 |publisher=Wiley |pages=15–17 |isbn=0470722991[/tpl] Funds typically carry side pocket assets "at cost" for purposes of calculating management fees and reporting net asset values. This allows fund managers to avoid attempting a valuation of the underlying investments, which may not always have a readily available market value.
Side pockets were widely used by hedge funds during the 2008 financial crisis amidst a flood of withdrawal requests. Side pockets allowed fund managers to lay away illiquid securities until market liquidity improved, a move that reduced losses. Despite these benefits, some investors complained that the practice was abused and not always transparent.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/04/28/hedgefunds-sec-idUSN2713105420100428 |title=SEC probes hedge funds' use of side pockets-WSJ |publisher=Reuters |date=27 April 2010 |accessdate=15 April 2013 |first=Joseph A. |last=Giannone[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/03/28/for-sale-illiquid-assets-hard-to-value/ |title=For Sale: Illiquid Assets, Hard to Value |author=Azam Ahmed |publisher=The New York Times |date=28 March 2011 |accessdate=15 April 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB115465505123626547.html |title='Side-Pocket' Accounts Of Hedge Funds Studied |last1=Zuckerman |first1=Gregory |last2=Patterson |first2=Scott |date=4 August 2006 |work=The Wall Street Journal |accessdate=18 April 2013[/tpl]  The SEC also has expressed concern about aggressive use of side pockets and has sanctioned certain fund managers for inappropriate use of them.Gerald T.

==Regulation==

Hedge funds must conform to the national, federal and state regulatory laws in their respective locations. The U.S. regulations and restrictions that apply to hedge funds differ from its mutual funds.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ici.org/investor_ed/brochures/faqs_hedge |title=The Differences Between Mutual Funds and Hedge Funds, April 2007 |publisher=ICI |date= |accessdate=26 November 2011[/tpl] Mutual funds, unlike hedge funds and other private funds, are subject to the Investment Company Act of 1940, which is a highly detailed and extensive regulatory regime.Lemke, Lins & Smith, Regulation of Investment Companies (Matthew Bender, 2013 ed.). According to a report by the International Organization of Securities Commissions the most common form of regulation pertains to restrictions on financial advisers and hedge fund managers in an effort to minimize client fraud. On the other hand,  U.S. hedge funds are exempt from many of the standard registration and reporting requirements because they only accept accredited investors. In 2010, regulations were enacted in the US and European Union, which introduced additional hedge fund reporting requirements.  These included the U.S.'s  Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act  and European  Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive.

In November 2010, the EU approved a law that will require all EU hedge fund managers to register with national regulatory authorities. The EU's Directive on Alternative Investment Fund Managers (AIFMD) was the first EU directive focused on  hedge fund managers. According to the EU, the aim of the directive is to provide greater monitoring and control of alternative investment funds.[tpl]cite web |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/10/572&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en |title=Directive on Alternative Investment Managers ('AIFMD'): Frequently Asked Questions |date=11 November 2010 |work=Europa |publisher=European Union |accessdate=8 March 2008[/tpl] The directive required managers to disclose more information, on a more frequent basis. It also directs hedge fund managers to hold larger amounts of capital. All hedge fund managers within the EU are subject to potential limitations on leveraged investments. The directive introduced a "passport" for hedge funds authorized in one EU country to operate throughout the EU. The scope of AIFMD is broad and encompasses managers located within the EU as well as non-EU managers that market their funds to European investors. An aspect of AIFMD which challenges established practices in the hedge funds sector is the potential restriction of remuneration through bonus deferrals and clawback provisions.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a766a03e-e47d-11e1-affe-00144feab49a.html#axzz2466ka3Qi |title=EU hedge funds face pay threat - FT.com |first=Alex |last=Barker and |first=Sam |last=Jones |work=ft.com |year=2012 |accessdate=20 August 2012[/tpl] Under the EU's 2010 Alternative Investment Fund Managers directive, offshore hedge funds using prime brokers as depositories are required to use EU-registered credit institutions before they can be sold in the EU.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ftadviser.com/InvestmentAdviser/Investments/News/article/20110228/cf8bd858-3de0-11e0-9432-00144f2af8e8/Offshores-could-struggle-under-directive-says-Collins-Meader.jsp |title=Offshores Could Struggle Under Directive, Says Collins' Meader |date=28 February 2011 |work=Investment Adviser |publisher=Financial Times Group |accessdate=8 March 2008[/tpl] The AIFMD's regulatory requirements will essentially mandate equivalent regulations for non-EU investment funds, if they wish to operate in EU markets.

==Performance==

===Measurement===

Performance statistics for individual hedge funds are difficult to obtain, as the funds have historically not been required to report their performance to a central repository and restrictions against public offerings and advertisement have led many managers to refuse to provide performance information publicly. However, summaries of individual hedge fund performance are occasionally available in industry journals[tpl]cite web|last=Willoughby |first=Jack |url=http://online.barrons.com/article/SB119101983536943198.html?mod=b_hps_9_0001_b_this_weeks_magazine_home_top |title=High Performance – Barron's Online |publisher=Online.barrons.com |date=1 October 2007 |accessdate=14 August 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/BA_HedgeFund50_071001.pdf |title=Here They Are—The Hedge Fund 50 |work=The Wall Street Journal[/tpl] and databases.[tpl]cite news |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20110304-711526.html |title=Hedge Fund Assets Near $2.5 Trillion in 2010 |first=Amy |last=Or |work=The Wall Street Journal |publisher=Dow Jones & Company, Inc. |date=4 March 2011 |accessdate=3 April 2011[/tpl] and investment consultancy Hennessee Group.

===Sector-size effect===

There is a debate over whether alpha (the manager's skill element in performance) has been diluted by the expansion of the hedge fund industry. Two reasons are given. First, the increase in traded volume may have been reducing the market anomalies that are a source of hedge fund performance. Second, the remuneration model is attracting more managers, which may dilute the talent available in the industry.[tpl]cite book |last=Lack |first=Simon |title=The Hedge Fund Mirage: The Illusion of Big Money and why it's Too Good to be True |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VLNomI8ahVQC&pg=PT18&dq=%22a+small+hedge+fund+industry+has+done+better+than+a+large+one%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=5koyUZLbPKqb0QW7-oDABA&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAA |accessdate=6 March 2013 |year=2012 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |location=New Jersey, USA |isbn=9781118164310 |page=7[/tpl][tpl]cite book |title=The Right Place for Alternative Betas in Hedge Fund Performance: an Answer to the Capacity Effect Fantasy |last1=Géhin |first1=Walter |last2=Vaissié |first2=Mathieu |url=http://faculty-research.edhec.com/servlet/com.univ.collaboratif.utils.LectureFichiergw?ID_FICHIER=1328885973094 |year=2005/06 |journal=The Journal of Alternative Investments |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=9–18 |publisher=EDHEC Risk and Asset Management Research Centre |accessdate=28 February 2013[/tpl]

===Hedge fund indices===

Indices that track hedge fund returns are, in order of development, called Non-investable, Investable and Clone.
Indices play a central and unambiguous role in traditional asset markets, where they are widely accepted as representative of their underlying portfolios. Equity and debt index fund products provide investable access to most developed markets in these asset classes. Hedge funds, however, are actively managed, so that tracking is impossible. Non-investable hedge fund indices on the other hand may be more or less representative, but returns data on many of the reference group of funds is non-public. This may result in biased estimates of their returns. In an attempt to address this problem, clone indices have been created in an attempt to replicate the statistical properties of hedge funds without being directly based on their returns data.  None of these approaches achieves the accuracy of indices in other asset classes for which there is more complete published data concerning the underlying returns.A source for hedge fund track records is the Cambridge Associates Private Equity Index; it is available at https://www.cambridgeassociates.com/foundations_endowments/working_together/specialized_expertise/alternative_assets/indicies_benchmarking.html

====Non-investable indices====

Non-investable indices are indicative in nature, and aim to represent the performance of some database of hedge funds using some measure such as mean, median or weighted mean from a hedge fund database. The databases have diverse selection criteria and methods of construction, and no single database captures all funds. This leads to significant differences in reported performance between different indices.
Although they aim to be representative, non-investable indices suffer from a lengthy and largely unavoidable list of biases.
Funds' participation in a database is voluntary, leading to self-selection bias because those funds that choose to report may not be typical of funds as a whole. For example, some do not report because of poor results or because they have already reached their target size and do not wish to raise further money..
The short lifetimes of many hedge funds means that there are many new entrants and many departures each year, which raises the problem of survivorship bias. If we examine only funds that have survived to the present, we will overestimate past returns because many of the worst-performing funds have not survived, and the observed association between fund youth and fund performance suggests that this bias may be substantial.
When a fund is added to a database for the first time, all or part of its historical data is recorded ex-post in the database. It is likely that funds only publish their results when they are favorable, so that the average performances displayed by the funds during their incubation period are inflated. This is known as "instant history bias" or "backfill bias".

====Investable indices====

Investable indices are an attempt to reduce these problems by ensuring that the return of the index is available to shareholders. To create an investable index, the index provider selects funds and develops structured products or derivative instruments that deliver the performance of the index.  When investors buy these products the index provider makes the investments in the underlying funds, making an investable index similar in some ways to a fund of hedge funds portfolio.
To make the index investable, hedge funds must agree to accept investments on the terms given by the constructor.  To make the index liquid, these terms must include provisions for redemptions that some managers may consider too onerous to be acceptable.  This means that investable indices do not represent the total universe of hedge funds. Most seriously, they under-represent more successful managers, who typically refuse to accept such investment protocols.

====Hedge fund replication====

The most recent addition to the field approach the problem in a different manner.  Instead of reflecting the performance of actual hedge funds they take a statistical approach to the analysis of historic hedge fund returns, and use this to construct a model of how hedge fund returns respond to the movements of various investable financial assets.  This model is then used to construct an investable portfolio of those assets.  This makes the index investable, and in principle they can be as representative as the hedge fund database from which they were constructed.
However, these clone indices rely on a statistical modelling process.  Such indices have too short a history to state whether this approach will be considered successful.

===Effect of 2007/08 financial crisis===

Hedge funds posted disappointing returns in 2008, but the average hedge fund return of -18.65% (the HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index return) was far better than the returns generated by most assets other than cash or cash equivalents.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2011[/tpl] The S&P 500 total return was -37.00% in 2008, and that was one of the best performing equity indices in the world. Several equity markets lost more than half their value. Most foreign and domestic corporate debt indices also suffered in 2008, posting losses significantly worse than the average hedge fund. Mutual funds also performed much worse than hedge funds in 2008. According to Lipper, the average US domestic equity mutual fund decreased 37.6% in 2008. The average international equity mutual fund declined 45.8%. The average sector mutual fund dropped 39.7%. The average China mutual fund declined 52.7% and the average Latin America mutual fund plummeted 57.3%. Real estate, both residential and commercial, also suffered significant drops in 2008. In summary, hedge funds outperformed many similarly risky investment options in 2008.

==Debates and controversies==

===Systemic risk===

Systemic risk refers to the risk of instability across the entire financial system, as opposed to within a single company.

Hedge funds fail regularly, and numerous hedge funds failed during the financial crisis.[tpl]cite news |title=Hedge fund graveyard: 693 and counting  |first=Ben |last=Rooney |url=http://money.cnn.com/2008/12/18/news/economy/hedge_fund_liquidations/?postversion=2008121817 |work=CNNMoney.com |date=18 December 2008 |accessdate=5 April 2011[/tpl] In testimony to the House Financial Services Committee in 2009, Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve Board Chairman said he "would not think that any hedge fund or private equity fund would become a systemically critical firm individually".Federal Reserve Perspectives on Financial Regulatory Reform Proposals:  Hearing Before the H. Comm. on Financial Services, 111th Cong. 25 (2009) (testimony of Ben S. Bernanke, Chairman, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System).
Nevertheless, although hedge funds go to great lengths to reduce the ratio of risk to reward, inevitably a number of risks remain. Systemic risk is increased in a crisis if there is "herd" behaviour, which causes a number of similar hedge funds to make losses in similar trades. In addition, while most hedge funds make only modest use of leverage, hedge funds differ from many other market participants, such as banks and mutual funds, in that there are no regulatory constraints on their use of leverage, and some hedge funds seek large amounts of leverage as part of their market strategy.  The extensive use of leverage can lead to forced liquidations in a crisis, particularly for hedge funds that invest at least in part in illiquid investments. The close interconnectedness of the hedge funds with their prime brokers, typically investment banks, can lead to domino effects in a crisis, and indeed failing counterparty banks can freeze hedge funds. These systemic risk concerns are exacerbated by the prominent role of hedge funds in the financial markets.  The global hedge fund industry has over $2 trillion in assets, and this does not take into account the full effect of leverage, which by definition is market exposure in excess of the amount invested.
An August 2012 survey by the Financial Services Authority concluded that risks were limited and had reduced as a result, inter alia, of larger margins being required by counterparty banks, but might change rapidly according to market conditions. In stressed market conditions, investors might suddenly withdraw large sums, resulting in forced asset sales. This might cause liquidity and pricing problems if it occurred across a number of funds or in one large highly leveraged fund.

===Transparency===

Hedge funds are structured to avoid most direct regulation (although their managers may be regulated) and are not required to publicly disclose their investment activities, except to the extent that investors generally are subject to disclosure requirements. This is in contrast to a regulated mutual fund or exchange-traded fund, which will typically have to meet regulatory requirements for disclosure. An investor in a hedge fund usually has direct access to the investment adviser of the fund, and may enjoy more personalized reporting than investors in retail investment funds. This may include detailed discussions of risks assumed and significant positions. However, this high level of disclosure is not available to non-investors, contributing to hedge funds' reputation for secrecy, while some hedge funds have very limited transparency even to investors.Carrie Johnson, "Scrutiny Urged for Hedge Funds" The Washington Post (29 June 2006). Retrieved 1 March 2011
Funds may choose to report some information in the interest of recruiting additional investors. Much of the data available in consolidated databases is self-reported and unverified.Cassar, G., & Gerakos, J. (2009). Determinants of Hedge Fund Internal Controls and Fees. Retrieved from http://www.hbs.edu/units/am/pdf/Gerakos.pdf  A study was done on two major databases containing hedge fund data. The study noted that 465 common funds had significant differences in reported information (e.g. returns, inception date, net assets value, incentive fee, management fee, investment styles, etc.) and that 5% of return numbers and 5% of NAV numbers were dramatically different.Liang, B. (2000). Hedge Funds: The Living and the Dead. Journal of Financial & Quantitative Analysis, 35(3), 309–326. Retrieved from Business Source Complete. With these limitations, investors have to do their own research, which may cost on the scale of US$50,000 for a fund that is not well-established.Stulz, R. (2007).

Some hedge funds, mainly American, do not use third parties either as the custodian of their assets or as their administrator (who will calculate the NAV of the fund). This can lead to conflicts of interest, and in extreme cases can assist fraud.

===Links with analysts===

In June 2006, prompted by a letter from Gary J. Aguirre, the Senate Judiciary Committee began an investigation into the links between hedge funds and independent analysts. Aguirre was fired from his job with the SEC when, as lead investigator of insider trading allegations against Pequot Capital Management, he tried to interview John Mack, then being considered for chief executive officer at Morgan Stanley.[tpl]cite news|author=Post Store |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/28/AR2006062801909.html |title=Scrutiny Urged for Hedge Funds |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= 29 June 2006|accessdate=14 August 2010[/tpl] The Judiciary Committee and the US Senate Finance Committee issued a scathing report in 2007, which found that Aguirre had been illegally fired in reprisalLiz Noyer, "Scales Of Justice Look Skewed For Rajaratnam, Samberg" Forbes magazine (27 May 2010).

The systemic practice of hedge funds submitting periodic electronic questionnaires to stock analysts as a part of market research was reported in by The New York Times in  July 2012. According to the report, one motivation for the questionnaires was to obtain subjective information not available to the public and possible early notice of trading recommendations that could produce short term market movements.[tpl]cite news |title=Surveys Give Big Investors an Early View From Analysts |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/16/business/in-surveys-hedge-funds-see-early-views-of-stock-analysts.html |accessdate=16 July 2012 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=15 July 2012 |author=Gretchen Morgenson |quote=The questions are vague but collectively give us a good sense of the analyst’s overall sentiment towards the company,” the report concluded. “We find that this sentiment manifests itself in future analyst upgrades[/tpl]

===Value in mean/variance efficient portfolios===

According to modern portfolio theory, rational investors will seek to hold portfolios that are mean/variance efficient (that is, portfolios offer the highest level of return per unit of risk, and the lowest level of risk per unit of return). One of the attractive features of hedge funds (in particular market neutral and similar funds) is that they sometimes have a modest correlation with traditional assets such as equities. This means that hedge funds have a potentially quite valuable role in investment portfolios as diversifiers, reducing overall portfolio risk.
However, there are three reasons why one might not wish to allocate a high proportion of assets into hedge funds. These reasons are:
Several studies have suggested that hedge funds are sufficiently diversifying to merit inclusion in investor portfolios, but this is disputed for example by Mark KritzmanPortfolio Efficiency with Performance Fees, Economics and Political Strategy (newsletter), February 2007, Peter L. Bernstein Inc.[tpl]cite news|last=Hulbert |first=Mark |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/04/business/yourmoney/04stra.html |title=Hulbert, Mark 2 + 20, and Other Hedge Fund Math, New York Times, 4 March 2007 |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=4 March 2007 |accessdate=26 November 2011[/tpl] who performed a mean-variance optimization calculation on an opportunity set that consisted of a stock index fund, a bond index fund, and ten hypothetical hedge funds. The optimizer found that a mean-variance efficient portfolio did not contain any allocation to hedge funds, largely because of the impact of performance fees. To demonstrate this, Kritzman repeated the optimization using an assumption that the hedge funds incurred no performance fees. The result from this second optimization was an allocation of 74% to hedge funds.
The other factor reducing the attractiveness of hedge funds in a diversified portfolio is that they tend to under-perform during equity bear markets, just when an investor needs part of their portfolio to add value. For example, in January–September 2008, the Credit Suisse/Tremont Hedge Fund Index[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hedgeindex.com/hedgeindex/en/default.aspx?cy=USD |title=Credit Suisse/Tremont Hedge Index web page |publisher=Hedgeindex.com |date= |accessdate=14 August 2010[/tpl] was down 9.87%. According to the same index series, even "dedicated short bias" funds had a return of −6.08% during September 2008. In other words, even though low average correlations may appear to make hedge funds attractive this may not work in turbulent period, for example around the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008.
