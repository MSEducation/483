Nergal-sharezer or Neriglissar (in Akkadian Nergal-šar-uṣur, "Oh god Nergal, preserve/defend the king"; the common form of his name is Neriglissar Hyatt, The Interpreter's Bible, 1951, volume V, p. 1,079) was King of Babylon from 560 to 556 BC.  He was the son-in-law of Nebuchadrezzar II, whose son and heir, Amel-Marduk, Nergal-sharezer murdered and succeeded. A Babylonian chronicle describes his western war in 557/556. He is traditionally listed as a king of the Chaldean Dynasty, however it is not known if he was a Chaldean or native of Babylon, as he was not related by blood to Nabopolassar and his successors.
His name is mentioned as one of high-ranking officers of king Nebuchadnezzar II in the Bible ([tpl]Bibleref|Jeremiah|39:13[/tpl]).
