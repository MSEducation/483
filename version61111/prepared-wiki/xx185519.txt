Colin Frederick Hill (born November 12, 1963 in Uxbridge, England) is a former Northern Irish professional football player most notable for his careers with Arsenal and Leicester City and as a Northern Ireland international.

==Career==

Hill played as a youth for Hillingdon Borough before joining Arsenal on schoolboy forms in 1977, becoming an apprentice in 1980 and turning professional in 1981. Initially a striker, he was converted into a defender and made his debut against Norwich City on April 20, 1983. He made 7 appearances in total that season, and went on to play 37 league games in 1983-84, mostly at right-back, but the signing of Viv Anderson forced him out of the first team and he spent most of the next two seasons in the reserves. 
Hill left Arsenal for Portuguese side Marítimo in 1986 on a free transfer, having played 51 games and scoring one goal for Arsenal. He later had spells with Colchester United, Sheffield United (winning them promotion to the First Division in 1989-90), Leicester City (winning promotion to the Premier League in 1994-95, although he missed out on the 1997 League Cup Final), Trelleborgs and Northampton Town. He also won 27 caps for Northern Ireland.
After retiring Colin spent 10 years working in the Commercial and Hospitality sector for Leicester City FC, The Q Group and the THA Group.
Colin is now a Commercial Executive for PFA Enterprises (2013)
