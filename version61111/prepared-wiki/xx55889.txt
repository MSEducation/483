The Royal Concertgebouw ([tpl]lang-nl|Koninklijk Concertgebouw[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-nl|ˌkɔnɪnklək kɔnˈsɛrt.xəˌbʌu|pron[/tpl]) is a concert hall in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The Dutch term "concertgebouw" literally translates into English as "concert building". On 11 April 2013, on occasion of the building's 125th anniversary, Queen Beatrix bestowed the Royal Title "Koninklijk" upon the building, as she did previously on to the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra.[tpl]cite web|title=Koninklijke status voor Het Concertgebouw|url=http://www.concertgebouw.nl/nieuws/koninklijke-status-voor-het-concertgebouw|publisher=Concertgebouw NV|accessdate=11 April 2013[/tpl] Because of its highly regarded acoustics, the Concertgebouw is considered one of the finest concert halls in the world, along with places such as Boston's Symphony HallApril 11, 1888: Concertgebouw, Home of Nearly Perfect Acoustics, OpensR.W.

==History==

The architect of the building was Adolf Leonard van Gendt,[tpl]cite Monumentenregister|monumentID=288|name=Concertgebouw|accessdate=9 February 2012[/tpl] who was inspired by the Gewandhaus in Leipzig, built two years earlier (and destroyed in 1943).
Construction began in 1883 in a pasture that was then outside the city, in Nieuwer-Amstel, a municipality that in 1964 became Amstelveen. 2,186 piles twelve to thirteen metres (40 to 43 ft) in length were sunk into the soil.Drawing of the Concertgebouw in the fields, at the Amsterdam City Archives
The hall opened on 11 April 1888 with an inaugural concert, in which an orchestra of 120 musicians and a chorus of 500 singers participated, performing works of Wagner, Handel, Bach, and Beethoven. The resident orchestra of the Concertgebouw is the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra (Koninklijk Concertgebouworkest), which gave its first concert in the hall on 3 November 1888, as the Concertgebouw Orchestra (Concertgebouworkest).
The Main Hall (Grote Zaal) seats 1,974, and is 44 metres (144 ft) long, 28 metres (92 ft) wide, and 17 metres (56 ft) high.[tpl]cite web|title=Het Concertgebouw - Capaciteit Zalen|url=http://www.concertgebouw.nl/sites/concertgebouw.nl/files/filemanager/Capaciteitenlijst.pdf|publisher=Concertgebouw NV|accessdate=24 February 2014[/tpl] Its reverberation time is 2.8 seconds without audience, 2.2 seconds with, making it ideal for the late Romantic repertoire such as Mahler. Though this characteristic makes it largely unsuited for amplified music, groups such as Led Zeppelin, The Who and Pink Floyd performed there in the 1960s. It hosts not only orchestral and operatic performances, but also jazz and world music.
A smaller, oval-shaped venue, the Recital Hall (Kleine Zaal), is located behind the Main Hall. The Recital Hall is 20 metres (66 ft) long and 15 metres (50 ft) wide. Its more intimate space is well-suited for chamber music and Lieder. The Recital Hall has 437 seats.
When the Concertgebouw was built, acoustics were something of a black art. As in shipbuilding, designers drew upon what had worked in the past without entirely understanding the underlying science. When the building was completed, the acoustics were not perfect, and a lot of effort went into fine-tuning the aural ambience. During later restorations, particular care has been taken not to alter the materials used for interior decoration with this in mind. In the 1980s, the hall embarked on extensive fund-raising for renovations after the hall was found to be slowly sinking into the ground. Pi de Bruijn was the architect for the contemporary annex to the original hall.[tpl]cite news | author=Paul L.
