Netscape Communications (formerly known as Netscape Communications Corporation and commonly known as Netscape) is a US computer services company, best known for Netscape Navigator, its web browser. When it was an independent company, its headquarters were in Mountain View, California.Swartz, Jon. "Company takes browser war to Netscape's lawn." San Francisco Chronicle. Thursday October 2, 1997. Retrieved on December 29, 2009.
Netscape's web browser was once dominant in terms of usage share, but lost most of that share to Internet Explorer during the first browser war. The usage share of Netscape had fallen from over 90 percent in the mid-1990s to less than one percent by the end of 2006.
Netscape is credited with developing the Secure Sockets Layer Protocol (SSL) for securing online communication, which is still widely used,[tpl]cite web|url=http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/iseries/v5r3/index.jsp?topic=/rzain/rzainhistory.htm |title=History of SSL at IBM.com |publisher=Publib.boulder.ibm.com |accessdate=2012-10-29[/tpl] as well as JavaScript, the most widely used language for client-side scripting of web pages.
Netscape stock traded from 1995 until 1999 when it was acquired by AOL in a pooling-of-interests transaction ultimately worth US$10 billion."America Online Inc.

==History==

===Early years===

Netscape was the first company to attempt to capitalize on the nascent World Wide Web.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl] It was originally founded under the name Mosaic Communications Corporation on April 4, 1994, the brainchild of Jim Clark who had recruited Marc Andreessen as co-founder and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers as investors. Clark recruited other early team members from SGI and NCSA Mosaic, including Rosanne Siino who became Vice President of Communications. Jim Barksdale came on board as CEO in January 1995."Remembering Netscape: The Birth Of The Web". Fortune. July 25, 2005. Retrieved July 1, 2012.  Jim Clark and Marc Andreessen originally created a 20-page concept pitch for an online gaming network to Nintendo for the Nintendo 64 console, but a deal was never reached.  Marc Andreessen explains, "If they had shipped a year earlier, we probably would have done that instead of Netscape.""Why Netscape Almost Never Happened". NotEnoughShaders. July 13, 2012 . Retrieved July 24, 2012."OPSWARE INC. / On the record: Marc Andreessen". SFGate. December 7, 2003  . Retrieved July 24, 2012.
The company's first product was the web browser, called Mosaic Netscape 0.9, released on October 13, 1994. This browser was subsequently renamed Netscape Navigator, and the company took the 'Netscape' name (coined by employee Greg Sands, although it was also a trademark of Cisco Systems"Cisco tablet not an iPad knock-off: Chambers". Network World. June 30, 2010. Retrieved July 1, 2012.) on November 14, 1994[tpl]Cite news| page = B3| title = Mosaic's Name Change| work=The San Francisco Chronicle| date = November 15, 1994[/tpl] to avoid trademark ownership problems with NCSA, where the initial Netscape employees had previously created the NCSA Mosaic web browser. The Mosaic Netscape web browser did not use any NCSA Mosaic code.[tpl]cite book |title=Netscape Time: The Making of the Billion-Dollar Start-Up That Took on Microsoft |last=Clark |first=Jim |authorlink=James H. Clark |coauthors=Owen Edwards |year=1999 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |isbn=978-0312199340 |pages=160–170 167[/tpl] Netscape made a very successful IPO on August 9, 1995. The stock was set to be offered at $14 per share, but a last-minute decision doubled the initial offering to $28 per share. The stock's value soared to $75 during the first day of trading, nearly a record for first-day gain. The stock closed at $58.25, which gave Netscape, an unprofitable firm, a market value of $2.9 billion. The company's revenues doubled every quarter in 1995.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.08/loudcloud.html?pg=4| title=Going Public as Netscape Did, before making a dime in profits | publisher=Lycos | work=Wired 8.08 | author=David Sheff | accessdate=July 14, 2006[/tpl]  Netscape's success (which crystallized the "Netscape Moment"[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/15464481 |title=The description of Netscape's Moment in The Economist, Feb 4, 2010 |publisher=Economist.com |accessdate=2012-10-29 |date=February 6, 2010[/tpl]) landed Andreessen, barefoot, on the cover of Time Magazine.
Netscape advertised that "the web is for everyone" and stated one of its goals was to "level the playing field" among operating systems by providing a consistent web browsing experience across them. The Netscape web browser interface was identical on any computer. Netscape later experimented with prototypes of a web-based system which would enable users to access and edit their files anywhere across a network, no matter what computer or operating system they happened to be using. This did not escape the attention of Microsoft, which viewed the commoditization of operating systems as a direct threat to its bottom line, i.e. a move from Windows to another operating system would yield a similar browsing experience thus reducing barriers to change. It is alleged that several Microsoft executives visited the Netscape campus in June 1995 to propose dividing the market (although Microsoft denies this as it would have breached anti-trust laws[tpl]cn|date=March 2014[/tpl]), which would have allowed Microsoft to produce web browser software for Windows while leaving all other operating systems to Netscape.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.pub.umich.edu/daily/1998/oct/10-20-98/news/news14.html| title=Government alleges illegal campaign by Microsoft|accessdate=July 14, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060708210502/http://www.pub.umich.edu/daily/1998/oct/10-20-98/news/news14.html |archivedate = July 8, 2006[/tpl] Netscape refused the proposition.
Microsoft released version 1.0 of Internet Explorer as a part of the Windows 95 Plus Pack add-on. According to former Spyglass developer Eric Sink, Internet Explorer was based not on NCSA Mosaic as commonly believed, but on a version of Mosaic developed at Spyglass[tpl]cite web|url=http://biztech.ericsink.com/Browser_Wars.html| title=Memoirs from the Browser Wars|accessdate=July 14, 2006[/tpl] (which itself was based upon NCSA Mosaic). Microsoft quickly released several successive versions of Internet Explorer, bundling them with Windows, never charging for them, financing their development and marketing with revenues from other areas of the company. This period of time became known as the browser wars, in which Netscape Communicator and Internet Explorer added many new features and went through many version numbers (not always in a logical fashion) in attempts to outdo each other. But Internet Explorer had the upper hand, as the amount of manpower and capital dedicated to it eventually surpassed the resources available in Netscape's entire business. By version 3.0, IE was roughly a feature-for-feature equivalent of Netscape Communicator, and by version 4.0, it was generally considered to be more stable on Windows than on the Macintosh platform. Microsoft also targeted other Netscape products with free workalikes, such as the Internet Information Server (IIS), a web server which was bundled with Windows NT.
Netscape could not compete with this strategy. In fact, it didn't attempt to. Netscape Navigator was not free to the general public until January 1998,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.news.com/2100-1001-207681.html?legacy=cnet| title=Netscape cuts prices on retail products | publisher=C-Net | author=Alex Lash | accessdate=February 23, 2008[/tpl] while Internet Explorer and IIS have always been free or came bundled with an operating system and/or other applications. Meanwhile, Netscape faced increasing criticism for the bugs in its products; critics claimed that the company suffered from 'featuritis' – putting a higher priority on adding new features than on making them work properly. This was particularly true with Netscape Navigator 2, which was only on the market for 5 months in early 1996 before being replaced by Netscape Navigator 3. The tide of public opinion, having once lauded Netscape as the David to Microsoft's Goliath, steadily turned negative, especially when Netscape experienced its first bad quarter at the end of 1997 and underwent a large round of lay-offs in January 1998. Netscape chief financial officer Peter Currie described the mid-1990s as "hectic and crazy" and that the company was undone by factors both internal and external.

===Open sourcing===

January 1998 was also the month that Netscape started the open source Mozilla project. Netscape publicly released the source code of Netscape Communicator 4.0 in the hopes that it would become a popular open source project. It placed this code under the Netscape Public License, which was similar to the GNU General Public License but allowed Netscape to continue to publish proprietary work containing the publicly released code. However, after having released the Communicator 4.0 code this way, Netscape proceeded to work on Communicator 4.5 which was focused on improving email and enterprise functionality. It eventually became clear that the Communicator 4.0 browser was too difficult to develop, and open source development was halted on this codebase. Instead, the open source development shifted to a next generation browser built from scratch. Using the newly built Gecko layout engine, this browser had a much more modular architecture than Communicator 4.0 and was therefore easier to develop with a large number of programmers. It also included an XML user interface language named XUL that allowed single development of a user interface that ran on Windows, Macintosh, and Unix.
The United States Department of Justice filed an antitrust case against Microsoft in May 1998. Netscape was not a plaintiff in the case, though its executives were subpoenaed and it contributed much material to the case, including the entire contents of the 'Bad Attitude' internal discussion forum.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,14743,00.html| title=Microsoft Subpoenas Bad Attitude|accessdate=July 14, 2006 | work=Wired| date=September 1, 1998[/tpl] In October 1998, Netscape acquired web directory site NewHoo for the sum of $1 million, renamed it the Open Directory Project, and released its database under an open content license.

===Acquisition by America Online===

America Online (AOL) on November 24, 1998 announced it would acquire Netscape Communications in a tax-free stock-swap valued at US$4.2 billion at the time of the announcement.[tpl]cite web | url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1023-218360.html| title=AOL buys Netscape for $4.2 billion[/tpl] By the time the deal closed on March 17, 1999, it was valued at US$10 billion. This merger was ridiculed by many who believed that the two corporate cultures could not possibly mesh; one of its most prominent critics was longtime Netscape developer Jamie Zawinski.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.jwz.org/gruntle/aol.html | title=netscape and aol.[/tpl] The acquisition was seen as a way for AOL to gain a bargaining chip against Microsoft, to let it become less dependent on the Internet Explorer web browser. Others believed that AOL was interested in Netcenter, or Netscape's web properties, which drew some of the highest traffic worldwide. Eventually, Netscape's server products and its Professional Services group became part of iPlanet, a joint marketing and development alliance between AOL and Sun Microsystems. On November 14, 2000, AOL released Netscape 6, based on the Mozilla 0.6 source code. (Version 5 was skipped.) Unfortunately, Mozilla 0.6 was far from being stable yet, and so the effect of Netscape 6 was to further drive people away from the Netscape brand. It was not until August 2001 that Netscape 6.1 appeared, based on Mozilla 0.9.2 which was significantly more robust. A year later came Netscape 7.0, based on the Mozilla 1.0 core.

===Disbanding===

During the acquisition of Netscape by AOL, joint development and marketing of Netscape software products would occur through the Sun-Netscape Alliance. The software in the newly branded iPlanet included "messaging and calendar, collaboration, web, application, directory, and certificate servers", as well as "production-ready applications for e-commerce, including commerce exchange, procurement, selling, and billing."[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sun-netscape-alliance-announces-new-iplanettm-brand-and-marketing-campaign-73653107.html| title=Sun-Netscape Alliance Announces New iPlanet(TM) Brand and Marketing Campaign|accessdate=July 7, 2012[/tpl] In March 2002, when the alliance was ended, "iPlanet became a division of Sun...

On July 15, 2003, Time Warner (formerly AOL Time Warner) disbanded Netscape. Most of the programmers were laid-off, and the Netscape logo was removed from the building. However, the Netscape 7.2 web browser (developed in-house rather than with Netscape staff, with some work outsourced to Sun's Beijing development center"Sun Micro To Double Beijing Software Center". HPCwire. August 8, 2003. Retrieved July 1, 2012.) was released by AOL on August 18, 2004.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/news_story.php?id=62001| title=Netscape Internet Software Updated|accessdate=July 14, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060623074531/http://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/news_story.php?id=62001  |archivedate = June 23, 2006[/tpl]
On October 12, 2004, the popular developer website Netscape DevEdge was shut down by AOL. DevEdge was an important resource for Internet-related technologies, maintaining definitive documentation on the Netscape browser, documentation on associated technologies like HTML and JavaScript, and popular articles written by industry and technology leaders such as Danny Goodman. Some content from DevEdge has been republished at the Mozilla website.

===Final release of the browser===

The Netscape brand name continued to be used extensively. The company once again had its own programming staff devoted to the development and support for the series of web browsers.UFAQ. org – "Announcing Netscape 9" by Jay Garcia Retrieved on February 5, 2007 Additionally, Netscape also maintained the Propeller web portal, which was a popular social-news site, similar to Digg, which was given a new look in June 2006. AOL marketed a discount ISP service under the Netscape brand name.
A new version of the Netscape browser, Netscape Navigator 9, based on Firefox 2, was released in October 2007. It featured a green and grey interface. In November 2007, IE had 77.4% of the browser market, Firefox 16.0% and Netscape 0.6%, according to Net Applications, an Internet metrics firm.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=205204433 |title=AOL Kills Netscape's Future, Leaves Firefox to Battle IE |accessdate=December 29, 2007 |author=Gonsalves, Antone |date= December 28, 2007|work=Informationweek.com |publisher=CMP Media LLC[/tpl]  On December 28, 2007, AOL announced that on February 1, 2008 it would drop support for the Netscape web browser and would no longer develop new releases. The date was later extended to March 1[tpl]cite web | url=http://blog.netscape.com/2007/12/28/end-of-support-for-netscape-web-browsers/| title=End of Support for Netscape web browsers | publisher=Netscape Blog| author=Tom Drapeau | accessdate=December 28, 2007[/tpl] to allow a major security update and to add a tool to assist users in migrating to other browsers. These additional features were included in the final version of Netscape Navigator 9 (version 9.0.0.6), released on February 20, 2008.

==Software==

===Classic releases===

====Netscape Navigator (versions 0.9–4.08)====

Netscape Navigator was Netscape's web browser from versions 1.0–4.8. The first beta versions were released in 1994 and were called Mosaic and later Mosaic Netscape. Then, a legal challenge from the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (makers of NCSA Mosaic), which many of Netscape's founders used to develop, led to the name Netscape Navigator. The company's name also changed from Mosaic Communications Corporation to Netscape Communications Corporation.
The browser was easily the most advanced available[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl] and so was an instant success, becoming market leader while still in beta.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl] Netscape's feature-count and market share continued to grow rapidly after version 1.0 was released. Version 2.0 added a full email reader called Netscape Mail, thus transforming Netscape from a single-purpose web browser to an Internet suite. The main distinguishing feature of the email client was its ability to display HTML email. During this period, the entire suite was called Netscape Navigator.
Version 3.0 of Netscape (the first beta was codenamed "Atlas") was the first to face any serious competition in the form of Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl] But Netscape easily remained the number one browser for the time being.
Netscape also released a Gold version of Navigator 3.0 that incorporated WYSIWYG editing with drag and drop between web editor and email components.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.intercom.co.cr/www/research/1996/0910.htm|title=Netscape Navigator Gold 3.0 Now Available, Adding Momentum to Netscape Client Software[/tpl]

====Netscape Communicator (versions 4.0–4.8)====

Netscape 4 addressed the problem of Netscape Navigator being used as both the name of the suite and the browser contained within it by renaming the suite to Netscape Communicator. After five preview releases in 1996–1997, Netscape released the final version of Netscape Communicator in June 1997. This version, more or less based on Netscape Navigator 3 Code, updated and added new features. The new suite was successful, despite increasing competition from Internet Explorer (IE) 4.0 (which had a more advanced HTML engine) and problems with the outdated browser core. IE was slow and unstable on the Mac platform until version 4.5.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl] Despite this, Apple entered into an agreement with Microsoft to make IE the default browser on new Mac OS installations, a further blow to Netscape's prestige.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl] The Communicator suite was made up of Netscape Navigator, Netscape Mail & Newsgroups, Netscape Address Book and Netscape Composer (an HTML editor).
In January 1998, Netscape Communications Corporation announced that all future versions of its software would be available free of charge and developed by an open source community, Mozilla. Netscape Communicator 5.0 was announced (codenamed "Gromit"). However, its release was greatly delayed, and meanwhile there were newer versions of Internet Explorer, starting with version 4. These had more features than the old Netscape version, including better support of HTML 4, CSS, DOM, and ECMAScript. The more advanced Internet Explorer 5.0 became the market leader.
In October 1998, Netscape Communicator 4.5 was released. It featured various functionality improvements, especially in the Mail and Newsgroups component, but did not update the browser core, whose functionality was essentially identical to that of version 4.08. One month later, Netscape Communications Corporation was bought by AOL. In November, work on Netscape 5.0 was canceled in favor of developing a completely new program from scratch.

===Mozilla-based releases===

====Netscape 6 (versions 6.0–6.2.3)====

In 1998, an informal group called the Mozilla Organization was formed and largely funded by Netscape (the vast majority of programmers working on the code were paid by Netscape) to co-ordinate the development of Netscape 5 (codenamed "Gromit"), which would be based on the Communicator source code. However, the aging Communicator code proved difficult to work with and the decision was taken to scrap Netscape 5 and re-write the source code. The re-written source code was in the form of the Mozilla web browser, which, with a few additions, Netscape 6 was based on.
This decision meant that Netscape's next major version was severely delayed. In the meantime, Netscape was taken over by AOL who, acting under pressure from the Web Standards Project, forced its new division to release Netscape 6.0 in 2000. The suite again consisted of Netscape Navigator and the other Communicator components, with the addition of a built-in AOL Instant Messenger client, Netscape Instant Messenger. However, it was clear that Netscape 6 was not yet ready for release and it flopped badly. It was based on Mozilla 0.6, which was not ready to be used by the general public yet due to many serious bugs that would cause it to crash often or render web pages slowly. Later versions of Netscape 6 were much improved[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl] (especially 6.2.x was regarded as a good release)[tpl]who|date=June 2013[/tpl], but the browser still struggled to make an impact on a disappointed community.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl]

====Netscape 7 (versions 7.0–7.2)====

Netscape 7.0 (based on Mozilla 1.0.1) was released in August 2002 was a direct continuation of Netscape 6 with very similar components. It picked up a few users, but was still very much a minority browser. It did, however, come with the popular Radio@Netscape Internet radio client. AOL had decided to deactivate Mozilla's popup-blocker functionality in Netscape 7.0, which created an outrage in the community. AOL learned the lesson for Netscape 7.01 and allowed Netscape to reinstate the popup-blocker. Netscape also introduced a new AOL-free-version (without the usual AOL addons) of the browser suite. Netscape 7.1 (codenamed "Buffy" and based on Mozilla 1.4) was released in June 2003.
In 2003, AOL closed down its Netscape division and laid-off or re-assigned all of Netscape's employees. Mozilla.org continued, however, as the independent Mozilla Foundation, taking on many of Netscape's ex-employees. AOL continued to develop Netscape in-house (with help from Sun's Beijing development center), but, due to there being no staff committed to it, improvements were minimal. One year later, in August 2004, the last version based on Mozilla was released: Netscape 7.2, based on Mozilla 1.7.2.
After an official poll posted on Netscape's community support board in late 2006, speculation arose of the Netscape 7 series of suites being fully supported and updated by Netscape's in-house development team.Netscape Community Announcement – Netscape 7.2 Retrieved on February 8, 2007Netscape Community poll – Should Netscape continue to update 7.2?

===Mozilla Firefox-based releases===

====Netscape Browser (version 8.0–8.1.3)====

Between 2005 and 2007, Netscape's releases became known as Netscape Browser. AOL chose to base Netscape Browser on the relatively successful Mozilla Firefox, a re-written version of Mozilla produced by the Mozilla Foundation. This release is not a full Internet suite as before, but is solely a web browser. Other controversial decisions include the browser's being made only for Microsoft Windows and its featuring both the Gecko rendering engine of previous releases and the Trident engine used in Internet Explorer.

===End of development and support===

AOL officially announced9 Users: Time to Flock or Firefox – The Netscape Blog that support for Netscape Navigator would end on March 1, 2008, and recommended that its users download either the Flock or Firefox browsers, both of which were based on the same technology.
The decision met mixed reactions from communities, with many arguing that the termination of product support is significantly belated. Internet security site Security Watch stated that a trend of infrequent security updates for AOL's Netscape caused the browser to become a "security liability", specifically the 2005–2007 versions, Netscape Browser 8.[tpl]cite web | url=http://securitywatch.eweek.com/browsers/netscape_death_is_long_overdue_good_for_security_1.html| title=Netscape Death is long overdue, Good for Security|accessdate=January 2, 2008[/tpl] Asa Dotzler, one of Firefox's original bug testers, greeted the news with "good riddance" in his blog post, but praised the various members of the Netscape team over the years for enabling the creation of Mozilla in 1998.[tpl]cite web | url=http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/asa/archives/2007/12/its_about_time.html| title=it's about time. r.i.p. netscape browser|accessdate=January 2, 2008[/tpl] Others protested and petitioned AOL to continue providing vital security fixes to unknowing or loyal users of its software, as well as protection of a well-known brand.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.savenetscape.com| title=Save Netscape Petition|accessdate=January 2, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://community.netscape.com/n/pfx/forum.aspx?tsn=1&nav=messages&webtag=ws-nscpbrowser&tid=10422| title=Netscape Community – Online Petition for the Support of NN|accessdate=January 2, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.savenetscape.tk| title=Save Netscape!|accessdate=January 2, 2008[/tpl]

===Later Netscape products===

Netscape's later products included:

===Propeller===

Between June 2006 and September 2007, AOL operated Netscape's website as social news website similar to Digg. The format did not do well; traffic dropped 55.1 percent between November 2006 and August 2007.[tpl]cite web|url=http://searchenginewatch.com/article/2050575/Propeller.com-Spinning-to-a-Stop |title=Propeller.com Spinning to a Stop - Search Engine Watch (#SEW) |publisher=Search Engine Watch |accessdate=2012-10-29[/tpl] In September 2007, AOL reverted Netscape's website to a traditional news portal, and rebranded the social news portal as "Propeller," moving the site to the domain "propeller.com." AOL shut down the Propeller website on October 1, 2010.

===Netscape Search===

Netscape operated a search engine, Netscape Search, which now redirects to AOL Search (which itself now merely serves Google search results). Another version of Netscape Search formerly found at netscape.com/search, was incorporated into Propeller, which has since closed.

===Other sites===

Netscape also operates a number of country-specific Netscape portals, including Netscape Canada among others. The portal of Netscape Germany was shut down in June 2008.
The Netscape Blog was written by Netscape employees discussing the latest on Netscape products and services. Netscape NewsQuake (formally Netscape Reports) is Netscape's news and opinion blog, including video clips and discussions. As of January 2012, no new posts have been made on either of these blogs since August 2008.

===Netscape technologies===

Netscape created the JavaScript web page scripting language. It also pioneered the development of push technology, which effectively allowed web sites to send regular updates of information (weather, stock updates, package tracking, etc.) directly to a user's desktop (aka "webtop"); Netscape's implementation of this was named Netcaster.[tpl]Dead link|date=May 2010[/tpl] Unfortunately, businesses quickly recognized the use of push technology to deliver ads to users, and annoyed users turned off the feature, so Netcaster was short-lived.
Netscape was notable for its cross-platform efforts. Its client software continued to be made available for Windows (3.1, 95, 98, NT), Macintosh, Linux, OS/2, BeOS, and many versions of Unix including DEC, Sun Solaris, BSDI, IRIX, IBM AIX, and HP-UX. Its server software generally was only available for Unix and Windows NT, though some of its servers were made available on Linux, and a version of Netscape FastTrack Server was made available for Windows 95/98. Today, most of Netscape's server offerings live on as the Sun Java System, formerly under the Sun ONE branding. Although Netscape Browser 8 was Windows only, multi-platform support exists in the Netscape Navigator 9 series of browsers.

==Current services==

===Netscape Internet Service===

Netscape ISP is a 56 kbit/s dial-up service offered at $9.95 per month[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.getnetscape.com/index.adp | title=GetNetscape Home Page | accessdate=March 20, 2008[/tpl] ($6.95 with 12-month commitment). The company serves webpages in a compressed format to increase effective speeds up to 1300 kbit/s (average 500 kbit/s). The Internet service provider is run by AOL under the Netscape brand. The low-cost ISP was officially launched on January 8, 2004.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.timewarner.com/corp/newsroom/pr/0,20812,670188,00.html | title=Netscape Launches Low-Cost Internet Access Service[/tpl] Its main competitor is NetZero. Netscape ISP's advertising is generally aimed at a younger demographic, e.g., college students, and people just out of school, as an affordable way to gain access to the Internet.

====Web Accelerator====

The Web Accelerator precompresses text at the Server side to approximately 4% its original size, increasing effective throughput to 1300 kbit/s. The accelerator also precompresses Flash executables and images to approximately 30% and 10%, respectively. Netscape advertises this as "DSL speeds over regular phone lines", although such speeds are limited to only web browsing, not downloads of files.
Another drawback of this approach is a loss in quality, where the graphics become heavily compacted and smeared, but the speed is dramatically improved such that web pages load in less than 5 seconds.

===Netscape.com===

Netscape always drove lots of traffic from various links included in the browser menus to its web properties. Some say it was very late to leverage this trafficNetscape late to leverage traffic - CNET News. News.cnet.com.

The original Netscape.com was discontinued in June 2006, replaced by the site that would eventually become Propeller.com. Two continuations of the original Netscape.com portal are available; Compuserve.com, the Web site of Compuserve, and ISP.Netscape.com, the web site for Netscape's dial-up discount ISP service, continue to use the Netscape.com layout as it was before June 2006. Of the two, only the latter explicitly uses the Netscape branding.
Netscape.com is currently an AOL Netscape-branded mirror duplicate of the AOL.com portal with the URL, replacing the former social news website in September 2007. The social news site moved to the Propeller.com domain, where it stayed until ending operations in October 2010. It features facilities such as news, sports, horoscopes, dating, movies, music and more. The change has come to much criticism amongst many site users, because the site has effectively become an AOL clone, and simply re-directs to regional AOL portals in some areas across the globe. Netscape's exclusive features, such as the Netscape Blog, Netscape NewsQuake, Netscape Navigator, My Netscape and Netscape Community pages, are less accessible from the AOL Netscape designed portal and in some countries not accessible at all without providing a full URL or completing an Internet search.Netscape Community responses.

===DMOZ===

DMOZ (from directory.mozilla.org, its original domain name, also known as the Open Directory Project or ODP), is a multilingual open content directory of World Wide Web links owned by Netscape that is constructed and maintained by a community of volunteer editors.

===Netscape Forum Center===

Netscape also has a wide variety of community-based forums within Netscape Forum Center, including its browser's community support board. To post on the forums, users must possess an AOL Screenname account in which to sign in, referred to within the site as the Netscape Network. The same service is also available through Compuserve Forum Center.
