William Nils Erich Petzäll (26 August 1988 – 1 September 2012) was a Swedish politician, former member of the Sweden Democrats and Chairman of the Sweden Democratic Youth. At the 2010 Swedish general election he was elected to be the parliamentary representative for Dalarna County (Sweden Democrat MP).
In 2011, Petzäll discontinued his commitment to the political party that he had been serving up until that point in time. Until his departure from the Sweden Democrats, Petzäll was employed as a press secretary, in addition to his primary role as the committee leader for the Sweden Democrats' immigration policy program commission.
