==Reception==

The Allmusic review by Richard S. Ginell awarded the album 4 stars noting "This was the recording debut of the Adderley Sextet, with Cannonball waxing eloquently and swingingly on alto, brother Nat charging ahead on cornet, and the versatile Yusef Lateef (who had joined the band only three weeks earlier) adding a bit of an edge on tenor, flute, and unusually for a jazz wind player, oboe on the odd, dirge-like "Syn-Anthesia." There is plenty of talk from Cannonball as well... This group would be Zawinul's springboard to prominence in the jazz world — and already his compulsively funky mastery of bop and the blues has fused tightly with the Sam Jones/Louis Hayes rhythm section."Ginell, R. S. Allmusic Review accessed 20 October 2009 The Penguin Guide to Jazz awarded the album 2½ stars stating "'Bringing in Joe Zawinul and Yusef Lateef energised the band anew".
