[[Seaboard-All Florida Railway]]

CATEGORIES: Defunct Florida railroads, Predecessors of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad

The Seaboard-All Florida Railway was a subsidiary of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad that oversaw two major extensions of the system in the early 1920s on each coast of Florida during the land boom.   One line extended the Seaboard’s tracks on the east coast from West Palm Beach down to Miami, while the other extension on the west coast extended the tracks from Hull (near Fort Ogden) to Fort Myers and Naples, Florida, with branches to LaBelle and Punta Rassa.  These two extensions were championed by Seaboard president S. Davies Warfield, and were constructed by Foley Brothers railroad contractors.  Both extensions also allowed the Seaboard to better compete with the Florida East Coast Railway and the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, who already served the east and west coasts of Florida respectively.

==Celebration==

The Seaboard All-Florida Railway lines opened on January 7, 1927, marking a significant milestone for the Seaboard Air Line Railway.  A two-day gala celebration for the lines immediately took place in which Warfield rode aboard a special section of the Seaboard's Orange Blossom Special with a number of special guests including Florida Governor John W. Martin.  The train, which went down the west coast line the first day and the east coast line the second day, stopped at points along the lines for public ovation with nearly 20,000 people attending.  The celebration was considered one of the largest and most significant in the history of American railroads.[tpl]cite book|last=Turner|first=Gregg M.|title=A Milestone Celebration: The Seaboard Railway to Naples and Miami|year=2004|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=9781468517378[/tpl]

==East Coast==

The east coast line began at the terminus of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad’s recently constructed Florida Western and Northern Railroad from Coleman to West Palm Beach via Auburndale and Sebring.  From West Palm Beach, the extension continued the line south along the east coast closely paralleling the Florida East Coast Railway down through Delray Beach, Boca Raton, and on into Fort Lauderdale.
After Fort Lauderdale, the line shifted inland slightly passing through Opa-locka, and Hialeah and then southeast into Miami, terminating in the Allapattah neighborhood where the original Miami passenger depot was built.  A later extension branched off the line in Hialeah (near Miami International Airport) southwest towards Homestead and Florida City.[tpl]cite book|last=Turner|first=Gregg M.|title=Florida Railroads in the 1920s|year=2005|publisher=Arcadia Publishing[/tpl]
Today, the entire east coast line today runs closely parallel to Interstate 95 and is part of the state-owned South Florida Rail Corridor.  The original line (except for the branch to Allapattah) has been double tracked, and has been slightly realigned at the south end throughout the years to accommodate expansion of Miami International Airport.  Amtrak operates the Silver Meteor and Silver Star service over the line, both of which are former Seaboard passenger services.  A number of former Seaboard passenger depots still stand, which continue to serve both Amtrak and Tri-Rail, the region's commuter rail service.
The Florida Department of Transportation purchased the line from CSX Transportation (Seaboard's successor through various mergers) in 1988 in order to begin Tri-Rail service after an unsuccessful attempt to establish the service on the adjacent Florida East Coast Railway.  Tri-Rail is today run by the South Florida Regional Transportation Authority.[tpl]cite web|title=2011 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report|url=http://www.sfrta.fl.gov/docs/overview/SFRTA_2011_CAFR.pdf|publisher=South Florida Regional Transportation Authority|accessdate=16 September 2013[/tpl]  CSX continues to have freight trackage rights over the line, and they still refer to it as their Miami Subdivision.  As part of their agreement with FDOT, CSX will continue to maintain the line and provide dispatching up until June 2014, when SFRTA will assume those duties.[tpl]cite web|title=South Florida transportation authority to take over rail corridor operation from CSXT|url=http://www.progressiverailroading.com/csx_transportation/news/South-Florida-transportation-authority-to-take-over-rail-corridor-operation-from-CSXT--34995|work=Progressive Railroading|accessdate=13 October 2013[/tpl]

==West Coast==

The west coast line was part of President Warfield's ambition to build deepwater ports in Naples and at Punta Rassa (both of which were never built).  The line began near Fort Ogden in Hull, where it branched off of the Charlotte Harbor and Northern Railway, which the Seaboard had just acquired.  From Hull, it proceeded directly south to Fort Myers, crossing the Caloosahatchee River and entering Fort Myers on a long drawbridge just downstream from the original Tamiami Trail Bridge (both bridges were a short distance upstream of the Edison Bridge).
The Fort Myers passenger depot (which still stands today) was located just south of the river at the intersection of Palm Beach Boulevard (SR 80) and East Riverside Drive.  A separate freight depot (which also remains) was located a short distance south of the passenger depot on Michigan Avenue.
From Fort Myers, the line continued south along Palm Avenue and the west side of the Ten Mile Canal, where it paralleled the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad's Lakeland to Marco Island line for a short distance, which ran on the east side of the canal.  It continued along the canal to just north of Mullock Creek, where it turned southeast and headed to Bonita Springs.  It then turned south and continued into downtown Naples, running along the route of Goodlette-Frank Road.
A thirty-mile branch existed from Fort Myers east through Alva to LaBelle.  The LaBelle Branch branched off the main line just south of the Fort Myers freight depot, and ran just south of State Road 80.  Another 8-mile branch existed from South Fort Myers toward Punta Rassa, where Warfield hoped to establish a deepwater port.  The Punta Rassa Branch branched off the line in south Fort Myers, and ran along the current route of Six Mile Cypress Parkway and through where Lakes Park is currently located before turning southwest and indirectly paralleling what is now Summerlin Road to Truckland, terminating at McGregor Boulevard.
Unlike the east coast extension, the west coast extension only existed until 1952.  Although, the southernmost 7 miles of the line from Vanderbilt Beach to downtown Naples and the Naples depot (which Seaboard had abandoned earlier in 1942) were subsequently purchased and taken over by the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, who connected it to their adjacent track at Vanderbilt Beach and abandoned their original line though Naples to Marco Island.  The downtown Naples portion remained in service until the mid 1980s.[tpl]cite book| last =Turner | first =Gregg M. | title =Railroads of Southwest Florida | publisher =Arcadia Publishing | series =Images of America | date =December 1, 1999[/tpl]
The Naples depot on Fifth Avenue South is now the home of a historical museum.  The Fort Myers depot most recently housed the Reilly Brothers Construction company, but the building is currently vacant.  The eastbound lanes of State Road 80 (Seaboard Street) run on a small portion of the former right of way east of downtown Fort Myers.  The John Yarbrough Linear Park also runs on some of the line's former right of way south of Fort Myers next to the Ten Mile Canal.
