[[Nervilia]]

CATEGORIES: Orchid genera, Nervilia

Nervilia is a genus of orchid with about 65 species, 6 in Australia with 2 or 3 endemic and the rest widely distributed in tropical Asia,Jones (2006), p. 280. with 16 in India,http://orchidkerala.googlepages.com/nervilia.htm and 5 in southern Africa.Plants of Southern Africa: an Online Check List
There are flowering and non-flowering varieties - the non-flowering plants have only a single leaf and are either ground-hugging or erect. The flowering varieties have a fleshy flower stem with only one or a few flowers and a leaf which arises later at the base of the dying flower stem. The flowers are rarely seen in the wild because they appear soon after the first heavy rains of the wet season and only live for 1 to 4 days.Jones (2006), p. 280.
Nervilia is the sole member of its subtribe, the Nervilliinae.
