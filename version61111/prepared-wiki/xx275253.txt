==Biography==

thumb|left|Robert Marc, Untitled (9720), oil on canvas, 90 x 90cmMarc spent his youth in Switzerland before returning to France to Study art. He studied in Paris during the 1960s and was witness to the social upheavals of the period including the 1968 student riots. His work was inspired during his time in Paris through exposure to several influences including: the museums of Europe, that enhanced his artistic knowledge, the music of John Coltrane, and also African Art that he saw in the galleries on Rue Guenegaud.[tpl]cite book|last=Thorburn|first=Will|title=Robert Marc: Reflections and Rediscovery|year=2011|publisher=Alon Zakaim Fine Art|location=London|pages=ii[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=The Robert Marc Collection|url=http://www.robert-marc-collection.com/biography.asp|work=Biography[/tpl] However, he preferred the solitude of the countryside, and having finished his studies, he returned to his native Burgundy where he produced most of his work in his studio there.[tpl]cite book|last=Clidiere|first=Sylvie|title=Robert Marc|year=1990|publisher=F.P.

He was discovered in the early 1980s by the New York dealer Barry Friedman. Friedman bought a work by Marc from a Parisian gallery that was unsigned and at the time he was unaware of its authorship; as Friedman reveals: "At the time, Marc didn't sign his paintings, as he believed that the signature interfered with the image".[tpl]cite book|last=Thorburn|first=Will|title=Robert Marc: Reflections and Rediscovery|year=2011|publisher=Alon Zakaim Fine Art|location=London|pages=iii[/tpl] These images were influenced by Russian Avant-Garde artists Malevich and Rodchenko, rather than the western European cubists such as Picasso and Braque.[tpl]cite web|last=Barry Friedman Gallery|title=Robert Marc biography|url=http://www.barryfriedmanltd.com/artists/marc_bio.html?n=Robert%20Marc&t=biography[/tpl] 
The meeting with Friedman was decisive. His first solo exhibition was in 1988 in Toulouse, and the same year in New York. The last one was in 1995 in Metz. During his career, Marc exhibited in France and internationally including shows in New York and Tokyo. He worked up until his death in 1993.[tpl]cite web|last=Alon Zakaim Fine Art|title=Robert Marc|url=http://www.alonzakaim.com/?artist_id=237[/tpl] Marc's wife continued to exhibit his paintings in her own gallery, Galerie du Ressort, until 1998. 
Alon Zakaim Fine Art staged an exhibition of Marc's work in 2011.
