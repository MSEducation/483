[[Shah Daulah Shahid]]

CATEGORIES: Islam in India

Makhdum Shah Daulah Shahid was a Fourteenth Century Muslim saint recognized for his preaching of Islam in northern India.  He was martyred at Shahjadpur in Sirajganj District, Rajshahi District in what is now northwestern Bangladesh.
Makhdum Shah was the second son of Muaz bin Jabal, a king of Yemen.  Together with some twenty companions, he travelled east by the land route through Bukhara and into India preaching Islam.  Eventually they settled in Shahzadpur, at the time part of a Hindu kingdom.  The king was displeased with the disruption caused by  Makhdum Shah and his followers and ordered them expelled from his kingdom.  Makhdum Shah refused to comply and he and nearly all of his followers were killed.
Makhdum Shah is buried in Shahjadpur in Sirajganj District, near the Shahi mosque.
