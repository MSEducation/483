CATEGORIES: Living people, 1982 births

Paola Hernandez (born 1982) is a Mexican fashion designer based in New York City.  She designs clothes, shoes, and accessories. 
Paola Hernández launched her label in 2006 after studying fashion at Saint Martin’s in London and shoe design at ARS Sutoria in Milan. “Fashion is a manifestation of collective consciousness,” says Paola, “my creative process starts with a question of how to understand human evolution.”
Paola utilizes fashion design as a means of exploring ideas and proposing ways of life that can inspire humanity towards a better state of mind through self-development. Her designs are based on philosophical concepts with a clean aesthetic. Behind each collection, the colors and materials are chosen to represent each concept. 
Throughout her career she has presented her collections in New York, London, Paris, Reykjavik, Bogota, and Mexico City. She has also dressed a wide range of musicians, from bands such as Yeah Yeah Yeahs, The Horrors, The Stills, Stars, Mexican Institute of Sound, Moderatto, Adanowsky, Ximena Sariñana; and actresses for the Cannes Festival such as Karina Gidi and Silvia Navarro.  
Paola's designs have been featured in a wide range of publications, from Vogue, Elle, Harper's Bazaar, InStyle, and Celeste to Rolling Stone in Mexico, from WWD to Nylon in New York, as well as Super Super in London, and Studio Voice in Tokyo.
Companies such as W Hotels, American Airlines, Perrier, Apple, FedEx, MAC Cosmetics, and Toyota have supported Paola throughout her career. 
The first Paola Hernandez flagship store opened in Mexico City January 2013.
