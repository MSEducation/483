</ref> Lieutenant [[Henry Tureman Allen|Henry Allen]] and Private Fred Fickett of the [[United States Army]] ascended and explored the river in 1885. The discovery of [[gold]] deposits on the Middle Fork  in 1893 led to a [[gold rush]] in 1898 with the establishment of trading posts and mining camps, including Bettles, on the upper river. In 1929, [[Bob Marshall (wilderness activist)|Robert "Bob" Marshall]] explored the [[North Fork of the Koyukuk River]] and gave the name ''Gates of the Arctic'' to the high Brooks Range along the river.
In 1980 the United States Congress designated 100 mi (164 km) of the North Fork of the Koyukuk River in the Brooks Range as the Koyukuk Wild and Scenic River.
In 1994 floods on the river swept away three villages, forcing the wholesale relocation of the population.

==Flora and fauna==

Vegetation along the Koyukuk River, sparse along the upper reaches, consists of tundra plants such as dwarf willows and other shrubs, sedges, and lichens. Further downstream at lower elevations, taiga and boreal forest plants are common except in the Koyukuk Flats near the mouth, where sedges and other herbaceous plants dominate the poorly drained muskeg. Trees found in more well-drained areas along the river include mountain alder, trembling aspen, white, and black spruce.Benke and Cushing, p. 790
Fish species frequenting the lower Koyukuk include Arctic lamprey and sockeye salmon. The sockeye and other salmon species, including Chinook and chum, also thrive along the upper reaches and tributaries.
Caribou migrate across the upper part of the Koyukuk watershed. Other major vertebrates in the region include Bald Eagles, brown and black bears, mink, beaver, marten, and river otter. Beluga whales sometimes visit the lower Koyukuk.
Moose herds, which thrive in parts of the watershed, especially in riparian zones downstream of Hughes, attract local and non-local hunters, bears, and wolves. A consortium of moose hunters and state wildlife officials work to keep the moose population at sustainable levels.[tpl]cite web|title=Koyukuk River Moose Management Plan: 2000–2005|publisher=Alaska Department of Fish and Game|format=PDF|url=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/static/home/about/management/wildlifeplanning/pdfs/koyplan.pdf|date=March 2001|pages=6–11|accessdate=October 5, 2013[/tpl]
Through 2005, no one had published a study of invertebrates of the Koyukuk or its larger tributaries. General information included in a study related to pipeline construction through the watershed suggested the  presence of a variety of true flies, midges, black flies, mayflies, stoneflies, and caddisflies.
