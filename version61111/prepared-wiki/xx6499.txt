===2001: First Grand Slam title and ascent to number 1===

Hewitt started off the 2001 season well by winning the Medibank International in Sydney, and went on to win tournaments in London (Queen's Club) and 's-Hertogenbosch. He captured his first Grand Slam singles title at the US Open in 2001, when he beat former world no. 1 Yevgeny Kafelnikov in the semifinals and defeated then-four-time champion Pete Sampras the next day in straight sets.[tpl]cite web|title=Hewitt has the answer|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/tennis/2001/us_open/news/2001/09/09/usopen_sunday_ap/#more|work=CNN|date=9 September 2001|accessdate=2014-01-19[/tpl] This win made Hewitt the only active ATP player to win a Grand Slam singles and doubles title during his career.

For his third straight year, He qualified for the year-end Tennis Masters Cup held in Shanghai and successfully defended his title by defeating Juan Carlos Ferrero in the final.[tpl]cite news|title=Hewitt Captures Masters Cup|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/18/sports/plus-tennis-hewitt-captures-masters-cup.html|work=The New York Times|date=18 November 2002|accessdate=2014-01-20[/tpl]  Hewitt's win helped him finish the year as world no. 1 for a second straight year.

==Rivalries==

===Hewitt vs Federer===

Hewitt and Roger Federer have played each other on 27 occasions. Early in their careers, Hewitt dominated Federer, winning seven of their first nine meetings, including a victory from two sets down in the 2003 Davis Cup semifinal which allowed Australia to defeat Switzerland. However, from 2004 onward, Federer has dominated the rivalry, winning 16 of the last 18 meetings to emerge with an 18–9 overall head-to-head record. This is Hewitt's longest rivalry as these two first played each other as juniors in 1996. They have met in one Grand Slam final, the 2004 US Open final, where Federer won his first US Open title in a lopsided encounter in which Federer scored a bagel either side of a second set tiebreak. Federer has met Hewitt at six of the Grand Slam tournaments in which he lifted the trophy, including all five of his triumphs between 2004 and 2005. Their most recent meeting was at the 2014 Brisbane International, where Hewitt triumphed over Federer in three sets for his first title since 2010, when he also beat Federer to the Halle title.

===Hewitt vs Roddick===

Hewitt's second longest rivalry was against American Andy Roddick in which the two have played on 14 occasions. Early in the rivalry Hewitt dominated the rivalry with six wins from their first seven meetings. One of those wins included a five set victory at the 2001 US Open, the tournament in which Hewitt captured his first Singles Grand Slam title. In later years Roddick began to dominate Hewitt, with the rivalry finishing at 7 wins each upon Roddick's retirement.

===Hewitt vs Nalbandian===

A rivalry between Hewitt and Argentinian tennis players is believed to have begun at the 2002 Wimbledon final where Hewitt defeated Argentina's David Nalbandian in straight sets. The rivalry would hit boiling point in 2005 over a series of matches spread between the 2005 Australian Open and the 2005 Davis Cup Quarterfinals between Australia and Argentina. In the third round of 2005 Australian Open Hewitt faced Argentinian Juan Ignacio Chela in which Hewitt fired up Chela with his over-zealous celebrations for Chela's unforced errors, causing the Argentinian to spit at Hewitt during a change of ends. Hewitt would then face David Nalbandian in the quarterfinals with Hewitt coming out victorious 10–8 in the fifth set. Later in 2005 Hewitt would face Guillermo Coria in the Davis Cup quarterfinals where their rivalry would flare up however die down the following year in the 2006 Davis Cup semifinals where Argentina came out victorious 5–0 over Hewitt and the Australians.

==Playing style==

Hewitt is a defensive counterpuncher. He typically likes to stay back towards the baseline during a rally and will usually approach the net only to catch a short reply or drop shot from his opponent. Hewitt's lack of penetration in his groundstokes, most notably in his forehand, a typically dominant shot in most male players, forces him to rely on placement rather than simply "dominating" the point.[tpl]cite web|author=Correspondent |url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/616272-top-shot-ranking-the-top-18-forehands-in-mens-tennis-2000-2010/page/2 |title=Men's Tennis: Ranking the Top 18 Forehands from 2000–2010 |publisher=Bleacher Report |date=2011-03-25 |accessdate=20 April 2014[/tpl]  At the 2004 Cincinnati Masters Final, commentator MaliVai Washington said that Hewitt was even more difficult to "ace" than Agassi because he gets more returns in play. Hewitt's tactics typically involve putting difficult service returns in play, consistently chasing down attempted winning shots from his opponent, and keep the ball deep until he feels he can hit a winner.
Although he is known primarily as a baseliner, Hewitt is a skilled volleyer and is known for having one of the best overhead smashes in the game. His signature shot, however, is the offensive topspin lob, a shot that he executes efficiently off both wings when his opponent approaches the net. US Davis Cup captain Patrick McEnroe, Jim Courier and Tim Henman have all described Hewitt's lob as being the best in the world (although Henman has since declared Andy Murray to have succeeded him).[tpl]citation|title=Wimbledon 2013|publisher=BBC Sport|date=26 June 2013|accessdate=26 June 2013 [/tpl] In Andre Agassi's book "Open", Hewitt is described as one of the best shot selectors in the history of Men's Tennis.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/tennis/lleyton-hewitt-earns-praise-from-andre-agassi/story-e6frfgao-1225814846611|title=Lleyton Hewitt earns praise from Andre Agassi|work=Herald Sun|date=31 December 2009|accessdate=26 September 2010[/tpl]

In late 2008, to extend his tennis career and reduce the amount of tax he would otherwise have had to pay, the couple relocated for the European and North American season to their future holiday home in the Old Fort Bay estate, in Nassau, Bahamas.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,25613192-661,00.html|title=Lleyton Hewitt's $3.8m beachside hideaway|date=10 June 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl]
Hewitt has a nickname, 'Rusty', which was given to him by Darren Cahill who at the time thought Hewitt resembled the character Rusty, from the National Lampoon film series.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/sports/2012/01/20/aussie-hewitt-back-in-3rd-round-after-injuries/ |title=Aussie Hewitt back in 3rd round after injuries |author= |date=19 January 2014 |website=Fox News |publisher=FOX News Network, LLC |accessdate=19 January 2014[/tpl]

==Controversies==

During the 2001 U.S. Open Hewitt complained to Swiss umpire Andreas Egli after being called for two foot-faults by a linesman and requested that the official be moved. "Look at him. Look at him and you tell me what the similarity is. Just get him off the court." The 'similarity' was possibly in reference to both his opponent James Blake and the linesman being black. Hewitt told officials what he meant by the comment was that the same linesman made both foot-fault calls. Tournament referee Brian Earley decided not to fine Hewitt, saying, "There was no gesture in the direction of Mr. Blake when he made the comments about 'the similarities'. He did not use Mr. Blake's name. He didn't say 'my opponent.'"[tpl]cite news|title=Hewitt won't be fined – Evidence 'inconclusive' on Aussie's outburst|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/tennis/2001/us_open/news/2001/09/01/hewitt_folo/|accessdate=22 July 2012|date=1 September 2001[/tpl]
At the French Open of the same year, Hewitt was involved in yet more controversy when he twice called match officials "spastic." Following his outbursts, a complaint was received from the Cerebral Palsy Association in Australia. Hewitt later apologised, stating "If I did say that in the heat of the battle, then I apologise. I didn't intend to offend anyone."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/tennis/frenchopen/3006790/French-Open-Kuerten-takes-familiar-route-in-search-of-title.html|title=French Open Kuerten takes familiar route in search of title|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=18 January 2011|location=London|first=John|last=Parsons|date=5 June 2001[/tpl]
