==Reception==

The Allmusic review by Stephen Thomas Erlewine awards the album 4.5 stars and states: "The quartet didn't change their approach at all — at their core, they remain a heavy, speed-addled, hook-conscious post-hardcore punk group — but their songwriting has improved, as has their attack."AllMusic Review: Punk In Drublic Accessed 24 July 2010
