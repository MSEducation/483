David Tarloff had exhibited disturbing behaviours for almost two decades, and was well-known to the medical and psychiatric establishment and the police force. During these years, up to the time of the Kathryn Faughey murder, he received a wide range of psychiatric assessments and treatments.  He received medication and electroshock therapy by force.[tpl]cite book |last=Kirk |first=Stuart A. |title=Mad Science: Psychiatric Coercion, Diagnosis, and Drugs |year=2013 |publisher=Transaction Publishers |page= 13[/tpl]

==Incident==

Tarloff walked past the doorman, rolling a suitcase behind him (as seen on the building's surveillance video), saying that he was there to see Dr. Schinbach.  Tarloff waited in the office reception area, chatting with a patient, while one of Dr. Faughey's evening sessions was in progress.  After that session concluded, when he knew that Faughey was alone in her office, he entered the room and attacked her with a meat cleaver. Another psychiatrist from the same practice, Dr. Kent Schinbach, attempted to help her, but was seriously wounded by slashes in the face and neck.Patient hacks therapist to death, New York Daily News, February 13, 2008[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/13/nyregion/psychiatrist-also-a-victim-recalls-david-tarloffs-actions-on-night-of-therapists-murder.html |title=Psychiatrist, Also Victimized, Tells of Attack by Defendant | newspaper=New York Times| author=Russ Buettner |date=March 13, 2013[/tpl]

==Aftermath==

Tarloff was arrested and arraigned for the murder and ordered to undergo a psychiatric evaluationAssociated Press, Man Arraigned in Therapist's Knife Slaying; Judge Orders Psychiatric Evaluation, February 17, 2008 which found him to be mentally competent to stand trial. There was evidence that the attack had been premeditated, but that the intended victim was Schinbach. Tarloff told police that he had planned to rob Schinbach, who he remembered being involved in diagnosing him with schizophrenia in 1991 and arranging for his institutionalization at that time.Psychologist Murder Suspect Found Fit For Trial, WCBS-TV, February 22, 2008 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulations to protect patient confidentiality were reported to have delayed the initial investigation.Associated Press, NYPD Investigation Into Therapist Slaying Slowed by Privacy Laws, February 16, 2008 Tarloff, who was expected to plead insanity in the case, was confined to a psychiatric unit of Bellevue Hospital while awaiting trial.
