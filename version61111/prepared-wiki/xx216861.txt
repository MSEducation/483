He was a leading dancer with the American Ballet, Ballet Caravan and the American Ballet Caravan companies that preceded and led to the establishment of the New York City Ballet in 1948.  His creations with those companies included roles in Balanchine's  versions of Le Baiser de la Fee, The Card Party and Transcendence, which Balanchine choreographed especially for him.
His first ballet, Classic Ballet, was choreographed with Balanchine.  Dollar restaged this work in 1944 as Constantia for Ballet International.  He choreographed many other ballets, of which his best known is The Duel, originally staged in 1949 as Le Combat for Roland Petit's Ballets de Paris.

He worked with ballet companies in Brazil, Japan and Monte Carlo, and founded a national ballet company in Iran.  Dollar was one of the country's top performers in terpsichorean art and made five appearances at the Municipal Opera in St. Louis.Britannica and choreographer Brainy History
