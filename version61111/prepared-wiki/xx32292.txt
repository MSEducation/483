[[Árvakr and Alsviðr]]

CATEGORIES: Horses in Norse mythology

In Norse mythology, Árvakr (Old Norse "early awake"Simek (2007:19).) and Alsviðr (Old Norse "very quick"Simek (2007:10—11).) are the horses which pull the sun, or Sol's chariot, across the sky each day. It is said that the gods fixed bellows underneath the two horses' shoulders to help cool them off as they rode.[tpl]cite book|last=Matthews|first=John and Caitlin|title=The Element Encyclopedia of Magical Creatures|year=2005|publisher=Harper Element|isbn=978-1-4351-1086-1|page=17[/tpl]
