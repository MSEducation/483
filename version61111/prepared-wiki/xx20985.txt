Programmed Instruction, Learning, or Teaching (PILOT) is a simple historic programming language developed in the 1960s.[tpl]Cite web |title= PILOT Resource Center |author= Rob Linwood |work= Sourceforge project |url= http://rpilot.sourceforge.net/pilot.html |accessdate= October 13, 2011 [/tpl]
Like its younger sibling LOGO, it was an early foray into the technology of computer assisted instruction (CAI).

==History==

PILOT was developed by John Amsden Starkweather, a psychology professor at the University of California, San Francisco medical center. In 1962 he developed a simple language for automating learning tests called Computest. Starting in 1968, he developed a follow-on project called PILOT, for various computers of the time such as the SDS 940.[tpl]Cite web |title= Register of the John A.

==Language syntax==

A line of PILOT code contains (from left to right) the following syntax elements:
A label can also be alone in a line, not followed by other code.  The syntax for a label is an asterisk followed by an identifier (alphanumeric string with alphabetic initial character).

===Command letters===

The following commands are used in "core PILOT".  Lines beginning with "R:" indicate a remark (or a comment) explaining the code that follows.
  R:Next line of input replaces current contents of accept buffer
