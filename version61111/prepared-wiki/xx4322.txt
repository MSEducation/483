From 1977 to 2014, the only motorcycles sold to the public under the Harley-Davidson brand have been heavyweight motorcycles, with engine displacements greater than 700 cc, designed for cruising on highways. Harley-Davidson motorcycles, or "Harleys", are noted for the tradition of heavy customization that gave rise to the chopper style of motorcycle.[tpl]cite web|url=http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PG01&s1=11136081&OS=11136081&RS=11136081|title=United States Patent Application: 0060260569|publisher=appft1.uspto.gov|accessdate=April 27, 2008|last=Nelson|first=Gregory J.[/tpl] Except for the modern VRSC and Street model families, current Harley-Davidson motorcycles reflect the styles of classic Harley designs. While Harley-Davidson's attempts to establish itself in the light motorcycle market have met little success, and have largely been abandoned since the 1978 sale of its Italian Aermacchi subsidiary, the company re-entered the middleweight market in 2014 with its Street series of motorcycles.
Harley-Davidson sustains a large brand community which keeps active through clubs, events, and a museum. Licensing of the Harley-Davidson brand and logo accounted for $40 million (0.8%) of the company's net revenue in 2010.

==History==

===Beginning===

In 1901, William S. Harley, age [tpl]age|1880|12|29|1901|7|20[/tpl], drew up plans for a small engine with a displacement of [tpl]convert|7.07|cuin|cc|0[/tpl] and four-inch (102 mm) flywheels.[tpl]Citation |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=DreHM9-kvckC&pg=PA13 |page=13 |title= Classic Harley-Davidson, 1903-1941 |first= Herbert |last= Wagner |publisher=MotorBooks International |year= 1999 |ISBN= 9780760305577[/tpl] The engine was designed for use in a regular pedal-bicycle frame. Over the next two years, Harley and his childhood friend Arthur Davidson worked on their motor-bicycle using the northside Milwaukee machine shop at the home of their friend, Henry Melk. It was finished in 1903 with the help of Arthur's brother, Walter Davidson. Upon testing their power-cycle, Harley and the Davidson brothers found it unable to climb the hills around Milwaukee without pedal assistance. They quickly wrote off their first motor-bicycle as a valuable learning experiment.Herbert Wagner, 2003. At the Creation: Myth, Reality, and the Origin of the Harley-Davidson Motorcycle, 1901–1909 (Madison: Wisconsin Historical Society Press), pp.22–28, 42–44.
Work immediately began on a new and improved second-generation machine. This first "real" Harley-Davidson motorcycle had a bigger engine of [tpl]convert|24.74|cuin|cc|0[/tpl] with [tpl]convert|9.75|in|cm|0[/tpl] flywheels weighing [tpl]convert|28|lb|kg|abbr=on[/tpl]. The machine's advanced loop-frame pattern was similar to the 1903 Milwaukee Merkel motorcycle (designed by Joseph Merkel, later of Flying Merkel fame). The bigger engine and loop-frame design took it out of the motorized bicycle category and marked the path to future motorcycle designs. The boys also received help with their bigger engine from outboard motor pioneer Ole Evinrude, who was then building gas engines of his own design for automotive use on Milwaukee's Lake Street.
The prototype of the new loop-frame Harley-Davidson was assembled in a [tpl]convert|10|x|15|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] shed in the Davidson family backyard. Most of the major parts, however, were made elsewhere, including some probably fabricated at the West Milwaukee railshops where oldest brother William A. Davidson was then toolroom foreman. This prototype machine was functional by September 8, 1904, when it competed in a Milwaukee motorcycle race held at State Fair Park. It was ridden by Edward Hildebrand and placed fourth. This is the first documented appearance of a Harley-Davidson motorcycle in the historical record.Wagner, 2003. pp.45–62.
In January 1905, small advertisements were placed in the Automobile and Cycle Trade Journal that offered bare Harley-Davidson engines to the do-it-yourself trade. By April, complete motorcycles were in production on a very limited basis. That year, the first Harley-Davidson dealer, Carl H. Lang of Chicago, sold three bikes from the five built in the Davidson backyard shed. (Some years later the original shed was taken to the Juneau Avenue factory where it would stand for many decades as a tribute to the Motor Company's humble origins. Unfortunately, the first shed was accidentally destroyed by contractors in the early 1970s during a clean-up of the factory yard.)
In 1906, Harley and the Davidson brothers built their first factory on Chestnut Street (later Juneau Avenue).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.harley-davidson.com/wcm/Content/Pages/H-D_History/history_1900s.jsp |title=Harley-Davidson History Timeline |publisher=Harley-Davidson Motorcycle Company |accessdate=September 29, 2012 [/tpl] This location remains Harley-Davidson's corporate headquarters today. The first Juneau Avenue plant was a [tpl]convert|40|x|60|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] single-story wooden structure. The company produced about 50 motorcycles that year.
In 1907, William S. Harley graduated from the University of Wisconsin–Madison with a degree in mechanical engineering. That year additional factory expansion came with a second floor and later with facings and additions of Milwaukee pale yellow ("cream") brick. With the new facilities production increased to 150 motorcycles in 1907. The company was officially incorporated that September. They also began selling their motorcycles to police departments around this time, a market that has been important to them ever since.Wagner, 2003. pp.68–81, 118.
Production in 1905 and 1906 were all single-cylinder models with [tpl]convert|26.84|cuin|cc|0[/tpl] engines. In February 1907 a prototype model with a 45-degree V-Twin engine was displayed at the Chicago Automobile Show. Although shown and advertised, very few V-Twin models were built between 1907 and 1910. These first V-Twins displaced [tpl]convert|53.68|cuin|cc|0[/tpl] and produced about [tpl]convert|7|hp|kW[/tpl]. This gave about double the power of the first singles. Top speed was about [tpl]convert|60|mph|km/h|-1|abbr=on[/tpl]. Production jumped from 450 motorcycles in 1908 to 1,149 machines in 1909.Wagner, 2003. pp.124–25.
thumb|Harley-Davidson works in 1911By 1911, some 150 makes of motorcycles had already been built in the United States – although just a handful would survive the 1910s.
In 1911, an improved V-Twin model was introduced. The new engine had mechanically operated intake valves, as opposed to the "automatic" intake valves used on earlier V-Twins that opened by engine vacuum. With a displacement of [tpl]convert|49.48|cuin|cc|0[/tpl], the 1911 V-Twin was smaller than earlier twins, but gave better performance. After 1913 the majority of bikes produced by Harley-Davidson would be V-Twin models.
By 1913, the yellow brick factory had been demolished and on the site a new 5-story structure had been built. Begun in 1910, the factory with its many additions would take up two blocks along Juneau Avenue and around the corner on 38th Street. Despite the competition, Harley-Davidson was already pulling ahead of Indian and would dominate motorcycle racing after 1914. Production that year swelled to 16,284 machines.

===World War I===

In 1917, the United States entered World War I and the military demanded motorcycles for the war effort.[ref][tpl]cite web|title       = The National World War One Museum – Recent Acquisitions – Model J 1917 Harley-Davidson Army Motorcycle |url         = http://www.theworldwar.org/s/110/display.aspx?sid=110&gid=1&pgid=967 |work=The National World War One Museum |accessdate  =June 13, 2009[/tpl]

===Bicycles===

Harley-Davidson launched a line of bicycles in 1917 in hopes of recruiting customers for its motorcycles. Besides the traditional diamond frame men's bicycle, models included a step-through frame 3-18 "Ladies Standard" and a 5-17 "Boy Scout" for youth. The effort was discontinued in 1923 because of disappointing sales.Harley-Davidson Museum, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, various artifacts, ephemera, and placards on display. One placard states "Harley-Davidson began as a motorcycle manufacturer unlike competitors such as Indian and Pope, which has previous histories in bicycling prior to building motorcycles. The many connections between bicycling and motorcycling prompted Harley-Davidson to begin selling bicycles in 1917. Despite heavy promotion, sales were disappointing and production was discontinued in 1923."
The bicycles were built for Harley-Davidson in Dayton, Ohio, by the Davis Machine Company from 1917 to 1921, when Davis stopped manufacturing bicycles.[tpl]cite book |last= Youngblood|first= Ed|year= 2003|title= The Heroes of Harley-Davidson|url= [tpl]Google books|EsYzQ5W3d2sC|The Heroes of Harley-Davidson|page=137|plainurl= yes[/tpl]|location= St. Paul, MN USA|publisher= Motorbooks International|page= 137|isbn= 0-7603-1595-7|accessdate= 2014-04-19[/tpl]

===1920s===

By 1920, Harley-Davidson was the largest motorcycle manufacturer in the world, with 28,189 machines produced, and dealers in 67 countries.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.harley-davidson.com/wcm/Content/Pages/H-D_History/history_1920s.jsp?locale=en_US |title=Harley-Davidson History Timeline |publisher=Harley-Davidson Motorcycle Company |accessdate=March 2010[/tpl]
In 1921, a Harley-Davidson, ridden by Otto Walker, was the first motorcycle ever to win a race at an average speed greater than [tpl]convert|100|mph|km/h|-1|abbr=on[/tpl].[ref]

Statnekov|accessdate=April 26, 2008[/tpl]
During the 1920s, several improvements were put in place, such as a new 74 cubic inch (1,212.6  cc) V-Twin, introduced in 1922, and the "Teardrop" gas tank in 1925. A front brake was added in 1928 although notably only on the J/JD models.The Encyclopedia of the Harley-Davidson by Peter Henshaw and Ian Kerr, p.139
In the late summer of 1929, Harley-Davidson introduced its [tpl]convert|45|cuin|cc|0[/tpl] flathead V-Twin to compete with the Indian 101 Scout and the Excelsior Super X.[tpl]Cite book|author=Mitchel, D.|title=Harley-Davidson Chronicle – An American Original|pages=68–69|publisher=Publications International Limited|year=1997|isbn=0-7853-2514-X[/tpl] This was the "D" model, produced from 1929 to 1931.[tpl]cite web|first       = Andy |last        = Hornsby |title       = American V – A Potted History of Harley-Davidson: Part 1 1903–1954 |url         = http://www.american-v.co.uk/heritage/timeline/pottedhist1/index.html |work=American V |publisher=American-V |location    = Crewe, England |accessdate  =June 13, 2009 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070928094348/http://www.american-v.co.uk/heritage/timeline/pottedhist1/index.html |archivedate = September 28, 2007[/tpl] Riders of Indian motorcycles derisively referred to this model as the "three cylinder Harley" because the generator was upright and parallel to the front cylinder.Mitchel, p.70 The [tpl]convert|2.745|in|mm|1|abbr=on[/tpl] bore and [tpl]convert|3.8125|in|mm|1|abbr=on[/tpl] stroke would continue in most versions of the 750 engine; exceptions include the XA and the XR-750.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2009[/tpl]

===Great Depression===

The Great Depression began a few months after the introduction of their 45 cubic inch model. Harley-Davidson's sales fell from 21,000 in 1929 to 3,703 in 1933. Despite this, Harley-Davidson unveiled a new lineup for 1934, which included a Flathead with Art Deco styling.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.motorcycleclassics.com/harley-davidson/1934-harley-davidson-vld.aspx|title=1934 Harley-Davidson VLD|publisher=Motorcycle Classics| accessdate=August 5, 2009|date= March–April 2009|author=Margie Siegal[/tpl]
In order to survive the remainder of the Depression, the company manufactured industrial powerplants based on their motorcycle engines. They also designed and built a three-wheeled delivery vehicle called the Servi-Car, which remained in production until 1973.
In the mid-1930s, Alfred Rich Child opened a production line in Japan with the [tpl]convert|74|cuin|cc[/tpl] VL. The Japanese license-holder, Sankyo Seiyako Corporation, severed its business relations with Harley-Davidson in 1936 and continued manufacturing the VL under the Rikuo name.The Motorcycle Hall of Fame Museum – 1958 Rikuo RT2: Harley-Davidson's Japanese connection. Motorcyclemuseum.org. Retrieved on April 27, 2012.
An [tpl]convert|80|cuin|cc[/tpl] flathead engine was added to the line in 1935, by which time the single-cylinder motorcycles had been discontinued.Mitchel, p. 92
In 1936, the 61E and 61EL models with the "Knucklehead" OHV engines was introduced.Mitchel, pp. 94–95 Valvetrain problems in early Knucklehead engines required a redesign halfway through its first year of production and retrofitting of the new valvetrain on earlier engines.[tpl]Cite book|last=Johnstone|first=Gary|title=Classic Motorcycles|origyear=First published 1993 by Boxtree Ltd.|year=1995|publisher=Tiger Books International|location=Twickenham|isbn=1-85501-731-8|page=53|chapter=Union Pacific Meets Roy Rogers[/tpl]
By 1937, all Harley-Davidson's flathead engines were equipped with dry-sump oil recirculation systems similar to the one introduced in the "Knucklehead" OHV engine. The revised [tpl]convert|74|cuin|cc[/tpl] V and VL models were renamed U and UL, the [tpl]convert|80|cuin|cc[/tpl] VH and VLH to be renamed UH and ULH, and the [tpl]convert|45|cuin|cc[/tpl] R to be renamed W.
In 1941, the [tpl]convert|74|cuin|cc[/tpl] "Knucklehead" was introduced as the F and the FL. The [tpl]convert|80|cuin|cc[/tpl] flathead UH and ULH models were discontinued after 1941, while the 74" U & UL flathead models were produced up to 1948.

===World War II===

One of only two American cycle manufacturers to survive the Great Depression,[tpl]Cite book|last=Wilson|first=Hugo|title=The Ultimate Motorcycle Book|year=1993|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|location=London|language=UK English|isbn=0-7513-0043-8|page=17|chapter=The World's Motorcycles: America[/tpl] Harley-Davidson again produced large numbers of motorcycles for the US Army in World War II and resumed civilian production afterwards, producing a range of large V-twin motorcycles that were successful both on racetracks and for private buyers.
Harley-Davidson, on the eve of World War II, was already supplying the Army with a military-specific version of its [tpl]convert|45|cuin|cc[/tpl] WL line, called the WLA. The A in this case stood for "Army". Upon the outbreak of war, the company, along with most other manufacturing enterprises, shifted to war work. More than 90,000 military motorcycles, mostly WLAs and WLCs (the Canadian version) were produced, many to be provided to allies.Smithsonian magazine, August 2003, pg. 34 – "Wild Thing", Robert F. Howe  Harley-Davidson received two Army-Navy ‘E’ Awards, one in 1943 and the other in 1945, which were awarded for Excellence in Production.
Shipments to the Soviet Union under the Lend-Lease program numbered at least 30,000.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2010[/tpl] The WLAs produced during all four years of war production generally have 1942 serial numbers. Production of the WLA stopped at the end of World War II, but was resumed from 1950 to 1952 for use in the Korean War.
The U.S. Army also asked Harley-Davidson to produce a new motorcycle with many of the features of BMW's side-valve and shaft-driven R71. Harley largely copied the BMW engine and drive train and produced the shaft-driven 750 cc 1942 Harley-Davidson XA. This shared no dimensions, no parts and no design concepts (except side valves) with any prior Harley-Davidson engine. Due to the superior cooling of the flat-twin engine with the cylinders across the frame, Harley's XA cylinder heads ran 100 °F (56 °C) cooler than its V-twins.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.motorcyclemuseum.org/asp/classics/bike.asp?id=71 |title=Motorcycle Hall of Fame Museum: 1942 Harley-Davidson XA |publisher=Motorcyclemuseum.org |accessdate=February 25, 2011[/tpl] The XA never entered full production: the motorcycle by that time had been eclipsed by the Jeep as the Army's general purpose vehicle, and the WLA—already in production—was sufficient for its limited police, escort, and courier roles. Only 1,000 were made and the XA never went into full production. It remains the only shaft-driven Harley-Davidson ever made.

===Small Harleys: Hummers and Aermacchis===

As part of war reparations, Harley-Davidson acquired the design of a small German motorcycle, the DKW RT 125, which they adapted, manufactured, and sold from 1948 to 1966.History. Harley Hummer Club (2010-05-17). Retrieved on July 7, 2011. Various models were made, including the Hummer from 1955 to 1959, but they are all colloquially referred to as "Hummers" at present.Harley Hummer. Com. Harleyhummer.com. Retrieved on July 7, 2011. BSA in the United Kingdom took the same design as the foundation of their BSA Bantam.Wilson, H. "The Encyclopedia of the Motorcycle" p. 37 Dorling-Kindersley Limited, 1995 ISBN 0-7513-0206-6
In 1960, Harley-Davidson consolidated the Model 165 and Hummer lines into the Super-10, introduced the Topper scooter,Wilson, p. 252 and bought fifty percent of Aermacchi's motorcycle division.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.motorcycleclassics.com/motorcycle-reviews/aermacchi-harley-davidson-350-sprint.aspx|title=Aermacchi Harley-Davidson Sprint 350|work=Motorcycle Classics|accessdate=2011-07-18|date=July–August 2011|author=Richard Backus[/tpl]  Importation of Aermacchi's 250 cc horizontal single began the following year.Wilson, p. 74Mitchel, p. 187 The bike bore Harley-Davidson badges and was marketed as the Harley-Davidson Sprint.  The engine of the Sprint was increased to 350 cc in 1969Mitchel, p. 215 and would remain that size until 1974, when the four-stroke Sprint was discontinued.
After the Pacer and Scat models were discontinued at the end of 1965, the Bobcat became the last of Harley-Davidson's American-made two-stroke motorcycles. The Bobcat was manufactured only in the 1966 model year.Mitchel, p. 193
Harley-Davidson replaced their American-made lightweight two-stroke motorcycles with the Aermacchi-built two-stroke powered M-65, M-65S, and Rapido. The M-65 had a semi-step-through frame and tank. The M-65S was a M-65 with a larger tank that eliminated the step-through feature. The Rapido was a larger bike with a 125 cc engine.Mitchel, p. 218  The Aermacchi-built Harley-Davidsons became entirely two-stroke powered when the 250 cc two-stroke SS-250 replaced the four-stroke 350 cc Sprint in 1974.Mitchel, p. 247, p.250
Harley-Davidson purchased full control of Aermacchi's motorcycle production in 1974 and continued making two-stroke motorcycles there until 1978, when they sold the facility to Cagiva.

Prior to WWII, Harley-Davidson's were produced in Japan under license to the company Rikuo (Rikuo Internal Combustion Company)[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Q473NKddjnAC&pg=PA240&lpg=PA240&dq=Harley-Davidson+RL+45&source=bl&ots=7AAy9cijQG&sig=O-IEfEHbvXE4W66dTkXWCRL6g7U&hl=en&sa=X&ei=E62aT4SyEoiG4gTu5OCwDw&ved=0CGEQ6AEwCw#v=onepage&q=Harley-Davidson%20RL%2045&f=false |title=Google Books: Japan's Motorcycle Wars: An Industry History |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-07-25[/tpl] starting in 1929 under the name of Harley-Davidson and using the company's tooling, and later under the name Rikuo.

===Tarnished reputation===

In 1952, following their application to the US Tariff Commission for a 40% tax on imported motorcycles, Harley-Davidson was charged with restrictive practices.[tpl]cite web|author=Ian Chadwick, ichadwick@sympatico.ca |url=http://www.ianchadwick.com/motorcycles/triumph/time03.html |title=Triumph Motorcycles Timeline: Recovery and Growth 1946–1962 |publisher=Ianchadwick.com |accessdate=January 5, 2009[/tpl]
In 1969, American Machine and Foundry (AMF) bought the company, streamlined production, and slashed the workforce. This tactic resulted in a labor strike and a lower quality of bikes. The bikes were expensive and inferior in performance, handling, and quality to Japanese motorcycles. Sales and quality declined, and the company almost went bankrupt. The "Harley-Davidson" name was mocked as "Hardly Ableson", "Hardly Driveable," and "Hogly Ferguson",
and the nickname "Hog" became pejorative.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2009[/tpl]

===Restructuring and revival===

In 1981, AMF sold the company to a group of thirteen investors led by Vaughn Beals and Willie G. Davidson for $80 million.Smithsonian magazine, August 2003, pg. 36 – "Wild Thing", Robert F. Howe  Inventory was strictly controlled using the just-in-time system.
In the early eighties, Harley-Davidson claimed that Japanese manufacturers were importing motorcycles into the US in such volume as to harm or threaten to harm domestic producers. After an investigation by the US International Trade Commission, President Reagan imposed in 1983 a 45% tariff on imported bikes with engine capacities greater than 700 cc. Harley-Davidson subsequently rejected offers of assistance from Japanese motorcycle makers.http://www.japanlaw.info/lawletter/july83/ase.htm – 7/83 US Imposes 45% Tariff on Imported Motorcycles However, the company did offer to drop the request for the tariff in exchange for loan guarantees from the Japanese.[tpl]cite encyclopedia|last=Field|first=Greg|editor=Darwin Holmstrom|encyclopedia=The Harley-Davidson Century|title=The Myth of Harley VS.

Rather than trying to match the Japanese, the new management deliberately exploited the "retro" appeal of the machines, building motorcycles that deliberately adopted the look and feel of their earlier machines and the subsequent customizations of owners of that era.

===Claims of stock price manipulation===

During its period of peak demand, during the late 1990s and early first decade of the 21st century, Harley-Davidson embarked on a program of expanding the number of dealerships throughout the country. At the same time, its current dealers typically had waiting lists that extended up to a year for some of the most popular models. Harley-Davidson, like the auto manufacturers, records a sale not when a consumer buys their product, but rather when it is delivered to a dealer. Therefore, it is possible for the manufacturer to inflate sales numbers by requiring dealers to accept more inventory than desired in a practice called channel stuffing. When demand softened following the unique 2003 model year, this news led to a dramatic decline in the stock price. In April 2004 alone, the price of HOG shares dropped from more than $60 to less than $40. Immediately prior to this decline, retiring CEO Jeffrey Bleustein profited $42 million on the exercise of employee stock options.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/793952/000122520804000684/xslF345X02/doc4.xml|title=SEC Form 4|publisher=EDGAR|date=April 15, 2004[/tpl] Harley-Davidson was named as a defendant in numerous class action suits filed by investors who claimed they were intentionally defrauded by Harley-Davidson's management and directors.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.glancylaw.com/amazing_case.php?caseid=125 |title=Glancy Binkow & Goldberg LLP – Attorneys at Law |publisher=Glancylaw.com |date=January 21, 2004 |accessdate=January 5, 2009[/tpl] By January 2007, the price of Harley-Davidson shares reached $70.

===Financial crisis===

According to Interbrand, the value of the Harley-Davidson brand fell by 43% to $4.34 billion in 2009. The fall in value is believed to be connected to the 66% drop in the company profits in two quarters of the previous year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://english.pravda.ru/business/companies/23-09-2009/109454-harley_davidson-0|title=Harley-Davidson, Toyota and Porsche Brands Lose Value|accessdate=October 1, 2009 |date=September 21, 2009 |publisher=Pravda.ru[/tpl] On April 29, 2010, Harley-Davidson stated that they must cut $54 million in manufacturing costs from its production facilities in Wisconsin, and that they would explore alternative U.S. sites to accomplish this. The announcement came in the wake of a massive company-wide restructuring, which began in early 2009 and involved the closing of two factories, one distribution center, and the planned elimination of nearly 25% of its total workforce (around 3,500 employees). The company announced on September 14, 2010 that it would remain in Wisconsin.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/14/harley-davidsons-to-remain-wisconsin-made/?src=mv&ref=automobiles | work=The New York Times | first=Jerry | last=Garrett | title=Harley-Davidsons to Remain Wisconsin-Made | date=September 14, 2010[/tpl]

==Motorcycle engines==

The classic Harley-Davidson engines are V-twin engines, each with a 45° angle between the cylinders. The crankshaft has a single pin, and both pistons are connected to this pin through their connecting rods.
This 45° angle is covered under several United States patents and is an engineering tradeoff that allows a large, high-torque engine in a relatively small space. It causes the cylinders to fire at uneven intervals and produces the choppy "potato-potato" sound so strongly linked to the Harley-Davidson brand.
To simplify the engine and reduce costs, the V-twin ignition was designed to operate with a single set of points and no distributor. This is known as a dual fire ignition system, causing both spark plugs to fire regardless of which cylinder was on its compression stroke, with the other spark plug firing on its cylinder's exhaust stroke, effectively "wasting a spark". The exhaust note is basically a throaty growling sound with some popping.
The 45° design of the engine thus creates a plug firing sequencing as such: The first cylinder fires, the second (rear) cylinder fires 315° later, then there is a 405° gap until the first cylinder fires again, giving the engine its unique sound.[tpl]cite web|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/harley3.htm|title=Howstuffworks "The Harley Sound and Mystique"|publisher=auto.howstuffworks.com|accessdate=April 27, 2008[/tpl]
Harley-Davidson has used various ignition systems throughout its history – be it the early points and condenser system, (Big Twin up to 1978 and Sportsters 1970 to 1978), magneto ignition system used on 1958 to 1969 Sportsters, early electronic with centrifugal mechanical advance weights, (all models 1978 and a half to 1979), or the late electronic with transistorized ignition control module, more familiarly known as the black box or the brain, (all models 1980 to present).
Starting in 1995, the company introduced Electronic Fuel Injection (EFI) as an option for the 30th anniversary edition Electra Glide.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.harley-davidson.com/wcm/Content/Pages/H-D_History/history_1990s.jsp?locale=en_US|title=Harley-Davidson – Timeline 1990's|publisher=www.harley-davidson.com|accessdate=April 27, 2008|archivedate=October 3, 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081003125510/http://www.harley-davidson.com/wcm/Content/Pages/H-D_History/history_1990s.jsp?locale=en_US|deadurl=yes[/tpl] EFI became standard on all Harley-Davidson motorcycles, including Sportsters, upon the introduction of the 2007 product line.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nightrider.com/biketech/motorcycle_efi_basics.htm|title=Harley-Davidson Motorcycle Fuel Injection Explained|publisher=www.nightrider.com|accessdate=April 27, 2008[/tpl]
In 1991, Harley-Davidson began to participate in the Sound Quality Working Group, founded by Orfield Labs, Bruel and Kjaer, TEAC, Yamaha, Sennheiser, SMS and Cortex. This was the nation's first group to share research on psychological acoustics. Later that year, Harley-Davidson participated in a series of sound quality studies at Orfield Labs, based on recordings taken at the Talladega Superspeedway, with the objective to lower the sound level for EU standards while analytically capturing the "Harley Sound."[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2007[/tpl] This research resulted in the bikes that were introduced in compliance with EU standards for 1998.
On February 1, 1994, the company filed a sound trademark application for the distinctive sound of the Harley-Davidson motorcycle engine: "The mark consists of the exhaust sound of applicant's motorcycles, produced by V-twin, common crankpin motorcycle engines when the goods are in use". Nine of Harley-Davidson's competitors filed comments opposing the application, arguing that cruiser-style motorcycles of various brands use a single-crankpin V-twin engine which produce a similar sound.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/law/st_org/iptf/articles/content/1998101101.html|title=The Trademark Registrability of the Harley-Davidson Roar: A Multimedia Analysis|publisher=www.bc.edu|accessdate=April 27, 2008[/tpl]  These objections were followed by litigation.

A 1,250 cc Screamin' Eagle version of the Revolution engine was made available for 2005 and 2006, and was present thereafter in a single production model from 2005 to 2007. In 2008, the 1,250 cc Revolution Engine became standard for the entire VRSC line. Harley-Davidson claims [tpl]convert|123|hp|abbr=on[/tpl] at the crank for the 2008 VRSCAW model.

The flathead single-cylinder motorcycles were designated Model A for engines with magneto systems only and Model B for engines with battery and coil systems, while overhead valve versions were designated Model AA and Model BA respectively, and a magneto-only racing version was designated Model S. This line of single-cylinder motorcycles ended production in 1934.

==Model families==

Modern Harley-branded motorcycles fall into one of six model families: Touring, Softail, Dyna, Sportster, Vrod and Street. These model families are distinguished by the frame, engine, suspension, and other characteristics.

===Touring===

The touring family, also known as "dressers", includes Road King, Road Glide, Street Glide and Electra Glide models offered in various trim. The Road Kings have a "retro cruiser" appearance and are equipped with a large clear windshield. Road Kings are reminiscent of big-twin models from the 1940s and 1950s. Electra Glides can be identified by their full front fairings. Most Electra Glides sport a fork-mounted fairing referred to as the "Batwing" due to its unmistakable shape. The Road Glide and Road Glide Ultra Classic have a frame-mounted fairing, referred to as the "Sharknose". The Sharknose includes a unique, dual front headlight.
Touring models are distinguishable by their large saddlebags, rear coil-over air suspension and are the only models to offer full fairings with radios and CBs. All touring models use the same frame, first introduced with a Shovelhead motor in 1980, and carried forward with only modest upgrades until 2009, when it was extensively redesigned. The frame is distinguished by the location of the steering head in front of the forks and was the first H-D frame to rubber mount the drivetrain to isolate the rider from the vibration of the big V-twin.
The frame was modified for the 1994 model year when the oil tank went under the transmission and the battery was moved inboard from under the right saddlebag to under the seat. In 1997, the frame was again modified to allow for a larger battery under the seat and to lower seat height. In 2007, Harley-Davidson introduced the [tpl]convert|96|cuin|cc|abbr=off[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://www.motorcyclistonline.com/2013/harley_davidson/dyna/specifications/05/engine.html|title= Buyer's Guide: Harley-Davidson Dyna 2013|work=Motorcyclist Online|publisher=Source Interlink|accessdate=October 11, 2012[/tpl] Twin Cam 96 engine, as well the six-speed transmission to give the rider better speeds on the highway.
In 2006, Harley introduced the FLHX Street Glide, a bike designed by Willie G. Davidson to be his personal ride, to its touring line.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.brainbucketmag.com/News/article/sid=408.html|last=Newbern|first=Michael|title=First Ride: 2007 FLHX|date=August 8, 2006[/tpl]
In 2008, Harley added anti-lock braking systems and cruise control as a factory installed option on all touring models (standard on CVO and Anniversary models).[tpl]Cite press release |title=ABS OPTION ON ALL HARLEY-DAVIDSON TOURING AND VRSC MODELS |publisher=Harley-Davidson |date=July 9, 2007 |url=http://www.harley-davidson.com/CO/NEW/en/PressRelease_date.asp?locale=en_US&bmLocale=en_US&HDCWPSession=vHLgG6cQLh81Jl9BDmTDST1frXYC02vTcXyzfQGn090yRDvTJyQb!-1996869500!400212047&id_in=1244&dspmm=7&dspyy=2007&FROM=NewsARCHIVE |accessdate=September 26, 2007 [/tpl] Also new for 2008 is the [tpl]convert|6|usgal|sing=on[/tpl] fuel tank for all touring models. 2008 also brought throttle-by-wire to all touring models.
For the 2009 model year, Harley-Davidson has redesigned the entire touring range with several changes, including a new frame, new swingarm, a completely revised engine-mounting system, [tpl]convert|17|in|mm|adj=on[/tpl] front wheels for all but the FLHRC Road King Classic, and a 2–1–2 exhaust. The changes result in greater load carrying capacity, better handling, a smoother engine, longer range and less exhaust heat transmitted to the rider and passenger.2009 Harley-Davidson 2009 model line.

Also released for the 2009 model year is the FLHTCUTG Tri-Glide Ultra Classic, the first three-wheeled Harley since the Servi-Car was discontinued in 1973.

In 2014 Harley-Davisdon released a redesigned for specific touring bikes and called the redesign, "Project Rushmore".

===Softail===

These big-twin motorcycles capitalize on Harley's strong value on tradition. With the rear-wheel suspension hidden under the transmission, they are visually similar to the "hardtail" choppers popular in the 1960s and 1970s, as well as from their own earlier history. In keeping with that tradition, Harley offers Softail models with "Springer" front ends and "Heritage" styling that incorporate design cues from throughout their history.
Softail models utilize the big-twin engine (F) and the Softail chassis (ST).

===Dyna===

Dyna-frame motorcycles were developed in the 1980s and early 1990s and debuted in the 1991 model year with the FXDB Sturgis offered in limited edition quantities. In 1992 the line continued with the limited edition FXDB Daytona and a production model FXD Super Glide. The new DYNA frame featured big-twin engines and traditional styling. They can be distinguished from the Softail by the traditional coil-over suspension that connects the swingarm to the frame, and from the Sportster by their larger engines. On these models, the transmission also houses the engine's oil reservoir.
Prior to 2008, Dyna models typically featured a narrow, XL-style front fork and front wheel, which the manufacturer included the letter "X" in the model designation to indicate. This lineup traditionally included the Super Glide (FXD), Super Glide Custom (FXDC), Street Bob (FXDB), and Low Rider (FXDL). One exception was the Wide Glide (FXDWG), which maintained the thickness of the XL forks and a narrow front wheel, but positioned the forks on wider triple-trees that give a beefier appearance. In 2008, the Dyna Fat Bob (FXDF) was introduced to the Dyna lineup, featuring aggressive styling like a new 2–1–2 exhaust, twin headlamps, a 180 mm rear tire, and, for the first time in the Dyna lineup, a 130 mm front tire. For the 2012 model year, the Dyna Switchback  (FLD) became the first Dyna to break the tradition of having an FX model designation: with detachable painted hard saddlebags, touring windshield, larger fork tubes, headlight nacelle and a wide front tire with full fender.  The new front end resembled the big-twin FL models from 1968-1971.
The Dyna family used the [tpl]convert|88|cuin|cc|sing=on[/tpl] twin cam from 1999 to 2006. In 2007, the displacement was increased to [tpl]convert|96|cuin|cc[/tpl] as the factory increased the stroke to [tpl]convert|4.375|in|mm|1[/tpl]. For the 2012 model year, the manufacturer began to offer Dyna models with the [tpl]convert|103|cuin|cc|sing=on[/tpl] upgrade.  All Dyna models use a rubber-mounted engine to isolate engine vibration.
Dyna models utilize the big-twin engine (F), small-diameter telescopic forks similar to those used on the Sportster (X) until 2012 when one model used the large diameter forks similar in appearance to those used on the Touring (L) models, and the Dyna chassis (D). Therefore, except for the FLD from 2012 to the present, all Dyna models have designations that begin with FXD, e.g., FXDWG (Dyna Wide Glide) and FXDL (Dyna Low Rider).
