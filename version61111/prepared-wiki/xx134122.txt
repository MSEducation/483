[[Monadnock Ledger]]

CATEGORIES: Newspapers published in New Hampshire

The Monadnock Ledger was a weekly newspaper based in Peterborough, New Hampshire. In September 2006 it purchased the rival Peterborough Transcript and created the twice-weekly Monadnock Ledger-Transcript.
The Ledger started in the mid-1950s as a company newsletter for New Hampshire Ball Bearings. Richard Noyes converted the newsletter into a tabloid weekly based in Jaffrey and then into a full size newspaper coming out twice a week, as the Jaffrey Ledger one day and the Peterborough Ledger some days later."Our Changing Town: Peterborough 1939-1989", page 168, Peterborough Historical Society. Peter E. Randall Publisher, Portsmouth, NH, 1996. It later changed to a weekly.
