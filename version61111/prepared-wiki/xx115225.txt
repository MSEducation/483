[[Paracyrba]]

CATEGORIES: Salticidae

Paracyrba is a spider genus of the Salticidae family (jumping spiders). Its only described species, P. wanlessi, is found only in Malaysia.
Its microhabitat are the water-filled hollow internodes of decaying bamboo, where it preys for aquatic animals, especially mosquito larvae.Zhang et al. 2006 In general only one specimen is found per occupied bamboo internode.Murphy & Murphy 2000: 294

==Description==

Females are up to 9Â mm long, males 7 to 8. The spiders is generally dark colored. On the flattened carapace, there is a central whitish band, which is much larger in the female. On the opisthosoma there are four to five transverse, yellowish bands, and a light area near the spinnerets. The long, thin legs are suited for their stealthy, non-jumping movements. The genitals are very similar to those of Cyrba, and P. wanlessi seems to have separated from it mainly due to its lifestyle.

==Name==

The genus name is a combination of the Ancient Greek para "near to" and the name of the related genus Cyrba.
The species is named in honor of Fred R. Wanless, who contributed much to the knowledge about the subfamily Spartaeinae.
