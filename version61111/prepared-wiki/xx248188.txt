Prior to her professional involvement in the field of autism awareness and research, she focused on field management, cost and financial analysis, and corporate operations at IBM Corporation.http://www.emken2010.com/meet
She lives in Fair Oaks, California with her husband of 28 years, Craig Swartz, a Global Enterprise Solution Architect at Dell. They have two daughters and a 21-year-old son, Alex, who has autism spectrum disorder.

==Autism advocacy==

Emken joined Autism Speaks in March 2007 to manage the relationship between the organization and the federal government, state governments, and related agencies.
Prior to joining Autism Speaks, Emken was a legislative consultant and board member at Cure Autism Now since 1998. She initially coordinated grassroots advocacy for the first major piece of federal autism legislation, the Advancement in Pediatric Autism Research Act, ultimately becoming the lead title of the Children's Health Act of 2000, which authorized programs at the NIH, CDC, and HRSA.
Emken led autism community advocacy for the Combating Autism Act of 2006 on behalf of Cure Autism Now, Autism Speaks, and 17 other leading autism organizations. The Combating Autism Act of 2006 passed in December 2006, and authorizes nearly $1 billion over the next 5 years to "combat" autism through research, screening, early detection and early intervention.
In 2007, she launched a multi-state campaign to secure insurance coverage for autism-related services. Fifteen states approved and enacted these measures; similar legislation is pending in over twenty others. Florida Governor Charlie Crist appointed her to the Governor's Task Force on Autism Spectrum Disorders.
In 2008 she officially registered as a lobbyist for Autism Speaks, and in 2009 she lobbied for numerous bills related to healthcare reform and combatting autism.http://www.wholobbies.us/filing/786E7DC6-9C32-42C7-994A-6EA9F224C3D6http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/firm_reports.php?id=D000047522&year=2009
