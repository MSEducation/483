[[Mathematical manuscripts of Karl Marx]]

CATEGORIES: History of mathematics, Karl Marx, Books by Karl Marx

The Mathematical manuscripts of Karl Marx consist mostly of Karl Marx's attempts to understand the foundations of infinitesimal calculus, from around 1873â€“1883. A Russian edition edited by Sofya Yanovskaya  was eventually published  in 1968, and an English translation was published in [tpl]harv|Marx|1983[/tpl]. Marx appears to have been unaware of the rigorous foundations of the calculus that had been developed by Cauchy and Weierstrass [tpl]harv|Hubert|1978[/tpl]. His views on calculus have had little influence on mathematics, except that his interest may have been used  during the Cultural Revolution to refute charges that mathematics was insufficiently Marxist.  This may have contributed to an interest in nonstandard analysis among Chinese mathematicians [tpl]harv|Dauben|1998[/tpl].
