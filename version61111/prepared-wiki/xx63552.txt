</ref> Together with the rest of Mylodontidae and the engimatic ''[[Pseudoprepotherium]]'', the [[Scelidotheriinae|scelidotheriines]] form the superfamily Mylodontoidea. ''[[Chubutherium]]'' is an ancestral and very plesiomorphic member of this subfamily and does not belong to the main group of closely related genera, which include ''[[Scelidotherium]]'' and ''[[Catonyx]]''.

==Extinction in North America==

Radiocarbon dating traces the disappearance of ground sloths in the United States to around 11,000 years ago, which coincides with the first appearances of humans in the land of what is now the United States and glacial-interglacial climate change.Steadman et al. 2005[tpl]broken citation|date=March 2013[/tpl] These simultaneous events make it challenging to attribute the extinction of the ground sloth to a single, direct cause. Steadman et al. argue that it is no coincidence that studies have shown that the disappearance of ground sloths occur a few years after humans inhabited their living areas.
Those that argue in favor of the claim that humans are the direct cause of the ground sloths’ extinction point out that the few sloths that remain are small sloths that spend most of their time in trees, making it difficult for them to be spotted by humans. Although these sloths were sufficiently hidden, they still would have been affected by the climate changes that supposedly wiped out the ground sloths. Additionally, after the continental ground sloths disappeared, insular sloths of the Caribbean remained for approximately 6,000 years longer (these islands were not colonized by humans until about 5500 yr BP).
It is difficult to find evidence that supports either claim on whether humans hunted the ground sloths to extinction. Taking large amounts of meat off of large mammals like the ground sloth is easy to do without making any contact with the bones of the animal.Borrero and Martin 2012[tpl]broken citation|date=March 2013[/tpl] This is important because these markings are what paleontologists look for when testing if human interaction was a factor.

==Hunting of ground sloths==

===Hunting weapons===

Current theories of how the first people came into the New World state that they arrived via the Bering Bridge that connected Asia and North America. These nomads descended from hunting families and had acquired the skills to track down and kill large mammals.Mosimann and Martin 1975[tpl]broken citation|date=March 2013[/tpl] By this time, humans had developed preliminary weapons used for hunting. These weapons included the Clovis points, which were narrow, carved stone projectiles used specifically for big game. A couple hundred years later, humans had established the atlatl, an invention that allowed them to throw spears at their preyRaymond 1986[tpl]broken citation|name=March 2013|date=March 2013[/tpl] These inventions allowed hunters to put distance between them and their prey, potentially making it less dangerous to approach these ground sloths.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]

===Economic implications===

There were pros and cons to hunting big game as opposed to hunting small game. This choice that hunter-gatherers made provides context to their economic thought process and allows economic historians to gauge their reasoning and witness how human economic decisions have evolved. While hunting small game would provide a steady rate of return, it was relatively low compared to that of big game.Hawkes et al. 1991[tpl]broken citation|date=March 2013[/tpl] Through studies focusing on Hadza hunters and separate situations in which different groups focused on big game and other groups focused on small game, Hawkes et al. demonstrate that groups focused on large prey maintained a higher mean rate of getting meat in the long run but also had a much higher risk of failing to retrieve any meat. Hawkes et al. find that the most efficient economic choice for hunter-gatherers looking to provide for their family would be hunting small game. However, hunter-gatherers chose to target these ground sloths.[tpl]clarify|date=April 2013[/tpl]

===Advantages===

Certain characteristics and behavioral traits of the ground sloths made them easy targets for human hunting and provided hunter-gatherers with strong incentives to hunt these large mammals.
Ground sloths often fed in open fields.Bargo 2001[tpl]broken citation|date=March 2013[/tpl] Recent studies have attempted to discover the diet of ground sloths through fossils of their dung. Analysis of these coproliths have found that ground sloths often ate the foliage of trees, hard grasses, shrubs, and yucca; these plants were located in areas that exposed them.Poinar et al. 1998[tpl]broken citation|date=March 2013[/tpl] Feeding in open areas made them susceptible to human interaction. Ground sloths were not only easy to spot, but also had never interacted with humans before. They did not know how to react to these new beings. Additionally, these large mammals waddled on their hind legs and front knuckles, keeping their claws turned in. Their movement and massive build (some weighed up to 3,000 kilograms) imply it[tpl]clarify|reason=which species of ground sloth?|date=March 2013[/tpl] was a relatively slow mammal. These constitute intuitive reasons why ground sloths would have been easy prey for hunters.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]

===Difficulties===

Although ground sloths were relatively easy to spot, this did not make hunting them easy. Big game hunters’ weapons were useless if ground sloths were further than thirty feet away.Downs and Stea 2005[tpl]broken citation|date=March 2013[/tpl] Additionally, the ground sloths’ already thick hide consisted of osteoderms, which made it exceptionally thick. It was difficult to take down an entire ground sloth with atlatls; killing a ground sloth required extensive knowledge of the species. Ground sloths' size and claws strong enough to tear apart tree branches made it incredibly dangerous for hunters to approach these animals.Lull 1931[tpl]broken citation|date=March 2013[/tpl]
