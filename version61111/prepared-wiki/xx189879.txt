The Chimichurri burger (usually called "Chimi burger", "Dominican burger", or simply "chimi") is a traditional snack dish (sandwich) served in the Dominican Republic. It is made from a ground pork or beef, which is sliced, grilled and served on a pan de agua (literally "water bread") and garnished with chopped cabbage. Salsa rosa is also added. This dish is made throughout the Dominican Republic and is usually sold on street stands. Each vendor has their own recipe; flavors and ingredients can substantially vary the texture and taste of the chimichurris.http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Dominican-Chimichurri-Burgers-240003
