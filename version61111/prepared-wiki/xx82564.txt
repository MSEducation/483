Bobst Boy is the nickname of Steven Stanzak (born  January 25, 1984), a New York University student who spent eight months living in the basement of the school's Bobst Library from September 2003 to April 2004.[tpl]cite web | publisher = BBC News | title =  Broke student 'slept in library' | date = April 28, 2004 | accessdate = 2 April 2008 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/3665885.stm[/tpl]
Before living in the Bobst Library, Stanzak was an ordinary student living on loans and part-time jobs, without financial assistance from his parents. In September 2003, he found that his NYU scholarship, four jobs, and private loans would cover his tuition costs, but he could not get enough loans to cover housing. He refused to drop out or transfer to a cheaper university, choosing instead to live in the library.[tpl]citation | first = Karen | last = Arenson | newspaper = New York Times | title =  Yes, Some Students Live in the Library (But Not Like This) | date = April 27, 2004 | accessdate = 2 April 2008 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/27/nyregion/27NYU.html | publisher = The New York Times[/tpl][tpl]cite web | publisher = East Carolinian | title =  It's your typical 2 a.m., winter 2002 | date = April 12, 2005 | accessdate = 2 April 2008 | url = http://media.www.theeastcarolinian.com/media/storage/paper915/news/2005/04/12/Opinion/Its-Your.Typical.2.A.m.Winter.2002-2210390.shtml[/tpl] Stanzak quickly tired of answering peoples' questions about life in the library, and posted a Q&A online, which eventually grew into the blog and web site, and Stanzak developed an underground fan following on NYU's campus.
The Washington Square News, NYU's student paper, was told of Stanzak's situation and asked to do a profile on him. At first Stanzak refused, fearing how NYU would react to the situation. However, once Stanzak was told that the article would only be printed with his consent, he agreed to an interview. In April 2004, just before the release of the news article, an NYU dean was told of Stanzak's situation, and requested a meeting. At the meeting, the dean told Stanzak that his initiative was remarkable, but that he could no longer live in the library, and Stanzak was provided free NYU housing for the last few weeks of classes.[tpl]citation | last = Palsson | first = Nils | newspaper = Washington Square News | title = Ousted Bobst Boy gets dorm | date = April 26, 2004 | accessdate = 2 April 2008 | url = http://nyunews.com/2004/04/26/19/ | publisher = Washington Square News [/tpl]
The day the profile was published, reporters started calling Stanzak, and he became an overnight celebrity.[tpl]citation | last = Chung | first = Jen | newspaper = Gothamist | title = Living at the Library: The Bobst Library's Tenant | date = April 27, 2004 | accessdate = 2 April 2008 | url = http://gothamist.com/2004/04/27/living_at_the_library_the_bobst_librarys_tenant.php[/tpl][tpl]citation | first = Karen | last = Arenson | newspaper = New York Times | title =   Page Two: April 25-May 1; Reading Oneself to Sleep | date = May 2, 2004 | accessdate = 2 April 2008 | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B07EED8123DF931A35756C0A9629C8B63[/tpl] Stanzak received widespread media attention, appearing on Good Morning America on April 29.[tpl]cite web | title = NYU Student Caught Living in the Library | date = April 30, 2004 | publisher = American Library Association | accessdate = 2 April 2008 | url = http://www.ala.org/ala/alonline/currentnews/newsarchive/alnews2004/april2004ab/bobstboy.cfm[/tpl]
Stanzak continued to receive financial assistance from NYU until graduation, and no longer updates his blog or web site. After his time in the library, he became a Resident Assistant at NYU's Lafayette Street Residence, in Chinatown.
He is currently attending Indiana University, pursuing a graduate degree in folklore which he began in fall 2006.
