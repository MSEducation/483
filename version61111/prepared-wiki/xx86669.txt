Elliott Smith is the second studio album by American singer-songwriter Elliott Smith, recorded from late 1994 to early 1995 and released on July 21, 1995 through Kill Rock Stars; his first album on the label. It was preceded by the single "Needle in the Hay", released in early January.

==Background==

After being impressed by Smith, Mary Lou Lord invited him to tour with her, and helped him to sign to Kill Rock Stars.[tpl]cite book |last=Nugent |first=Benjamin |year=2004 |title=Elliott Smith and the Big Nothing |publisher=Da Capo Press |isbn=978-0-306-81447-1[/tpl]
The album is of a similar musical style to Roman Candle in its minimalist, acoustic sound. Smith mostly appears alone on his acoustic guitar, although he is occasionally backed up by the odd musical instrument, such as a harmonica and drums. Thematically, Smith said that he "personally can't get more dark" than his self-titled album.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.well-rounded.com/music/reviews/elliottsmith_intv.html |title=Elliott Smith Interview: Well Rounded Entertainment |last=Peisner |first=David |website=Well Rounded Entertainment |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20000919124038/http://www.well-rounded.com/music/reviews/elliottsmith_intv.html |archivedate=September 19, 2000 |accessdate=April 13, 2013[/tpl]
The album's lyrics contain many references to drug use, which Smith claims are metaphorical. The album cover features a photograph by J. J. Gonson, who also photographed the cover for Roman Candle, depicting cut-out figures falling from buildings as if they were committing suicide.

==Release==

"Needle in the Hay", the album's only single, was released early January, 1995.[tpl]cite web |url=http://killrockstars.bandcamp.com/album/needle-in-the-hay-7 |title=Needle in the Hay 7"  Kill Rock Stars |work=Bandcamp |accessdate=June 21, 2013[/tpl]
Elliott Smith was released on July 21 through Kill Rock Stars, making it his first full-length album on the label.[tpl]cite web |url=http://killrockstars.bandcamp.com/album/elliott-smith |title=Elliott Smith  Kill Rock Stars |work=Kill Rock Stars |accessdate=June 23, 2013[/tpl] In contrast to Roman Candle, Elliott Smith was "promoted heavily", with posters of Smith appearing in the windows of record stores across the Northwest of Portland, Oregon, where Smith lived at the time.

==Critical reception==

While not believed to have been reviewed by many, if any, critics at the time of its release, Elliott Smith has been critically well-received retrospectively. AllMusic wrote: "Elliott Smith contains the blueprint for his later successes, and more importantly, it's a [tpl]Sic|?|hide=y|fully|-[/tpl]realized work itself."

==Legacy==

Pitchfork Media rated "Needle in the Hay" as the twenty-seventh best song of the 1990s.[tpl]cite web |url=http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/7852-the-top-200-tracks-of-the-1990s-50-21/3/ |title=Staff Lists: The Top 200 Tracks of the 1990s: 50â€“21  Pitchfork |date=September 2, 2010 |work=Pitchfork |accessdate=April 13, 2013[/tpl]
