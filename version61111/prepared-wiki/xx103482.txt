V Deep was The Boomtown Rats' fifth album, and the first to be released after guitarist Gerry Cott left the group. It includes the minor hit single "House on Fire".

==Name==

The name of the album is pronounced "five deep", not "vee deep". It is taken from the Japanese term for a style of love-making, "four shallow, five deep", but also refers to the fact that it's the band's fifth album and also that they are now a five-piece following the departure of Gerry Cott.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.boomtownrats.co.uk/the-boomtown-rats.html |title=History of The Boomtown Rats |publisher=Boomtownrats.co.uk |date=1985-07-13 |accessdate=2014-04-09[/tpl]
