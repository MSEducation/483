==Career==

===Early career===

Barrymore's career began when she was auditioned for a dog food commercial when she was eleven months old. When she was bitten by her canine co-star, the producers were afraid she would cry, but she merely laughed, and was hired for the job. She made her feature film debut in Altered States (1980), in which she had a small part. A year later, she landed the role of Gertie, the younger sister of Elliott, in E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, which made her one of the most famous child stars of the time and earned her the Young Artist Award as Best Young Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture in 1982.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youngartistawards.org/pastnoms4.htm|title=4th Annual Youth in Film Awards|accessdate=March 31, 2011|work=YoungArtistAwards.org[/tpl] She received a Golden Globe nomination as Best Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture in 1984 for her role in Irreconcilable Differences, in which she starred as a young girl divorcing her parents.[tpl]cite web |title=HFPA – Awards Search |url=http://www.goldenglobes.org/browse/member/28761 |accessdate=July 3, 2008 |publisher=Golden Globes[/tpl] In a review in the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert stated: "Barrymore is the right actress for this role precisely because she approaches it with such grave calm."[tpl]cite web |first=Roger |last=Ebert |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19840101/REVIEWS/401010349/1023 |title=Irreconciable Differences film review |accessdate=July 15, 2008 |date=January 1, 1984 |publisher=Roger Ebert.com |work=Chicago Sun-Times[/tpl]

===Rebellious era===

In the wake of this sudden stardom, Barrymore endured a notoriously troubled childhood. She was already a regular at the famed Studio 54 when she was a little girl, smoking cigarettes at the age of nine, drinking alcohol by the time she was eleven, smoking marijuana at the age of twelve, and snorting cocaine at the age of thirteen. Her nightlife and constant partying became a popular subject with the media. She was in rehab at the age of fourteen. A suicide attempt, also at the age of fourteen, put her back in rehab, followed by a three-month stay with singer David Crosby and his wife. The stay was precipitated, Crosby said, because she "needed to be around some people that were committed to sobriety." Barrymore later described this period of her life in her autobiography, Little Girl Lost. The following year, following a successful juvenile court petition for emancipation, she moved into her own apartment.
In her late teens, her rebelliousness played itself out on screen and in print. Barrymore forged an image as a manipulative teenage seductress, beginning with the film Poison Ivy (1992), which was a box office failure, but was popular on video and cable.[tpl]cite web |first=Owen |last=Gleiberman |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,310405,00.html|title=Poison Ivy Review |accessdate=July 25, 2008 |date=May 8, 1992 |work=Entertainment Weekly[/tpl] That same year, at the age of seventeen, she posed nude for the cover of the July issue of Interview magazine with her then-fiancé, actor Jamie Walters, as well as appearing nude in pictures inside the issue.[tpl]cite journal|first=Bronwen|last=Hruska|title=Summer Sneaks Drew, We Hardly Knew Ye The littlest Barrymore finally seems back on track in solid film roles.

[tpl]quote|"I really love my body and the way it is right now. There's something very awkward about women and their breasts because men look at them so much. When they're huge, you become very self-conscious. Your back hurts. You find that whatever you wear, you look heavy in. It's uncomfortable. I've learned something, though, about breasts through my years of pondering and pontificating, and that is: Men love them, and I love that."[tpl]cite web | first = Nancy | last = Mills | title = Now, Drew Love!
