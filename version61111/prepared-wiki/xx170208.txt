In network addressing, the host address, or the host ID portion of an IP address, is the portion of the address used to identify hosts (any device requiring a Network Interface Card, such as a PC or networked printer) on the network.

Your network ID is the first 30 bits, in bold below. The host portion is the last two bits. By changing those two bits, you can create the following IP addresses:
