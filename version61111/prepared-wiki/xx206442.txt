Through his mother and father he was descended from King [tpl]okina[/tpl]Umi and King Liloa, connecting also to the chiefs of Maui, Oahu, Kauai. His name translates as the "Great Heavenly Island Climber". He fathered the House of Keoua through his eldest son.
He was born to Keaweʻīkekahialiʻiokamoku and his half-sister, Princess Kalanikauleleiaiwi, granddaughter of Iwikauikaua (whose symbol was a torch burning at midday) and daughter of chiefess Keakealaniwahine.[tpl]cite web |title= Hale O Keoua Nui: Keoua Kalanikupuapaikalaninui and his descendants |url= http://www.keouanui.org/Keouanui.html |work= Hawaii's royal family web site |publisher= Keali'i publications |accessdate=2009-12-29 [/tpl] His father was the ruler of the entire Big Island of Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i. In addition to Kona, Keawe also gave him dominion over parts of the Kohala District, which was mostly controlled by the powerful and somewhat independent Mahi family.Kekoolani Genealogy of the Descendants of the Ruling Chiefs of Hawaii - pafg27 - Generated by Personal Ancestral File His brother became ruler of the Ka[tpl]okina[/tpl]ū district of the island.
After his father's death in 1754, he and his older brother, Kalaninuiamamao, fought for the throne of the Island of Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i. While the conflict ensued between the two brothers, Alapainui was able to take advantage of the situation and usurped the throne. Alapai was Kee[tpl]okina[/tpl]aumoku's half-brother, sharing his mother. They were also brothers of Ha'ae-a-Mahi, father of the Chiefess Kekuiapoiwa II, the mother of Kamehameha the Great. Because of the conflict between Ke[tpl]okina[/tpl]eaumoku and Kaiimamao, the Big Island remained divided into three to six separate chiefdoms until the unification by Kamehameha.
He married a member of the noble [tpl]okina[/tpl]I family of the Ka[tpl]okina[/tpl]ū district, the High Chiefess Kamakaimoku, former wife of his brother. Keōua, his eldest son, would father the House of Kamehameha and the House of Kalokuokamaile. His second wife was the High Chiefess Kailakanoa. His sons by Kailakanoa were Kanekoa and Kahai. Only his son Kanekoa's descendants survive from his second marriage; most notable of these are the House of Kawānanakoa, through her granddaughter Po[tpl]okina[/tpl]omaikelani, the wife of Elelule La[tpl]okina[/tpl]akeaelelulu of Hilo, and mother of Kūhiō Kalanianaole.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.royalark.net/Hawaii/hawaii3.htm |title=The Kamehameha Dynasty Genealogy (Page 3)|author=Christopher Buyers |accessdate=2009-12-21 |work= Royal Ark web site [/tpl]
