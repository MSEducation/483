Xyzzy is a magic word from the Colossal Cave Adventure computer game.xyzzy in the Jargon File.
In computing, the word is sometimes used as a metasyntactic variable or as a video game cheat code, the canonical  "magic word". In mathematics, the word is used as a mnemonic for the cross product.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.rickadams.org/adventure/c_xyzzy.html | title = Everything you ever wanted to know about…the magic word XYZZY | work = The Colossal Cave Adventure page | author = Rick Adams [/tpl]

==Origin==

Modern usage is primarily from one of the earliest computer games, Colossal Cave Adventure, in which the idea is to explore an underground cave with many rooms, collecting the treasures found there. By typing "xyzzy" at the appropriate time, the player could move instantly between two otherwise distant points. As Colossal Cave Adventure was both the first adventure game and the first interactive fiction, hundreds of later interactive fiction games included responses to the command "xyzzy" in tribute.[tpl]cite web|url=http://webhome.idirect.com/~dswxyz/sol/xyzzy.html|title=xyzzy responses|author=David Welbourn[/tpl] A web page giving responses to "xyzzy" in many games of interactive fiction 
The origin of the word has been the subject of debate.  Rick Adams pointed out that the mnemonic "XYZZY" has long been taught by math teachers to remember the process for performing cross products (as a mnemonic that lists the order of subscripts to be multiplied first).  Crowther, author of Colossal Cave Adventure, states that he was unaware of the mnemonic, and that he "made it up from whole cloth" when writing the game.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/001/2/000009.html | title = Somewhere Nearby is Colossal Cave: Examining Will Crowther's Original "Adventure" in Code and in Kentucky  | author = Dennis G.

==Uses==

Xyzzy has been implemented as an undocumented no-op command on several operating systems; in Data General's AOS, for example, it would typically respond "Nothing happens", just as the game did if the magic was invoked at the wrong spot or before a player had performed the action that enabled the word. The 32-bit version, AOS/VS, would respond "Twice as much happens". On several computer systems from Sun Microsystems, the command "xyzzy" is used to enter the interactive shell of the u-boot bootloader.[tpl]cite web|url=http://dlc.sun.com/pdf/820-4783-10/820-4783-10.pdf |title=Page 17 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2009-08-20[/tpl] Early versions of Zenith Z-DOS (a re-branded variant of MS-DOS 1.25) had the command "xyzzy" which took a parameter of "on" or "off".  Xyzzy by itself would print the status of the last "xyzzy on" or "xyzzy off" command.
The popular Minesweeper game under older versions of Microsoft Windows had a cheat mode triggered by entering the command xyzzy, then pressing the key sequence shift and then enter, which turned a single pixel in the top-left corner of the entire screen into a small black or white dot depending on whether or not the mouse pointer is over a mine.{{cite web|author=eeggs.com |url=http://www.eeggs.com/items/6818.html |title=Windows 2000 Easter Eggs - Eeggs.com |publisher=Eeggs.comThe low-traffic Usenet newsgroup alt.xyzzy is used for test messages, to which other readers (if there are any) customarily respond, "Nothing happens" as a note that the test message was successfully received.
