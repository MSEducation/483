During the latter half of the 20th century, the fields of genetics and molecular biology matured greatly, significantly increasing understanding of biological heredity.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1038/171737a0 |author-separator=, |author1=Watson J.D. |authorlink1=James D.

Common misunderstandings include the following ideas:

==Genetic determinism==

While there are many examples of animals that display certain well-defined behaviour that is genetically programmed,For example, see this discussion of the behaviour of the digger wasp these examples have been extrapolated to a popular misconception that all patterns of behaviour, and more generally the phenotype, are rigidly genetically determined. There is good evidence that some basic aspects of human behaviour, such as circadian rhythms[tpl]cite journal |author=Florez JC, Takahashi JS |title=The circadian clock: from molecules to behaviour |journal=Ann. Med. |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=481–90 |date=August 1995 |pmid=8519510 |doi=10.3109/07853899509002457 [/tpl] are genetically-based, but it is clear that many other aspects are not.
In the first place, much phenotypic variability does not stem from genetics. For example:

==A gene for X==

In the early years of genetics it was suggested that there might be "a gene for" a wide range of particular characteristics. This was partly because the examples studied from Mendel onwards inevitably focused on genes whose effects could be readily identified; partly that it was easier to teach science that way; and partly because the mathematics of evolutionary dynamics is simpler if there is a simple mapping between genes and phenotypic characteristics.[ref]

These have led to the general perception that there is "a gene for" arbitrary traits,
leading to controversy in particular cases such as the purported "gay gene".[ref]
