He was reserve team coach when Cyril Lea resigned in New Year 1980. Wally then stepped up to be number two to Alan Durban. He subsequently served Richie Barker when he became manager, but left in March 1982. There were rumoured to be differences between Gould and some of the senior players at this time, with one `training ground incident` resulting in Ray Evans, the captain, being suspended for two weeks. Days later Gould was replaced by Bill Asprey.Master Potters of Stoke City F.C. `The Managers, Coaches, Trainers...` by Wade Martin Sisyphus Books 1993.
