The LSU Gym Armory building on the campus of Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana was completed in 1930.

==Early history==

After Huey P. Long became Governor of Louisiana in 1928, he worked with LSU President Thomas Wilson Atkinson to find ways to obtain funding to build new facilities on LSU's campus. A priority was placed on a facility for large student gatherings. Due to budget constraints, President Atkinson proposed a combination Gym/Armory and secured $250,000 from the Louisiana legislature for its construction.[tpl]cite web|title=History|publisher=acsa.lsu.edu|url=http://www.acsa.lsu.edu/about/history.aspx|accessdate=2013-08-10[/tpl] It was built on the edge of the bluff, the main floor was the gymnasium and the lower floor was the armory. Both floors were located on ground level. The gymnasium had a stage at one end and could be converted into an auditorium by placing four thousand folding chairs on the gymnasium floor and another fifteen hundred in the balcony. When not set up as an auditorium, it provided an open space for basketball games, dances and other events. The second floor provided space for locker rooms, a trophy room and a dance studio.
The Gym/Armory was the original home of the LSU Tigers basketball team after it moved from the old downtown campus. The team moved to the Huey P. Long Field House after it was completed in 1932.
Over the years, the original building was renovated many times. The 20 foot ceilings were dropped to 8 and 9 foot ceilings to accommodate air conditioning and had multiple uses throughout its history.[tpl]cite web|title=History|publisher=acsa.lsu.edu|url=http://www.acsa.lsu.edu/about/history.aspx|accessdate=2013-08-10[/tpl]

==Cox Communications Academic Center for Student-Athletes==

In 2000, an idea was floated to create an academic center that would house an academic support program that would blend state-of-the-art technology with an appropriate study environment. LSU looked to Richard Manship, longtime Tiger football booster and CEO of Capital City Press and WBRZ-TV, to head the fundraising for the massive project. Manship, along with the Tiger Athletic Foundation, put together the Academic Center Development Council who was in charge of locating donors. Together with a $5.5 million donation by Cox Communications, more than $14 million was donated by private contributors and supporters of LSU Athletics.[tpl]cite web|title=Cox - 10-year naming deal at LSU academic center|publisher=Street and Smith's Sports Business Journal|url=http://m.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2001/11/20011126/This-Weeks-Issue/Cox-Pays-$55M-For-10-Year-Naming-Deal-At-LSU-Academic-Center.aspx|accessdate=2014-03-06[/tpl] In November 2002, the LSU Cox Communications Academic Center for Student-Athletes idea came to fruition.[tpl]cite web|date= June 14, 2012|title=Ranking the SEC's facilities|publisher=espn.com|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/ncfnation/tag/_/name/2012-facilities-rank|accessdate=2014-02-11[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=History|publisher=acsa.lsu.edu|url=http://www.acsa.lsu.edu/about/history.aspx|accessdate=2013-08-10[/tpl]
