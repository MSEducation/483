==Fust’s Successor’s and Influence==

After Peter Schoeffer married Fust’s daughter, Christina, it was only right that the printing business of Fust and Schoeffer be carried on through offspring. Fust and Schoeffer had done much to keep their ways of printing secret even going as far as to make their employees swear by oath that they would not reveal anything.[tpl]cite web|last=Uhlendorf|first=B.A.|title=The Invention of Printing and Its Spread till 1470: With Special Reference to Social and Economic Factors|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/4301902?seq=34&Search=yes&searchText=%22invention+AND+spread+of+printing%22&searchText=%22fust%22&searchText=%28&searchText=%29&list=show&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3D%2528%2522invention%2BAND%2Bspread%2Bof%2Bprinting%2522%2B%2522fust%2522%2529%26amp%3BSearch%3DSearch%26amp%3Bgw%3Djtx%26amp%3Bprq%3D%2528invention%2BAND%2Bspread%2Bof%2Bprinting%2B%2522fust%2522%2529%26amp%3Bhp%3D25%26amp%3Bacc%3Don%26amp%3Baori%3Da%26amp%3Bwc%3Don%26amp%3Bfc%3Doff&prevSearch=&resultsServiceName=null|publisher=The University of Chicago Press[/tpl]  Unfortunately for them the secrets were revealed and heard about in all different kinds of places. Schoeffer’s sons (Fust’s grandsons) Johann and Peter continued on in their father and grandfather’s footsteps by also becoming part of the printing occupation. Johann Schoeffer was the first inventor and author of the art of printing. The younger Peter’s son Ivo also carried on into the printing business as his career. Johann Fust may not have started out as much of a printing man but he certainly ended up influencing a whole new generation of printing. What started out in Germany definitely spread to other parts of the world. It seemed unlikely that the original partnership between Fust and Gutenberg would end up having the effect that it ultimately did on the printing press. Many people will credit and continue to credit Gutenberg for a lot of the success of the 42 line Bible and for printing in general. The facts do state, however, that if it was not for Johann Fust that this bible would have never been created in the first place. Fust controlled the sales aspect as well and branched out this creation to people in other countries. Thanks to Fust’s partnership with Schoeffer a whole new generation of printers were brought into the world. The argument remains who is the true father of the printing press. Johann Fust is the name that most people still do not know today. Johann Gutenberg may have not gotten the respect that he deserved while he was still living but he has that respect now. Johann Fust will always be the man who turned his back on Gutenberg, however he will also always be the man that truly began the printing press.
