[[Kinoform]]

CATEGORIES: X-rays

A kinoform is a type of converging lens that is able to efficiently focuse x-ray radiation. They can be used to study nanomaterials. Diamond is often used in kinoform lenses as it has a high thermal conductivity.[tpl]cite web |url= http://phys.org/news168536133.html |title=A Kinoform's Best Friend: Diamond Refractive Lenses for Nanofocusing |accessdate=12 August 2013[/tpl] They are also used in holography[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.opticsinfobase.org/ao/abstract.cfm?uri=ao-28-5-976 |title= Optical performance of holographic kinoforms |accessdate=12 August 2013[/tpl]
