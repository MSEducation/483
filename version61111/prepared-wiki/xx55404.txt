DNA computing is a form of computing which uses DNA, biochemistry and molecular biology, instead of the traditional silicon-based computer technologies. DNA computing, or, more generally, biomolecular computing, is a fast developing interdisciplinary area. Research and development in this area concerns theory, experiments, and applications of DNA computing.  The term "molectronics" has sometimes been used, but this term had already been used for an earlier technology, a then-unsuccessful rival of the first integrated circuits;"Molectronic Computer Shown by Texas Instr.", unknown publication, circa 1963, in Box 2, Folder 3, listed in Jack Kilby Papers: A Guide to the Collection, Southern Methodist University.  http://lib.texas.edu/taro/smu/00116/smu-00116.html .  this term has also been used more generally, for molecular-scale technology."Application-specific methods for testing molectronic or nanoscale devices" (filed April 1,2004), Patent US 7219314 B1.  http://google.com/patents/US7219314 .        

==History==

This field was initially developed by Leonard Adleman of the University of Southern California, in 1994.[tpl]cite doi|10.1126/science.7973651[/tpl] — The first DNA computing paper. Describes a solution for the directed Hamiltonian path problem. Also available here: http://www.usc.edu/dept/molecular-science/papers/fp-sci94.pdf  Adleman demonstrated a proof-of-concept use of DNA as a form of computation which solved the seven-point Hamiltonian path problem. Since the initial Adleman experiments, advances have been made and various Turing machines have been proven to be constructible.[ref][tpl]cite doi|10.1016/S0166-218X(96)00058-3[/tpl] — Describes a solution for the boolean satisfiability problem.
