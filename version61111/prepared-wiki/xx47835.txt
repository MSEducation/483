==History==

Prior to the Meiji Restoration of 1868, the area of present-day Okayama Prefecture was divided between Bitchū, Bizen and Mimasaka provinces. Okayama Prefecture was formed and named in 1871 as part of the large-scale administrative reforms of the early Meiji period (1868 – 1912), and the borders of the prefecture were set in 1876.Nussbaum, "Provinces and prefectures" at [tpl]Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|p. 780|page=780[/tpl].

===Association with Momotarō legend===

Okayama Prefecture is closely associated with the folklore hero, Momotarō. This tale is said to have roots in the legendary story of Kibitsuhiko-no-mikoto and Ura which explains that the Prince Ura of Kudara used to live in Kinojo (castle of the devil) and was a cause of trouble for the people living in the village. The emperor's government sent Kibitsuhiko-no-mikoto(Momotarō) to defeat Ura. The city of Okayama holds an annual Momotarō-matsuri, or Momotarō Festival.[tpl]cite web|title=Okayama History|url=http://www.okayama-japan.jp/en/history.html|accessdate=24 June 2012[/tpl]
