==Critical reception==

Aaron Lariviere of Stereogum stated: "Celebrity Lifestyle" is the closest they'd get to mainstream alternative rock, but leave it to Gira to tart things up with a line like "She's just a drug addiction, and a self-reflecting image of a narcotized mind."[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.stereogum.com/1197001/swans-albums-from-worst-to-best/top-stories/lead-story/attachment/thegreatannihilator/ | title=Swans Albums From Worst To Best | publisher=Stereogum | date=Nov 9, 2012 | accessdate=October 24, 2013 | author=Lariviere, Aaron[/tpl] Coreen Wolanski of Exclaim! compared the song to the works of Sonic Youth, another no wave contemporary from the New York scene. She also noted " the layers of heavy, driving guitars."[tpl]cite web | url=http://exclaim.ca/Reviews/PopAndRock/swans-great_annihilator | title=Swans - The Great Annihilator | publisher=Exclaim! | date=July 2002 | accessdate=October 24, 2013 | author=Wolanski, Coreen[/tpl] NME also commented that "Celebrity Lifestyle" reveals Mad Mike G maintaining his top form of recent years," while humorously criticizing and mocking the song's lyrics.[tpl]cite web | title=Swans: Celebrity Lifestyle (Invisible) - NME review | publisher=NME | accessdate=October 24, 2013[/tpl] Ben Donelly of Dusted Magazine stated that "the single seemed an awful lot like a Kim Gordon outtake, playing catchup with peers who’d scratched the mainstream."[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.dustedmagazine.com/reviews/7319 | title=Swans - The Seer | publisher=Dusted | date=August 27, 2012 | accessdate=October 24, 2013 | author = Donelly, Ben [/tpl]
In his review for the band's 2012 live album, We Rose from Your Bed with the Sun in Our Head, Tiny Mix Tapes reviewer Paul Haney compared the song to a live track, "The Apostle," writing: "Obvious parallels to The Great Annihilator’s “Celebrity Lifestyle” may spring to mind, and indeed, there is a certain gothic resonance to the affair."[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.tinymixtapes.com/music-review/swans-we-rose-your-bed-sun-our-head | title=Swans - We Rose From Your Bed With The Sun In Our Head | publisher=Tiny Mix Tapes | accessdate=October 24, 2013 | author=Haney, Paul[/tpl]
