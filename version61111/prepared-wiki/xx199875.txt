Bayan (or Buyan; Naiyan Баян) (r.1302-1309) was one of most famous khans of White Horde. "Bayan" means "rich" and "buyan" means "good deed/act" (as in religion or belief) in the Mongolian language.
When Bayan became the khan, his cousin and relatives revolted against him. The latter, under his cousin Kobluk, were supported by Khaidu and Duwa. Bayan fought his rebel cousin, Koblek, and Kaidu's forces several times. He asked help from  Tokhta, ruler of the Golden Horde and the Blue Horde. Tokhta was angry with the situation, and warned Khaidu not to help the rebels. 
Buyan also tried to ally with Temur Oljeitu of the Yuan Dynasty, the suzerain of Mongol Empire, against the Chagatai Khanate and Khaidu. But the distance between them made it ineffective.René Grousset-The Empire of the Steppes: A History of Central Asia, p.211 Finally, Bayan defeated his enemies and ruled his Horde till 1309. It is claimed that Circassians, Russians and Hungarians (probably Bashkirs) served in his army.Encyclopedia of Mongol Empire, see White Horde
