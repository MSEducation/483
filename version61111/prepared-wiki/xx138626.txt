Felix Greene (21 May 1909â€”June 15, 1985) was a British-American journalist who chronicled several Communist countries in the 1960s and 1970s.
He was one of the first Western reporters to visit North Vietnam when he traveled there for the San Francisco Chronicle in the 1960s. Some of his material has been reproduced for A-Level history, within the Vietnam War topic.
Born in England, Greene first visited China for the BBC in 1957. He later produced documentary films, including One Man's China, Tibet, Cuba va!,, Vietnam! Vietnam! and Inside North Viet Nam. These films has been accused of giving a very rosy and one-sided view of the communist society.HYPOCRISY IN THE "PEACE" MOVEMENT: A CASE STUDY by Chris R.

In the 1970s, Felix Greene came to in Dharamsala to visit the 14th Dalai Lama who recalled that after 3 days of discussion, Greenes attitude had changed.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dd5bk_iUItcC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_v2_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Imagine All the People: A Conversation with the Dalai Lama on Money, Politics, and Life as it Could Be|chapter=Power and Values|authors=Tenzin Gyatso, Fabien Quaki, Anne Benson|page=17|quote=Felix Green who was quite a close friend to the late Zhou Enlai of China. Mr. Green had visited China regularly for many years and had great faith in both the country and in communism. He came to Dharamsala with several films, hoping to show me how happy people were in Tibet, and to explain that things were not as bad as we, the Tibetans in exile, believed. He tried to convince me that everything was okay in my country. We talked and argued for three or four days. After many hours of discussion, he finally changed his attitude on most points. In such cases, a good argument based on sincere motivation can produce a positive result, provided both parties strive to be objective. It is very helpful to talk, talk, talk, until a solution is found.[/tpl]His Holiness the Dalai Lama in New York, NY - May 22, 2010
