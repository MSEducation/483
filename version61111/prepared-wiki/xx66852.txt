[[Number line]]

CATEGORIES: Elementary mathematics, Mathematical manipulatives

In basic mathematics, a number line is a picture of a straight line on which every point is assumed to correspond to a real number and every real number to a point.[tpl]cite book | last1=Stewart | first1=James B. | last2 = Redlin | first2 = Lothar | last3=Watson | first3=Saleem | authorlink=James Stewart (mathematician) | title=College Algebra | publisher=Brooks Cole  | year=2008 | edition = 5th | pages=13–19 | isbn=0-495-56521-0[/tpl]  Often the integers are shown as specially-marked points evenly spaced on the line.  Although this image only shows the integers from −9 to 9, the line includes all real numbers, continuing forever in each direction, and also numbers not marked that are between the integers. It is often used as an aid in teaching simple addition and subtraction, especially involving negative numbers.
It is divided into two symmetric halves by the origin, that is the number zero.
In advanced mathematics, the expressions real number line, or real line are typically used to indicate the above-mentioned concept that every point on a straight line corresponds to a single real number, and vice versa.

==Drawing the number line==

A line drawn through the origin at right angles to the real number line can be used to represent the imaginary numbers. This line, called imaginary line, extends the number line to a complex number plane, with points representing complex numbers.
