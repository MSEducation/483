[[Anti-Arabism]]

CATEGORIES: Anti-Arabism, Discrimination, Politics and race, Orientalism

Anti-Arabism or Arabophobia is consistent advocacy of discrimination, extermination, prejudice, hostility, hatred, or genocide toward Arabs.

==Arab definition==

Arabs are people whose native language is Arabic. People of Arabic origin, in particular native English and French speakers of Arab ancestry in Europe and the Americas, often identify themselves as Arabs. Due to widespread practice of Islam among Arab populations, Anti-Arabism is commonly confused with Islamophobia.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/race/story/0,11374,1120849,00.html |title=Islamophobia should be as unacceptable as racism |first=Faisal |last=Bodi |date=12 January 2004 |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=2009-06-22 | location=London| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090521223141/http://www.guardian.co.uk/race/story/0,11374,1120849,00.html| archivedate= 21 May 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
There are prominent Arab non-Muslim minorities in the Arab world. These minorities include Christians in Egypt, Lebanon, Palestine, Syria, Jordan, Iraq and Kuwait, among other Arab countries. There are also sizable minorities of Arab Jews, Druze, and nonreligious.

==Historical anti-Arabism==

Anti-Arab prejudice is suggested by many events in history. In the Iberian Peninsula, all non-Catholics, including Muslim Arabs, were targeted following the 15th century fall of Granada. In 1492, Arab converts to Christianity, called Moriscos, were expelled from Spain to North Africa after being condemned by the Spanish Inquisition. The Spanish word "moro", meaning moor, today carries a negative meaning.[tpl]cite journal |last=Echebarria-Echabe |first=Agustín |author2=Emilia Fernández Guede |date=May 2007 |title=A New Measure of Anti-Arab Prejudice: Reliability and Validity Evidence |journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology |volume=37 |issue=5 |pages=1077–1091 |doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.2007.00200.x[/tpl] Although ethnically different from the Arabs in Spain at the time, the term Moro was also used pejoratively[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2009[/tpl] by the Spanish since the 16th century to refer to Muslim tribal groups in the Philippines; the term indios was used to refer to Christianized tribal groups.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2009[/tpl]

In The Arabic Language and National Identity: a Study in Ideology, Yasir Suleiman notes of the writing of Tawfiq al-Fikayki that he uses the term shu'ubiyya to refer to movements he perceives to be anti-Arab, such as the Turkification movement in the Ottoman Empire, extreme-nationalist and Pan-Iranist movements in Iran and communism. In al-Fikayki's view, the objectives of anti-Arabism are to attack Arab nationalism, pervert history, emphasize Arab regression, deny Arab culture, and generally be hostile to all things Arab. He concludes that, "In all its various roles, anti-Arabism has adopted a policy of intellectual conquest as a means of penetrating Arab society and combatting Arab nationalism."[tpl]cite book|title=The Arabic Language and National Identity: A Study in Ideology|first=Yasir|last=Suleiman|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2003|page=238|isbn=0-7486-1707-8[/tpl]

==Modern anti-Arabism==

===Algeria===

Anti-Arabism is a major element of movements known as Berberism that are widespread mainly amongst Algerians of Kabyle and other Berber origin."Le monde arabe existe-il ?", Lucien Oulahbib. It has historic roots as Arabs are seen as invaders that occupied Algeria and destroyed its late Roman and early medieval civilization that was considered an integral part of the West; this invasion is considered to have been the source of the resettlement of Algeria's Berber population in Kabylie and other mountainuous areas. Regardless, the Kabyles and other Berbers have managed to preserve their culture and achieve higher standards of living and education when compared to Algerian Arabs. Furthermore, many Berbers speak their language and French; are non religious, secular, or Evangelical Christian; and openly identify with the Western World. Many Berber Nationalists view Arabs as a hostile people intent on eradicating their own culture and nation. Berber social norms restrict marriage to someone of Arab ethnicity, although it is permitted to marry someone from other ethnic groups."Du problème berbère au dilemme kabyle a l'aube du 21e siècle", Maxime Ait Kaki

The Anti-Arab sentiments among Algerian Berbers (mainly from Kabylie) were always related to the reassertion of Kabyle identity. It began as an intellectual militant movement in schools, universities, and popular culture (mainly nationalistic songs).[tpl]cite journal |last=Roberts |first=Hugh |title=The Economics of Berberism: The Material Basis of the Kabyle Question in Contemporary Algeria |journal=Government and Opposition |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=223–227 |doi=10.1111/j.1477-7053.1983.tb00024.x |year=1983[/tpl] In addition to that, the authorities’ efforts to promote development in Kabylie contributed to a boom of sorts in Tizi Ouzou, whose population almost doubled between 1966 and 1977, and to a greater degree of economic and social integration within the region had the contrary effect of strengthening a collective Amazigh consciousness and Anti-Arab sentiments.[tpl]cite book |first1=Ofra |last1=Bengio |first2=Gabriel |last2=Ben-Dor |title=Minorities and the State in the Arab World |publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers |year=1999 |page=35 |isbn=1-55587-647-1 |lastauthoramp=y[/tpl]
Arabophobia can be seen at different levels of intellectual, social, and cultural life of some Berbers. After the Berberist crisis in 1949, a new radical intellectual movement emerged under the name L'Académie Berbère. This movement was known by its adoption and promotion of Anti-Arab and Anti-Islam ideologies especially amongst immigrant Kabyles in France and achieved a relative success at the time.[tpl]cite book |last=Slimani-Direche |first=Karina |title= Histoire de l'émigration kabyle en France au XXe siècle: Réalités culturelles et politiques et réappropriations identitaires |publisher=L'Harmattan |year=2002 |page=140 |isbn=2-7384-5789-4 |language=French[/tpl] Translation from French:  These reactions are also residues of a violent and Manichean political discourse which was particularly developed after the Berberist crisis in 1949 (see the second part) and expressed by members or sympathizers of the L'Académie Berbère (Berber Academy). This political berberist and radical trend which was especially developed with immigration, wanted to be anti-Arab, anti-Islam, and willingly sank in a narrow Manichaeism. This trend has seen relative success among some Kabyle immigrants especially from Paris Region (Région parisienne). 
In 1977, the final game of the national soccer championship pitting a team from Kabylie against one from Algiers turned into an Arab-Berber conflict. The Arab national anthem of Algeria was overwhelmed by the shouting of Anti-Arab slogans such as "A bas les arabes" (down with the Arabs).[tpl]cite book |chapter=Ethnicity and Power in North Africa: Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco |editor-last=Spickard |editor-first=Paul R.

The roots of modern day Arabophobia in Algeria can be traced back to multiple factors. For some, Anti-Arabism movement among Berbers is part of the legacy of French Colonization or manipulation of North Africa. As from the beginning, the French understood that to attenuate Muslim resistance to their presence, mainly in Algeria, they had to resort to the divide and rule doctrine. The most obvious divide that could be instrumentalized in this perspective was the ethnic one. Therefore, France employed some official colonial practices to tighten its control over Algeria by creating racial tensions between Arabs and Berbers and between Jews and Muslims.[tpl]cite journal |first1=Joan E. |last1=Gross |first2=David A. |last2=McMurray |title=Berber Origins and the Politics of Ethnicity in Colonial North African Discourse |journal = PoLAR: Political and Legal Anthropology Review |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=39–58 |date=June 1993 |doi=10.1525/pol.1993.16.2.39[/tpl]
Others argue that the Berber language and traditions are deeply rooted in the North African cultural mosaic; for centuries, Berber culture has survived conquests, repression, and exclusion from different invaders: Romans, Arabs, and French. Hence, believing that its identity and specificity were threatened, the Berbers took note of the political and ideological implications of Arabism as defended by successive governments.[tpl]cite book |chapter=Ethnicity and Power in North Africa: Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco |editor-last=Spickard |editor-first=Paul R.

He has been stopped going to prayers, with relatives and friends and has been subjected to a humiliating body search. He has been the object of several groundless accusations of robbery or holding a knife. A senior lawyer told the Sydney Morning Herald that the police harassment was due to the police enmity against Houda's clients and the Australian Arab community.[tpl]cite news|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald |title=Suing police again, the lawyer of Middle Eastern appearance |url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/suing-police-again-the-lawyer-of-middle-eastern-appearance-20111112-1ncvd.html |date=2011-11-13 |accessdate=2012-07-19 |author=Mercer, Neil[/tpl] He was first falsely arrested in 2000 for which he was awarded $145,000 damages by a judge who described his persecution as "shocking".

In 2010, Houda, his lawyer Chris Murphy, and Channel Seven journalist Adam Walters claimed that Frank Menilli, a senior New South Wales police officer, behaved in a corrupt fashion by trying to alter Channel Seven's coverage of the Houda Case by promising the Walter's inside information in exchange for presenting the case in the police's favour.

These charges were thrown out of court by Judge John Connell who stated "At the end of the day, here were three men of Middle Eastern appearance walking along a suburban street, for all the police knew, minding their own business at an unexceptional time of day, in unexceptional clothing, except two of the men had hooded jumpers. The place they were in could not have raised a reasonable suspicion they were involved in the robberies" Houda is currently suing the six police officers involved for false imprisonment, unlawful arrest, assault and battery and defamation.

===France===

France used to be a colonial empire, with still great post-colonial power over its former colonies, using Africa as a reservoir for labor, especially in moments of dire need. During World War I, reconstruction and shortages made France bring thousands of North African workers. Out of a total of 116,000 workers from 1914–1918, 78,000 Algerians, 54,000 Moroccans, and Tunisians were requistioned.[tpl]dubious|mathematically impossible|date=February 2011[/tpl] Two hundred and forty thousand Algerians were mobilized or drafted, and two thirds of these were soldiers who served mostly in France. This constituted more than one-third of the men of those nations from ages 20–40.[tpl]cite book |first1=Alain |last1=Gillette |first2=Abdelmalek |last2=Sayadm |title=L’immigration algérienne en France |location=Paris |publisher=Editions Entente |year=1984 |page=50 |lastauthoramp=y |isbn=2-7266-0018-2 |edition=2nd |language=French[/tpl] According to historian Abdallah Laroui, Algeria sent 173,000 soldiers, 25,000 of whom were killed. Tunisia sent 56,000, of whom 12,000 were killed. Moroccan soldiers helped defend Paris and landed at Bordeaux in 1916.[tpl]cite book |first=Abdallah |last=Laroui |title=History of the Maghreb |others=Translated by Ralph Manheim |location=Princeton |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1977 |pages=351–12 |isbn=0-691-03109-6[/tpl]
After the war, reconstruction and labor shortages necessitated even larger number of Algerian laborers. Migration (or the need for labor) was reestablished at a high level by 1936. This was partly the result of collective recruitments in the villages conducted by French officers and representatives of companies. Labor recruitment continued throughout the 1940s. North Africans were mostly recruited for dangerous and low-wage jobs, unwanted by ordinary French workers.[tpl]cite book |first=Georges |last=Mauco |title=Les étrangers en France: leur role dans l'activite economique |location=Paris |publisher=Armand Colin |year=1932 |page=170 |language=French[/tpl]; and [tpl]cite book |first=Neil |last=McMaster |title=Colonial Migrants and Racism: Algerians in France, 1900-62 |location=New York |publisher=St Martin's Press |year=1997 |page=67[/tpl]
This large number of immigrants was of great help for France's rapid post–World War II economic growth. The 1970s were marked by recession followed by the cessation of labor migration programs and crackdowns on illegal immigration. During the 1980s, political disfavor with President Mitterrand's social programs led to the rise of Jean-Marie Le Pen and other far right French nationalists. The public increasingly blamed immigrants for French economic problems. In March 1990, according to a poll reported in Le Monde, 76% of those polled said that there were too many Arabs in France while 39% said they had an "aversion" to Arabs.[tpl]cite journal |last=Dwyer |first=Katherine |year=1997 |title=France's New Nazis: The Resistible Rise of Jean-Marie LePen |journal=International Socialist Review |issue=2 |issn=0020-8744 |url=http://www.isreview.org/issues/02/LePen.shtml[/tpl] In the following years, Interior Minister Charles Pasqua was noted for dramatically toughening immigration laws.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.migrationinformation.org/Profiles/display.cfm?id=266 |title=The Challenge of French Diversity |first1=Kimberly |last1=Hamilton |publisher=Migration Policy Institute |first2=Patrick |last2=Simon |first3=Clara |last3=Veniard |date=November 2004 |accessdate=2009-06-26[/tpl]

===Iran===

Human rights group Amnesty International claims that in practice, Arabs are among a number of ethnic minorities that are disadvantaged and suffer discrimination by the authorities.[tpl]cite web |url=http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGMDE130102006 |title=Iran: New government fails to address dire human rights situation |date=2006-02-16 |publisher=Amnesty International[/tpl] Separatist tendencies in Khuzestan exacerbate this. How far the situation facing Arabs in Iran is related to racism or simply a result of policies suffered by all Iranians is a matter of debate (see: Politics of Khuzestan). Iran is a multi-ethnic society with its Arab minority mainly located in the south.Perry-Castañeda Library Map Collection, Iran ethnoreligious distribution 2004, The University of Texas at Austin, 2004
It is claimed by some, that anti-Arabism in Iran may be related to the notion that Arabs forced some Persians to convert to Islam in 7th century AD (See: Muslim conquest of Persia). Author Richard Foltz in his article "Internationalization of Islam" states "Even today, many Iranians perceive the Arab destruction of the Sassanid Empire as the single greatest tragedy in Iran's long history.[tpl]cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Encarta |title=Internationalization of Islam |url=http://encarta.msn.com/sidebar_1741575641/Internationalization_of_Islam.html|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwKSDkOP|archivedate=2009-10-31|deadurl=yes[/tpl] (See also: Anti-Persian sentiments) Following the Muslim conquest of Persia, many Iranians (also known as "mawali") came to despise the Umayyads due to discrimination against them by their Arab rulers. The Shu'ubiyah movement was intended to reassert Iranian identity and resist attempts to impose Arab culture while reaffirming their commitment to Islam.
More recently, anti-Arabism has arisen as a consequence of aggression against Iran by the regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq. During a visit to Khuzestan, which has most of Iran's Arab population, a British journalist, John R.

She says that the "hype artists" and "book-cookers" of ADC reported that "a Muslim student was pelted with eggs at Arizona State University", but that of two such incidents logged at the university, one was a "complete hoax", and the other was not considered a hate crime by police.Malkin, Michelle (May 28, 2003) "Myth of the Muslim hate-crime epidemic".

In 2004, American radio host Michael Savage described Arabs as "non-humans", said that Americans want the U.S. to "drop a nuclear weapon" on an Arab country, and advocated that people in the Middle East be "forcibly converted to Christianity" to "turn them into human beings". Savage characterized Israel as "a little country surrounded by racist, fascist bigots who don't want anyone but themselves living in that hell hole called the Middle East".Savage Nation, May 11, 2004. Expressions of anti-Arabism in the United States intensified following the 2009 Fort Hood shooting, which was perpetrated by Nidal Malik Hasan, a Palestinian Arab American. In 2010, the proposed development of an Islamic community center containing a mosque near the World Trade Center site provoked further widespread expressions of virulent anti-Arabism in the United States[tpl]cite web|last=Ferguson |first=Barbara |url=http://arabnews.com/world/article104056.ece |title=Ground Zero mosque polarizes US |work=Arab News|date=August 16, 2010|accessdate=June 13, 2011[/tpl]

Parts of Hollywood are regarded as using a disproportionate number of Arabs as villains and of depicting Arabs negatively and stereotypically. According to Godfrey Cheshire, a critic on the New York Press, "the only vicious racial stereotype that's not only still permitted but actively endorsed by Hollywood" is that of Arabs as crazed terrorists.[tpl]cite news |first=Brian |last=Whitaker |authorlink=Brian Whitaker |title=The 'towel-heads' take on Hollywood |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,355880,00.html |work=The Guardian|date=2000-08-11 | location=London[/tpl]
Like the image projected of Jews in Nazi Germany, the image of Arabs projected by western movies is often that of "money-grubbing caricatures that sought world domination, worshipped a different God, killed innocents, and lusted after blond virgins".[tpl]cite journal |last=Shaheen |first=Jack G. |authorlink=Jack Shaheen |year=2000 |title=Hollywood's Muslim Arabs |journal=The Muslim World |volume=90 |issue=1–2 |pages=22–42 |issn=0027-4909 |doi=10.1111/j.1478-1913.2000.tb03680.x[/tpl]
The 2000 film Rules of Engagement drew criticism from Arab groups and was described as "probably the most racist film ever made against Arabs by Hollywood" by the ADC. Paul Clinton of The Boston Globe wrote "at its worst, it's blatantly racist, using Arabs as cartoon-cutout bad guys".
Jack Shaheen, in his book Reel Bad Arabs,[tpl]cite book |last=Shaheen |first=Jack G. |authorlink=Jack Shaheen |title=Reel Bad Arabs |year=2001 |publisher=Interlink Publishing Group |isbn=1-56656-388-7[/tpl] surveyed more than 900 film appearances of Arab characters. Of those, only a dozen were positive and 50 were balanced. Shaheen writes that "Arab stereotypes are deeply ingrained in American cinema. From 1896 until today, filmmakers have collectively indicted all Arabs as Public Enemy #1 – brutal, heartless, uncivilized religious fanatics and money-mad cultural "others" bent on terrorizing civilized Westerners, especially Christians and Jews. Much has happened since 1896 ... Throughout it all, Hollywood's caricature of the Arab has prowled the silver screen. He is there to this day – repulsive and unrepresentative as ever."[tpl]cite news |first=John |last=Levesque |title=Arabs suffer in the hands of Hollywood |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/tv/63118_tv21.shtml |work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |date=2002-03-21[/tpl]
According to Newsweek columnist Meg Greenfield, anti-Arab sentiment presently promotes misconceptions about Arabs and hinders genuine peace in the Middle East.
In 1993, the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee confronted Disney about anti-Arab racist content in its animated film Aladdin. At first Disney denied any problems but eventually relented and changed two lines in the opening song. Members of the ADC were still unhappy with the portrayal of Arabic characters and the referral to the Middle East as "barbaric".[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=gIyH_DLYhoIC&lpg=PA74&pg=PA74#v=onepage&q |first=Karl F. |last=Cohen |title=Forbidden Animation: Censored Cartoons and Blacklisted Animators in America |page=74 |publisher=McFarland & Company |date=March 1998 |isbn=978-0-7864-0395-0[/tpl]
In 1980, The Link, a magazine published by Americans for Middle East Understanding, contained an article "The Arab Stereotype on Television" which detailed negative Arab stereotypes that appeared in TV shows including Woody Woodpecker, Rocky and Bullwinkle, Jonny Quest and an educational children's show on PBS.

In the 1990s, the Anti-Defamation League clashed with the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee in a legal dispute regarding sensitive information the ADL had collected about ADC members' positions on the Arab-Israeli conflict. In 1999, the dispute was finally settled out of court without any finding of wrongdoing.[tpl]cite news |first=Julie |last=Wiener |title=ADL settles with Arabs, others to wrap up 6-year lawsuit |url=http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/12169/ |publisher=j. |date=1999-10-01[/tpl] In 2001 the ADL attempted to bar Arab members of CAIR from attending a conference on multicultural inclusion.
