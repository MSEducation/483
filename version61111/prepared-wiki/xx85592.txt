 [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]</ref> Most Herdwicks spend winter on the [[fells]], from approximately December to April. They are normally left to graze freely on the hillsides (without any additional feed), but each ewe tends to stay in her ''heaf'' (the local term for ''heft''), the same small area of fell. Due to the rough conditions on fells, lambing losses can be as high as 25%.<ref name="npa">[tpl]cite web |title=Topic 2 - Farming |work= Understanding the National Park|publisher=[[Lake District National Park Authority]]|url=http://www.lake-district.gov.uk/index/understanding/posters/poster2_farming.htm |accessdate =2007-11-01 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071022042905/http://www.lake-district.gov.uk/index/understanding/posters/poster2_farming.htm  |archivedate=2007-10-22[/tpl]</ref> This ability to thrive unassisted is part of the reason fell farmers so highly value Herdwicks over much higher-producing lowland breeds.<ref name="rough guide"/> 
A Herdwick's grey fleece is not easily dyed, and is coarse, and so is best suited to use as carpet wool. The wool is also an excellent natural insulator; it is possible to buy sheets of fireproofed wool to fit as loft insulation.[ref]
