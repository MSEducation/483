A parliamentary election was held in Niger on 4 December 2004 alongside a simultaneous presidential election. 105 members were elected in 8 multi-member constituencies using the party-list proportional representation system. The remaining 8 members were elected in special single-member constituencies to ensure the representation of national minority communities.
The result was a victory for the National Movement for the Development of Society (MNSD-Nassara), which won 47 of the 113 seats in the National Assembly. The party's presidential candidate, Tandja Mamadou, was also victorious in the presidential election. Following the election, MNSD-Nassara resumed its previous ruling coalition with junior partner CDS-Rahama whose 22 seats give a 69 seat majority in the National Assembly of Niger.Yahaya Garba, "6ème congrès de la CDS-Rahama: Un congrès expéditif et sans enjeu", Roue de l’Histoire n° 368, September 5, 2007 (Tamtaminfo.com, September 6, 2007) [tpl]fr icon[/tpl].
