Dark rooms are still a feature of some gay bars and clubs throughout Europe. 

==Dark rooms in sex clubs and bathhouses==

Dark rooms may be advertised as an amenity or attraction of sex clubs and bathhouses.
A sex club's dark room may be as simple as a small darkened area large enough for two or three people, or may comprise a large portion of the club's floor area, with mazes, glory holes, private nooks, steel bars resembling prison cells, and varying floor levels.
