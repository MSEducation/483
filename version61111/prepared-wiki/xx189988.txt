The song is a mid-tempo ballad in which the narrator tells of his "night to remember" a lost lover. He begins by stating that he has had a tough week, and has plans for tonight because he is feeling downcast.
In the second verse, he states how he feels that, because his woman was "so hard to lose", he has to do such a recollection of her, even though "sad ain't his style". According to Billboard.com, Diffie "conveys an element of hope among the ashes of a relationship that make this song a survivor."
