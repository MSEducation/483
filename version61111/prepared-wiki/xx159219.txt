"3-Tage-Bart" stubble; lit: 3-days-beard is a punk song by Die Ärzte. It's the fourth track and the first single from their 1996 album Le Frisur. The song is about a man, who has everything he may want and need, but he's missing one thing - the stubble.

==The video==

In the video Die Ärzte are running and jumping on a beach, obviously happy and on the other hand performing some kind of dance, singing the song in another location. The video very often jumps between those two locations. 

The video was filmed in Spain, during a tour break, and is released on the Killer DVD.
