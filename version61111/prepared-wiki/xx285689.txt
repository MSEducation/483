==Life==

In 1769 he was, with Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi, Johann Gottfried Herder, and Johann Wolfgang Goethe, known as a member of the Merckschen Circle in Darmstadt, but almost all broke with him because nobody trusted him. After moving to Berlin he was briefly teacher of philosophy to Crown Prince Frederick William III of Prussia. Along with bookseller and author Christoph Friedrich Nicolai, Royal librarian Johann Erich Biester, and Moses Mendelssohn, the German Jewish philosopher, he became a member of the Berlin Wednesday Society. Later on he went to Paris, where he lived as a Jacobin and later died.
