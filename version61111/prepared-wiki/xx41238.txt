Sinicization, sinicisation, or  sinification, ([tpl]zh|c=汉化|p=Hànhuà[/tpl]), also called chinalization ([tpl]zh|c=中国化|p=Zhōngguóhuà[/tpl]), is a process whereby non-Han Chinese societies come under the influence of dominant Han Chinese state and society. Areas of influence include alphabet, diet, economics, industry, language, law, lifestyle, politics, religion, sartorial choices, technology, culture, and cultural values. More broadly, "Sinicization" may refer to policies of acculturation, assimilation, or cultural imperialism of neighbouring cultures to China, depending on historical political relations.  This is reflected in the histories of Korea, Vietnam and Japan in the East Asian cultural sphere, for example, in the adoption of the Chinese writing system.

==Integration==

The integration policy is a type of nationalism aimed at strengthening of the Chinese identity among population. Proponents believe integration will help to develop shared values, pride in being the country’s citizen, respect and acceptance towards cultural differences among citizens of China. Critics argue that integration destroys ethnic diversity, language diversity, and cultural diversity. Analogous to North America with approximately 300 Native American languages and distinct ethnic groups, in China there are 292 non-Mandarin languages spoken by native peoples of the region http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=CN. There are also a number of immigrant languages, such as Khmer, Portuguese, English, etc.

==Historical examples of sinicization==

===Turkic peoples===

Descendants of Uyghurs who migrated to Taoyuan County, Hunan have largely assimilated into the Han Chinese and Hui population and practice Chinese customs, speaking Chinese as their language.

===Tang dynasty===

During the 8th and 9th centuries in the Tang dynasty, Chinese soldiers moved into Guizhou (Kweichow) and married native women, their descendants are known as Lao-han-jen (original Chinese), in contrast to new Chinese who colonized Guizhou at later times. They still speak an archaic dialect.[tpl]en icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=eG8cAAAAMAAJ&q=In+some+parts,+as+for+example+in+Kweichow,+the+distinction+is+made+between+the+Lao-han-jen+or+%22+Original+Chinese+%22+and+the++claim+ancestry+in+the+region+from+as+early+as+the+eighth+and+ninth+centuries+%3B+these+ancestors+were+as+a+rule+soldier-colonists+who+married+native+women,+and+their+descendants+speak+an+archaic+dialect.+The+new+Chinese,+much+more&dq=In+some+parts,+as+for+example+in+Kweichow,+the+distinction+is+made+between+the+Lao-han-jen+or+%22+Original+Chinese+%22+and+the++claim+ancestry+in+the+region+from+as+early+as+the+eighth+and+ninth+centuries+%3B+these+ancestors+were+as+a+rule+soldier-colonists+who+married+native+women,+and+their+descendants+speak+an+archaic+dialect.+The+new+Chinese,+much+more&hl=en&ei=SdPMTIrZOMaAlAez8YWbBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA|title=Scottish geographical magazine, Volumes 45-46|author=Scottish Geographical Society|year=1929|publisher=Royal Scottish Geographical Society.|location=|isbn=|page=70|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28[/tpl] Many immigrants to Guizhou were descended from these soldiers in garrisons who married non-Chinese women.[tpl]en icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vqcSAAAAIAAJ&q=Among+them+were+forced+or+voluntary+immigrants+who+came+as+families+or+clans,+garrison+soldiers+without+families+who+married+women+from+non-Chinese+groups,+and+in+more+recent+years+farmers,+business+and+professional+men,+and+officials.&dq=Among+them+were+forced+or+voluntary+immigrants+who+came+as+families+or+clans,+garrison+soldiers+without+families+who+married+women+from+non-Chinese+groups,+and+in+more+recent+years+farmers,+business+and+professional+men,+and+officials.&hl=en&ei=r9LMTLz_AsTflgftkNzjCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAQ|title=The Cowrie Shell Miao of Kweichow, Volume 32, Issue 1|author=Margaret Portia Mickey|year=1947|publisher=The Museum|location=|isbn=|page=6|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28[/tpl]

===Ming dynasty===

Massive military campaigns were launched by the Ming dynasty during the Miao Rebellions against the southern aboriginal Miao, Yao, and other tribes, settled thousands of Han and Hui in their land after crushing and killing the aboriginals.
During the Ming conquest of Yunnan Chinese military soldiers were settled in Yunnan, and many married the native women.

===Qing dynasty===

The Manchu people started sinicizing during the Qing dynasty. They originally had their own separate style of naming from the Han Chinese, but eventually adopted Han Chinese naming practices.
Manchu names consisted of more than the two or one syllable Chinese names, and when phonetically transcribed into Chinese, they made no sense at all.[tpl]cite book|year=2001|publisher=Stanford University Press|quote=famous Manchu figure of the early Qing who belonged to the Niohuru clan) would have been the unwieldy "Niu-gu-lu E-bi-long" in Chinese. Moreover, the characters used in names were typically chosen to represent the sounds of Manchu, and not to carry any particular meaning in Chinese. For educated Han Chinese accustomed to names composed of a familiar surname and one or two elegang characters drawn from a poem or a passage from the classics, Manchu names looked not just different, but absurd. What was oneo to make of a name like E-bi-long, written in Chinese characters meaning "repress-must flourish," or Duo-er-gun, meaning "numerous-thou-roll"? S. . .To them they looked like nonsense. . . But they are not nonsense in Manchu: "E-bi-long" is the transcription of ebilun, meaning "a delicate or sickly child," and "Duo-er-gun" is the Chinese transcription of dorgon, the Manchu word for badger.|location=|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_qtgoTIAiKUC&pg=PA242#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn=0-8047-4684-2|page=242|pages=|title=The Manchu Way: The Eight Banners and Ethnic Identity in Late Imperial China|edition=illustrated, reprint|author=Mark C. Elliott|accessdate=March 2, 2012[/tpl] The meaning of the names that Manchus used were also very different from the meanings of Chinese names.[tpl]cite book|year=2001|publisher=Stanford University Press|quote=Thus we find names like Nikan (Chinese), Ajige (little), Asiha (young), Haha (nale), Mampi (knot—a reference to the hair?), Kara (black), Fulata (red-eyed), Necin (peaceful), Kirsa (steppe fox), Unahan (colt), Jumara (squirrel), Nimašan (sea eagle), Nomin (lapis lazuli), and Gacuha (toy made out of an animal's anklebone).44 Names such as Jalfungga (long-lived), Fulingga (lucky one), Fulungga (majestic), and Hūturingga (fortunate), were not unknown, either, particularly after the seventeenth century.

Elliott|accessdate=March 2, 2012[/tpl] The Manchus also gave numbers as personal names.[tpl]cite book|year=2001|publisher=Stanford University Press|quote=While Chinese names, too, sometimes ended in characters with the sounds "zhu," "bao," and "tai," more often than not, such names in the Qing belonged to Manchus and other bannermen (Chinese bannermen and Mongols sometimes took Manchu-sounding names), even if the attached meaning is not clear (it is not certain that all names in fact had a specific meaning). Giving "numeral names" was another unique Manchu habit. These were names that actually referred to numbers. Sometimes they were given using Manchu numbers—for example, Nadanju (seventy) or Susai (fifty). Other times number names used the Manchu transcriptions of Chinese numbers, as in the name Loišici (= Liushi qi, "sixty-seven"), Bašinu (= bashi wu, "eight-five").45 Such names, unheard of among the Han, were quite common among the Manchus, an appeared from time to time among Chinese bannermen. Popular curiosity about this odd custom in Qing was partly satisfied by the nineteenth-century bannerman-writer Fu-ge, who explained in his book of "jottings" that naming children for their grandparents' ages was a way of wishing longevity to the newly born.46|location=|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_qtgoTIAiKUC&pg=PA243#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn=0-8047-4684-2|page=243|pages=|title=The Manchu Way: The Eight Banners and Ethnic Identity in Late Imperial China|edition=illustrated, reprint|author=Mark C.

They gave their children Chinese names which were separate from the Manchu names, and even adopted the Chinese practice of generation names, although its usage was inconsistent and error ridden, eventually they stopped using Manchu names.[tpl]cite book|year=2001|publisher=University of Washington Press|quote=At Xiuyan, in eastern Fengtian, the Manchus in the seventh or eighth generation continued as before to give their sons polysyllabic Manchu personal names that were meaningless when transliterated into Chinese, but at the same time they began to also give them Chinese names that were disyllabic and meaningful and that conformed to the generational principle. Thus, in the seventh generation of the Gūwalgiya lineage were sons with two names, one Manchu and one Chinese, such as Duolunbu/Shiman, Delinbu/Shizhu, and Tehengbu/Shizhen. Within the family and the banner, these boys used their Manchu name, but outside they used their Han-style name. Then, from the eight or ninth generation one, at the beginning of the nineteenth century, the Gūwalgiya at Xiuyan stopped giving polysyllabic Manchu names to their sons, who thereafter used Chinese names exclusively.|location=|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=tgq1miGno-4C&pg=PA56#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=56|pages=|title=Manchus & Han: ethnic relations and political power in late Qing and early republican China, 1861-1928|edition=reprint, illustrated|author=Edward J.

Usage of surnames was not traditional to the Manchu while it was to the Han Chinese.[tpl]cite book|year=2001|publisher=Stanford University Press|quote=Chinese names consist typically of a single-character surname and a given name of one or two characters, the latter usually chosen for their auspicious meaning. Manchu names were different. For one thing, Manchus did not commonly employ surnames, identifying themselves usually by their banner affiliation rather than by their lineage. Even if they had customarily used both surname and given name, this would not have eliminated the difference with Han names, since Manchu names of any kind were very often longer than two characters—that is, two syllables— in length.

==Modern examples of sinicization==

===Kuomintang===

The Kuomintang pursued a sinicization policy, it was stated that "the time had come to set about the business of making all natives either turn Chinese or get out." by foreign observers on the Kuomintang policy. It was noted that "Chinese colonization" of "Mongolia and Manchuria" led to the conclusion "to a conviction that the day of the barbarian was finally over."[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?ei=z37kTZKwH-b40gGG2pGIBw&ct=result&id=Qb0pAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+Kuomintang+urged+that+the+time+had+come+to+set+about+the+business+of+making+all+natives+either+turn+Chinese+or+get+out.+The+Kuomintang+has+but+little+political+power+in+Chinese+Turkistan%2C+because+the+ruling+Chinese+faction&q=kuomintang+business|title=The new Orient; a series of monographs on Oriental culture ...|author=|editor=|year=1933|publisher=|edition=|location=|page=116|isbn=|pages=|accessdate=2011-05-29[/tpl][tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?ei=R3_kTcf7AoXi0QG11e20Bw&ct=result&id=rrjQAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Kuomintang+urged+that+the+time+had+come+to+set+about+the+business+of+making+all+natives+either+turn+Chinese+or+get+out.+The+Kuomintang+has+but+little+political+power+in+Chinese+Turkistan%2C+because+the+ruling+Chinese+faction&q=The+Kuomintang+urged+that+the+time+had+come+to+set+about+the+business+of+making+all+natives+either+turn+Chinese+or+get+out.+The+Kuomintang+has+but+little+political+power+in+Chinese+Turkistan%2C+because+the+ruling+Chinese+faction|title=The Open court, Volume 47|author=|editor=Paul Carus|year=1934|publisher=The Open Court Pub.

The Hui Muslim 36th Division (National Revolutionary Army) governed southern Xinjiang in 1934–1937.

===Taiwan===

After the Republic of China took control of Taiwan in 1945 and relocated its capital to Taipei in 1949, the intention of Chiang Kai-shek was to eventually go back to mainland China and retake control of it. Chiang believed that to retake mainland China, it would be necessary to sinicize Taiwan's inhabitants.  Examples of this policy included the renaming of streets, use of Mandarin Chinese in schools and punishments for using other languages, and teaching students to revere Confucian ethics, develop Han Chinese nationalism, and believe Taiwan is part of China.[tpl]cite conference | first = June Teufel | last = Dreyer | title = Taiwan’s Evolving Identity | url = http://www.wilsoncenter.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=events.event_summary&event_id=31149 Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars | location = Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars | quote = In order to shore up his government’s legitimacy, Chiang set about turning Taiwan’s inhabitants into Chinese. To use Renan’s terminology, Chiang chose to re-define the concept of shared destiny to include the mainland. Streets were re-named; major thoroughfares in Taipei received names associated with the traditional Confucian virtues. The avenue passing in front of the foreign ministry en route to the presidential palace was named chieh-shou (long life), in Chiang’s honor. Students were required to learn Mandarin and speak it exclusively; those who disobeyed and spoke Taiwanese, Hakka, or aboriginal tongues could be fined, slapped, or subjected to other disciplinary actions. | date = July 17, 2003 | accessdate = May 20, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.hoover.org/publications/digest/17827189.html|quote=The new KMT concluded that it must “Sinicize” Taiwan if it were ever to unify mainland China.

First, it was done to help root out fifty years of Japanese colonial influence on the island's populace--"resinicizing" them, one might say- -and thereby guarantee their loyalty to the Chinese motherland. Second, the million mainlanders or so who had fled to Taiwan themselves had the age-old tendency of being more loyal to city, county, or province than to China as a nation. They identified themselves as Hunanese, Cantonese, or Sichuanese first, and as Chinese second.[/tpl]
The process of re-asserting non-Chinese identity, as in the case of ethnic groups in Taiwan, is sometimes known as (desinicization).

===Tibet===

The sinicization of Tibet is the change of Tibetan society to Han Chinese standards, by means of cultural assimilation, immigration, and political reform.Burbu, Dawa (2001) China's Tibet Policy, Routledge, ISBN 978-0-7007-0474-3, pp 100-124Samdup, Tseten (1993) Chinese population - Threat to Tibetan identity

==In popular culture==

In some forms of fiction, due to China's communist statehood, Soviet-themed characters are de-Sovietized and switched over to become Chinese to fit modern (post-Cold War) times. The original cut of the 2012 Red Dawn remake depicted a North Korean invasion before having said information leaked to the Global Times, sparking controversy in China and threatening its airing in the country (the invaders were changed to North Koreans). In 2006, Chinese versions of the Crimson Dynamo and the Abomination were created and made members of the Liberators in Marvel Comics.
