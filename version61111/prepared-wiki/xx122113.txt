==Early life==

After high school, Rasmussen attended college the University of Montana Western where he completed a double major in history and math as an honor student.  As the public radio sports announcer for the UMW Bulldogs, Rasmussen had his voice heard for the first time by an audience.   To help with the expenses of college, Rasmussen worked as a barrel clown in western Montana.   Rasmussen made his first appearance as a rodeo clown in Superior, Montana, at the age of 19.   Flint had his first thoughts about being a rodeo clown when he told his father and brother that he could do better than the rodeo clowns at the time.   "I just thought it needed a new energy, a young guy who could relate and get young people to get back to rodeo," Rasmussen said.   After he completed college, Flint Rasmussen returned to the town he was born, Havre, and taught at Havre High School in addition to coaching football and track.   After two years of teaching and coaching, Rasmussen grew restless and started his career as a barrel man.

==The Rodeo Clown==

According to the Journal of Folklore Research, "The clown of the rodeo qualifies as the clown of cowboy society, and thus in the rodeo he exaggerates, satirizes, rearranges, and challenges the assumptions upon which the social and natural relations of the cowboy world operate." [tpl]cite web|last=Stoltje|first=Beverly|title=The Rodeo Clown and the Semiotics of Metaphor|publisher=Journal of Folklore Research|accessdate=27 March 2012[/tpl]  The rodeo clown goes back to the old western stories, where cowboys play tricks and tell lies.  The rodeo clown's main act comes at the last event bull riding.   During the ride, the clown faces the bull and plays the bullfighter, but after the ride, resumes his role as the jokester and story teller.

==Achievements==

"I think it's hard to come into this sport cold at 25 and try to learn it,"  Rasmussen said.  But that did not stop him. Flint Rasmussen's did his first Wrangler National Finals Rodeo (NFR) in 1998.   That same year, he was a barrel clown at the Pendleton Round Up, and thirteen years later, in 2011, Rasmussen was induced into the Pendleton Hall of Fame.   When Flint signed with the Professional Bull Riders (PBR) in 2005, the contract was exclusive and Rasmussen now only works for the PBR.   Before signing with the PBR, Rasmussen was the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA) Clown of the Year for eight consecutive years.   Along with those honors, he was the Coors Man in the Can seven times.   Rasmussen not only excels in the arena but also outside it, too.  In 2010, Rasmussen made a special appearance as the Pendleton High School graduation speaker.

==Late 2000s==
