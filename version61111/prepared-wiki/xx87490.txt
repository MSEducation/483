The Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, (CPA) previously known as the Empire Parliamentary Association,  is an organisation, of British origin, which works to support good governance, democracy and human rights. 
As of 1989, the organisation acknowledges a Patron - the Head of the Commonwealth;  Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II - and a Vice Patron, the head of state or of the government of the branch holding the upcoming conference. The association's supreme authority is the General Assembly, constituted by delegates to the annual Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference. The  business and activities are managed by an Executive Committee, which reports to the General Assembly. The association's funds are obtained from membership fees paid by its branches, as well as from two trust funds and various other sources.
