Valproic acid (VPA, valproate), an acidic chemical compound, has found clinical use as an anticonvulsant and mood-stabilizing drug, primarily in the treatment of epilepsy, bipolar disorder and prevention of migraine headaches. VPA is a liquid at room temperature, but it can be reacted with a base such as sodium hydroxide to form the salt sodium valproate, which is a solid. 
The acid, salt, or a mixture of the two (valproate semisodium) are marketed under a number of different brand names, including: Depakote, Epilim, Valparin, Valpro, Vilapro and Stavzor. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, a list of the most important medication needed in a basic health system.[tpl]cite web|title=WHO Model List of EssentialMedicines|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/93142/1/EML_18_eng.pdf?ua=1|work=World Health Organization|accessdate=22 April 2014|date=October 2013[/tpl]

==Medical uses==

Its primary use in medicine is in the treatment of epilepsy, bipolar mania and migraine prophylaxis. It is also used off-label for bipolar maintenance. Other off-label uses include impulse control disorders, suggested by recent evidence of efficacy in controlling this adverse effect of Parkinson's Disease medical therapy. Recently, it has been trialled in the treatment of HIV and cancer, owing to its histone deacetylase-inhibiting effects.[tpl]cite journal|last=Činčárová|first=L|coauthors=Zdráhal, Z; Fajkus, J|title=New perspectives of valproic acid in clinical practice|journal=Expert Opinion on Investigational Drugs|date=December 2013|volume=22|issue=12|pages=1535–1547|doi=10.1517/13543784.2013.853037|pmid=24160174[/tpl] Valproate has a broad spectrum of anticonvulsant activity, although it is primarily used as a first-line treatment for tonic-clonic seizures, absence seizures and myoclonic seizures and as a second-line treatment for partial seizures and infantile spasms.[tpl]cite journal|last=Löscher|first=W|title=Basic pharmacology of valproate: a review after 35 years of clinical use for the treatment of epilepsy.|journal=CNS drugs|year=2002|volume=16|issue=10|pages=669–694|doi=10.2165/00023210-200216100-00003|pmid=12269861[/tpl] It has also been successfully given intravenously to treat status epilepticus.[tpl]cite journal|last=Olsen|first=KB|coauthors=Taubøll, E; Gjerstad, L|title=Valproate is an effective, well-tolerated drug for treatment of status epilepticus/serial attacks in adults.|journal=Acta Neurologica Scandinavica|year=2007|volume=187|pages=51–4|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0404.2007.00847.x|pmid=17419829[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Kwan|first=SY|title=The role of intravenous valproate in convulsive status epilepticus in the future.|journal=Acta Neurologica Taiwanica|date=June 2010|volume=19|issue=2|pages=78–81|pmid=20830628|url=http://www.ant.org.tw/Mag_Files/19-2/N201072314227_192edi.pdf|format=PDF[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Tiamkao|first=Somsak|coauthors=Sawanyawisuth, Kittisak; Chancharoen, Alongkorn|title=The efficacy of intravenous sodium valproate and phenytoin as the first-line treatment in status epilepticus: a comparison study|journal=BMC Neurology|year=2013|volume=13|issue=1|pages=98|doi=10.1186/1471-2377-13-98|pmid=23889906|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1471-2377-13-98.pdf|format=PDF|pmc=3727978[/tpl]

==Adverse effects==

The most common adverse effects of valproic acid are digestive complaints like diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting and indigestion; vision problems like seeing double or lazy eye; hormonal disturbances (increased testosterone production in females and menstrual irregularities), hair loss, memory problems, weight gain, infections, low platelet count (which can make one bleed more easily), infection, dizziness, drowsiness, tremor and headache. Less common, yet serious side effects include liver damage, brittle bones (becomes far more common with long-term use), polycystic ovaries, movement disorders (which may be irreversible like tardive dyskinesia), psychiatric/neurologic disturbances like hallucinations, anxiety and confusion; swollen pancreas, low body temperature and potentially life-threatening blood abnormalities.

===Pregnancy===

Valproate causes birth defects; exposure during pregnancy is associated with about three times as many major anomalies as usual, mainly spina bifida and, more rarely, with several other defects, possibly including a "valproate syndrome".[tpl]cite pmid|19490988[/tpl] Characteristics of this valproate syndrome include facial features that tend to evolve with age, including trigonocephaly, tall forehead with bifrontal narrowing, epicanthic folds, medial deficiency of eyebrows, flat nasal bridge, broad nasal root, anteverted nares, shallow philtrum, long upper lip and thin vermillion borders, thick lower lip and small downturned mouth.[tpl]cite pmid|17090909[/tpl]
Women who intend to become pregnant should switch to a different drug if possible.Valproate Not To Be Used for Migraine During Pregnancy, FDA Warns Women who become pregnant while taking valproate should be warned that it causes birth defects and cognitive impairment in the newborn, especially at high doses (although vaproate is sometimes the only drug that can control seizures, and seizures in pregnancy could have even worse consequences.) They should take high-dose folic acid and be offered antenatal screening (alpha-fetoprotein and second-trimester ultrasound scans), although screening and scans do not find all birth defects.British National Formulary (March 2003) 45
Valproate can cause neural tube defects. Folic acid supplements may reduce the risk of birth defects, however. A recent study showed children of mothers taking valproate during pregnancy are at risk for significantly lower IQs.[tpl]cite pmid|22246336[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/549073 | title = NEAD: In Utero Exposure To Valproate Linked to Poor Cognitive Outcomes in Kids | last = Cassels | first = Caroline | date = December 8, 2006 | publisher = Medscape | accessdate = 2007-05-23[/tpl][tpl]cite pmid|16894099[/tpl] Maternal valproate use during pregnancy has been associated with a significantly higher risk of autism in the offspring.[tpl]cite pmid|23613074[/tpl] Exposure of the human embryo to valproic acid is associated with risk of autism, and it is possible to duplicate features characteristic of autism by exposing rat embryos to valproic acid at the time of neural tube closure.[tpl]cite pmid|15749245[/tpl] Valproate exposure on embryonic day 11.5 led to significant local recurrent connectivity in the juvenile rat neocortex, consistent with the underconnectivity theory of autism.[tpl]cite pmid|17638926[/tpl] A 2009 study found that the 3 year old children of pregnant women taking valproate had an IQ nine points lower than that of a well-matched control group.

===Contraindications===

Contraindications include:

===Interactions===

Valproate inhibits CYP2C9, glucuronyl transferase, and epoxide hydrolase and is highly protein bound and hence may interact with drugs that are substrates for any of these enzymes or are highly protein bound themselves. It may also potentiate the CNS depressant effects of alcohol. It should not be given in conjunction with other antiepileptics due to the potential for reduced clearance of other antiepileptics (including carbamazepine, lamotrigine, phenytoin and phenobarbitone) and itself. It may also interact with:

===Overdose and toxicity===

Excessive amounts of valproic acid can result in tremor, stupor, respiratory depression, coma, metabolic acidosis, and death. Overdosage in children is usually of an accidental nature, whereas with adults it is more likely to be an intentional act. In general, serum or plasma valproic acid concentrations are in a range of 20–100 mg/l during controlled therapy, but may reach 150–1500 mg/l following acute poisoning. Monitoring of the serum level is often accomplished using commercial immunoassay techniques, although some laboratories employ gas or liquid chromatography.[tpl]cite pmid|12475192[/tpl]
In contrast to other antiepileptic drugs, at present there is little evidence favorable evidence for salivary therapeutic drug monitoring. Salivary levels of valproic acid correlate poorly with serum levels, at least in part due to valproate's weak acid property (pKa of 4.9).[tpl]cite journal|last=Patsalos|first=PN|coauthors=Berry|title=Therapeutic drug monitoring of antiepileptic drugs by use of saliva|journal=Therapeutic Drug Monitoring|date=Feb 2013 |volume=35|issue=1|pages=4-29|pmid=23288091|accessdate=21 April 2014[/tpl] 
In severe intoxication, hemoperfusion or hemofiltration can be an effective means of hastening elimination of the drug from the body.[tpl]cite pmid|19656009[/tpl]R. Baselt, Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man, 8th edition, Biomedical Publications, Foster City, CA, 2008, pp. 1622-1626. Supplemental L-carnitine is indicated in patients having an acute overdose[tpl]cite pmid|16277730[/tpl][tpl]cite pmid|22180549[/tpl] and also prophylactically in high risk patients. Acetyl-L-carnitine lowers hyperammonemia less markedly[tpl]cite pmid|8347126[/tpl] than L-carnitine. 

==Mechanism of action==

The mechanism of action of valproate is not fully understood. Its anticonvulsant effect is attributed to the 
blockade of voltage-dependent sodium channels and increased brain levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The GABAergic effect is also believed to contribute towards the anti-manic properties of valproate. In animals, sodium valproate raises cerebral and cerebellar levels of the inhibitory synaptic transmitter, GABA, possibly by inhibiting GABA degradative enzymes, such as GABA transaminase, succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase and by inhibiting the re-uptake of GABA by neuronal cells. It also possesses histone deacetylase-inhibiting effects. The inhibition of histone deacetylase, by promoting more transcriptionally active chromatin structures, likely presents the epigenetic mechanism for regulation of many of the neuroprotective effects attributed to valproic acid. Intermediate molecules mediating these effects include VEGF, BDNF, and GDNF.

==History==

Valproic acid was first synthesized in 1882 by B.S. Burton as an analogue of valeric acid, found naturally in valerian.[tpl]cite journal | author = Burton B.S. | year = 1882 | title = On the propyl derivatives and decomposition products of ethylacetoacetate | url = | journal = Am Chem J. | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 385–395 [/tpl] Valproic acid is a carboxylic acid, a clear liquid at room temperature. For many decades, its only use was in laboratories as a "metabolically inert" solvent for organic compounds. In 1962, the French researcher Pierre Eymard serendipitously discovered the anticonvulsant properties of valproic acid while using it as a vehicle for a number of other compounds that were being screened for antiseizure activity. He found it prevented pentylenetetrazol-induced convulsions in laboratory rats.[tpl]cite pmid|13935231[/tpl] It was approved as an antiepileptic drug in 1967 in France and has become the most widely prescribed antiepileptic drug worldwide.[tpl]cite pmid|12269862[/tpl] Valproic acid has also been used for migraine prophylaxis and bipolar disorder.[tpl]cite pmid|14624229[/tpl]
