==Plot summary==

A middle-aged writer is disenchanted with his tyrannical wife, his disrespectful teenage son, and his life in general.  He receives the gift of a custom-built word processor from his nephew, a teenage electronics genius. Unfortunately, the nephew suddenly dies in a car accident caused by the writer's abusive brother, who was driving drunk.  The writer must figure out on his own how to use the gift. He discovers that this word processor enables him to write things into existence, delete things from existence, and alter the fabric of his reality â€“ at least, as long as the rickety word processor still functions. He erases his wife and son, and seconds before the processor's demise replaces them with his nephew and the nephew's kind, gentle mother.
