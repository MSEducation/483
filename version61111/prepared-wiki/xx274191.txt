==Rolling stock==

Services are formed of 6-car 485 series EMUs, which include Green car (first class) accommodation. Niigata-based sets T16 and T17 are normally allocated to Kubikino duties, as these two sets did not receive the Green car seat refurbishment applied to other 485 sets used on Inaho limited express services in 2007.[tpl]cite journal| title = 越後路をめぐる国鉄型車両の現況|trans_title=The Current State of JNR Rolling Stock on Echigo Routes | journal = Tetsudō Daiya Jōhō Magazine | volume = 40| issue = 330| page = p.12–23| publisher = Kōtsū Shimbun | location = Japan | date = October 2011[/tpl]

==History==

The Kubikino services commenced from the start of the revised timetable on 1 December 2002, replacing the previous Minori limited express services. 4-car 485 series were initially used on these services, but 6-car Inaho 485 series sets were used from 20 May 2006 to relieve overcrowding.
A predecessor to the Kubikino rapid service, the [tpl]Nihongo|Kubiki|くびき[/tpl], operated as a semi-express between [tpl]ja-stalink|Niigata[/tpl] and [tpl]ja-stalink|Arai||Niigata[/tpl] from 1 October 1963, and as an express service from 5 March 1966, before being absorbed into [tpl]Nihongo|Yoneyama|よねやま[/tpl] semi-express services operating between [tpl]ja-stalink|Nagano[/tpl] and Niigata from 30 September 1968.[tpl]cite book | title = 列車名鑑1995 |trans_title= Train Name Directory 1995| publisher = Railway Journal| date = August 1995 | location = Japan| page = 125| isbn = [/tpl][tpl]cite book| last = Teramoto | first = Mitsuteru | title = 国鉄・ＪＲ列車名大辞典 |trans_title= JNR & JR Train Name Encyclopedia| publisher = Chuoshoin Publishing Co., Ltd. | date = July 2001 | location = Tokyo, Japan | pages = 215–216| isbn = 4-88732-093-0[/tpl]
