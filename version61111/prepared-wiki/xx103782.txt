[[Tricomin]]

CATEGORIES: Human hair

Tricomin may refer to a Chilean mining drilling company or to a purported non-drug alternative to prevent hair loss and alopecia, with a copper peptide as a key ingredient. The product is manufactured by the ProCyte corporation.
Tricomin hair loss is a superoxide dismutase formed from a metal complexed peptide. This works as a hair growth stimulant by improving collagen synthesis and possibly repairing skin and hair function. An 80% response rate has been reported for Tricomin in early tests. Phase II FDA clinical trial results were released which reported positive growth effects. The company has released a line of products, including shampoos, conditioners, and a therapy spray, which are available from doctors and mail order distributors. They are marketing the product as a cosmetic rather than going through FDA approval.
