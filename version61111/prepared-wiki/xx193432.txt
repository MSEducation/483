CATEGORIES: Former local government areas of Victoria (Australia)

The Shire of Lowan was a local government area in the Wimmera region of western Victoria, Australia. The shire covered an area of [tpl]convert|2861|km2|sqmi|1[/tpl], and existed from 1875 until 1995.

==History==

Lowan was originally part of the Shire of Wimmera which incorporated in 1862. On 31 December 1875, Lowan became a shire in its own right. Several parts of it split away in its first 20 years—Dimboola on 2 April 1885, the West Riding as Kaniva (Lawloit) on 29 May 1891 and the South Riding as Kowree on 29 May 1894. Like many western shires, it lost a remote section to its north when Shire of Walpeup was created on 1 November 1911.[tpl]cite book|title=Victorian Municipal Directory|year=1992|publisher=Arnall & Jackson|location=Brunswick|pages=744–745[/tpl] Accessed at State Library of Victoria, La Trobe Reading Room.
