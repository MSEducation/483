==Reception==

Scott Yanow of Allmusic states, "The Gerry Mulligan Quartet of 1952-53 was one of the best-loved jazz groups of the decade and it made stars out of both the leader and trumpeter Chet Baker... Although not quite possessing the magic of the earlier group, the music is quite enjoyable and the interplay between the two horns is still special".Yanow, S.
