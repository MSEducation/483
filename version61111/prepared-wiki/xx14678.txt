Milan Kundera ([tpl]IPA-cs|ˈmɪlan ˈkundɛra|lang[/tpl]; born 1 April 1929) is the Czech Republic's most recognized living writer. Of Czech origin, he has lived in exile in France since 1975, having become a naturalised citizen in 1981. He "sees himself as a French writer and insists his work should be studied as French literature and classified as such in book stores."
Kundera's best-known work is The Unbearable Lightness of Being. His books were banned by the Communist regimes of Czechoslovakia until the downfall of the regime in the Velvet Revolution of 1989. He lives virtually incognito and rarely speaks to the media. A perennial contender for the Nobel Prize in Literature, he has been nominated on several occasions.[tpl]cite news|first=Sarah|last=Crown|url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/nobelprize/story/0,14969,1591402,00.html |title=Nobel prize goes to Pinter|work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian Media Group|location=London|date=13 October 2005|accessdate=12 May 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200404/27/eng20040427_141663.shtml|title="Milan Kundera" coming to China|work=People's Daily Online|date=25 June 2004|accessdate=25 June 2004[/tpl]

==Biography==

Kundera was born in 1929 at Purkyňova ulice, 6 (6 Purkyňova Street) in Brno, Czechoslovakia, to a middle-class family. His father, Ludvík Kundera (1891–1971), once a pupil of the composer Leoš Janáček, was an important Czech musicologist and pianist who served as the head of the Janáček Music Academy in Brno from 1948 to 1961. Milan learned to play the piano from his father; he later studied musicology and musical composition. Musicological influences and references can be found throughout his work; he has even included musical notation in the text to make a point. Kundera is a cousin of Czech writer and translator Ludvík Kundera. He belonged to the generation of young Czechs who had had little or no experience of the pre-war democratic Czechoslovak Republic. Their ideology was greatly influenced by the experiences of World War II and the German occupation. Still in his teens, he joined the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia which seized power in 1948. He completed his secondary school studies in Brno at Gymnázium třída Kapitána Jaroše in 1948. He studied literature and aesthetics at the Faculty of Arts at Charles University in Prague.  After two terms, he transferred to the Film Faculty of the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague where he first attended lectures in film direction and script writing.
In 1950, his studies were briefly interrupted by political interferences. He and writer Jan Trefulka were expelled from the party for "anti-party activities." Trefulka described the incident in his novella Pršelo jim štěstí (Happiness Rained On Them, 1962).  Kundera also used the incident as an inspiration for the main theme of his novel Žert (The Joke, 1967). After Kundera graduated in 1952, the Film Faculty appointed him a lecturer in world literature. In 1956 Milan Kundera was readmitted into the Party. He was expelled for the second time in 1970. Kundera, along with other reform communist writers such as Pavel Kohout, was partly involved in the 1968 Prague Spring. This brief period of reformist activities was crushed by the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968. Kundera remained committed to reforming Czech communism, and argued vehemently in print with fellow Czech writer Václav Havel, saying, essentially, that everyone should remain calm and that "nobody is being locked up for his opinions yet," and "the significance of the Prague Autumn may ultimately be greater than that of the Prague Spring." Finally, however, Kundera relinquished his reformist dreams and moved to France in 1975. He taught for a few years in the University of Rennes.[tpl]fr icon[/tpl] “L'intransigeant amoureux de la France” L'Express, 03/04/2003[tpl]en icon[/tpl] «When there is no word for 'home», The New-York Times, 29 April 1984 He was stripped of Czechoslovak citizenship in 1979; he has been a French citizen since 1981.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kundera.de/english/Biography/biography.html |title=Biography Milan Kunder |publisher=Kundera.de |date=1929-04-01 |accessdate=2013-11-19[/tpl]

==Work==

Although his early poetic works are staunchly pro-communist,[tpl]cite web|url=http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/3806/ |title=Man, a wide garden: Milan Kundera as a young Stalinist - Enlighten |publisher=Eprints.gla.ac.uk |date=2013-04-12 |accessdate=2013-11-19[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/3806/1/Milan_Kundera.pdf |title=Man, a wide garden: Milan Kundera as a young Stalinist |author=Jan Culik |date=January 2007 |publisher=Eprints.gla.ac.uk |accessdate=2013-11-19[/tpl] his novels escape ideological classification. Kundera has repeatedly insisted on being considered a novelist, rather than a political or dissident writer. Political commentary has all but disappeared from his novels (starting specifically after The Unbearable Lightness of Being) except in relation to broader philosophical themes. Kundera's style of fiction, interlaced with philosophical digression, greatly inspired by the novels of Robert Musil and the philosophy of Nietzsche, [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.webster.edu/~corbetre/personal/reading/kundera-unbearable.html |title=Kundera Milan: The Unbearable Lightness of Being |publisher=Webster.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-11-19[/tpl] is also used by authors Alain de Botton and Adam Thirlwell. Kundera takes his inspiration, as he notes often enough, not only from the Renaissance authors Giovanni Boccaccio and Rabelais, but also from Laurence Sterne, Henry Fielding, Denis Diderot, Robert Musil, Witold Gombrowicz, Hermann Broch, Franz Kafka, Martin Heidegger, and perhaps most importantly, Miguel de Cervantes, to whose legacy he considers himself most committed.
Originally, he wrote in Czech. From 1993 onwards, he has written his novels in French. Between 1985 and 1987 he undertook the revision of the French translations of his earlier works. As a result, all of his books exist in French with the authority of the original. His books have been translated into many languages.
A detailed discussion of Milan Kundera's work in English, written originally by Jan Čulík for the US Dictionary of Literary Biography, is available on the website of the University of Glasgow [tpl]cite web|url=http://www2.arts.gla.ac.uk/Slavonic/Kundera.htm |title=Milan Kundera |publisher=.arts.gla.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-11-19[/tpl] here.

===The Joke===

In his first novel, The Joke (1967), he gave a satirical account of the nature of totalitarianism in the Communist era. Kundera was quick to criticize the Soviet invasion in 1968. This led to his blacklisting in Czechoslovakia and his works being banned there.

===Life is Elsewhere===

Kundera's second novel was first published in French as La vie est ailleurs in 1973 and in Czech as Život je jinde in 1979. Set in Czechoslovakia before, during and after the Second World War, Life Is Elsewhere is a satirical portrait of the fictional poet Jaromil, a young and very naive idealist who becomes involved in political scandals.

===The Book of Laughter and Forgetting===

In 1975, Kundera moved to France. There he published The Book of Laughter and Forgetting (1979) which told of Czech citizens opposing the communist regime in various ways. An unusual mixture of novel, short story collection and author's musings, the book set the tone for his works in exile. Critics have noted the irony that the country that Kundera seemed to be writing about when he talked about Czechoslovakia in the book, "is, thanks to the latest political redefinitions, no longer precisely there" which is the "kind of disappearance and reappearance" Kundera explores in the book.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/240976.The_Book_of_Laughter_and_Forgetting |title=The Book of Laughter and Forgetting by Milan Kundera — Reviews, Discussion, Bookclubs, Lists |publisher=Goodreads.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-19[/tpl] Published in Czech (Kniha smíchu a zapomnění) in April 1981 by 68 Publishers Toronto.

===The Unbearable Lightness of Being===

Kundera's most well known work, The Unbearable Lightness of Being, was published in 1984. The book chronicles the fragile nature of an individual's fate, theorizing that a single lifetime is insignificant in the scope of Nietzsche's concept of eternal return. In an infinite universe, everything is guaranteed to recur infinitely. In 1988, American director Philip Kaufman released a film adaptation.

===Immortality===

In 1990, Kundera published Immortality. The novel, his last in Czech, was more cosmopolitan than its predecessors, as well as more explicitly philosophical and less political. It would set the tone for his later novels.

==Writing style and philosophy==

Kundera's characters are often explicitly identified as figments of his own imagination, commenting in the first-person on the characters in entirely third-person stories. Kundera is more concerned with the words that shape or mould his characters than with the characters' physical appearance. In his non-fiction work, The Art of the Novel, he says that the reader's imagination automatically completes the writer's vision. He, as the writer, wishes to focus on the essential insofar as the physical is not critical to an understanding of the character. For him the essential may not include the physical appearance or even the interior world (the psychological world) of his characters. Other times, a specific feature or trait may become the character's idiosyncratic focus.
François Ricard suggested that Kundera conceives with regard to an overall oeuvre, rather than limiting his ideas to the scope of just one novel at a time.  His themes and meta-themes exist across the entire oeuvre.  Each new book manifests the latest stage of his personal philosophy. Some of these meta-themes include exile, identity, life beyond the border (beyond love, beyond art, beyond seriousness), history as continual return, and the pleasure of a less "important" life. (François Ricard, 2003) Many of Kundera's characters are intended as expositions of one of these themes at the expense of their fully developed humanity. Specifics in regard to the characters tend to be rather vague. Often, more than one main character is used in a novel, even to the extent of completely discontinuing a character and resuming the plot with a brand new character. As he told Philip Roth in an interview in The Village Voice: "Intimate life is understood as one's personal secret, as something valuable, inviolable, the basis of one's originality.Contemporary Authors Online, Thomson Gale, 2007[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2007[/tpl]
Kundera's early novels explore the dual tragic and comic aspects of totalitarianism. He does not view his works, however, as political commentary. "The condemnation of totalitarianism doesn't deserve a novel," says Kundera. According to the Mexican novelist Carlos Fuentes, "What he finds interesting is the similarity between totalitarianism and "the immemorial and fascinating dream of a harmonious society where private life and public life form but one unity and all are united around one will and one faith..." In exploring the dark humor of this topic, Kundera seems deeply influenced by Franz Kafka.
Kundera considers himself to be a writer without a message. For example, in the Sixty-three Words, a chapter in The Art of the Novel, Kundera recounts an episode when a Scandinavian publisher hesitated about going ahead with the publication of The Farewell Party because of the apparent anti-abortion message contained in the novel. Kundera explains that not only was the publisher wrong about the existence of such a message in the work, but, "...I was delighted with the misunderstanding. I had succeeded as a novelist. I succeeded in maintaining the moral ambiguity of the situation. I had kept faith with the essence of the novel as an art: irony. And irony doesn't give a damn about messages!"[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/98/05/17/specials/kundera-words.html|title=Key Words, Problem Words, Words I love|last=Kundera|first=Milan|date=6 March 1988|work=The New York Times|accessdate=13 November 2010[/tpl]
He also digresses into musical matters, analyzing Czech folk music, quoting from Leoš Janáček and Bartók. Further in this vein, he interpolates musical excerpts into the text (for example, in The Joke), or discusses Schoenberg and atonality.

==Miroslav Dvořáček controversy==

On 13 October 2008, the Czech weekly Respekt prominently publicised an investigation carried out by the Czech Institute for Studies of Totalitarian Regimes,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ustrcr.cz/en |title=The Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes |language=[tpl]cs icon[/tpl] |publisher=Ustrcr.cz |date=2013-05-15 |accessdate=2013-11-19[/tpl] which alleged that Kundera had denounced a young Czech pilot, Miroslav Dvořáček, to the police in 1950.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://english.respekt.cz/Milan-Kunderas-denunciation-2742.html|title=Milan Kundera's denunciation|work=Respekt|date=13 October 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081014003849/http://english.respekt.cz/Milan-Kunderas-denunciation-2742.html|archivedate=14 October 2008[/tpl] The accusation was based on a police station report which named "Milan Kundera, student, born 1.4.1929" as the informant in regard to the presence of Dvořáček at a student dormitory; information about his defection from military service and residence in Germany was attributed in the report to Iva Militká. The target of the subsequent arrest, Miroslav Dvořáček, had fled Czechoslovakia after being ordered to join the infantry in the wake of a purge of the flight academy and returned to Czechoslovakia as an agent of  a spy agency organised by Czechoslovak exiles. The police report does not mention his activity as an agent. Dvořáček returned secretly to the student dormitory of a friend's former sweetheart, Iva Militká. Militká was dating (and later married) a fellow student Ivan Dlask, and Dlask knew Kundera. The police report states that Militká told Dlask who told Kundera who told the police of Dvořáček's presence in town. Although the Communist prosecutor sought the death penalty, Dvořáček was sentenced to 22 years (as well as being charged 10,000 crowns, forfeiting property, and being stripped of civic rights), and ended up serving 14 years in a labour camp, with some of that time spent in a uranium mine, before being released.Pancevski, Bojan (14 October 2008). "Milan Kundera denies spy tip-off claims". The Times UK 
After Respekt[tpl]'[/tpl]s report (which states that Kundera did not know Dvořáček), Kundera denied turning Dvořáček in to the police, stating he did not know him at all, and could not even recollect "Militská". This denial was broadcast in Czech, but is available in English transcript only in abbreviated paraphrase.[tpl]dead link|date=November 2013[/tpl] On 14 October 2008, the Czech Security Forces Archive ruled out the possibility that the document could be a fake, but refused to make any interpretation about it.http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/news/index_view.php?id=338644 [tpl]dead link|date=November 2013[/tpl] (Vojtech Ripka for the Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes said, "There are two pieces of circumstantial evidence police report and its sub-file, but we, of course, cannot be one hundred percent sure. Unless we find all survivors, which is unfortunately impossible, it will not be complete", adding both that the signature on the police report matches the name of a man who worked in the corresponding National Security Corps section and, on the other hand, that a police protocol is missing.)
While many critics in the Czech Republic condemned Kundera as a "police informer", there were also many voices which sharply criticised Respekt for publishing a badly researched piece. The problem was that the short police report according to which young Kundera allegedly informed on Dvořáček does not contain Kundera's signature, nor does it contain any information from his ID card. Kundera was the student representative of the Hall of Residence which Dvořáček visited and it cannot be ruled out that anyone could have reported him to the police using Kundera's name. Contradictory statements by Kundera's fellow students were carried by the Czech newspapers in the wake of this "scandal". "Historian" Tomáš Hradílek was criticised for an undeclared conflict of interest: one of the protagonists of the incident was his relative. The Prague-based Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes is regarded by many as a propagandistic institution. It states on its website[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ustrcr.cz/ |title=Ústav pro studium totalitních režimů |language=[tpl]cs icon[/tpl] |publisher=Ustrcr.cz |date=2013-11-15 |accessdate=2013-11-19[/tpl] that its task is to "impartially study the crimes of the former communist regime". Critics also accused Respekt for using the under-researched Kundera "scandal" to boost its weakening circulation figures. Prague literary scholar Jakub Češka has produced a detailed Barthian analysis of the process which turned Milan Kundera into an informer.[tpl]cite web|url=http://blisty.cz/art/47276.html |title=The process which turned Milan Kundera into an informer |publisher=Blisty.cz |date= |accessdate=2013-11-19[/tpl]
Dvořáček still believes he was betrayed by Iva Militká; his wife said she doubted the "so-called evidence" against Kundera.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20081014-spy%E2%80%99-wife-doubts-claims-against-kundera-literature-history&navi=EUROPE|title=Spy’s wife doubts claims against Kundera|work=France 24|date=14 October 2008|accessdate=14 October 2008[/tpl] Dlask, who according to the police report told Kundera of Dvořáček's presence, died in the 1990s. He had told his wife Militká that he had mentioned Dvořáček's arrival to Kundera.[tpl]cite web|author=Eliška Bártová, Ludvík Hradilek |url=http://aktualne.centrum.cz/rozhovory/clanek.phtml?id=619364 |title=Rozhovor: Že v tom měl Kundera prsty, vím už 15 let - Aktuálně.cz |publisher=Aktualne.centrum.cz |date= |accessdate=2013-11-19[/tpl] Two days after the incident became widely publicised, a counterclaim was made by literary historian Zdeněk Pešat. He said that Dlask was the informant in the case, and Dlask had told him that he had "informed the police."http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/index_view.php?id=338869 [tpl]dead link|date=November 2013[/tpl] Pešat, then a member of a branch of Czechoslovak Communist Party, said he believed that Dlask informed on Dvořáček to protect his girlfriend from sanctions for being in contact with an agent-provocateur. As Kundera's name still appears as the informer on the police report, this still leaves open the possibility that Kundera informed on Dvořáček to the police (and not the Communist Party branch) separately from Dlask, or had been set up by Dlask to do the deed itself.
In the first-person postscript to Life Is Elsewhere, Kundera (writing as himself) defends his protagonist: he is "a monster. But his monstrosity is potentially contained in us all.  It is in me."[tpl]en icon[/tpl] Life is Elsewhere, Postscript, page 310. ISBN 978-0-571-14903-2. The protagonist had, among other things, denounced to the authorities a young man about to flee Czechoslovakia.[tpl]en icon[/tpl] Life is Elsewhere pp 260–266, Part Five, Chapter 11. ISBN 978-0-571-14903-2. Kundera has since expressed that “The characters in my novels are my own unrealized possibilities.... The novel is not the author’s confession.”[tpl]en icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|first=Milan|last=Kundera|url=http://www.amazon.com/Unbearable-Lightness-Being-Milan-Kundera/dp/0060932139|title=The Unbearable Lightness of Being[/tpl] page 221, Part Five, Chapter 15. ISBN 978-0-571-13539-4.

The German newspaper Die Welt compared Kundera to Günter Grass, recipient of the 1999 Nobel Prize in Literature, who in 2006 was revealed to have been drafted into the Waffen-SS in the Second World War.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/news/index_view.php?id=338564|title=Kundera's case resembles Grass's – Die Welt|work=ČTK|accessdate=14 October 2008[/tpl] Ivan Klíma wrote in the daily Lidové noviny: "From a reader's perspective it may well be true that if we are disappointed in someone we believed in and admired, our feelings are hurt and our trust is shaken.
