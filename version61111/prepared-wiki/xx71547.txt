The Salafi movement, also known as the Salafi methodology and the Salafist movement, is a movement or sectHave Salafis Taken Over the Muslim World and Muslim Communities, Answered by Shaykh Muhammad ibn Adam al-Kawthari, ... and only recently (in the last 30 years) has the so called Salafi sect come into existence. within Sunni Islam that takes its name from the term salaf ("predecessors", "ancestors") used to identify the earliest Muslims, who, its adherents believe, provide the epitome of Islamic practice.Ghazali And The Poetics Of Imagination, by Ebrahim Moosa ISBN 0-8078-5612-6 – Page 21salafiyya About Atheism/Agnosticism The popular hadith that quotes Muhammad as saying 'The people of my own generation are the best, then those who come after them, and then those of the next generation,' is seen  as a call to Muslims follow the example of  those first three generations, the salaf.[tpl]cite book|last=Lacey|first=Robert|title=Inside the Kingdom, Kings, Clerics, Modernists, Terrorists, and the Struggle for Saudi Arabia|year=2009|publisher=Viking|location=New York|page=9[/tpl]
The movement is often described as related to, including, or synonymous with Wahhabism, but Salafists consider the term "Wahhabi" derogatory.For example, the Ahl-i Hadith which "have been active since the nineteenth century on the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan ... though designated as Wahhabis by their adversaries, ... prefer to call themselves 'Salafis.'" (from The Failure of Political Islam, by Olivier Roy, translated by Carol Volk, Harvard University Press, 1994, pp. 118–9) At other times, Salafism has been deemed a hybrid of Wahhabism and other post-1960s movements.Stephane Lacroix, Al-Albani's Revolutionary Approach to Hadith.

Academics and historians have used the term "Salafism" to denote "a school of thought which surfaced in the second half of the 19th century as a reaction to the spread of European ideas" and "sought to expose the roots of modernity within Muslim civilization."[tpl]cite book |last=Kepel |first=Gilles |title=Jihad: The Trail of Political Islam |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=OLvTNk75hUoC |accessdate=28 January 2014 |year=2006 |publisher=I.B.Tauris |isbn=9781845112578[/tpl]For example: "Salafism originated in the mid to late 19th-century as an intellectual movement at al-Azhar University, led by Muhammad Abduh (1849–1905), Jamal al-Din al-Afghani (1839–1897) and Rashid Rida (1865–1935)." from Understanding the Origins of Wahhabism and Salafism, by Trevor Stanley.

Observers differ over whether Salafi are Sunni Muslims and whether they are Wahhabis. Self-described Salafis believe they are Sunni Muslims, while traditionalist Sunni critics claim that Salafis are the same as Wahhabis, a sect unto their own and different from orthodox (i.e. traditional) Sunni Muslims.Yazid was Never Amirul Muminin, by Sheikh Abdillahi Nassir, published Bilal Muslim Mission of Kenya, 2004; also published Al-Islamd.org Ahlul Bayt Digital Islamic Library Project. Section entitled Wahabis Contradict the Sunnah!  The basis of this claim is that Salafis do not acknowledge or follow any of the four schools of thought (Madhhab) to which other Sunni Muslims adhere. They have their own beliefs and laws, their own leaders and systems, a religion with strict and so-called extremist ways.As-Sunnah Foundation of America, Wahhabism: Understanding the Roots and Role Models of Islamic Extremism, by Zubair QamarGlobalSecurity.org Wahhabi.Masud.co.uk, Al-Albani Unveiled, Some Observations about the Salafi/Wahhabi sect

==Etymology==

The popular hadith that quotes Muhammad as saying 'The people of my own generation are the best, then those who come after them, and then those of the next generation,' is seen as a call to Muslims to follow the example of those first three generations, known collectively as the salaf or "pious Predecessors" (as-Salaf as-Saleh).[tpl]cite web |url=http://muttaqun.com/salafiyyah.html |title=Dawat-us-Salafiyyah ("Call of those who preceded us") |publisher=Muttaqun.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-18[/tpl] They include the "Companions" (Sahabah), the "Followers" (Tabi‘un) and the "Followers of the Followers" (Tabi‘ al-Tabi‘in).  There a number of records of the hadith[tpl]cite web |url=http://al-ibaanah.com/articles.php?ArtID=97 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080304023423/http://al-ibaanah.com/articles.php?ArtID=97 |archivedate=2008-03-04 |title=Why the Word Salafee? |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=2010-04-18[/tpl] it is narrated in the Sahih al-Bukhari of `Abd Allah ibn `Umar (a companion of Muhammad)[tpl]hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|8|76|437[/tpl]

==Tenets==

According to at least one scholar,  "temporal proximity to the Prophet Muhammad is associated with the truest form of Islam" among many Sunni MuslimsBernard Haykel, a professor of Near Eastern Studies, states that "a strongly held view" among Sunnis[tpl]cite book |last=Haykel |first=Bernard |editor-first=Roel |editor-last=Meijer |title=Global Salafism: Islam's New Religious Movement |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=2009 |pages=34 |chapter=Chapter 1: On the Nature of Salafi Thought and Action |isbn=978-0-231-15420-8[/tpl]
The terms Salafi, Ahl-as-Sunnah ("People of the Sunnah") and Ahl al-Hadith ("People of the Tradition") are all considered[tpl]by whom|date=October 2013[/tpl] to bear the same or similar connotation and Muslim scholars have used them interchangeably[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl] throughout the ages. Ahl al-Hadeeth is possibly the oldest recorded term for these earliest adherents,[tpl]big|شرف أصحاب الحديث[/tpl] ("The Noble Status of the People of Hadeeth"), al-Khateeb al-Baghdaadi. while Ahl as-Sunnah is overwhelmingly used by Muslim scholars, including Salafi scholars, such as the Ash'ari sect, leading to a narrower use of the term "Salafi".[tpl]cite web |url=http://islameye.com/%D8%AD%D9%83%D9%85-%D9%82%D9%88%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%A7-%D8%B3%D9%84%D9%81%D9%89-%D9%84%D9%84%D8%B4%D9%89%D8%AE-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%89-t4699s150.html |title= حكم قول انا سلفي ("The Ruling On Saying "I am Salafi"", Shaikh al-Albani) |publisher=islameye.com |date= |accessdate=10/12/2010[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=March 2013[/tpl]
Salafis view the Salaf as an eternal model for all succeeding Muslim generations in their beliefs, exegesis, method of worship, mannerisms, morality, piety and conduct: the Islam they practiced is seen as pure, unadulterated and, therefore, the ultimate authority for the interpretation of the Sunnah.Sharh Usool I'tiqaad Ahl as-Sunnah wal-Jama'ah, al-Laalika'ee, tahqeeq of Nash'at Kamaal Misree, 1/7-9 This is not interpreted as an imitation of cultural norms or trends that are not part of the legislated worship of Islam but rather as an adherence to Islamic theology.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl] Salafis reject speculative philosophy (kalam) that involves discourse and debate in the development of the Islamic creed.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl] They consider this process a foreign import from Greek philosophy, alien to the original practice of Islam.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl] The Imam Al-Dhahabi (died 748H[tpl]\[/tpl]1348) said:
Salafis believe that the Qur'an, the Hadith and the consensus (ijma) of approved scholarship (ulama) along with the understanding of the Salaf us-salih as being sufficient guidance for the Muslim. As the Salafi da'wa is a methodology and not a madh'hab in fiqh (jurisprudence) as commonly misunderstood, Salafis can come from the Maliki, Shafi'i, Hanbali or the Hanafi schools of Sunni fiqhGlobalSecurity.org Salafi Islam and accept teaching of all four if supported by clear and authenticated evidence from the Sunnah. In the face of clear evidence, be it from Qur'an or Hadeeth, they support scholars' engagement in ijtihad[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]if they are qualified[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]as opposed to total blind imitation (taqlid). Their theological views are based on the Athari creed as opposed to kalam, dialectics or any form of philosophy deemed speculative.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]
Salafis condemn certain common practices as polytheism (shirk) and tawassul of religious figures, such as venerating the graves of Islamic prophets and saints or using amulets to seek protection.http://dunyanews.tv/index.php/en/pv/Hasb-e-Haal/3/ep-9906/ALL/2013-09-13 They maintain that such practices are bid‘ah (heretical innovations) that are not permissible and should not be taught or practiced.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl] Salafis believe that Islam declined after the early generations because of religious innovations and an abandoning of what they consider to be pure Islamic teachings; and that an Islamic revival will only result through emulation of early generations of Muslims and purging of foreign influences.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]
Salafis place great emphasis on following acts in accordance with the known sunnah, not only in prayer but in every activity in daily life. For instance, many are careful always to use three fingers when eating, drink water in three pauses with the right hand while sitting,Six Points of Tabligh, the chapter on "Desired Manners of Eating and Drinking" includes 26 norms on the etiquette of eating and drinking. From: Globalized Islam : the Search for a New Ummah, by Olivier Roy, Columbia University Press, 2004. and make sure their jellabiya or other garment does not extend below the ankle, thereby following the example recorded by Muhammad and his companions.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]

===Views on Taqlid (scholarly authority)===

In legal matters, Salafis are divided between those who, in the name of independent legal judgement (ijtihad), reject strict adherence (taqlid) to the four schools of law (madhahib) and others who remain faithful to these.The Princeton Encyclopedia of Islamic Political Thought, p 484 Salafi scholars from Saudi Arabia are generally bound by Hanbali fiqh and advocate following an Imam rather than understanding scripture oneself.Stephane Lacroix, George Holoch, Awakening Islam, p 84 These include Bin Baz, Salih al-Uthaymeen, Salih al-Fawzaan, Saud bin Shuraim and al-Sudais .[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl] Other Salafi scholars however hold that taqlid is unlawful since from their perspective, following a madhab without searching for direct evidence leads Muslims astray.Miriam Cooke, Bruce B. Lawrence, Muslim Networks from Hajj to Hip Hop, p 213 These scholars include Rashid Rida,Thus he Rida opposed Taqlid and called for and practiced absolute ijtihad. Clinton Bennett, The Bloomsbury Companion to Islamic Studies, p.174. See also, Richard Gauvain, Salafi Ritual Purity: In the Presence of God, Introduction, p9 al-Khajnadee, Muhammad Abduh,Abduh's statement of purpose was: To liberate thought from the shackles of Taqlid and understand religion as it was understood by the Salaf. Clinton Bennett, The Bloomsbury Companion to Islamic Studies, p.168. Saleem al-Hilali and Nasir al-Din al-Albani.From there he Albani learned to oppose taqlid in a madhab. Clinton Bennett, The Bloomsbury Companion to Islamic Studies, p.174. Al-Albani had denounced Wahhabi attachment to the Hanbali school. Stephane Lacroix, George Holoch, Awakening Islam, p 85
At the very end of the spectrum, some Salafis hold taqlid to be an act of polytheism.For many Salafis, both modernist and conservative, "worship" of created beings includes practicing taqlid within a madhab of fiqh. Clinton Bennett, The Bloomsbury Companion to Islamic Studies, p.165

===Opposition to the use of kalam===

Salafi scholars are in staunch opposition to the use of kalam, dialectics or speculative philosophy in theology. This is because it is seen as a heretical innovation in Islam which opposes the primordial aspiration to follow the original methodology of the Salaf us-salih with regards to Aqidah. Statements of the early Imams of the early Muslims are in corroboration with this such as Abu Hanifa who prohibited his students from engaging in kalam, stating that those who practice it are of the "regressing ones".al-Makkee, Manaaqib Abee Haneefah, pg. 183–184 Malik ibn Anas referred to kalam in the Islamic religion as being "detested",Dhammul-Kalaam (B/194) and that whoever "seeks the religion through kalam will deviate".Dhammul-Kalaam (Q/173/A) In addition, Shafi'i said that no knowledge of Islam can be gained from books of kalam, as kalam "is not from knowledge"Dhammul-Kalaam (Q/213)Dhahabi, as-Siyar (10/30) and that "It is better for a man to spend his whole life doing whatever Allah has prohibited[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]besides shirk with Allah[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]rather than spending his whole life involved in kalam."Ibn Abi Hatim, Manaaqibush-Shaafi'ee, pg. 182 Ahmad ibn Hanbal also spoke strongly against kalam, stating his view that no-one looks into kalam unless there is "corruption in his heart"Jaami' Bayaanul-'Ilm wa Fadlihi (2/95) and even went so far as to prohibit sitting with people practicing kalam even if they were defending the Sunnah,Manaqib al-Imam Ahmad (or Manaaqibul-Imaam Ahmad), by Abu'l-Faraj ibn al-Jawzi, p205. and instructing his students to warn against any person they saw practicing kalam.Ibn Battah, al-Ibaanah (2/540)

==History==

Landmarks claimed in the history of Salafi da'wah are Ahmad ibn Hanbal (died 240 AH[tpl]\[/tpl]855 AD), known among Salafis as Imam Ahl al-Sunnah and one of the three scholars commonly titled with the honorific Sheikh ul-Islam, namely, Taqi ad-Deen Ibn Taymiyyah (died 728 AH[tpl]\[/tpl]1328 AD) and Ibn al-Qayyim (died 751 AH[tpl]\[/tpl]1350).[tpl]big|التجديد بمفهومية[/tpl] ("Renewal and its Understanding"), Shaikh Muhammad Aman al-Jaamee, Part 1.[tpl]big|صور من الجاهليات المعاصرة[/tpl] ("Glimpses From the Modern Jahiliyyah"), Shaikh Muhammad Amaan al-Jaamee.[tpl]big|سلسلة مفهوم السلفية[/tpl] ("Understanding Salafiyyah"), Shaikh Muhammad Naasir ad-Deen al-Albaani, Parts 1–2, 6.

===Early examples of usage===

===Muhammad ibn Abd-al-Wahhab===

Many today consider Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab as the first figure in the modern era to push for a return to the religious practices of the salaf as-salih.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.salafipublications.com/sps/sp.cfm?subsecID=SLF02&articleID=SLF020001&articlePages=1 |title=The Principles of Salafiyyah |publisher=Salafipublications.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-18[/tpl] His evangelizing in the Arabian Peninsula during the 18th century was a call to return to the practices of the early Muslims. His works, especially Kitab at-Tawhid, are still widely read by Salafis around the world today and the majority of Salafi scholars still cite them frequently.Shaikh Muhammad Ibn Abdul-Wahhab: His Salafi Creed, Reformist Movement and Scholars' Praise of Him, 4th ed. by Judge Ahmad Ibn 'Hajar Ibn Muhammad al-Butami al-Bin Ali, Ad-Dar as-Salafiyyah, Kuwait, 1983, p.108-164 After his death, his views flourished under his descendants (the Al ash-Sheikh) and the generous financing of the House of Saud, initiating the current worldwide Salafi movement.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2011[/tpl]
The vast majority of Salafis reject the label "Wahhabi" because they consider it unfounded and an object of controversy,The Wahhabi Myth, H.J.Oliver holding that Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab did not establish a new school of thought but restored the Islam practiced by the earliest generations of Muslims.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2011[/tpl] Followers of Salafiyyah consider it wrong to be called "Wahhabis" as the 17th Name of God is al-Wahhab ("the Bestower"), so to be called a "Wahhabi" denotes the following of a person other than what is meant to be followed in the Qur'an and Sunnah.Laurent Bonnefoy, Salafism in Yemen. Transnationalism and Religious Identity, Columbia University Press/Hurst, 2011, ISBN 978-1-84904-131-7, page 245. Wahhabism has been called a "belittling" and derogatory term for Salafi,What is a Salafi and What is Salafism? while another source defines it as "a particular orientation within Salafism," an orientation some consider strongly apolitical,[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/04/AR2006090401107_2.html |title=Washington Post, For Conservative Muslims, Goal of Isolation a Challenge |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=2007-01-15 |accessdate=2010-04-18 |first=Caryle |last=Murphy[/tpl]John L. Esposito, What Everyone Needs to Know About Islam, p.50 and yet another describes it as a formerly separate current of Islamic thought that appropriated "language and symbolism of Salafism" until the two became "practically indistinguishable" in the 1970s.Abou El Fadl, Khaled M., The Great Theft, HarperSanFrancisco, 2005, p.79  Critics of Wahhabiyya, Hamid Algar and Khaled Abou El Fadl, argue that while the two interpretations had distinct differences, they effectively merged in the 1970s and early 1980s when Saudi oil-export funding "co-opted" Salafism, and "melded" their ideologies.[tpl]cite web|last=Dillon|first=Michael R.|title=WAHHABISM: IS IT  A FACTOR IN THE SPREAD OF GLOBAL TERRORISM?| url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a509109.pdf|work=September  2009|publisher=Naval Post-Graduate School|accessdate=2 April 2014|pages=3–4|quote=Hamid Algar ... emphasizes the strong influence of the Saudi  petrodollar in the propagation of Wahhabism, but also attributes the  political situation of the Arab world at the time as a contributing factor  that led to the co-opting of Salafism. ...Khaled Abou El Fadl, ...  expresses the opinion that Wahhabism would not have been able to spread in  the modern Muslim world ... it would have to be spread under the banner of  Salafism.8 This attachment of Wahhabism to Salafism was needed as Salafism  was a much more “credible paradigm in Islam;” making it an ideal medium for  Wahhabism. ... The co-opting of Salafism by Wahhabism was not completed  until the 1970s when the Wahhabis stripped away some of their extreme  intolerance and co-opted the symbolism and language of Salafism; making  them practically indistinguishable.[/tpl]
Trevor Stanley states that while the origins of the terms Wahhabism and Salafism "were quite distinct"[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]"Wahhabism was a pared-down Islam that rejected modern influences, while Salafism sought to reconcile Islam with modernism"[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]they both shared a rejection of "traditional" teachings on Islam in favor of a direct, more puritan interpretation. Stéphane Lacroix, a fellow and lecturer at Sciences Po in Paris, also affirmed a distinction between the two: "As opposed to Wahhabism, Salafism refers here to all the hybridations that have taken place since the 1960s between the teachings of Muhammad bin ‘Abd al-Wahhab and other Islamic schools of thought. Al-Albani’s discourse can therefore be a form of Salafism, while being critical of Wahhabism."
The migration of Muslim Brotherhood members from Egypt to Saudi Arabia and Saudi King Faisal's "embrace of Salafi pan-Islamism resulted in cross-pollination between Muhammad ibn Abd-al-Wahhab's teachings on tawhid, shirk and bid‘ah and Salafi interpretations of the sayings of Muhammad.[tpl]cite web |last=Stanley |first=Trevor |url=http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&tx_ttnews%5Bswords%5D=8fd5893941d69d0be3f378576261ae3e&tx_ttnews%5Bany_of_the_words%5D=%20Trevor%20Stanley%20&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=528&tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=7&cHash=a5ad45ee77 |title=Understanding the Origins of Wahhabism and Salafism by Trevor Stanley |publisher=Jamestown.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-18[/tpl]

===Contemporary Salafism===

Salafism is attractive to its adherents because it underscores Islam's universality.Daniel Benjamin and Steven Simon, The Next Attack, page 55. ISBN 0-8050-7941-6. It insists on affirmation of the literal truth as understood by its apparent meaning of Qur'anic scripture and Hadeeth, yet may challenge secularism by appropriating secularism's traditional role of defending the socially and politically weak against the powerful.Hassan Hanafi, Brief History of Islam, pp. 258–259. ISBN 1-4051-0900-9.

==Views on extremism==

In recent years, Salafi methodology has come to be associated with the jihad of extremist groups and related groups that advocate the killing of innocent civilians. While some terrorists claim to be Salafi, these acts have consistently been strongly opposed by some Salafi scholars such as Muhammad Nasiruddin al-Albani, Muhammad ibn al Uthaymeen and Abd al-Aziz ibn Abd Allah ibn Baaz who have all issued fatawa (religious verdicts) forbidding suicide bombing, declaring it as being totally haram (forbidden).Shaykh Salih Al Suhaymee's fatwa against suicide bombings at islamagainstextremism.com., Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia, Shaykh Abdul Aziz Aal Al Shaykh's fatwa against suicide bombing at islamagainstextremism.com.Shaykh Al Albaani's fatwa on suicide bombings (audio with English translation) at islamagainstextremism.com.Shaykh Ubayd Al Jaabiree refuting suicide bombings and Anwar Al Awlaki at islamagainstextremism.com.  The Saudi scholar, Muhammad ibn al Uthaymeen considered suicide bombing to be unlawful Gabriel G. Tabarani, Jihad's New Heartlands: Why the West Has Failed to Contain Islamic Fundamentalism, p 26.Richard Gauvain, Salafi Ritual Purity: In the Presence of God, p 331 and the scholar Abdul Muhsin al-Abbad wrote a treatise entitled: According to which intellect and Religion is Suicide bombings and destruction considered Jihad?.Gabriel G. Tabarani, Jihad's New Heartlands: Why the West Has Failed to Contain Islamic Fundamentalism, p 26. Muhammad Nasiruddin al-Albani stated that "History repeats itself. Everybody claims that the Prophet is their role model. Our Prophet spent the first half of his message making da’wa, and he did not start it with jihad".Quintan Wiktorowicz, Anatomy of the Salafi Movement, p217.
Nevertheless a few Salafi scholars appear to support extremism and acts of violence. The Egyptian Salafi cleric Mahmoud Shaaban "appeared on a religious television channel calling for the deaths of main opposition figures Mohammed ElBaradei – a Nobel peace prize laureate – and former presidential candidate Hamdeen Sabahy."The Observer, Violent tide of Salafism threatens the Arab spring, by Peter Beaumont and Patrick Kingsley, 10 February 2013.Reuters, Egypt orders cleric held over ElBaradei death call, by Marwa Awad, edited by Paul Taylor and Jon Hemming, 11 February 2013.  The popular salafi preacher Zakir Naik speaking of Osama bin Laden, said that he would not criticise bin Laden because he had not met him and did not know him personally. He added that, "If bin Laden is fighting enemies of Islam, I am for him," and that "If he is terrorizing America – the terrorist, biggest terrorist – I am with him. Every Muslim should be a terrorist. The thing is that if he is terrorizing the terrorist, he is following Islam. Whether he is or not, I don’t know, but you as Muslims know that, without checking up, laying allegations is also wrong."Von Drehle, David; Ghosh, Bobby: "An Enemy Within: The Making of Najibullah Zazi". Time. p. 2. 1 October 2009. Retrieved 16 April 2011.
Some other Islamic groups, particularly some Sufis, have also complained about extremism among some Salafi. It has been noted that the Western association of Salafi ideology with violence stems from writings "through the prism of security studies" that were published in the late 20th century ands that continue to persist.[tpl]cite book|last=Meijer|first=Roel|editor-first=Roel|editor-last=Meijer|title=Global Salafism: Islam's New Religious Movement|publisher=Columbia University Presss|year=2009|pages=34|chapter=Introduction|isbn=978-0-231-15420-8[/tpl]

==Trends sometimes associated with Salafism==

According to at least one observer,Natana J. DeLong-Bas, in Wahhabi Islam: From Revival and Reform to Global Jihad, Salafism can be divided into three trends, one focusing on education and missionary work to solidify the tawhid prior to any political movement (sometimes called Madkhalism); another focusing on re-establishing a caliphate through the means of evolution, but not violence (sometimes called Salafist activism); and a third sharing similar political goals as the second group, but engaging in violent Jihad (sometimes called Salafi jihadism and/or Qutbism).()[tpl]cite web|author= Michael R.

"Purists" are Salafists who focus on non-violent da'wah, education, and "purification of religious beliefs and practices". They dismiss politics as "a diversion or even innovation that leads people away from Islam".Whatever Happened to the Islamists? edited by Olivier Roy and Amel Boubekeur, Columbia University Press, 2012.
Madkhalism is a term typically referring to the strain of Salafists viewed as supportive of authoritarian regimes in the Middle East.Richard Gauvain, Salafi Ritual Purity: In the Presence of God, pg. 41. New York: Routledge, 2013.Roel Meijer, Global Salafism: Islam's New Religious Movement, pg. 49. New York: Columbia University Press, 2009.George Joffé, Islamist Radicalisation in Europe and the Middle East: Reassessing the Causes of Terrorism, pg. 317. London: I.B. Tauris, 2013. Taking its name from the controversial Saudi Arabian cleric Rabee Al-Madkhali, the movement lost its support in Saudi Arabia proper when several members of the Permanent Committee (the country's clerical body) denounced Madkhali personally.The Transmission and Dynamics of the Textual Sources of Islam: Essays in Honour of Harald Motzki, eds. Nicolet Boekhoff-van der Voort, Kees Versteegh and Joas Wagemakers, pg. 382. Leiden: Brill Publishers, 2011. Influence of both the movement and its figureheads have waned so much within the Muslim world that analysts have declared it to be a largely European phenomenon.

===Salafist activism===

It has sometimes been described as a third strain of the global movement, being different from the Salafist Jihadists by eschewing violence and from the Salafist Madkhalists by engaging in modern political processes.Meijer, pg. 48. Due to numerical superiority, the movement has been referred to the mainstream of the Salafist movement at times. This trend, sometimes called "politicos", see politics as "yet another field in which the Salafi creed has to be applied" in order to safeguard justice and "guarantee that the political rule is based upon the Shari'a".

===Salafist jihadism===

"Salafi Jihadism" was a term coined by Gilles KepelThe Salafist movement by Bruce LiveseyComing to Terms: Fundamentalists or Islamists?, Martin Kramer, Middle East Quarterly, Spring 2003, pp. 65–77. to describe those self-claiming Salafi groups who began developing an interest in jihad during the mid-1990s. Practitioners are often referred to as "Salafi jihadis" or "Salafi jihadists". Journalist Bruce Livesey estimates Salafi jihadists constitute less than 0.5 percent of the world's 1.9 billion Muslims (i.e., less than 10 million). However, those who take their actions beyond the limits of the shari'ah (such as terrorist attacks against civilians) are seen as deviant and not true Salafis.
Another definition of Salafi jihadism, offered by Mohammed M. Hafez, is an "extreme form of Sunni Islamism that rejects democracy and Shia rule." Hafez distinguished them from apolitical and conservative Salafi scholars (such as Muhammad Nasiruddin al-Albani, Muhammad ibn al Uthaymeen, Abd al-Aziz ibn Abd Allah ibn Baaz and Abdul-Azeez ibn Abdullaah Aal ash-Shaikh), but also from the sahwa movement associated with Salman al-Ouda or Safar Al-Hawali.Suicide Bombers in Iraq By Mohammed M. Hafez
An analysis of the Caucasus Emirate, a Salafi jihadist group was made in 2014 by Darion Rhodes.Darion Rhodes, Salafist-Takfiri Jihadism: the Ideology of the Caucasus Emirate, International Institute for Counter-terrorism, March 2014 It analyzes the group's strict observance of tawhid and its rejection of shirk, taqlid, ijtihad, and bid'ah, while believing that jihad is the only way to advance the cause of Allah on the earth.

===Qutbism===

Qutbism is a movement which has, at times, been described both as a strain of Salafism and an opposing movement, providing the foil to Madkhalism in that the movement is typically found in radical opposition to the ruling regimes of the Middle East. Qutbism has, at times, been associated with the above mentioned Salafist Jihadist trend.
Despite some similarities, the different contemporary self-proclaimed Salafist groups often strongly disapprove of one another and deny the other's Islamic character.Abou El Fadl, Khaled, The Great Theft Harper San Francisco, 2005, p.62-8

===Comparison with other movements===

Some Salafi Muslims often preach disengagement from Western activities, and advocate being apolitical and being against any form of extremism, "even by giving them an Islamic slant."Globalized Islam :the Search for a New Ummah, by Olivier Roy, Columbia University Press, 2004 (p.245) Instead, it is thought that Muslims should stick to traditional activities, particularly Dawah. Nevertheless, Salafis do not preach willful ignorance of civil or state law.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl] While preaching that the Sharia takes precedence, Salafi Muslims conform to civil or state law as far as they are required, for example in purchasing mandatory auto insurance.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]

===Arab Spring===

Salafi have been notable following insurrections in Egypt, Tunisia and Libya. In the 2011–12 Egypt parliamentary elections, the Islamist Bloc led by the Al-Nour Party managed to receive 27.8% of the vote despite only "a few months of party politicking experience", gaining 127 of the 498 parliamentary seats contested and forming the second-largest bloc in the parliament.Salafis and Sufis in Egypt, Jonathan Brown, Carnegie Paper, December 2011. According to Ammar Ali Hassan of al-Ahram, while Salafis and the Muslim Brotherhood agree on many issues such as the need to "Islamize" society and restricting private property rights by legally requiring all Muslims to give alms, the former has nevertheless rejected the flexibility of the latter on the issue of whether women and Christians should be entitled to serve in high office, as well as its relatively tolerant attitude towards Shia Iran.[tpl]cite web|last=Hassan|first=Ammar Ali|title=Muslim Brothers and Salafis|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/News/502/32/Muslim%20Brothers%20and%20Salafis.aspx|work=06-12-2012|publisher=Al Ahram|accessdate=19 May 2013[/tpl]

==Criticism==

Salafism has been recently criticized by Professor Khaled Abou El Fadl of the UCLA School of Law. El Fadl argues that the Salafi methodology "drifted into stifling apologetics" by the mid-20th century, a reaction against "anxiety" to "render Islam compatible with modernity," by its leaders earlier in the century.Abou El Fadl, Khaled, The Great Theft, Harper San Francisco, 2005, p. 77 He attacks those who state "any meritorious or worthwhile modern institutions were first invented and realized by Muslims". He argues the result was that "an artificial sense of confidence and an intellectual lethargy" developed, according to Abou El Fadl, "that took neither the Islamic tradition nor" the challenges of the modern world "very seriously."Abou El Fadl, pp. 52–56, 78–9
According to the As-Sunnah Foundation of America, the Salafi and Wahhabi movements are strongly opposed by a long list of Sunni scholars.As-Sunnah Foundation of America, Wahhabism: Understanding the Roots and Role Models of Islamic Extremism by Zubair Qamar. This article lists 65 Sunni scholars from different time periods, whom the article claims were opposed to either the Salafi or the Wahhabi movements. The article claims that the Wahhabi movement is the same thing as the Salafi movement. The Saudi government has been criticised for damaging Islamic heritage of thousands of years in Saudi Arabia.The Independent, The photos Saudi Arabia doesn't want seen – and proof Islam's most holy relics are being demolished in Mecca , by Jerome Taylor, 15 March 2013. The article says that the Saudis are dismantling some old parts the Grand Mosque at Mecca, as part of work to make the mosque larger, and that the sites of other very old buildings in Mecca and Medina have been redevloped over the past twenty years. The article claims that many senior Wahhabis believe that preserving historic relics for their own sake is undesirable because it encourages idolatry (shirq).[tpl]YouTube|vpy5x7Nchck|Saudi's Destruction Of The Islamic Heritage, by AhleSunnaTV[/tpl]. Though Salafis when told about this were as opposed to it as other Muslims.The Independent, Why don't more Muslims speak out against the wanton destruction of Mecca's holy sites?, by Jerome Taylor, 28 October 2012. The Salafi movement has been linked by Marc Sageman to some terrorists group around the world.Third public hearing of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, Statement of Marc Sageman to the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, 9 July 2003

===Salafism in China===

Salafism is intensely opposed by a number of Hui Muslims in China and by the Gedimu, Sufi Khafiya and Jahriyya, to the extent that even the fundamentalist Yihewani (Ikhwan) Chinese sect, founded by Ma Wanfu after Salafi inspiration, condemned Ma Debao and Ma Zhengqing as heretics when they attempted to introduce Salafism as the main form of Islam. Ma Debao established a Salafi school, called the Sailaifengye (Salafi) menhuan in Lanzhou and Linxia. It is completely separate from other Muslim sects in China.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=hUEswLE4SWUC&pg=PA72&dq=ma+anliang&q=wahhabism%20ma%20debao|title=China's Muslim Hui community: migration, settlement and sects|author=Michael Dillon|year=1999|publisher=Curzon Press|location=Richmond|page=208|isbn=978-0-7007-1026-3|accessdate=2010-06-28[/tpl] Muslim Hui avoid Salafis, even if they are family members.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=b21aKLh6_KkC&pg=PA79&dq=gedimu+ikhwan#v=onepage&q=gedimu%20ikhwan&f=false|title=Between Mecca and Beijing: modernization and consumption among urban Chinese Muslims|author=Maris Boyd Gillette|year=2000|publisher=Stanford University Press|page=279|isbn=0-8047-3694-4|accessdate=2010-06-28[/tpl] The number of Salafis in China are not included on percentage lists of Muslim sects in China.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=imw_KFD5bsQC&pg=PA458&dq=gedimu+ikhwan#v=onepage&q=kubrawiyya%20percent%20gedimu%20hui%20ma%20tong&f=false|title=The Oxford History of Islam|author=John L.

They were not allowed to move or worship openly. The Yihewani had become secular and Chinese nationalists; they considered the Salafiyya to be "heterodox" (xie jiao) and people who followed foreigners' teachings (waidao). After the Communists took power, Salafis were allowed to worship openly again.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=wEih57-GWQQC&pg=PA79&dq=ma+bufang+secret+war#v=onepage&q=ma%20bufang%20secret%20war&f=false|title=Guide to Islamist Movements|author=BARRY RUBIN|year=2000|publisher=M.E.
