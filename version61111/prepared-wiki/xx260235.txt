The 2014 Winter Olympics and Paralympics venues are divided between two "clusters" located in and around Sochi, Russia

==Venues==

===Coastal Cluster===

Located in the Adler City District of Sochi, Imeretinsky Valley, on the Black Sea, the Olympic Park houses the main Olympic Stadium used for the Games' ceremonies, and venues for indoor sports such as hockey, figure skating, curling, and speed skating. It also houses training facilities, the Olympic Village, the international broadcasting centre, and other amenities. The park is designed so that all of the venues are accessible within walking distance of each other. The venues are situated around a water basin containing a fountain known as "The Waters of the Olympic Park"; designed by California-based WET (which also designed the cauldron for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City), the fountain measures 5.3 meters in diameter with a capacity of about 700,000 gallons of water, featuring more than 250 nozzles and jet systems that can create fog and choreographed water displays set to music.[tpl]cite news |last= Madler|first= Mark|date= February 24, 2014|title= WET Design Runs Rings Around Rivals|url= http://sfvbj.com/accounts/login/?next=/news/2014/feb/24/wet-design-runs-rings-around-rivals/|newspaper= San Fernando Business Journal|location= Los Angles, California|publisher= California Business Journals|accessdate= February 26, 2014[/tpl][tpl]Cite web |url= http://www.gizmag.com/sochi-olympic-fountains/30934/ |publisher= Gizmag|title= California-based WET makes the waters dance at Sochi |accessdate=February 26, 2013[/tpl]
The Olympic Village is built in the Olympic Park, on the shores of the Black Sea. It was built by Basic Element. It consists of 47 buildings and is designed for three thousand people. Athletes, journalists and members of the Olympic family will live there. After the competition, the Olympic Village will be an off-season resort complex Sochnoye or "Juicy".

==Updates==

Environmental protection measures are being used in venue construction. These include being climate-neutral, games in harmony with nature, zero waste, and raising environmental awareness in preparing and hosting the 2014 Games. The 100th environmental protection measure was completed in October 2010."Volunteers mark Sochi2014's 100th environmental protection measure.

A European Ski competition will take place in early 2011 while a World cup event will take place in 2012."Olympic Slopes Ready for Sochi Games."

==Tentative post-Olympic usage==

The Olympic venues were to be used for the 40th G8 summit[tpl]cite web|title=Russia to hold 2014 G8 summit in Sochi: Putin|url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail/2013/06/19/309829/russia-to-host-2014-g8-summit/[/tpl]  but this was cancelled when Russia was suspended from G8 because of its military intervention in Ukraine. The leaders of the remaining G7 member countries are going to meet in Bruxelles instead.
In October 2010, it was announced that the area around the Coastal Cluster will be used as part of a Formula 1 racing circuit that will hold its first race in 2014. The main concern is in regards to the event's 2014 timing so that it does not conflict with the 2014 Games that will take 7â€“23 February of this year.
On 2 December 2010, FIFA (International Federation of Association Football) awarded their 2018 World Cup to Russia. Among the venues to be used will be Central Stadium (known as Sochi Olympic Stadium in Russia's bid package to FIFA), which will be expanded to seat 47,659 after the Games.
