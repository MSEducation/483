The Rollercoaster Tour was a 1992 co-headlining concert tour by the English Britpop band Blur, the American indie rock band Dinosaur Jr., the Irish alternative rock band My Bloody Valentine and the Scottish noise pop band The Jesus and Mary Chain.[tpl]sfn|Brook|Buckley|2003|p=710[/tpl] A one-leg, 11-date tour of the United Kingdom, the tour was in support of all four bands' current releases: Blur's debut album Leisure (1991), Dinosaur Jr.[tpl]'[/tpl]s fourth album Green Mind (1991), My Bloody Valentine's second album Loveless (1991) and The Jesus and Mary Chain's fourth album Honey's Dead (1992).
The tour was curated by The Jesus and Mary Chain vocalist Jim Reid, who "wanted to break the routine" of performing in small, frequently played venues—such as Nottingham[tpl]'[/tpl]s Rock City—and "cater to all strands of independent rock music".[tpl]cite journal|last=Perry|first=Andrew|date=April 2013|title=Eyewitness – The Rollercoaster Tour, 1992, Part 1: Like Minds United|journal=Mojo|publisher=Bauer Media Group|issue=233|page=29–30[/tpl] Reid was inspired by, and considered the Rollercoaster Tour a British equivalent to, the North American festival Lollapalooza,[tpl]cite web|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/11432-dinosaur-jr-live-review|title=News | Live Report: Dinosaur Jr.|work=The Quietus|last=Morris|first=Damien|date=19 February 2013|accessdate=8 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/p6n8|title=Music – Review of The Jesus and Mary Chain: Live in Concert|work=BBC Music|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|last=Hawkes|first=Deborah|year=2003|accessdate=8 August 2013[/tpl] which The Jesus and Mary Chain performed at in 1991 and which he considered "fairly disastrous". Each band performed a 45-minute set with no encore and the line-up changed each night of the tour, although The Jesus and Mary Chain performed as the final act on all 11 dates.[tpl]cite AV media|year=1992|title=The Rollercoaster Tour, 1992|medium=TV|publisher=Beat UK (ITV)|location=London|date=September 1992[/tpl]

Whose was the best film show? And then there was, who could be most off their tits and still play a show?" The Rollercoaster EP, containing material from Blur, My Bloody Valentine, Dinosaur Jr. and The Jesus and Mary Chain, was issued in Melody Maker in March 1992 to promote the tour.[tpl]sfn|Strong|2002|p=292[/tpl]
