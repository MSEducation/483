[[Pholiotina]]

CATEGORIES: Bolbitiaceae

Pholiotina is a genus of small agaric fungi. It was circumscribed by Swiss mycologist Victor Fayod in 1889.

==Taxonomic details==

The genus Pholiotina is defined as small thin Mycena-like mushrooms,  with an hymenoderm pileipellis, a dry cap surface, cystidia that are  sub-capitate to blunt, and spores which are rusty brown in deposit.  Spores of mushrooms of this genus are thick walled, smooth and have a germ pore.
Some authors consider Pholiotina part of the genus Conocybe. The two genera can be distinguished microscopically: Pholiotina contains a differentiated central zone called a mediostratum that is lacking in Conocybe. Additionally, Pholiotina species have cystidia with rounded to tapered tips, compared to the enlarged, globular cystidial tips of Conocybe.
In a 2007 publication, Hausknecht and Krisai-Greilhuber devised an infrageneric classification that includes the sections Piliferae and Vestitae, and the series Aeruginosa, Aporos, Appendiculata, Brunnea, Coprophila, Filipes, Keniensis, Mairei, Pygmaeoaffinis, Resinosocystidiata, Sulcata, Teneroides, Utriformis, and Vexans.

==Species==

Pholiotina rugosa is the most commonly known species of this genus, although
in most field guides this species is known as Conocybe filaris, which is a
taxonomic equivalent.
