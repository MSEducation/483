Flaunt It is the debut album by British band Sigue Sigue Sputnik. The album featured a remix of their #3 UK hit singleSIGUE SIGUE SPUTNIK - The Official Charts Company "Love Missile F1-11", as well as "21st Century Boy". Flaunt It was unique in that the band sold off spots between songs for advertisements. Ultimately, ads for L'Oréal, i-D magazine, the short-lived London pirate television station NeTWork 21, and London's Kensington Market clothing shop Pure Sex were complemented by fictitious ads for the Sputnik Corporation and the (unreleased) Sigue Sigue Sputnik Computer Game;[tpl]cite web| title=Sigue Sigue Sputnik | 1986 Unknown | Games That Weren't | GTW64 - home of unreleased Commodore 64 games| url=http://www.gamesthatwerent.com/gtw64/sigue-sigue-sputnik/ |accessdate=2013-01-15[/tpl] a spoken word advertisement (narrated by the Sputnik Corporation voiceover) for EMI closes the album.
