[[50 metre running target mixed]]

CATEGORIES: ISSF shooting events, Rifle shooting sports

50 metre running target mixed is an ISSF shooting event, shot with a .22-calibre rifle at a target depicting a boar moving sideways across a 10 metre wide opening. A part of the ISSF World Shooting Championships since 1970, it differs from 50 metre running target in that the slow runs (target visible for 5 seconds) and the fast runs (target visible for 2.5 seconds) are randomized so the shooter does not know in advance which speed to expect.
