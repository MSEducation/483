==Background==

On his fourth studio album 808's & Heartbreak and in the song "Heartless" Kanye West utilized the voice audio processor device known as Auto-Tune. West had previously experimented with the technology on his debut album The College Dropout for the background vocals of "Jesus Walks and "Never Let Me Down." The voice altering device created a unique sound helping West express his then feelings of his break up with fiancée Alexis Phifer months after the timeless passing of his mother.
The song was performed for the first time in Denver, Colorado.Kanye performing Heartless live  The song was also performed at a T.I. concert at Key Club in Los Angeles.[tpl]Cite news |last=Smith |first=Camilo |url=http://archive.is/RJz2J |work=L.A.

===Music video===

A music video of The Fray's version of "Heartless" was released on September. The video showed a classroom full of elementary-level students with the video centering around one boy. He keeps glancing at a girl, as drawings appear on a piece of notebook paper in front of him. The band members as well as Kanye West are seen as simple drawn figures performing on the paper. Eventually, the artwork expands out to the classroom, forming a design around the girl. The video implies that the girl was the 'heartless' one who hurt the boy.
