[[Malpractice (Dr. Feelgood album)]]

CATEGORIES: 1975 albums, Albums produced by Vic Maile, United Artists Records albums, Dr. Feelgood albums

Malpractice was the second Dr. Feelgood album, released in October 1975.
The album reached number 17 in the UK Albums Chart in November 1975, and remained in that chart for six weeks. It was their first recording to chart, and appeared almost two years before their first single to do so in the corresponding UK Singles Chart - "Sneakin' Suspicion" (June 1977).
Malpractice saw Dr. Feelgood break into the UK Top 20, the success of the release a gauge of a change in the  musical climate. With their drainpipe suits, short hair, and surly demeanour, they were as influential as any at the inception of punk rock.
The album was re-issued in August 1990 on the Grand Records label in both vinyl and CD formats.
