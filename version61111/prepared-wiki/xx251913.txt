A Bullet for Joey is a 1955 film noir starring Edward G. Robinson, George Raft and Audrey Totter about a gangster who sneaks into Canada to kidnap a scientist for the communists. 

==Plot==

Communist agents in Canada are spying on Dr. Carl Macklin, an atomic physicist whose knowledge they want. To kidnap him, Eric Hartman, the party's top man in Montreal, offers $100,000 to a deported American criminal, Joe Victor.
Joe's former flame, Joyce Geary, is blackmailed into helping with the plan. Police Inspector Leduc of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police investigates and ends up caring for Joyce, as she does for him.
A thug working for Victor kills the scientist's secretary after using her to gain information. Leduc is taken prisoner aboard a ship as Hartman and Victor attempt to take Dr. Macklin with them to Europe.
A plea is made by Leduc to the gangster Victor, who misses his native America, to do the right thing for a change and help stop the Communists. A shootout ensues between Victor and Hartman, who end up killing one another, but Joyce's innocence is proven to the satisfaction of Leduc and the law.

==Critical Response==

In his book, Film Noir, Detective and Mystery Movies on DVD, John Howard Reid considered the movie dull. Slow pace, one-dimensional characters, and an unconvincing climax plague the film.[tpl]cite book|title=Film Noir, Detective and Mystery Movies on DVD: A Guide to the Best in Suspense|last=Reid|first=John|year=2009|publisher=Lulu Books|isbn=978-1-4357-3010-6|page=15|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-hLwwpIDOf4C&lpg=PA14&dq=a%20bullet%20for%20joey&pg=PA15#v=onepage&q=a%20bullet%20for%20joey&f=false|accessdate=2010-01-06[/tpl]
