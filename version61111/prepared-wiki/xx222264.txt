==Coat of arms==

The family coat of arms were lawfully assumed in Norway in 1683: The shield is parted in two fields, the first and upper one having the mother pelican feeding its young with its own blood (a pelican in its piety), and the second field has three blooming roses with leaves and stems.  On top of the shield is a helmet with a crest: two buffalo horns and between them the symbol of Fortune being a naked woman holding a ship's sail in her hands and standing on an orb.Heraldisk nøkkel(Herman Leopoldus Løvenskiold. 1978.  Oslo: Universitetsforl) ISBN 978-82-00-01697-7  
The Ulefoss-line of the family has, however, dropped Fortune and uses the two horns only. The various lines of the family have different heraldic colours (tinctures) in the arms.Norske slektsvåpen (Hans Cappelen. 1976)
In Germany the family used a merchant's mark.Fabelwesen der Heraldik in Familien- und Stadtewappen (Carl Alexander Von Volborth. (1996) ISBN 978-3-7630-2329-5)
