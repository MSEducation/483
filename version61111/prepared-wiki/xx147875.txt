==The lake==

As its name would suggest, the town of Lake Cargelligo is situated on a lake fed by the Lachlan River through Lake Curlew. The lake was originally named Regent's Lake by the explorer John Oxley after the prince regent of England at the time. The lake was the primary water source for the early mining town, and has continued to remain an integral source of water for Lake Cargelligo's inhabitants. These days the lake serves recreational uses as well, most commonly boating and water skiing, which is a large part of the town's tourism industry.
After many years of drought, it was reported in early 2010 that the lake ran dry for the first time since 1902.http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2010/s2801903.htm ABC 7.30 Report 26 Jan 2010
