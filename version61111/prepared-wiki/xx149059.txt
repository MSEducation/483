Helston, sometimes known as Helleston, was a parliamentary borough centred on the small town of Helston in Cornwall.
Using the bloc vote system of election, it returned two Members of Parliament (MPs) to the House of Commons of England until 1707, then to House of Commons of Great Britain until 1800, and to House of Commons of the United Kingdom until the 1832 general election.
The Reform Act 1832 reduced its representation to one member, elected by the first-past-the-post system.  Under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885, it was abolished with effect from the 1885 general election.
