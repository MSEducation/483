Aleksanterin teatteri (Finnish), Alexandersteatern (Swedish) is a Finnish theatre in the city of Helsinki at Bulevardi 23-27, also known as Russian Theater and  Alexander Theatre. 

==History==

In the summer of 1875, the Governor-General of Russian Finland in 1866-1881, Count Nikolay Adlerberg, who was a frequent theatregoer, received Alexander II of Russia's permission to build a theatre for Russians living in Helsinki. The auditorium of the theatre was decorated by the Saint Petersburg architect Jeronim Osuhovsky, and the Finnish artist Severin Falkman decorated the ceiling paintings, which depict twelve cupids, reminding of the Mariinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg. The theatre technology was designed by Iosif Vorontsov. The theatre was completed in October 1879, and in February 1880 it was named after Russian Tsar Alexander II. 
The grand opening of the theatre occurred on 30 March 1880 with Charles Gounod's Faust. 
In 1918 Finnish National Opera and Ballet moved to the Alexander Theatre and remained in the premises till 1993. After Finnish National Opera and Ballet moved to their newly built house, the Alexander Theatre got back its historical name and once again became a venue theatre. 
Since 1993, the building of the Alexander Theatre has been used for guest stage performances of variable genres. The theatre building also houses different offices, rehearsal facilities, dance studios and different companies.
