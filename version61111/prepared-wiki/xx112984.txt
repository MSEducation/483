The Thunder Swamp Trail System is a [tpl]convert|45|mi|km|adj=on[/tpl] network of hiking trails in Pennsylvania. It was constructed by the Youth Conservation Corps during the 1970s through the Pocono Mountains. The trail surface is challenging and is often wet, uneven and rocky.
The main trail is marked with orange blazes and is designated a "State Forest Hiking Trail" with special trail corridor protection. There are several connector trails offering side trips.  Parking is very convenient for one of the better sections of this trail system and is located on the right-hand side of Rt.402 approximately one mile passed the Monroe/Pike County line.  The stone parking lot is located between Howeytown Road to the south and Saw Creek Road to the north.  This is a great section for trout fishing.  You can hike out of the back of the parking lot for approximately 1.5 miles and come across a small creek with nice six to eight inch trout scattered throughout the holes.  If you were to hike across Rt 402 for approximately three miles you will come across Ressica Creek which is always plentiful of trout.  This is a tough hike back to either stream but the experience is well worth the effort.  Hiking conditions are moderate at best, wear very comfortable and sturdy boots, pack plenty of water, and always take your camera.  The wildlife on these trails is great for the area.
