Hiddleston is well known for his portrayal of Loki in the 2011 Marvel Studios film, Thor. He was invited to audition by Kenneth Branagh, the film's director, after having previously worked with Branagh on Ivanov and Wallander. Hiddleston said of Branagh, "Ken has had a life-changing effect. He was able to say to the executives, 'Trust me on this, you can cast Tom and he will deliver'. It was massive and it's completely changed the course of what is available to me to do. Ken gave me my break."[tpl]cite web  | last = Singh | first = Anita | title = Tom Hiddleston: Eton unfairly portrayed as 'full of braying toffs' | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/9193004/Tom-Hiddleston-Eton-unfairly-portrayed-as-full-of-braying-toffs.html | work = The Daily Telegraph|location=UK | date = 8 April 2012 | accessdate = 12 April 2012 [/tpl] In the beginning, he originally auditioned for the part of Thor. "I initially auditioned to play Thor. That was what I was being considered for, because I'm tall and blonde and classically trained, and that seemed to be the mold for what Thor was, he was to be a classical character. And it was in my auditions. I owe this entirely to Marvel and their open-mindedness, they saw something that they thought was interesting. They saw some temperament that they liked."[tpl]cite web  | last = Leader | first = Michael | title = Tom Hiddleston interview: The Avengers, modern myths, playing Loki and more | url = http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/1337123/tom_hiddleston_interview_the_avengers_modern_myths_playing_loki_and_more.html | work = Den of Geek! | date = 25 April 2012 | accessdate = 7 May 2012 [/tpl] The casting director gave Hiddleston six weeks to bulk up, so he went on a strict diet and gained twenty pounds of muscle.[tpl]cite web  | last = Weintraub | first = Steve | title =  Tom Hiddleston On Set Interview THOR; Talks About Playing Loki, How He Got Cast, and a Lot More | url = http://collider.com/tom-hiddleston-interview-thor-on-set/64233/ | work = Collider | date = 10 December 2010 | accessdate = 25 June 2012 [/tpl] In the end, Branagh decided he was more suitable as the antagonist and cast him as Loki.
