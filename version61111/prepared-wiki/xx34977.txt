Yengo is a national park in New South Wales, Australia, 132Â km northwest of Sydney.
In 1993 the National Park and Wildlife Service opened their depot in Bucketty. From here they started to manage the newly established Yengo National Park. A helipad, known as 'Bucketty International' was established and in 1995 (after The Fires) a fire tower was built.
In 1999 the NPWS acquired parts of the Crown land that lay between Bucketty and the Yengo NP. This new area also included the Convict Wall and the amphitheatre used by the community.
The Bucketty community asked NPWS to recognise their custodianship of the place and in early 2000, the community, together with the NPWS, developed a Memorandum of Understanding to jointly manage the site.
Access to Yengo NP is via Yengo Creek Road off The Great North Road just outside Laguna.
