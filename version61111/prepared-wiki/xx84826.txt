Story of the Year is an American rock band formed in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1995.Story of the Year at Allmusic.com Accessed May 17, 2007. The band was originally formed under the name Big Blue Monkey. They changed their name to Story of the Year in 2002 after the release of their EP titled Story of the Year on the indie label Criterion Records, after they realized a blues group of the name Big Blue Monkey had already existed.
It would not be until a few years after forming that Story of the Year saw its first piece of commercial success in its major label debut, Page Avenue, containing the popular singles "Until the Day I Die" and "Anthem of Our Dying Day". A second album, In the Wake of Determination, followed in 2005, but did not achieve the commercial success of its predecessor. The band released their third album, The Black Swan, on April 22, 2008, which was their first release on Epitaph Records, followed by 2010s The Constant.
On March 8, 2013, it was announced that the band reunited and are planning on a world tour.

==History==

===Page Avenue (2002–2004)===

After spending 7 years as a local band, recording demos and three EPs, Story of the Year signed a deal with Maverick Records in 2002, then recorded and released their first album, Page Avenue, in September 2003. The first single from that album was "Until The Day I Die".  It first received radio airplay around July/August 2003 on stations like KROQ-FM and sold thousands of copies worldwide.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl] The second single, "Anthem of Our Dying Day", featured a music video directed by Joe Hahn of Linkin Park.
Live in the Lou/Bassassins (a CD/DVD combo of live performances and touring video) was released on May 10, 2005. It was a hit amongst Story of the Year fans and was certified Gold by the RIAA in late 2005, indicating shipment of over 50,000 units as it is video longform format.Gold and Platinum Database Search Type in "Story of the Year"

===In the Wake of Determination (2004–2006)===

After the Page Avenue tour finally ended in late 2004, Story of the Year returned to the studio with producer Steve Evetts in 2005, to record their second studio album. In the Wake of Determination, released on October 11, 2005, is much heavier sounding than the previous album, due to switching producers to get their "true sound".

==Controversies==

===Band brawl===

MTV News reported on their website that during a radio show in May 2004, the band members of Story of the Year got into a fight with the roadies of metal band Godsmack.Story of the Year Say Godsmack's Crew Kicked Their Asses. MTV News, June 2, 2004 Accessed February 6, 2007 Pictures of the band members' bruised faces were posted on their homepage as well as a blistering rant of the event. The members of Godsmack were not involved in the fight, but they were targeted by the rant as well. It went on to talk about being detained by the local police. There were no arrests from the incident, and the Noblesville Police Department had no record of anything having taken place. Story of the Year's account of the fight was removed and replaced with a note reading: "I took the Godsmack post down because we are going to ask them to go get some chocolate ice cream with us".
