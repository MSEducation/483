Sharp Solar produces thin film modules and mono and poly-crystalline silicon solar cells. Sharp's photovoltaic (PV) modules are used for many applications, from satellites to lighthouses, and industrial applications to residential use.  Sharp began researching solar cells in 1959 with mass production first beginning in 1963. Production capacity amounted to 324 MW in 2004.Sharp Solar ModulesSharp Solar celebrates five years as world number one In 2010, they were the #1 producer of PV cells, in terms of revenues."Solarbuzz Raises Global Photovoltaic 2010 Market Forecast to 15.2 GW", SolarBuzz, 29 June 2010
Sharp Solar manufactures PV modules in many locations, including Llay near Wrexham, Wales and Memphis, TN.
