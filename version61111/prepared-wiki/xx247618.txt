==Career==

Alexander’s Ring Announcing career began in 1989 when he convinced a promoter to let him announce one rainy night on Sanibel Island, Florida.  The fights were held on tennis courts that became flooded from the downpour. During the co-main event, the sound system went out and Alexander had to shout the introductions and results through cupped hands for the remainder of the night. "The place was full of drunks who were yelling and pelting me with beer cups," he says. "I figured this is as bad as it can get."[tpl]cite web|title=Bob Alexander|url=http://boxrec.com/media/index.php/Bob_Alexander|publisher=boxrec.com|accessdate=30 November 2013[/tpl]
