The Squeak programming language is a dialect of Smalltalk. It is object-oriented, class-based and reflective.
It was derived directly from Smalltalk-80 by a group at Apple Computer that included some of the original Smalltalk-80 developers. Its development was continued by the same group at Walt Disney Imagineering, where it was intended for use in internal Disney projects.
Squeak is available for many platforms, and programs produced on one platform run bit-identical on all other platforms. The Squeak system includes code for generating a new version of the virtual machine (VM) on which it runs. It also includes a VM simulator written in Squeak itself. For this reason, it is easily ported.

==Developers==

Dan Ingalls, an important contributor to the Squeak project, wrote the paper[tpl]cite web|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=263754&coll=portal&dl=ACM |first=Dan |last=Ingalls |first2=Ted |last2=Kaehler |first3=John |last3=Maloney |first4=Scott |last4=Wallace |first5=Alan |last5=Kay |title=Back to the Future: the story of Squeak, a practical Smalltalk written in itself |publisher=ACM Digital Library |year=1997 |accessdate=2011-06-12[/tpl] upon which Squeak is built and constructed the architecture for five generations of the Smalltalk language.
Squeak incorporates many of the elements Alan Kay proposed in the Dynabook concept, which he formulated in the 1960s. Kay is an important contributor to the Squeak project.

==User-interface frameworks==

Squeak includes a number of user-interface frameworks:

==Uses==

Many Squeak contributors collaborate on Open Cobalt, a free and open source  virtual world browser and construction toolkit application which is built on Squeak.
Squeak is also used in the es operating system and for implementing the Scratch
programming language for beginning programmers. In May 2011 the OpenQwaq virtual conferencing and collaboration system based on Squeak, an open source release of Teleplace, was announced on the Teleplace blog.[tpl]Cite web |title=Moving Immersive Collaboration Forward|url=http://teleplace.wordpress.com/2011/05/03/moving-immersive-collaboration-forward/[/tpl]

==License==

Squeak 4.0 may be downloaded at no cost, including source code, as a prebuilt virtual machine image licensed under the MIT License, with the exception of some of the original Apple code, which is governed by the Apache License.
Originally, Apple actually released Squeak under a license called the "Squeak License." While source code was available and modification permitted, the Squeak License contained an indemnity clause that prevented it from qualifying as true Free and Open Source Software.
In 2006, Apple relicensed Squeak twice. First, in May, Apple used its own Apple Public Source License, which satisfies the Free Software Foundation's concept of a Free Software License[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/apsl.html |title=FSF's Opinion on the Apple Public Source License (APSL) 2.0 |publisher=Gnu.org |date=2011-05-07 |accessdate=2011-06-12[/tpl] and has attained official approval from the Open Source Initiative[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.opensource.org/pressreleases/osi-clarifies-APSL.php |title=Clarification of the APSL: Press Releases OS Clarifies The Status Of The APSL |publisher=Opensource.org |date=1999-03-17 |accessdate=2011-06-12[/tpl] as an Open Source License. The Apple Public Source License, as it turns out, fails to pass the third standard that Free and Open Source Software licenses are held to: the Debian Free Software Guidelines promulgated by the Debian project, an influential volunteer-run Linux distribution. To enable inclusion of Etoys in the One Laptop Per Child project, a second relicensing was undertaken using the Apache License. At this point, an effort was also made to address the issue of code contributed by members of the Squeak community, which it was not in Apple's power to unilaterally relicense.
For each contribution made under the Squeak License since 1996, a relicensing statement was obtained authorizing distribution under the MIT license, and finally in March 2010, the end result was released as Squeak 4.0, now under combined MIT and Apache licenses.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/Squeak-4-0-released-now-under-MIT-Apache-license-956267.html |publisher=The H Open |title=Squeak 4.0 released - now under MIT/Apache license |date=2010-03-16 |accessdate=2011-06-12[/tpl]
