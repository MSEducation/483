10,000 Trees for the Rouge Valley is a non-profit environmental organization that has held many Toronto-area tree plantings. It is a volunteer group that is dedicated to helping the environment, as it has restored more than [tpl]convert|100|acre|km2[/tpl] of fragile land in the Rouge Watershed with the assistance of individuals, families, governments and community groups, since 1990.  [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.frw.ca/rouge.php?ID=73|title=Friends of the Rouge Watershed| accessdate= 28 May 2008 [/tpl]  The species of trees are carefully chosen to attract and support wildlife, stabilize the soil, and improve the air and water quality. In addition, the organisation tries to protect creeks and streams from soil erosion, and it has been able to link areas of forest and extend wildlife corridors.
