The general structure of the endoplasmic reticulum is a membranous network of cisternae (sac-like structures) held together by the cytoskeleton. The phospholipid membrane encloses a space, the cisternal space (or lumen), which is continuous with the perinuclear space but separate from the cytosol. The functions of the endoplasmic reticulum can be summarized as the synthesis and export of proteins and membrane lipids, but varies between ER and cell type and cell function.  The quantity of RER and SER in a cell can slowly interchange from one type to the other, depending on the changing metabolic activities of the cell.  Transformation can include embedding of new proteins in membrane as well as structural changes.  Changes in protein content may occur without noticeable structural changes.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl]

===Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum===

The surface of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (often abbreviated RER) is studded with protein-manufacturing ribosomes giving it a "rough" appearance (hence its name). The binding site of the ribosome on the rough endoplasmic reticulum is the translocon.[tpl]cite journal | author= Görlich D, Prehn S, Hartmann E, Kalies KU, Rapoport TA. | title= A mammalian homolog of SEC61p and SECYp is associated with ribosomes and nascent polypeptides during translocation. | journal= Cell |date=Oct 1992| volume=71 | issue=3 | pages=489–503 | pmid=1423609 | doi=10.1016/0092-8674(92)90517-G[/tpl] However, the ribosomes bound to it at any one time are not a stable part of this organelle's structure as they are constantly being bound and released from the membrane. A ribosome only binds to the RER once a specific protein-nucleic acid complex forms in the cytosol.  This special complex forms when a free ribosome begins translating the mRNA of a protein destined for the secretory pathway.[tpl]cite book |last=Lodish |first=Harvey |last2=et al. |year=2003 |title=Molecular Cell Biology |edition=5th |publisher=W. H. Freeman |pages=659–666 |isbn=0-7167-4366-3 [/tpl] The first 5-30 amino acids polymerized encode a signal peptide, a molecular message that is recognized and bound by a signal recognition particle (SRP). Translation pauses and the ribosome complex binds to the RER translocon where translation continues with the nascent protein forming into the RER lumen and/or membrane. The protein is processed in the ER lumen by an enzyme (a signal peptidase), which removes the signal peptide. Ribosomes at this point may be released back into the cytosol; however, non-translating ribosomes are also known to stay associated with translocons.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Seiser|first1=R. M.|title=The Fate of Membrane-bound Ribosomes Following the Termination of Protein Synthesis|journal=Journal of Biological Chemistry|volume=275|issue=43|year=2000|pages=33820–33827|issn=00219258|doi=10.1074/jbc.M004462200[/tpl]
The membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum forms large double membrane sheets that are located near, and continuous with, the outer layer of the nuclear envelope.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Shibata|first1=Yoko|last2=Voeltz|first2=Gia K.|last3=Rapoport|first3=Tom A.|title=Rough Sheets and Smooth Tubules|journal=Cell |volume=126|issue=3|year=2006|pages=435–439|issn=00928674|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2006.07.019[/tpl] Although there is no continuous membrane between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus, membrane-bound vesicles shuttle proteins between these two compartments.Endoplasmic reticulum.

Retrieved September 13, 2006, from Answers.com Web site: http://www.answers.com/topic/endoplasmic-reticulum Vesicles are surrounded by coating proteins called COPI and COPII. COPII targets vesicles to the Golgi apparatus and COPI marks them to be brought back to the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The rough endoplasmic reticulum works in concert with the Golgi complex to target new proteins to their proper destinations. A second method of transport out of the endoplasmic reticulum involves areas called membrane contact sites, where the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and other organelles are held closely together, allowing the transfer of lipids and other small molecules.[tpl]cite journal |author=Levine T |title=Short-range intracellular trafficking of small molecules across endoplasmic reticulum junctions |journal=Trends Cell Biol. |volume=14 |issue=9 |pages=483–90 |date=September 2004 |pmid=15350976 |doi=10.1016/j.tcb.2004.07.017 |url= [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Levine T, Loewen C |title=Inter-organelle membrane contact sites: through a glass, darkly |journal=Curr.

The rough endoplasmic reticulum is key in multiple functions:

===Smooth endoplasmic reticulum===

The smooth endoplasmic reticulum (abbreviated SER) has functions in several metabolic processes. It synthesizes lipids, phospholipids, and steroids. Cells which secrete these products, such as those in the testes, ovaries, and skin oil glands have a great deal of smooth endoplasmic reticulum.[tpl]cite news |title=Functions of Smooth ER |publisher=University of Minnesota Duluth[/tpl] It also carries out the metabolism of carbohydrates, drug detoxification, attachment of receptors on cell membrane proteins, and steroid metabolism.[tpl]cite journal|author=Maxfield FR, Wüstner D|title=Intracellular cholesterol transport|journal=J. Clin. Invest.|volume=110|issue=7|pages=891–8|date=October 2002|pmid=12370264|pmc=151159|doi=10.1172/JCI16500[/tpl] In muscle cells, it regulates calcium ion concentration. It is connected to the nuclear envelope. Smooth endoplasmic reticulum is found in a variety of cell types (both animal and plant), and it serves different functions in each. The smooth endoplasmic reticulum also contains the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase, which converts glucose-6-phosphate to glucose, a step in gluconeogenesis. It consists of tubules that are located near the cell periphery. These tubes sometimes branch forming a network that is reticular in appearance.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Shibata|first1=Yoko|last2=Voeltz|first2=Gia K.|last3=Rapoport|first3=Tom A.|title=Rough Sheets and Smooth Tubules|journal=Cell|volume=126|issue=3|year=2006|pages=435–439|issn=00928674|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2006.07.019[/tpl] In some cells, there are dilated areas like the sacs of rough endoplasmic reticulum. The network of smooth endoplasmic reticulum allows for an increased surface area to be devoted to the action or storage of key enzymes and the products of these enzymes.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl]

====Sarcoplasmic reticulum====

The sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), from the Greek sarx, ("flesh"), is smooth ER found in smooth and striated muscle. The only structural difference between this organelle and the smooth endoplasmic reticulum is the medley of proteins they have, both bound to their membranes and drifting within the confines of their lumens. This fundamental difference is indicative of their functions: The endoplasmic reticulum synthesizes molecules, while the sarcoplasmic reticulum stores and pumps calcium ions. The sarcoplasmic reticulum contains large stores of calcium, which it sequesters and then releases when the muscle cell is stimulated.[tpl]cite journal|author=Toyoshima C, Nakasako M, Nomura H, Ogawa H|title=Crystal structure of the calcium pump of sarcoplasmic reticulum at 2.6 A resolution|journal=Nature|volume=405|issue=6787|pages=647–55|year=2000|pmid=10864315|doi=10.1038/35015017[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=Medical Cell Biology 3rd/ed|publisher=Academic Press|pages=69|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=tRbCHk9easQC&pg=PA69&lpg=PA69&dq=smooth+er+stores+calcium+ions+muscle+cells&source=bl&ots=RtG7D-wi59&sig=5hxYMBaDdb-S4Ypd01Hcp-e8qqY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=odTNUNPFC-LX0QHRnoHQBg&ved=0CHIQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=smooth%20er%20stores%20calcium%20ions%20muscle%20cells&f=false[/tpl]  It plays a major role in excitation-contraction coupling.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl]

==Functions==

The endoplasmic reticulum serves many general functions, including the folding of protein molecules in sacs called cisternae and the transport of synthesized proteins in vesicles to the Golgi apparatus. Correct folding of newly made proteins is made possible by several endoplasmic reticulum chaperone proteins, including protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), ERp29, the Hsp70 family member BiP/Grp78, calnexin, calreticulin, and the peptidylpropyl isomerase family. Only properly folded proteins are transported from the rough ER to the Golgi apparatus.  Disturbances in redox regulation, calcium regulation, glucose deprivation, and viral infection[tpl]cite journal|last=Xu|first=C|coauthors=et al|title=Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress: Cell Life and Death Decisions|journal=J. Clin. Invest|year=2005|volume=115|pages=2656–2664|pmid=16200199|doi=10.1172/JCI26373|issue=10|pmc=1236697[/tpl] or the over-expression of proteins[tpl]cite journal | author = Kober L, Zehe C, Bode J | title = Development of a novel ER stress based selection system for the isolation of highly productive clones | journal = Biotechnol. Bioeng. | volume = 109 | issue = 10 | pages = 2599–611 |date=October 2012 | pmid = 22510960 | doi = 10.1002/bit.24527  [/tpl] can lead to endoplasmic reticulum stress response (ER stress), a state in which the folding of proteins slows, leading to an increase in unfolded proteins. This stress is emerging as a potential cause of damage in hypoxia/ischemia, insulin resistance, and other disorders.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl]

===Protein transport===

Secretory proteins, mostly glycoproteins, are moved across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Proteins that are transported by the endoplasmic reticulum throughout the cell are marked with an address tag called a signal sequence. The N-terminus (one end) of a polypeptide chain (i.e., a protein) contains a few amino acids that work as an address tag, which are removed when the polypeptide reaches its destination. Proteins that are destined for places outside the endoplasmic reticulum are packed into transport vesicles and moved along the cytoskeleton toward their destination. In human fibroblasts, the ER is always co-distributed with microtubules and the depolymerisation of the latter cause its co-aggregation with mitochondria, which are also associated with the ER.  Soltys,B.J. and Gupta, R.S. (1992) Interrelationships of endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, intermediate filaments, and microtubules--a quadruple fluorescence labeling study.
The endoplasmic reticulum is also part of a protein sorting pathway. It is, in essence, the transportation system of the eukaryotic cell. The majority of its resident proteins are retained within it through a retention motif. This motif is composed of four amino acids at the end of the protein sequence. The most common retention sequence is KDEL (lys-asp-glu-leu). However, variations of KDEL do occur, and other sequences can also give rise to endoplasmic reticulum retention. It is not known whether such variation can lead to sub-ER localizations. There are three KDEL receptors in mammalian cells, and they have a very high degree of sequence identity. The functional differences between these receptors remain to be established. [tpl]citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl]
