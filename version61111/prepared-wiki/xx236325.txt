Biogeography of the Lost World (Pantepui region, northeastern South America): insights from bryophytes. Phytotaxa 9, 254-65. The region is characterized by a pattern of about 50 tepuis, isolated tabletop mountains that arise from the sandstone plateau of the highlands. Tepuis are known for their biodiversity, especially their concentrations of endemic species, and most are still pristine, undisturbed ecosystems. The genus is almost entirely restricted to the Chimantá Massif, a complex of several of these tepuis in Bolívar, Venezuela. There several species of the genus are dominant members of the higher-elevation shrublands, which are known as paramoid vegetation because of their similarity to the páramos of the Andes.Rull, V.
