Kamehameha I ([tpl]IPA-haw|kəmehəˈmɛhə[/tpl]; c. 1758 – May 8, 1819), also known as Kamehameha the Great, conquered the Hawaiian Islands and formally established the Kingdom of Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i in 1810. By developing alliances with the major Pacific colonial powers, Kamehameha preserved Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i's independence under his rule. Kamehameha is remembered for the Kānāwai Māmalahoe, the "Law of the Splintered Paddle", which protects human rights of non-combatants in times of battle. Kamehameha's full Hawaiian name is Kalani Pai[tpl]okina[/tpl]ea Wohi o Kaleikini Keali[tpl]okina[/tpl]ikui Kamehameha o [tpl]okina[/tpl]Iolani i Kaiwikapu kau[tpl]okina[/tpl]i Ka Liholiho Kūnuiākea.

==Birth and concealment==

Traditional chants indicate he was born in the month of ikuwā (winter) or around November. According to Hawaiian historians Samuel Kamakau[tpl]cite book |url= http://www.ulukau.org/elib/cgi-bin/library?c=chiefs&l=en |title= Ruling chiefs of Hawaii |author= Samuel Kamakau |year= 1991 |edition=Revised |publisher= Kamehameha Schools Press |location= Honolulu |isbn= 0-87336-014-1 |pages=[/tpl][tpl]rp|66–69[/tpl] and later Abraham Fornander[tpl]cite book |title= An Account of the Polynesian Race: Its Origins and Migrations, and the Ancient History of the Hawaiian People to the Times of Kamehameha I |year=1880 |publisher=Trübner & Co |volume= Volume 2 |author= Abraham Fornander |editor= John F.

His father Keōua and his mother Chiefess Kekū[tpl]okina[/tpl]iapoiwa of the Kohala district on the island of Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i were probably his hanai, adopted parents.[tpl]cite book|author1=Norris Whitfield Potter|author2=Lawrence M.

Alapaʻinui, who was the present king of Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i at that time, was angry when the kahuna (priest) told him that the child born would become "the slayer of chiefs", and he had, according to custom, two houses built that day, one for the child that would be hunted and killed and the other of the kahuna's. Kaha, who was one of Alapa[tpl]okina[/tpl]i's kahunas and was knowledgeable of the prophecy and the killing, went to Keku[tpl]okina[/tpl]iapoiwa and told her to give the child to Nae[tpl]okina[/tpl]ole, who was a famous runner of chiefs (kūkini), and he ran from Kokoiki to Pali Hula[tpl]okina[/tpl]ana at [tpl]okina[/tpl]Āwini, the third valley from Waipi[tpl]okina[/tpl]o where he was raised by the chiefess Kaha[tpl]okina[/tpl]ōpulani (who by some accounts was the sister of Nae[tpl]okina[/tpl]ole and a cousin of Keku[tpl]okina[/tpl]iapoiwa) along with her own mother, Hikuʻikekualono,  daughter Kuakāne.[tpl]cite journal |work= Annual Report |title= The Birth of Kamehameha I |author= William DeWitt Alexander |id= [tpl]hdl|10524/11853[/tpl] |year= 1912 |volume= |publisher=Hawaiian Historical Society |pages=6–8[/tpl]
They raised Pai[tpl]okina[/tpl]ea for the first few years of his life. Five years after his birth, Alapa[tpl]okina[/tpl]i, perhaps remorseful of his actions, invited the child back to live with his family. There under the guidance of his kumu (teacher), Kekūhaupi[tpl]okina[/tpl]o, he learned the ways of court diplomacy and war. His father, thought to have been poisoned or prayed to death by Alapa[tpl]okina[/tpl]i, died a few years later. Kekūhaupi[tpl]okina[/tpl]o remained a faithful and trusted advisor to Pai[tpl]okina[/tpl]ea until the accidental death of the loyal kahu during a sham battle.
Another story says the name Pai[tpl]okina[/tpl]ea was given to Kamehameha after he first distinguished himself as a warrior in a battle between Maui and Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i island in 1775–1779,[tpl]rp|84[/tpl], by saving his teacher's, Kekūhaupi[tpl]okina[/tpl]o's, life, by blocking a blow from a pāhoa (dagger).
Pai[tpl]okina[/tpl]ea is said to have had a dour disposition, and acquired the name he is best known for today: Ka mehameha, from the Hawaiian language for "the lonely one".[tpl]Hawaiian Dictionaries |mehameha |accessdate= September 28, 2010 [/tpl] The name "Kamehameha" was given to Pai[tpl]okina[/tpl]ea by Alapa[tpl]okina[/tpl]i after he was brought into his court, Pai[tpl]okina[/tpl]ea was given that name because, for most of his childhood life, he lived in solitude at [tpl]okina[/tpl]Āwini.

===Naha Stone===

Legend has it that the man who moves the stone would be the one to unite the islands. Many have tried and failed to get the stone to move from its original spot and those who have tried were of high ranking "naha’’ blood line. Kamehameha was of the nī[tpl]okina[/tpl]aupi[tpl]okina[/tpl]o descent and Ululani (high-ranking chiefess of Hilo) believed Kamehameha was not worthy of attempting to move the stone. Kamehameha ignored all negativity and in the end, not only had he moved the stone but legend says the stone had been overturned. Kamehameha went on to unite the islands through a series of hard fought battles., ‘‘The Legend of the Naha Stone.’’ Donch website, 15 November 2013. Retrieved on 4 December 2013.

==Unification of Hawaiʻi==

When Alapa[tpl]okina[/tpl]i died, his position was succeeded by his son Keawe[tpl]okina[/tpl]ōpala. Kalaniʻōpuʻu, challenged his rule, and was backed by his nephew Kamehameha. In fierce fighting at Kealakekua Bay, Keawe[tpl]okina[/tpl]ōpala was slain and Kalaniʻōpuʻu claimed victory. For his loyal service to his uncle, Kamehameha was made Kalaniʻōpuʻu's aide.
In 1779, Kamehameha again traveled with Kalaniʻōpuʻu to Kealakekua Bay. This time he, among other young chiefs accompanying their senior chief, met with Captain James Cook. During Kamehameha's first contact with non-Hawaiians, he may have stayed aboard Cook's ship, the [tpl]HMS |Resolution|1771 |6[/tpl], for at least one night.

===Hawaii Island===

Raised in the royal court of his uncle Kalaniʻōpuʻu, Kamehameha achieved prominence in 1782, upon Kalaniʻōpuʻu's death. While the kingship was inherited by Kalaniʻōpuʻu's son Kīwalaʻō, Kamehameha was given a prominent religious position, guardianship of the Hawaiian god of war, Kūkā[tpl]okina[/tpl]ilimoku, as well as the district of Waipi[tpl]okina[/tpl]o valley. There was already hatred between the two cousins, caused when Kamehameha presented a slain ali[tpl]okina[/tpl]i's body to the gods instead of to Kīwalaʻō. When a group of chiefs from the Kona district offered to back Kamehameha against Kīwalaʻō, he accepted eagerly. The five Kona chiefs supporting Kamehameha were: Ke[tpl]okina[/tpl]eaumoku Pāpa[tpl]okina[/tpl]iahiahi (Kamehameha's father-in-law), Keaweaheulu Kalua[tpl]okina[/tpl]āpana (Kamehameha's uncle), Kekūhaupi[tpl]okina[/tpl]o (Kamehameha's warrior teacher), Kame[tpl]okina[/tpl]eiamoku and Kamanawa (twin uncles of Kamehameha). Kīwalaʻō was soon defeated in the battle of Moku[tpl]okina[/tpl]ōhai, and Kamehameha took control of the districts of Kohala, Kona, and Hāmākua on the island of Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i.[tpl]cite book |url= http://www.ulukau.org/elib/cgi-bin/library?c=elibrary&l=en |title= Kamehameha and his warrior Kekūhaupiʻo (Moolelo kaao no Kuhaupio ke koa kaulana o ke au o Kamehameha ka Nui) |author= Stephen L. Desha |others= Translated by Frances N. Frazier |year= 2000 |edition=Revised |publisher= Kamehameha Schools Press |location= Honolulu |isbn= 0-87336-056-7 [/tpl]
Kamehameha then moved against the district of Puna in 1790 deposing Chief Keawema[tpl]okina[/tpl]uhili. Keōua Kū[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahu[tpl]okina[/tpl]ula, exiled to his home in Ka[tpl]okina[/tpl]ū, took advantage of Kamehameha's absence and led an uprising. When Kamehameha returned with his army to put down the rebellion, Keōua fled past the Kīlauea volcano, which erupted and killed nearly a third of his warriors from poisonous gas.
Questioning a kahuna on how best to go about securing the rest of the island, Kamehameha resolved to construct a temple (heiau) to Kūkā[tpl]okina[/tpl]ilimoku, as well as lay an ali[tpl]okina[/tpl]i's body on it.
When the Pu[tpl]okina[/tpl]ukoholā Heiau was completed in 1791, Kamehameha invited Keōua to meet with him. Keōua may have been dispirited by his recent losses. He may have mutilated himself before landing so as to make himself an imperfect sacrificial victim. As he stepped on shore, one of Kamehameha's chiefs threw a spear at him. By some accounts he dodged it, but was then cut down by musket fire. Caught by surprise, Keōua's bodyguards were killed. With Keōua dead, and his supporters captured or slain, Kamehameha became King of Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i island.[tpl]cite book |author= Herbert Henry Gowen| title= The Napoleon of the Pacific: Kamehameha the Great |origyear=1919 |year=1977 |publisher=Revell, republished AMS Press |isbn=978-0-404-14221-6 [/tpl]

===Maui and Oʻahu===

Kamehameha's dreams included far more than the island of Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i; with the counsel of his favorite wife Ka[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahumanu, who became one of Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i's most powerful figures, he set about planning to conquer the rest of the Hawaiian Islands. Help came from British and American traders, who sold guns and ammunition to Kamehameha. Two westerners who lived on Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i island, Isaac Davis and John Young, became advisers of Kamehameha and trained his troops in the use of firearms.[tpl]cite news |url= http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&res=990CE5D61F3BE532A25757C1A9649C94679FD7CF |title= Boatswain John Young: his adventures in Hawaii recalled |date= February 14, 1886 |newspaper= New York Times archive | format=PDF[/tpl]
With his new army, Kamehameha felt confident enough to move on the neighboring islands of Maui and O[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahu, already weakened by a war of succession that had broken out between King Kahekili II's son and brother. Kamehameha may or may not have known that his rival, King Kalanikūpule, also possessed firearms, and was planning a move against him when the ali[tpl]okina[/tpl]i nui of Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i invaded those islands.
In 1795, Kamehameha set sail with an armada of 960 war canoes and 10,000 soldiers. He quickly secured the lightly defended islands of Maui and Moloka[tpl]okina[/tpl]i at the Battle of Kawela. The army moved on the island of O[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahu, landing his troops at Wai[tpl]okina[/tpl]alae and Waikīkī. What Kamehameha did not know was that one of his commanders, a high-ranking ali[tpl]okina[/tpl]i named Ka[tpl]okina[/tpl]iana, had defected to Kalanikūpule. Ka[tpl]okina[/tpl]iana assisted in the cutting of notches into the Nu[tpl]okina[/tpl]uanu Pali mountain ridge; these notches, like those on a castle turret, would serve as gunports for Kalanikūpule's cannon.
In a series of skirmishes, Kamehameha's forces were able to push back Kalanikūpule's men until the latter was cornered on the Pali Lookout. While Kamehameha moved on the Pali, his troops took heavy fire from the cannon. In desperation, he assigned two divisions of his best warriors to climb to the Pali to attack the cannons from behind; they surprised Kalanikūpule's gunners and took control of the weapons. With the loss of their guns, Kalanikūpule's troops fell into disarray and were cornered by Kamehameha's still-organized troops. A fierce battle ensued, with Kamehameha's forces forming an enclosing wall. By using their traditional Hawaiian spears, as well as muskets and cannon, they were able to kill most of Kalanikūpule's forces. Over 400 men were forced off the Pali's cliff, a drop of 1,000 feet. Ka[tpl]okina[/tpl]iana was killed during the action; Kalanikūpule was captured some time later and sacrificed to Kūkā[tpl]okina[/tpl]ilimoku.
Kamehameha wanted not only to conquer the islands but to win the hearts of the people. After the victory at Nu[tpl]okina[/tpl]uanu, Kamehameha showed his true leadership qualities. He not only cared for his own warriors but for the warriors of his opposition. He helped replenish the island of O[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahu by repairing ‘‘kalo’’ patches and planting more sweet potatoes.Desha Stephen, ‘’Kamehameha and his warrior Kekuhaupi[tpl]okina[/tpl]o (Honolulu: Kamehameha Schools Press, 1921), 418-419.

===Kauai===

Kamehameha was now ruler of all the Hawaiian Islands from O[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahu to the east, but the western islands of Kaua[tpl]okina[/tpl]i and Ni[tpl]okina[/tpl]ihau continued to elude him. Using Honolulu as a base, he had a forty-ton ship built. When he attempted to invade the western islands in 1796, Ka[tpl]okina[/tpl]iana's brother Nāmākeha led a rebellion on Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i island against his rule, and Kamehameha was forced to return and put down the insurrection.[tpl]cite web |title= Chapter 4: Founding of the Hawaiian Kingdom |work= A Cultural History of Three Traditional Hawaiian Sites on the West Coast of Hawai'i Island |publisher= National Park Service |author= Diane Lee Rhodes and Linda Wedel Greene |url= http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/kona/history4.htm |accessdate=2009-12-23 [/tpl] After his first failed attempt, Kamehameha commissioned the mass construction of a fleet of war canoes called Peleleu, from the forests of Hilo and Puna. The project lasted from 1796 to 1801, and was superintended by the kahuna kālai wa[tpl]okina[/tpl]a, Kaha[tpl]okina[/tpl]ōpio Hūhā. During this time, a triple hull canoe (pūkolu), presumably the first of its kind in the islands, was built and named Kaenakāne, though it proved ineffective.
In 1803 he tried again, but this time, disease broke out among his warriors; Kamehameha himself fell ill, though he later recovered. During this time, Kamehameha was amassing the largest armada Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i had ever seen – foreign-built schooners and massive war canoes, armed with cannon and carrying his vast army. Kaumuali[tpl]okina[/tpl]i, ali[tpl]okina[/tpl]i nui of Kaua[tpl]okina[/tpl]i, watched as Kamehameha built up his invading force and decided he would have a better chance in negotiation than battle. He may also have been influenced by foreign merchants, who saw the continuing feud between Kamehameha and Kaumuali[tpl]okina[/tpl]i as bad for the sandalwood trade.
In April 1810, Kaumuali[tpl]okina[/tpl]i became a vassal of Kamehameha, who therefore emerged as the sole sovereign of the unified Hawaiian islands.[tpl]cite book |title=History of the Hawaiian Kingdom |author=Norris Potter|year=2003|ISBN=1-57306-150-6|publisher=Bess Press[/tpl]

==King of Hawaii==

As king, Kamehameha took several steps to ensure that the islands remained a united realm even after his death. He unified the legal system and he used the products he collected in taxes to promote trade with Europe and the United States. Kamehameha did not allow non-Hawaiians to own land; they would not be able to until the Great Māhele of 1848. This edict ensured the islands' independence even while many of the other islands of the Pacific succumbed to the colonial powers.
In fact, the Kingdom of Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i that Kamehameha established retained its independence, except for a five-month British occupation in 1843, until it was annexed by the United States in 1898. It was this legacy that earned Kamehameha the epithet "Napoleon of the Pacific" (Napoleona o ka Pākīpika in the Hawaiian language).
Kamehameha also instituted the Māmalahoe Kānāwai, the Law of the Splintered Paddle. Its origins derived from before the unification of the Island of Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i, in 1782, when Kamehameha, during a raid, caught his foot in a rock. Two local fishermen, fearful of the great warrior, hit Kamehameha hard on the head with a large paddle, which actually broke the paddle. Kamehameha was stunned and left for dead, allowing the fisherman and his companion to escape. Twelve years later, the same fisherman was brought before Kamehameha for punishment. King Kamehameha instead blamed himself for attacking innocent people, gave the fisherman gifts of land and set them free. He declared the new law, "Let every elderly person, woman, and child lie by the roadside in safety". This law, which provided for the safety of noncombatants in wartime, is estimated to have saved thousands of lives during Kamehameha's campaigns. It became the first written law of the Kingdom of Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i, was included in the state constitution,[tpl]cite web | author= |title= The Constitution of the State of Hawaii |article= Article IX, Section 10 | year = 1979 |url= http://hawaii.gov/lrb/con/conart9.html | accessdate= 2013-11-08 [/tpl] and has influenced many subsequent humanitarian laws of war.[tpl]cite web |title= Thematic Essay on the Law of the Splintered Paddle: Compass Point for Hawaiian Leadership in International Humanitarian Law |author= Michael Hoffman |url= http://coe-dmha.org/Liaison/Vol_2No_3/Lia03.htm |accessdate= 2009-12-23 [/tpl]
Although he ended human sacrifice, Kamehameha was a devout follower of the Hawaiian religion and Hawaiian traditions (such as Lua). He believed so strongly in his religion and culture that he would execute his subjects for breaches of the strict rules called kapu. Although he entertained Christians, he did not appear to take them seriously.
Kamehameha would be lucky to have visitors from other countries such as John Young, Isaac Davis, and George Vancouver. Young and Davis became advisors to Kamehameha and provided him with advanced weapons that helped in combat. Kamehameha was also a religious king and the holder of the war god Kuka[tpl]okina[/tpl] ilimoku. Vancouver noticed that Kamehameha would worship his gods and wooden images in heiau and he wanted to spread the religion in England to Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i. The reason missionaries were not sent to Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i from Great Britain is because Kamehameha told Vancouver that the gods he worshiped were his gods with ‘‘mana’’ and through these gods, Kamehameha became supreme ruler over all of the islands. Witnessing the devotion Kamehameha had, Vancouver decided not to send missionaries from England.Samuel Kamakau, ‘‘Ruling Chiefs of Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i (Honolulu: Kamehameha Schools Press, 1991), 180-181.

==Later life==

After about 1812, Kamehameha spent his time at Kamakahonu, a compound he built in Kailua-Kona.
It is now the site of King Kamehameha's Beach Hotel, the starting and finishing points of the Ironman World Championship Triathlon.
As the custom of the time, he took several wives and had many children, although he would outlive about half of them.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.royalark.net/Hawaii/hawaii6.htm |title=The Kamehameha Dynasty Genealogy (Page 6) |author=Christopher Buyers |accessdate=2009-12-23 |work= Royal Ark web site [/tpl]

===Final resting place===

When Kamehameha died May 14, 1819, his body was hidden by his trusted friends, Hoapili and Ho[tpl]okina[/tpl]olulu, in the ancient custom called hūnākele (literally, "to hide in secret"). The mana, or power of a person, was considered to be sacred. As per the ancient custom, his body was buried hidden because of his mana. His final resting place remains unknown. At one point in his reign Kamehameha III asked that Hoapili show him where his father's bones were buried, but on the way there Hoapili knew that they were being followed, so he turned around.Norris Potter (2003).
