===COLBERT Treadmill===

In 2009, NASA engineered a new treadmill for the International Space Station. It was brought to the ISS by the Space Shuttle Discovery during the STS-128 mission in August 2009. The complex machine is now used eight hours daily by astronauts and cosmonauts aboard the space station in order to maintain their muscle mass and bone density while spending long periods of time in a zero-gravity environment. While engineers at NASA were constructing this treadmill, it was simply called T-2 for more than two years. However, on April 14, 2009, NASA renamed it the "Combined Operational Load-Bearing External Resistance Treadmill", or COLBERT.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/behindscenes/colberttreadmill.html|title=NASA — COLBERT Ready for Serious Exercise|publisher=Nasa.gov|date=2010-10-23|accessdate=2011-07-16[/tpl] NASA named the treadmill after Colbert,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29841715/|title=Oops: Colbert wins space station name contest - Technology & science - Space - Human spaceflight - msnbc.com|publisher=MSNBC|date=2009-03-23|accessdate=2011-07-16[/tpl] who took an interest during the Node 3 naming census for the ISS module, Tranquility.
Colbert urged his followers to post the name "Colbert", which upon completion of the census received the most entries totaling 230,539, some 40,000 votes more than the second-place choice, Serenity.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/220492/march-03-2009/name-the-nasa-module-after-stephen|title=Name the NASA Module After Stephen|publisher=colbertnation.com|date=2008-03-03|accessdate=2008-03-04[/tpl] The COLBERT is expected to last the life of the ISS and will have seen about 38,000 miles of running when the Space Station is retired in 2020 but was also built with 150,000 mile lifespan if needed till 2028 or longer. Colbert realized he was the recipient of an extremely rare honor when astronaut Suni Williams came on The Colbert Report to announce that NASA had named the treadmill after him. Despite being a backronym, the COLBERT is the only piece of NASA engineered equipment in space that is named after a living human being.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/externalflash/name_ISS/index.html|title=Help NASA Name Node 3!|publisher=Nasa.gov|date=2009-01-30|accessdate=2011-07-16[/tpl]
