==Career==

Crimes of the Heart was Henley's first professionally produced play. It opened at the Actors Theatre of Louisville in 1978, where it was declared co-winner of a new American play contest.[tpl]Page needed|date=April 2012[/tpl]  The play then moved to New York and was produced by the Manhattan Theatre Club.McTague, p. ?[tpl]Page needed|date=April 2012[/tpl]  Crimes of the Heart won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1981, as well as the award for Best American Play of 1981 from the New York Drama Critics' Circle.McTague, p. 27  The play also earned Henley a nomination for a Tony Award, and her screenplay for the film version of Crimes of the Heart was nominated for an Oscar as Best Adapted Screenplay.

Henley's first six plays are set in the Deep South: two in Louisiana and four in Mississippi, where she grew up.[tpl]cite journal|title=The History of Southern Women's Literature|journal=Southern Literary Studies|pages=588–593|author=Karen L. Laughlin|authorlink=Beth Henley|editor1-first=Carolyn|editor1-last=Perry|publisher=Louisiana State University Press|location=Baton Rouge[/tpl]  Themes of her dramas are tied to small town values and the importance of love.  Henley particularly focuses on her female characters in terms of identity and expression.  Dominant themes include:
Henley views her characters as examples of the repercussions of modern society and representative of the alienation, pain, and suffering that reflect the human condition. Her plays explore the dichotomy within individuals that seek happiness but are betrayed by modern civilization.  Henley's notion that neurotic behavior is endemic to modern civilization stems from Freud's psychoanalytic theory. Her Southern sense of the grotesque and absurd experienced in daily existence have caused some critics to compare Henley to other Southern Writers such as Eudora Welty and Flannery O'Connor. This attitude has caused Henley to be classified in the Southern Gothic genre.[tpl]cite journal|last=Plunka|first=Gene|title=Freudian Psychology and Beth Henley's Popular Culture Satire: Signature|journal=The Journal of Popular Culture|date=July 3, 2006[/tpl]
Henley's writing style has evolved throughout her career.  Her plays of the 1980s are characterized as naturalistic and dramatize the relationship between the interior self and the exterior world.[tpl]Page needed|date=April 2012[/tpl]  The characters are outsiders, and by virtue of their nonconformity they risk being unable to share their feelings, insights, and experiences with others because they are alone, punished for their difference. They risk being institutionally isolated in a prison or asylum because they are so alone, so outside behavioral norms, that their actions warrant their removal from society. Hope exists in the search for a kindred soul.[tpl]Page needed|date=April 2012[/tpl]  Her plays of the 1990s are considered experimental in moving beyond the traditional settings and themes of her earlier work.[tpl]Page needed|date=April 2012[/tpl]  These plays explore structure and the concepts of time with action occurring in a fragmentary way, spanning amounts of time, and/or occurring in episodic succession. This is clearly seen in Abundance, the first play not set in the South.[tpl]Page needed|date=April 2012[/tpl]  Henley applies a new technique in these plays: structuring action around a gap and subsequent references which cast doubt on the action of the absent scene.  Henley begins to mix genres, such as play noirHucheon, Linda. "The Politics of Parody", The Politics of Postmodernism, New York: Routledge, 1989. pp. 93–117 and integrates repeated verbal and visual images across genres with the theme of love dominating as well as exploring the theme of denial.[tpl]Page needed|date=April 2012[/tpl]  Henley later attempts to reconcile themes of love and imagination in Revelers and employs ancient theatre techniques, such as a prologue, in the title and structure of the play. A recurring feature in all of her plays, Henley brings together a collection of individuals who cling to the self-images and experiences that give them their identity.[tpl]Page needed|date=April 2012[/tpl]

==Criticism==

Some critics have faulted Henley for locating her women characters within the home, arguing that this is a place that has both defined and confined women in negative ways, without offering avenues for either re-visioning or escape.

==Personal life==

For many years Henley dated actor, writer and director Stephen Tobolowsky, whom she met while they were students at Southern Methodist University.  Their relationship ended in 1988. She is currently in a relationship with cherry farmer and playwright Frank Levering. Tobolowsky, Stephen.
