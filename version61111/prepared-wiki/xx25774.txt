==History==

In 1796, Poland Township was the first charted township in the Connecticut Western Reserve, being the southeasternmost portion (Township 1, Range 1).  The township was founded by Jonathan Fowler, who fell in love with Yellow Creek which flows through Poland. Fowler owned an inn near the river which still stands as the oldest building in Poland. The historical buildings of Poland can be identified by a sign in the shape of Ohio located by the front door of the building.
The Village of Poland was founded in 1866.  Poland Seminary was originally a private secondary school, Poland Academy, and then a liberal arts college founded 200 years ago.  Its main building has been incorporated into Poland Middle School on College Street. The former medical school and law school is now a private residence also on College Street. Its dormitory is incorporated into the Poland Public Library on Main Street. Former distinguished faculty include the journalist Ida Tarbell.  
Poland is the home to the Poland Seminary High School Bulldogs. The girls softball team won the OHSAA Division II state championship in 2011.http://www.ohsaa.org/sports/sb/girls/2011/d2final11.htm OHSAA Softball Div. II Final
