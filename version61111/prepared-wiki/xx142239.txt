In a major shift in relations with both other Arab states and the Western world, Syria participated in the US-led Gulf War against Saddam Hussein. Syria participated in the multilateral Madrid Conference of 1991, and during the 1990s engaged in negotiations with Israel. These negotiations failed, and there have been no further direct Syrian-Israeli talks since President Hafez al-Assad's meeting with then President Bill Clinton in Geneva in March 2000.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.forward.com/articles/7655/ |title=Syria Makes Overture Over Negotiations – Forward.com |publisher=Forward.com |author=Marc Perelman |date=11 July 2003 |accessdate=25 October 2008[/tpl] [[File:Syrian civil war 2.png|thumb|right|300px|Current military situation in Syria.

Hafez al-Assad died on 10 June 2000. His son, Bashar al-Assad, was elected President in an election in which he ran unopposed. His election saw the birth of the Damascus Spring and hopes of reform, but by autumn 2001 the authorities had suppressed the movement, imprisoning some of its leading intellectuals.[tpl]cite book|last=George|first=Alan|title=Syria: neither bread nor freedom|year=2003|publisher=Zed Books|location=London|isbn=1-84277-213-9|pages=56–58|url=http://books.google.com/?id=dFdbVVcKsSIC&printsec=frontcover[/tpl] Instead, reforms have been limited to some market reforms.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.meforum.org/683/syrian-reform-what-lies-beneath |first=Farid N. |last=Ghadry |title=Syrian Reform: What Lies Beneath |date=Winter 2005 |publisher=The Middle East Quarterly [/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2579331.stm |title= Profile: Syria's Bashar al-Assad  |date=Last Updated: |accessdate=25 October 2008 | work=BBC News[/tpl]

==Geography==

Syria lies between latitudes 32° and 38° N, and longitudes 35° and 43° E. It consists mostly of arid plateau, although the northwest part of the country bordering the Mediterranean is fairly green. The Northeast of the country "Al Jazira" and the South "Hawran" are important agricultural areas.[tpl]cite book |last = National Council of Geography Teachers (U.S.)|title = The Journal of Geography |publisher = The Journal of geography |year = 1928 |page = 167[/tpl] The Euphrates, Syria's most important river, crosses the country in the east. It is considered to be one of the fifteen states that comprise the so-called "Cradle of civilization".[tpl]cite book |last =  F. A. Schaeffer |first = Claude |title = Syria and the Cradle of Civilization: The Findings of Claude F a Schaeffer in Ras Shamra |publisher = Trubner & Company |year = 2003 |isbn = 1-84453-129-5 [/tpl]
The climate in Syria is dry and hot, and winters are mild. Because of the country's elevation, snowfall does occasionally occur during winter. Petroleum in commercial quantities was first discovered in the northeast in 1956. The most important oil fields are those of Suwaydiyah, Qaratshui, Rumayian, and Tayyem, near Dayr az–Zawr. The fields are a natural extension of the Iraqi fields of Mosul and Kirkuk. Petroleum became Syria's leading natural resource and chief export after 1974. Natural gas was discovered at the field of Jbessa in 1940.

==Politics and government==

[tpl]Main|Politics of Syria[/tpl] [tpl]See also|Syrian civil war[/tpl]
Syria is formally a unitary republic. The constitution adopted in 2012 effectively transformed Syria into a semi-presidential republic due to the constitutional right for individuals to be elected which do not form part of the National Progressive Front.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/81771718/Qordoba-Translation-of-the-Syrian-Constitution-Modifications-15-2-2012 |title=Constitution of Syria.

The executive branch consists of the president, two vice presidents, the prime minister, and the Council of Ministers (cabinet). The constitution requires the president to be a Muslim[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/sy00000_.html |title=Constitution of Syria |accessdate=22 October 2008[/tpl] but does not make Islam the state religion.
The constitution gives the president the right to appoint ministers, to declare war and state of emergency, to issue laws (which, except in the case of emergency, require ratification by the People's Council), to declare amnesty, to amend the constitution, and to appoint civil servants and military personnel.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/outofdate/bgn/syria/85051.htm |title=Syria (05/07) |publisher=State.gov |accessdate=25 October 2008[/tpl] According to the 2012 constitution, the president is elected by Syrian citizens in a direct election.
Syria's legislative branch is the unicameral People's Council. Under the previous constitution, Syria did not hold multi-party elections for the legislature, with two thirds of the seats automatically allocated to the ruling coalition.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/index.cfm?fa=view&id=21265 |title=Syria: Elections without Politics |publisher=Carnegie Endowment[/tpl] On 7 May 2012, Syria held its first elections in which parties outside the ruling coalition could take part. Seven new political parties took part in the elections, of which Popular Front for Change and Liberation was the largest opposition party. The armed anti-government rebels, however, chose not to field candidates and called on their supporters to boycott the elections.
The President is the Secretary-General of the party, and the leader of the National Progressive Front governing coalition. Outside of the coalition are 14 illegal Kurdish political parties.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3774055.stm |title=Syria clamps down on Kurd parties |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=22 October 2008 | date=3 June 2004[/tpl]
Syria's judicial branches include the Supreme Constitutional Court, the High Judicial Council, the Court of Cassation, and the State Security Courts. Islamic jurisprudence is a main source of legislation and Syria's judicial system has elements of Ottoman, French, and Islamic laws. Syria has three levels of courts: courts of first instance, courts of appeals, and the constitutional court, the highest tribunal. Religious courts handle questions of personal and family law. The Supreme State Security Court (SSSC) was abolished by President Bashar al-Assad by legislative decree No. 53 on 21 April 2011.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sana.sy/eng/21/2011/04/22/pr-342711.htm |title=Decrees on Ending State of Emergency, Abolishing SSSC, Regulating Right to Peaceful Demonstration |publisher=Syrian Arab News Agency |date=2011-04-22 |accessdate=2013-01-30[/tpl]

As a result of the ongoing civil war, various alternative governments were formed, including the Syrian Interim Government, the Democratic Union Party and localised regions governed by sharia law. Representatives of the Syrian Interim government were invited to take up Syria's seat at the Arab League on 28 March 2013 and was recognised as the "sole representative of the Syrian people" by several nations including the United States, United Kingdom and France.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-20406562 |title=Syria conflict: UK recognises opposition, says William Hague |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2012-11-20 |accessdate=2013-08-28[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Hugh Schofield |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-20319787 |title=Syria: France backs anti-Assad coalition |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2012-11-13 |accessdate=2013-08-28[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Madhani|first=Aamer|title=Obama says U.S. will recognize Syrian opposition|url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2012/12/11/al-nusra-designated-terrorists/1760755/|newspaper=USA Today|date=December 12, 2012[/tpl]

===Human rights===

The situation for human rights in Syria has long been a significant concern among independent organizations such as Human Rights Watch, who in 2010 referred to the country's record as "among the worst in the world."[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/01/24/us-syria-rights-idUSTRE70N5S620110124 |title=Syria among worst for rights abuses: HRW report |date=24 January 2011 |publisher=Reuters [/tpl] Freedom House ranked Syria "Not Free" in its annual Freedom in the World survey.
The authorities are accused of arresting democracy and human rights activists, censoring websites, detaining bloggers, and imposing travel bans. Arbitrary detention, torture, and disappearances are widespread.[tpl]cite web|title=Syria: Events of 2008|url=http://www.hrw.org/en/node/79303|publisher=Human Rights Watch[/tpl] Although Syria's constitution guarantees gender equality, critics say that personal statutes laws and the penal code discriminate against women and girls. Moreover, it also grants leniency for so-called 'Honour killing'. As of 9 November 2011 during the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad, the United Nations reported that of the over 3500 total deaths, over 250 deaths were children as young as 2 years old, and that boys as young as 11 years old have been gang raped by security services officers.[tpl]cite news | url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203935604577066623669457632.html |title=More than 250 children among dead, U.N. says |author=Joe Lauria |publisher=The Wall Street Journal |date=29 November 2011 |accessdate=29 November 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/11/28/world/meast/syria-un-report/index.html |title=UN report: Syrian forces commit 'gross violations' of human rights, CNN |date=29 November 2011[/tpl]

In August 2013 the government was suspected of using chemical weapons against its civilians. US Secretary of State John Kerry said it was "undeniable" that chemical weapons had been used in the country and that President Bashar al-Assad's forces had committed a "moral obscenity" against his own people. "Make no mistake," Kerry said. "President Obama believes there must be accountability for those who would use the world's most heinous weapon against the world's most vulnerable people. Nothing today is more serious, and nothing is receiving more serious scrutiny".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/26/syria-us-un-inspection-kerry |title=Iran warns west against military intervention in Syria|publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=2013-08-28[/tpl]
The Emergency Law, effectively suspending most constitutional protections, was in effect from 1963 until 21 April 2011. It was justified by the government in the light of the continuing war with Israel over the Golan Heights.

===Military===

The President of Syria is commander in chief of the Syrian armed forces, comprising some 400,000 troops upon mobilization. The military is a conscripted force; males serve in the military upon reaching the age of 18.[tpl]cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/syria/overview.htm |title=Syria – Overview |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |accessdate=2013-01-30[/tpl] The obligatory military service period is being decreased over time, in 2005 from two and a half years to two years, in 2008 to 21 months and in 2011 to year and a half.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/xinhua/2011-03-20/content_2068776.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110503190742/http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/xinhua/2011-03-20/content_2068776.html|archivedate=2011-05-03 |title=Syria reduces compulsory military service by three months |publisher=Chinadaily.com.cn |date=20 March 2011 |accessdate=23 April 2011[/tpl] About 20,000 Syrian soldiers were deployed in Lebanon until 27 April 2005, when the last of Syria's troops left the country after three decades.
The breakup of the Soviet Union—long the principal source of training, material, and credit for the Syrian forces—may have slowed Syria's ability to acquire modern military equipment. It has an arsenal of surface-to-surface missiles. In the early 1990s, Scud-C missiles with a 500-kilometer range were procured from North Korea, and Scud-D, with a range of up to 700 kilometers, is allegedly being developed by Syria with the help of North Korea and Iran, according to Zisser."Syria's embrace of WMD"[tpl]dead link|date=January 2013[/tpl] by Eyal Zisser, Globe and Mail, 28 September 2004 (link leads only to abstract; purchase necessary for full article).
Syria received significant financial aid from Persian Gulf Arab states as a result of its participation in the Persian Gulf War, with a sizable portion of these funds earmarked for military spending.

===Foreign relations===

Ensuring national security, increasing influence among its Arab neighbors, and securing the return of the Golan Heights, are the primary goals of President Bashar al-Assad's foreign policy. At many points in its history, Syria has seen virulent tension with its geographically cultural neighbors, such as Turkey, Israel, Iraq, and Lebanon. Syria enjoyed an improvement in relations with several of the states in its region in the 21st century, prior to the Arab Spring and the Syrian civil war.
Since the ongoing civil war of 2011, and associated killings and human rights abuses, Syria has been increasingly isolated from the countries in the region, and the wider international community. Diplomatic relations have been severed with several countries including: Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Germany, Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, the United States, Belgium, Spain, and the Gulf States.[tpl]cite web|last=Strenger |first=Carlo |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/middle-east/assad-takes-a-page-out-of-russia-s-book-in-his-war-against-rebels-1.411789 |title=Assad takes a page out of Russia's book in his war against rebels|publisher=Haaretz.com |date=2012-02-08 |accessdate=2013-01-15[/tpl]
From the Arab league, Syria continues to maintain diplomatic relations with Algeria, Egypt, Iraq, Lebanon, Sudan and Yemen. Syria's violence against civilians has also seen it suspended from the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation in 2012. Syria continues to foster good relations with her traditional allies, Iran, China, Venezuela and Russia, who are among the few countries which have supported the Syrian government in its conflict with the Syrian opposition.
Syria considers the Hatay Province of Turkey as part of its own territory.
Israel unilaterally annexed the Golan Heights in 1981, although the Syrian government continues to demand the return of this territory.
The Syrian occupation of Lebanon began in 1976 as a result of the civil war and ended in April 2006 in response to domestic and international pressure after the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister, Rafik Hariri.
Syria is included in the European Union's European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) which aims at bringing the EU and its neighbours closer.

===Administrative divisions===

Syria is divided into 14 governorates, which are sub-divided into 61 districts, which are further divided into sub-districts.

===Internet and telecommunications===

The Telecommunications in Syria are overseen by the Ministry of Communications and Technology.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.moct.gov.sy/moct/?q=ar |title=وزارة الاتصالات والتقانة |publisher=Moct.gov.sy |accessdate=2013-08-28[/tpl] In addition, Syrian Telecom plays an integral role in the distribution of government internet access.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ste.gov.sy/ |title=AT&T – 4G LTE, Cell Phones, U-verse, TV, Internet & Phone Service |publisher=Ste.gov.sy |accessdate=2013-08-28[/tpl] The Syrian Electronic Army serves as a pro-government military faction in cyberspace and has been long considered an enemy of the hacktivist group Anonymous.[tpl]cite web|last=Katerji |first=Oz |url=http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/the-syrian-electronic-army-hacked-the-bbc |title=The Syrian Electronic Army Are at Cyber War with Anonymous|publisher=Vice.com |date=2013-04-04 |accessdate=2013-08-28[/tpl] Because of internet censorship laws, 13,000 internet activists have been arrested between March 2011 and August 2012.[tpl]cite web|url=http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-007-5860-5_21#page-1 |title=Internet Anonymity in Syria, Challenges and Solution|publisher=Link.springer.com |accessdate=2013-08-28[/tpl]

==Economy==

Syria is classified by the World Bank as a "lower middle income country."[tpl]cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/about/country-classifications/country-and-lending-groups |title=Country and Lending Groups |publisher=Data.worldbank.org |accessdate=26 July 2012[/tpl] Syria remains dependent on the oil and agriculture sectors.[tpl]cite web|title=Syria Country Brief, September 2010|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTSYRIANARAB/Resources/Syria_Web_brief.pdf|publisher=World Bank[/tpl] The oil sector provides about 40% of export earnings. In addition, proven offshore expeditions have indicated that large sums of oil exist on the Mediterranean Sea floor between Syria and Cyprus.http://books.google.com/books?id=iW9VAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA209&dq=syria+sulfur+mining&hl=en&sa=X&ei=SAHtUt_tHciWyAHuuIDgCQ&ved=0CDcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=syria%20sulfur%20mining&f=false The agriculture sector contributes to about 20% of GDP and 20% of employment. Oil reserves are expected to decrease in the coming years and Syria has already become a net oil importer. Since the civil war began, the economy shrank by 35%, and the Syrian pound has fallen to one-sixth of its prewar value.[tpl]cite news|title=Syria Weighs Its Tactics as Pillars of Its Economy Continue to Crumble|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/14/world/middleeast/government-in-syria-searches-for-answers-as-economy-crumbles.html|accessdate=13 July 2013|newspaper=NYTimes.com|date=13 July 2013[/tpl] The government increasingly relies on credit from Iran, Russia and China.
The economy is highly regulated by the government, which has increased subsidies and tightened trade controls to assuage protesters and protect foreign currency reserves. Long-run economic constraints include foreign trade barriers, declining oil production, high unemployment, rising budget deficits, and increasing pressure on water supplies caused by heavy use in agriculture, rapid population growth, industrial expansion, and water pollution. The UNDP announced in 2005 that 30% of the Syrian population lives in poverty and 11.4% live below the subsistence level.
Syria's main exports include crude oil, refined products, raw cotton, clothing, fruits, and grains. The bulk of Syrian imports are raw materials essential for industry, vehicles, agricultural equipment, and heavy machinery. Earnings from oil exports as well as remittances from Syrian workers are the government's most important sources of foreign exchange.
Syria’s share in global exports has eroded gradually since 2001. The real per capita GDP growth was just 2.5% per year in the 2000–2008 period. Unemployment is high at above 10%. Poverty rates have increased from 11% in 2004 to 12.3% in 2007.[tpl]cite web|title=Economic Challenges and Reform Options for Syria: A Growth Diagnostics Report|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTDEBTDEPT/Resources/468980-1218567884549/5289593-1224797529767/5506237-1270144995464/DFSG03SyriaFR.pdf|publisher=World Bank|page=10|date=2011-02-21[/tpl]
Political instability poses a significant threat to future economic development. Foreign investment is constrained by violence, government restrictions, economic sanctions, and international isolation. Syria’s economy also remains hobbled by state bureaucracy, falling oil production, rising budget deficits, and inflation.[tpl]cite web|title=Syria|url=http://www.heritage.org/index/country/syria|publisher=Index of Economic Freedom[/tpl]
Prior to the civil war in 2011, the government hoped to attract new investment in the tourism, natural gas, and service sectors to diversify its economy and reduce its dependence on oil and agriculture. The government began to institute economic reforms aimed at liberalizing most markets, but those reforms were slow and ad hoc, and have been completely reversed since the outbreak of conflict in 2011.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/04/us-syria-economy-socialist-idUSBRE8630FA20120704 |title=Syria reverts to socialist economic policies to ease tension |publisher= Reuters |date=4 July 2012|accessdate=27 October 2012[/tpl]

===Petroleum industry===

Syria has produced heavy-grade oil from fields located in the northeast since the late 1960s. In the early 1980s, light-grade, low-sulphur oil was discovered near Deir ez-Zor in eastern Syria. Syria's rate of oil production has decreased dramatically from a peak close to [tpl]convert|600,000|oilbbl/d|m3/d[/tpl] (bpd) in 1995 down to less than [tpl]convert|140,000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on[/tpl] in 2012.[tpl]cite web|title=Syria says preparing to finalize oil deal with Russia|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/21/us-russia-syria-oil-idUSBRE87K0U620120821|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=28 August 2012[/tpl]
Syria exported roughly [tpl]convert|200000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on[/tpl] in 2005, and oil still accounts for a majority of the country's export income. Syria also produces 22 million cubic meters of gas per day, with estimated reserves around [tpl]convert|8.5|Tcuft|km3[/tpl]. While the government has begun to work with international energy companies in the hopes of eventually becoming a gas exporter, all gas currently produced is consumed domestically.
Prior to the uprising, more than 90% of Syrian oil exports were to EU countries, with the remainder going to Turkey. Oil and gas revenues constituted around 20% of total GDP and 25% of total government revenue.[tpl]cite web|title=The Syrian Economy: Hanging by a Thread|url=http://carnegieendowment.org/2012/06/20/syrian-economy-hanging-by-thread/dwq7|publisher=Carnegie Endowment for International Peace|date=June 20, 2012[/tpl]

Arabic is the official language. Several modern Arabic dialects are used in everyday life, most notably Levantine in the west and Mesopotamian in the northeast. Kurdish (in its Kurmanji form) is widely spoken in the Kurdish regions of Syria. Armenian and Turkish (South Azeri dialect) are spoken among the Armenian and Turkmen minorities.
Aramaic was the lingua franca of the region before the advent of Arabic, and is still spoken among Assyrians, and Classical Syriac is still used as the liturgical language of various Syriac Christian denominations. Most remarkably, Western Neo-Aramaic is still spoken in the village of Ma`loula as well as two neighboring villages, 35 miles (56 km) northeast of Damascus.
Many educated Syrians also speak English and French.

===Arts===

The literature of Syria has contributed to Arabic literature and has a proud tradition of oral and written poetry. Syrian writers, many of whom migrated to Egypt, played a crucial role in the nahda or Arab literary and cultural revival of the 19th century. Prominent contemporary Syrian writers include, among others, Adonis, Muhammad Maghout, Haidar Haidar, Ghada al-Samman, Nizar Qabbani and Zakariyya Tamer.
Ba'ath Party rule, since the 1966 coup, has brought about renewed censorship. In this context, the genre of the historical novel, spearheaded by Nabil Sulayman, Fawwaz Haddad, Khyri al-Dhahabi and Nihad Siris, is sometimes used as a means of expressing dissent, critiquing the present through a depiction of the past. Syrian folk narrative, as a subgenre of historical fiction, is imbued with magical realism, and is also used as a means of veiled criticism of the present. Salim Barakat, a Syrian émigré living in Sweden, is one of the leading figures of the genre. Contemporary Syrian literature also encompasses science fiction and futuristic utopiae (Nuhad Sharif, Talib Umran), which may also serve as media of dissent.

===Popular culture===

The Syrian music scene, in particular that of Damascus, has long been among the Arab world's most important, especially in the field of classical Arab music. Syria has produced several pan-Arab stars, including Asmahan, Farid al-Atrash and singer Lena Chamamyan. The city of Aleppo is known for its muwashshah, a form of Andalous sung poetry popularized by Sabri Moudallal, as well as for popular stars like Sabah Fakhri.
Television was first introduced to Syria in 1960, when Syria and Egypt (which adopted television that same year) were part of the United Arab Republic. It broadcast in black and white until 1976. Syrian soap operas have considerable market penetration throughout the eastern Arab world.[tpl]cite book |last = Salti |first = Rasha |title = Insights Into Syrian Cinema: Essays and Conversations with Contemporary Filmmakers |publisher = ArteEast |year = 2006 |isbn = 1-892494-70-1 [/tpl]

===Sports===

The most popular sports in Syria are football, basketball, swimming, and tennis. Damascus was home to the fifth and seventh Pan Arab Games. Many popular football teams are based in Damascus, Aleppo, Homs, Latakia, etc.
The Abbasiyyin Stadium in Damascus is home to the Syrian national football team. The team enjoyed some success, having qualified for four Asian Cup competitions. The team had its first international on 20 November 1949, losing to Turkey 7–0. The team was ranked 138th in the world by FIFA as of May 2013.

===Cuisine===

Linked to the region of Syria where a specific dish has originated, Syrian cuisine is rich and varied in its ingredients. Syrian food mostly consists of Southern Mediterranean, Greek, and Southwest Asian dishes. Some Syrian dishes also evolved from Turkish and French cooking: dishes like shish kebab, stuffed zucchini, yabra' (stuffed grape leaves, the word yapra' derıves from the Turkish word 'yaprak' meaning leaf).
The main dishes that form Syrian cuisine are kibbeh, hummus, tabbouleh, fattoush, labneh, shawarma, mujaddara, shanklish, pastırma, sujuk and baklava. Baklava is made of filo pastry filled with chopped nuts and soaked in honey. Syrians often serve selections of appetizers, known as meze, before the main course. Za'atar, minced beef, and cheese manakish are popular hors d'œuvres. The Arabic flatbread khubz is always eaten together with meze.
Drinks in Syria vary, depending on the time of the day and the occasion. Arabic coffee, also known as Turkish coffee, is the most well-known hot drink, usually prepared in the morning at breakfast or in the evening. It is usually served for guests or after food. Arak, an alcoholic drink, is also a well-known beverage served mostly on special occasions. More examples of Syrian beverages include Ayran, Jallab, White coffee, and a locally manufactured beer called Al Shark.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/travel/2009/1015/damascus.html|title=Damascus|date=15 October 2009|publisher=RTÉ|accessdate=26 November 2009[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2013[/tpl]
