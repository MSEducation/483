Whiplash is an American thrash metal/speed metal band. The band was founded in 1984 in Passaic, New Jersey by the three Tonys:  Tony Portaro (vocals, guitar), Tony Scaglione (drums) and Tony Bono (bass). This lineup recorded their debut album Power And Pain for Roadrunner Records in 1985. Joe Cangelosi replaced Tony Scaglione in 1986 when he left for a seven-week tour with Slayer. Joe Cangelosi recorded Ticket To Mayhem in 1987 with the two Tonys. In 1989, Glenn Hansen joined the band as the new singer for the album titled Insult to Injury.  The band split up due to business reasons, but reunited in 1996 after Portaro and Scaglione joined forces in a revamped lineup of Billy Milano's M.O.D. for a European tour. Whiplash released two further albums, Cult of One and Sit, Stand, Kneel, Prey before the three Tonys recorded a final album together in 1998, Thrashback.  
Bassist Tony Bono died in 2002 after suffering a heart attack, at the age of 38.
In 2009, founding member Tony Portaro and Joe Cangelosi reformed the band, adding bassist Rich Day, and recorded Unborn Again, released in September 2009.
