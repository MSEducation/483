Salesman is a 1969 direct cinema documentary film directed by brothers Albert and David Maysles, and Charlotte Zwerin.[tpl]imdb title|id=0064921|title=Salesman[/tpl].

==Synopsis==

The documentary follows four salesmen as they travel across New England and southeast Florida trying to sell expensive Bibles door-to-door in low-income neighborhoods and attend a meeting in Chicago. The film focuses in particular on the struggles of salesman Paul Brennan, a middle-aged Irish-American Catholic from Jamaica Plain, Boston, who struggles to maintain his sales.

==Interviews and the salesmen==

==Production==

The Maysles brothers decided they wanted to be the first to make a nonfiction feature film (which turned out to be “Salesman") after learning that Truman Capote had made the claim that his newly released book “In Cold Blood” was a nonfiction novel. The film was made on a low budget; just under seven minutes into the film, one of the two cameras used can be seen in shot.  The handheld microphone used to record the film's sound is visible in other shots.
The Maysles brothers had themselves been door-to-door salesmen in the past, selling everything from cosmetics to encyclopedias. While filming, they became part of the pitch, telling those who let the salesmen and the camera crew into their homes that they were now part of "a human interest story." http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/124-salesman
Elements of popular culture that appear as backdrops to the main story include the song "If I Were a Rich Man", from Fiddler on the Roof; a recorded orchestral performance of The Beatles' song "Yesterday"; The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson; and televised boxing matches.
As stated in the closing credits,
Salesman was filmed in January 1967 (perhaps also late December 1966) and bears a copyright date of 1968.

==Reception==

===Critical response===

The film was first released, Vincent Canby, film critic for The New York Times, lauded the film and wrote, "...the documentary feature about four door-to-door Bible salesmen who move horizontally through the capitalistic dream. It's such a fine, pure picture of a small section of American life that I can't imagine its ever seeming irrelevant, either as a social document or as one of the best examples of what's called cinema vérité or direct cinema...It is fact, photographed and recorded with extraordinarily mobile camera and sound equipment, and then edited and carefully shaped into a kind of cinematic mural of faces, words, motel rooms, parlors, kitchens, streets, television images, radio music—even weather."Canby, Vincent. The New York Times, film review, April 18, 1969.  Last accessed: May 9, 2008 Documentary filmmaker James Blue once said of Albert Maysles that, “his cinema is one in which ethics and aesthetics are interdependent, where beauty starts with honesty, where a cut or a change in camera angle can become not only a possible aesthetic error, but also a ‘sin’ against truth.” http://www.albany.edu/writers-inst/webpages4/filmnotes/fns99n5.html
Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune listed Salesman as one of the ten best films of 1970.Siskel and Ebert Top Ten Lists. Retrieved March 17, 2013.
