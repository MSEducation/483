The Aztec Motel, also known as the Aztec Auto Court or Aztec Lodge, was a historic motel located on former U.S. Route 66 in the Upper Nob Hill neighborhood of Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States. It was demolished in 2011 despite being the oldest continuously-operating Route 66 motel in New Mexico[tpl]cite news | last=Linthicum | first=Leslie | title=History Takes a Lick on Route 66 | newspaper=Albuquerque Journal | date=June 16, 2011 | location=NM | page=A1 |url=http://www.abqjournal.com/main/2011/06/16/upfront/history-takes-a-lick-on-route-66.html[/tpl] and "one of the five most important motels left" in Albuquerque.[tpl]cite news | last=Tomlin|first=Alex | title=Historic Route 66 motel demolished | url=http://www.krqe.com/dpp/news/historic-route-66-motel-demolished | accessdate=16 August 2011 | newspaper=KRQE News | date=June 10, 2011 | location=NM[/tpl]
The motel was built in 1932 as the first of what would eventually be dozens of auto courts lining Central Avenue.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/route66/aztec_auto_court_albuquerque.html |title=Aztec Auto Court|publisher=US National Park Service[/tpl] It was listed on the New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties[tpl]cite web | title=Properties by County | url=http://www.nmhistoricpreservation.org/documents/PropertiesByCounty.pdf | publisher=New Mexico Department of Cultural Affairs | accessdate=29 April 2011[/tpl]  and the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. The building was well known locally for its exterior decorations, which consisted of hundreds of found objects assembled in the 1990s by a resident of the motel. The work was described in the Albuquerque Journal as a "beloved local folk art installation".
The Aztec Motel was razed in early June 2011. The motel's owner cited its deteriorating condition and high maintenance costs as reasons for the demolition, estimating the building would cost $1 million to renovate. The motel's neon sign was preserved and will become part of any future development on the site.
