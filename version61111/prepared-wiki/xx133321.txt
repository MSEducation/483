Starting on the district council level as a vice chairman, he rose through the political ranks, being elected as an Member of Provincial Assembly (MPA), a Member of the National Assembly (MNA) and then being appointed advisor to the Governor. He assumed the post of Agriculture Minister Punjab in 1971. A member of the Pakistan Peoples Party he was chosen by Prime Minister Bhutto as Governor of the Punjab, a post he held from November 1973 to March 1975.

After the ouster of the Bhutto government in 1977, Sadiq Hussain Qureshi retired from active politics.

Despite offers during his later years he never held an elected office or participated in active politics again.
