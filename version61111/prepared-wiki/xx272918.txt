Almost Legendary is an American pop band from Atlanta, Georgia that was formed in 2009. The band has four members; lead vocalist and bassist Mark Coryell, guitarist and backup vocalist Chris Nixon, guitarist and keyboardist Brian O'Connor, and drummer Ryan Fox. Pulling from the influence of the late 50's pop-punk sound and the currently popular electronic dance songs, Almost Legendary has developed a unique combination of the two styles. On September 2, 2011, Almost Legendary self-released their debut 3 song EP titled Bright Lights, and played on the 2011 Vans Warped Tour.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.almostlegendarymusic.com/bios |title=Almost Legendary |deadurl=no |accessdate=May 26, 2013[/tpl]
