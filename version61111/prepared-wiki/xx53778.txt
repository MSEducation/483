==Legacy==

One of the first townsites in Dakota Territory is named after Medary.  The town of Medaryville, Indiana was also named after him. In North Columbus, Ohio (annexed to the city of Columbus in the late 1800s) a street dating back to the early 1900s Medary Avenue was named for him. Because Columbus Public Schools names its schools for the street on which they are located, Medary Elementary School also carried his surname.
Medary was buried at Greenlawn Cemetery, Columbus, Ohio.
