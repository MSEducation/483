==Pulmonary Hypertension==

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a cardiovascular disease characterized by a resting mean pulmonary arterial pressure exceeding 25 mmHg, or more than 30 mmHg during exercise.Badesch, D.B., Champion, H.C., Sanchez, M.A.G., Hoeper, M.M., Hoyd, J.E., Manes, A., McGoon, M., Naeije, R., Olschewski, H., Oudiz, R.J., and Torbicki, A. (2009). Diagnosis and Assessment of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension. Journal of the American College of Cardiology. 54:55-66. It arises from the pulmonary vascular remodeling accompanied by endothelial dysfunction, fibroblast activation, and endothelial cellular proliferation. Symptoms of PH include shortness of breath, chronic fatigue, dizziness, peripheral edema, cyanosis, and chest pain. If untreated, PH could lead to heart failure and death.Zeller, J.L., Burke, A.E., and Glass, R.M. (2008). Pulmonary Hypertension. The Journal of the American Medical Association. 299:3. PH is divided into 5 classifications: arterial, venous, hypoxemia, thromboembolic, and miscellaneous.Simonneau, G., Galie, M., Rubin, L.J., Langleben, D., Seeger, W., Domenighetti, G., Gibbs, S., Lebrec, D., Speich, R., Beghetti, M., Rich, S., and Fishman, A. (2004). Clinical Classification of Pulmonary Hypertension. Journal of the American College of Cardiology. 43:5-12.

==Molecular Mechanism==

Fasudil (HA-1077) is a selective RhoA/Rho kinase(ROCK) inhibitor.Nagumo, H., Sasaki, Y., Ono, Y., Okamato, H., Seto, M., and Takuwa, Y. (2000). Rho kinase inhibitor HA-1077 prevents Rho-mediated myosin phosphatase inhibition in smooth muscle cells. American Journal of Physiology. 278: C57-C65. ROCK is an enzyme that plays an important role in mediating vasoconstriction and vascular remodeling in the pathogenesis of PH. ROCK induces vasoconstriction by phosphorylating the myosin-binding subunit of myosin light chain (MLC) phosphatase, thus decreasing MLC phosphatase activity and enhancing vascular smooth muscle contraction.

===Angiotensin-converting Enzyme (ACE) expression and Angiotensin-II (Ang-II) levels===

ACE is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of Angiotensin-I (Ang-I) to Angiotensin-II (Ang-II). Ang-II is a peptide hormone which increases blood pressure by initiating vasoconstriction and aldosterone secretion. ROCK increases ACE expression and activity in PH. By inhibiting ROCK with fasudil, circulating ACE and Ang-II are reduced, leading to a decrease in pulmonary vascular pressure.Ocaranze M.P., Prvera, P., Novoa, U., Pinto, M., Gonzalez, L., Chiong, M., Lavandero, S., and Jalil, J.E. (2011). Rho kinase inhibition activates the homologous angiotensin-converting enzyme-angiotensin-(1-9) axis in experimental hypertension. Journal of Hypertension. 29:706-715.

===Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase (eNOS) expression===

eNOS mediates the production of the vasodilator Nitric oxide (NO). Pulmonary arterial cell cultures treated with fasudil showed a significant increase in eNOS mRNA levels in a dose dependent manner, and the half-life of eNOS mRNA increased 2-folds. These findings suggested that ROCK inhibition with fasudil increases eNOS expression by stabilizing eNOS mRNA, which contributed to an increase of NO level to enhance vasodilation.Takemoto, M., Sun, J., Hiroko, J., Shimokawa, H., and Liao, J.K. (2002). Rho-Kinase Mediates Hypoxia-Induced Downregulation of Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase. Journal of the American Heart Association. 106:57-62.

===Extracellular signal-regulated kinase(ERK) activity and p27Kip1 levels===

The proliferative effects of ROCK on vascular endothelial cells is due to the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK).Liu, A., Ling, F., Wang, D., Wang, Q., Lu, X., and Liu, Y. (2011). Fasudil inhibits platelet-derived growth factor-induced human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell proliferation by up-regulation of p27kip1 via the ERK signal pathway. Chinese Medical Journal. 124:3098-3104. ERK mediates cell proliferation via the phosphorylation of p27Kip1, thus accelerating the degradation rate of p27Kip1.Delmas, C., Manenti, S., Boudjelal, A., Peyssonnaux, C., Eychene, A., and Darbon, J.R. (2001). The p42/p44 Mitoen-activated protein kinase activation triggers p27kip1 degradation independently of CDK2/Cyclin E in NIH 3T3 cells.The Journal of Biological Chemistry. 276:34958-34965. p27Kip1 is a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor which down-regulates cell cycle by binding cyclin-CDK complex.Rodman D.M., and Fouty, B.W. (2003). Mevastatin can cause G1 arrest and induce apoptosis in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells through a p27kip1-independent pathway. Journal of the American Heart Associations. 92:501-509. Human pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells treated with fasudil showed a decrease in cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Fasudil also decreases ERK activities, as well as increases level of p27Kip1. This suggested that the anti-proliferative effects of fasudil is due to the decrease of ERK activities via the inhibition of ROCK.
