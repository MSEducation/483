[[Epigenetics]]

CATEGORIES: Epigenetics, Genetic mapping

In biology, and specifically genetics, epigenetics is the study of heritable changes in gene activity that are not caused by changes in the DNA sequence; it also can be used to describe the study of stable, long-term alterations in the transcriptional potential of a cell that are not necessarily heritable. Unlike simple genetics based on changes to the DNA sequence (the genotype), the changes in gene expression or cellular phenotype of epigenetics have other causes, thus use of the term epi- (Greek: επί- over, outside of, around) -genetics.[tpl]Cite book |last= Spector |first= Tim |year= 2012 |title= Identically Different: Why You Can Change Your Genes |location= London |publisher= Weidenfeld & Nicolson |page= 8 |quote= Just over ten years ago researchers found that the diets of pregnant mothers could alter the behaviour of genes in their children and that these changes could last a lifetime and then be passed on in turn to their children. The genes were literally being switched on or off by a new mechanism we call epigenetics – meaning in Greek 'around the gene'. Contrary to traditional genetic dogma, these changes could be transferred to the next generation. In this case the mothers just happened to be rats, but recent similar findings in humans have created a revolution in our thinking. [/tpl]
The term also refers to the changes themselves: functionally relevant changes to the genome that do not involve a change in the nucleotide sequence. Examples of mechanisms that produce such changes are DNA methylation and histone modification, each of which alters how genes are expressed without altering the underlying DNA sequence. Gene expression can be controlled through the action of repressor proteins that attach to silencer regions of the DNA. These epigenetic changes may last through cell divisions for the duration of the cell's life, and may also last for multiple generations even though they do not involve changes in the underlying DNA sequence of the organism;[tpl]cite journal | author = Bird A | title = Perceptions of epigenetics | journal = Nature | volume = 447 | issue = 7143 | pages = 396–8 |date=May 2007 | pmid = 17522671 | doi = 10.1038/nature05913 |bibcode = 2007Natur.447..396B [/tpl] instead, non-genetic factors cause the organism's genes to behave (or "express themselves") differently.[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080501094940/http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/article_details.php?id=10140 |title=Special report: 'What genes remember' by Philip Hunter | Prospect Magazine May 2008 issue 146 |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=1 May 2008 |accessdate=26 July 2012[/tpl] (There are objections to the use of the term epigenetic to describe chemical modification of histone, since it remains unclear whether or not histone modifications are heritable.)[tpl]cite journal |author=Ledford H. |title=Disputed definitions |journal=Nature |year=2008 |volume=455 |issue=7216 |pages=1023–8 |pmid = 18948925 |doi=10.1038/4551023a [/tpl]
One example of an epigenetic change in eukaryotic biology is the process of cellular differentiation. During morphogenesis, totipotent stem cells become the various pluripotent cell lines of the embryo, which in turn become fully differentiated cells. In other words, as a single fertilized egg cell – the zygote – continues to divide, the resulting daughter cells change into all the different cell types in an organism, including neurons, muscle cells, epithelium, endothelium of blood vessels, etc., by activating some genes while inhibiting the expression of others.[tpl]cite journal | author = Reik W | title = Stability and flexibility of epigenetic gene regulation in mammalian development | journal = Nature | volume = 447 | issue = 7143 | pages = 425–32 |date=May 2007 | pmid = 17522676 | doi = 10.1038/nature05918 |bibcode = 2007Natur.447..425R [/tpl]
In 2011, it was demonstrated that the methylation of mRNA plays a critical role in human energy homeostasis. The obesity-associated FTO gene is shown to be able to demethylate N6-methyladenosine in RNA.

==Historical usage of "epigenetics"==

Epigenetics (as in "epigenetic landscape") was coined by C. H. Waddington in 1942 as a portmanteau of the words epigenesis and genetics.[tpl]cite journal|author=Waddington CH | title = The epigenotype| journal = Endeavour | volume = 1 | pages = 18–20 |doi= | year = 1942 [/tpl]  Epigenesis is an oldAccording to the Oxford English Dictionary: [tpl]quote | The word is used by W. Harvey, Exercitationes 1651, p. 148, and in the English Anatomical Exercitations 1653, p. 272. It is explained to mean ‘partium super-exorientium additamentum’, ‘the additament of parts budding one out of another’.[/tpl]  It is also worth quoting this adumbration of the definition given there (viz., "The formation of an organic germ as a new product"): [tpl]quote | theory of epigenesis: the theory that the germ is brought into existence (by successive accretions), and not merely developed, in the process of reproduction. ... The opposite theory was formerly known as the ‘theory of evolution’; to avoid the ambiguity of this name, it is now spoken of chiefly as the ‘theory of preformation’, sometimes as that of ‘encasement’ or ‘emboîtement’.[/tpl] word that has more recently been used (see preformationism for historical background) to describe the differentiation of cells from their initial totipotent state in embryonic development. When Waddington coined the term the physical nature of genes and their role in heredity was not known; he used it as a conceptual model of how genes might interact with their surroundings to produce a phenotype; he used the phrase "epigenetic landscape" as a metaphor for biological development.   Waddington held that cell fates were established in development much like a marble rolls down to the point of lowest local elevation.Waddington, Conrad H. 1953. The Epigenetics of birds. Cambridge University Press Waddington suggested visualising increasing irreversibility of cell type differentiation as ridges rising between the valleys where the marbles (cells) are travelling.http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14760651url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jez.b.20002 Hall BK. 2004. In search of evolutionary developmental mechanisms: the 30-year gap between 1944 and 1974. J Exp Zool B Mol Dev Evol. 15 January 2004;302(1):5-18. In recent times Waddington's notion of the epigenetic landscape has been rigorously formalized in the context of the systems dynamics state approach to the study of cell-fate.http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0003626url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0003626 Álvarez-Buylla ER, Chaos Á, Aldana M, Benítez M, Cortes-Poza Y, et al. 2008. Floral Morphogenesis: Stochastic Explorations of a Gene Network Epigenetic Landscape. PLoS ONE 3(11): e36265.
The term "epigenetics" has also been used in developmental psychology to describe psychological development as the result of an ongoing, bi-directional interchange between heredity and the environment.Gottlieb,G., (1991). Epigenetic systems view of human development. Developmental Psychology, 27(1), 33-34.   Interactivist ideas of development have been discussed in various forms and under various names throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. An early version was proposed, among the founding statements in embryology, by Karl Ernst von Baer and popularized by Ernst Haeckel. A radical epigenetic view (physiological epigenesis) was developed by Paul Wintrebert. Another variation, probabilistic epigenesis, was presented by Gilbert Gottlieb in 2003.Gilbert Gottlieb. Probabilistic epigenesis, Developmental Science 10:1 (2007), 1-11 This view encompasses all of the possible developing factors on an organism and how they not only influence the organism and each other but how the organism also influences its own development.
Noted developmental psychologist Erik Erikson used the term epigenetic principle in his book Identity: Youth and Crisis (1968), and used it to encompass the notion that we develop through an unfolding of our personality in predetermined stages, and that our environment and surrounding culture influence how we progress through these stages. This biological unfolding in relation to our socio-cultural settings is done in stages of psychosocial development, where "progress through each stage is in part determined by our success, or lack of success, in all the previous stages."Boeree, C. George, (1997/2006), Personality Theories, Erik Erikson[tpl]cite book|last=Erikson|first=Erik|title=Identity: Youth and Crisis|year=1968|publisher=W.W. Norton and Company, Inc.|location=Chapter 3|page=92[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bio-medicine.org/biology-definition/Epigenetics|title=Epigenetics|publisher= Bio-Medicine.org|accessdate=21 May 2011[/tpl]

==Contemporary usage of "epigenetics"==

Robin Holliday defined epigenetics as "the study of the mechanisms of temporal and spatial control of gene activity during the development of complex organisms."[tpl]cite journal | author = Holliday R | title = Mechanisms for the control of gene activity during development | journal = Biol Rev Camb Philos Soc | volume = 65 | issue = 4 | pages = 431–71 |date=November 1990 | pmid = 2265224 | doi =10.1111/j.1469-185X.1990.tb01233.x  [/tpl] Thus epigenetic can be used to describe anything other than DNA sequence that influences the development of an organism.
The more recent usage of the word in science has a stricter definition. It is, as defined by Arthur Riggs and colleagues, "the study of mitotically and/or meiotically heritable changes in gene function that cannot be explained by changes in DNA sequence."[tpl]cite book | author = Riggs AD, Russo VEA, Martienssen RA | title = Epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation | publisher = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press | location = Plainview, N.Y. | year = 1996 | pages = | isbn = 0-87969-490-4 | oclc = | doi = | accessdate = [/tpl][tpl]page needed|date=August 2013[/tpl] The Greek prefix epi- in epigenetics implies features that are "on top of" or "in addition to" genetics; thus epigenetic traits exist on top of or in addition to the traditional molecular basis for inheritance.
The term "epigenetics", however, has been used to describe processes which have not been demonstrated to be heritable such as histone modification; there are therefore attempts to redefine it in broader terms that would avoid the constraints of requiring heritability. For example, Sir Adrian Bird defined epigenetics as "the structural adaptation of chromosomal regions so as to register, signal or perpetuate altered activity states." This definition would be inclusive of transient modifications associated with DNA repair or cell-cycle phases as well as stable changes maintained across multiple cell generations, but exclude others such as templating of membrane architecture and prions unless they impinge on chromosome function. Such redefinitions however are not universally accepted and are still subject to dispute.  The NIH "Roadmap Epigenomics Project," ongoing as of 2013, uses the following definition: "Epigenetics is an emerging frontier of science that involves the study of changes in the regulation of gene activity and expression that are not dependent on gene sequence. For purposes of this program, epigenetics refers to both heritable changes in gene activity and expression (in the progeny of cells or of individuals) and also stable, long-term alterations in the transcriptional potential of a cell that are not necessarily heritable. While epigenetics refers to the study of single genes or sets of genes, epigenomics refers to more global analyses of epigenetic changes across the entire genome."NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Project  Overview
In 2008, a consensus definition of the epigenetic trait, "stably heritable phenotype resulting from changes in a chromosome without alterations in the DNA sequence", was made at a Cold Spring Harbor meeting.[tpl]cite journal | title=An operational definition of epigenetics | author=Berger SL, Kouzarides T, Shiekhattar R, Shilatifard A | year=2009 | journal=Genes Dev. | volume=23 | issue=7 | pages=781–3 | url=http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/23/7/781.full  | pmid=19339683 | doi=10.1101/gad.1787609[/tpl]
The similarity of the word to "genetics" has generated many parallel usages. The "epigenome" is a parallel to the word "genome", and refers to the overall epigenetic state of a cell. The phrase "genetic code" has also been adapted—the "epigenetic code" has been used to describe the set of epigenetic features that create different phenotypes in different cells. Taken to its extreme, the "epigenetic code" could represent the total state of the cell, with the position of each molecule accounted for in an epigenomic map, a diagrammatic representation of the gene expression, DNA methylation and histone modification status of a particular genomic region. More typically, the term is used in reference to systematic efforts to measure specific, relevant forms of epigenetic information such as the histone code or DNA methylation patterns.

==Molecular basis of epigenetics==

Epigenetic changes can modify the activation of certain genes, but not the sequence of DNA. Additionally, the chromatin proteins associated with DNA may be activated or silenced. This is why the differentiated cells in a multi-cellular organism express only the genes that are necessary for their own activity. Epigenetic changes are preserved when cells divide. Most epigenetic changes only occur within the course of one individual organism's lifetime, but, if gene inactivation occurs in a sperm or egg cell that results in fertilization, then some epigenetic changes can be transferred to the next generation.[tpl]cite journal | author = Chandler VL | title = Paramutation: from maize to mice | journal = Cell | volume = 128 | issue = 4 | pages = 641–5 |date=February 2007 | pmid = 17320501 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2007.02.007 [/tpl] This raises the question of whether or not epigenetic changes in an organism can alter the basic structure of its DNA (see Evolution, below), a form of Lamarckism.
Specific epigenetic processes include paramutation, bookmarking, imprinting, gene silencing, X chromosome inactivation, position effect, reprogramming, transvection, maternal effects, the progress of carcinogenesis, many effects of teratogens, regulation of histone modifications and heterochromatin, and technical limitations affecting parthenogenesis and cloning.
DNA damage can also cause epigenetic changes.[tpl]cite journal |author=Kovalchuk O, Baulch JE |title=Epigenetic changes and nontargeted radiation effects—is there a link? |journal=Environ. Mol.

Epigenetic research uses a wide range of molecular biologic techniques to further our understanding of epigenetic phenomena, including chromatin immunoprecipitation (together with its large-scale variants ChIP-on-chip and ChIP-Seq), fluorescent in situ hybridization, methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes, DNA adenine methyltransferase identification (DamID) and bisulfite sequencing. Furthermore, the use of bioinformatic methods is playing an increasing role (computational epigenetics).

==Mechanisms==

Several types of epigenetic inheritance systems may play a role in what has become known as cell memory,[tpl]cite journal | author = Jablonka E, Lamb MJ, Lachmann M | title = Evidence, mechanisms and models for the inheritance of acquired characteristics | journal = J.

Biol. |date=September 1992 | volume = 158 | issue = 2 | pages = 245–268 | doi = 10.1016/S0022-5193(05)80722-2 [/tpl] note however that not all of these are universally accepted to be examples of epigenetics.

===DNA methylation and chromatin remodeling===

Because the phenotype of a cell or individual is affected by which of its genes are transcribed, heritable transcription states can give rise to epigenetic effects. There are several layers of regulation of gene expression. One way that genes are regulated is through the remodeling of chromatin. Chromatin is the complex of DNA and the histone proteins with which it associates. Histone proteins are little spheres that DNA wraps around. If the way that DNA is wrapped around the histones changes, gene expression can change as well. Chromatin remodeling is accomplished through two main mechanisms:
The way that the cells stay differentiated in the case of DNA methylation is clearer to us than it is in the case of histone shape. Basically, certain enzymes (such as DNMT1) have a higher affinity for the methylated cytosine. If this enzyme reaches a "hemimethylated" portion of DNA (where methylcytosine is in only one of the two DNA strands) the enzyme will methylate the other half.
Although histone modifications occur throughout the entire sequence, the unstructured N-termini of histones (called histone tails) are particularly highly modified. These modifications include acetylation, methylation, ubiquitylation, phosphorylation, sumoylation, ribosylation and citrullination. Acetylation is the most highly studied of these modifications. For example, acetylation of the K14 and K9 lysines of the tail of histone H3 by histone acetyltransferase enzymes (HATs) is generally correlated with transcriptional competence.
One mode of thinking is that this tendency of acetylation to be associated with "active" transcription is biophysical in nature. Because it normally has a positively charged nitrogen at its end, lysine can bind the negatively charged phosphates of the DNA backbone. The acetylation event converts the positively charged amine group on the side chain into a neutral amide linkage. This removes the positive charge, thus loosening the DNA from the histone. When this occurs, complexes like SWI/SNF and other transcriptional factors can bind to the DNA and allow transcription to occur. This is the "cis" model of epigenetic function. In other words, changes to the histone tails have a direct effect on the DNA itself.
Another model of epigenetic function is the "trans" model. In this model changes to the histone tails act indirectly on the DNA. For example, lysine acetylation may create a binding site for chromatin modifying enzymes (and basal transcription machinery as well). This Chromatin Remodeler can then cause changes to the state of the chromatin. Indeed, the bromodomain — a protein segment (domain) that specifically binds acetyl-lysine — is found in many enzymes that help activate transcription, including the SWI/SNF complex (on the protein polybromo). It may be that acetylation acts in this and the previous way to aid in transcriptional activation.
The idea that modifications act as docking modules for related factors is borne out by histone methylation as well. Methylation of lysine 9 of histone H3 has long been associated with constitutively transcriptionally silent chromatin (constitutive heterochromatin). It has been determined that a chromodomain (a domain that specifically binds methyl-lysine) in the transcriptionally repressive protein HP1 recruits HP1 to K9 methylated regions. One example that seems to refute this biophysical model for methylation is that tri-methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 is strongly associated with (and required for full) transcriptional activation. Tri-methylation in this case would introduce a fixed positive charge on the tail.
It has been shown that the histone lysine methyltransferase (KMT) is responsible for this methylation activity in the pattern of histones H3 & H4. This enzyme utilizes a catalytically active site called the SET domain (Suppressor of variegation, Enhancer of zeste, Trithorax). The SET domain is a 130-amino acid sequence involved in modulating gene activities. This domain has been demonstrated to bind to the histone tail and causes the methylation of the histone.[tpl]cite journal | author = Jenuwein T, Laible G, Dorn R, Reuter G | title = SET domain proteins modulate chromatin domains in eu- and heterochromatin | journal = Cell. Mol. Life Sci. | volume = 54 | issue = 1 | pages = 80–93 |date=January 1998 | pmid = 9487389 | doi = 10.1007/s000180050127 [/tpl]
Differing histone modifications are likely to function in differing ways; acetylation at one position is likely to function differently from acetylation at another position. Also, multiple modifications may occur at the same time, and these modifications may work together to change the behavior of the nucleosome. The idea that multiple dynamic modifications regulate gene transcription in a systematic and reproducible way is called the histone code.

Epigenetic changes of this type thus have the potential to direct increased frequencies of permanent genetic mutation. DNA methylation patterns are known to be established and modified in response to environmental factors by a complex interplay of at least three independent DNA methyltransferases, DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B, the loss of any of which is lethal in mice.[tpl]cite journal | author = Li E, Bestor TH, Jaenisch R | title = Targeted mutation of the DNA methyltransferase gene results in embryonic lethality | journal = Cell | volume = 69 | issue = 6 | pages = 915–26 |date=June 1992 | pmid = 1606615 | doi = 10.1016/0092-8674(92)90611-F [/tpl] DNMT1 is the most abundant methyltransferase in somatic cells,[tpl]cite journal | author = Robertson KD, Uzvolgyi E, Liang G, Talmadge C, Sumegi J, Gonzales FA, Jones PA | title = The human DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) 1, 3a and 3b: coordinate mRNA expression in normal tissues and overexpression in tumors | journal = Nucleic Acids Res. | volume = 27 | issue = 11 | pages = 2291–8 |date=June 1999 | pmid = 10325416 | pmc = 148793 | doi =  10.1093/nar/27.11.2291[/tpl] localizes to replication foci,[tpl]cite journal | author = Leonhardt H, Page AW, Weier HU, Bestor TH | title = A targeting sequence directs DNA methyltransferase to sites of DNA replication in mammalian nuclei | journal = Cell | volume = 71 | issue = 5 | pages = 865–73 |date=November 1992 | pmid = 1423634 | doi = 10.1016/0092-8674(92)90561-P [/tpl]  has a 10–40-fold preference for hemimethylated DNA and interacts with the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA).[tpl]cite journal | author = Chuang LS, Ian HI, Koh TW, Ng HH, Xu G, Li BF | title = Human DNA-(cytosine-5) methyltransferase-PCNA complex as a target for p21WAF1 | journal = Science | volume = 277 | issue = 5334 | pages = 1996–2000 |date=September 1997 | pmid = 9302295 | doi = 10.1126/science.277.5334.1996 [/tpl]

Histones H3 and H4 can also be manipulated through demethylation using histone lysine demethylase (KDM). This recently identified enzyme has a catalytically active site called the Jumonji domain (JmjC). The demethylation occurs when JmjC utilizes multiple cofactors to hydroxylate the methyl group, thereby removing it. JmjC is capable of demethylating mono-, di-, and tri-methylated substrates.[tpl]cite journal | author = Nottke A, Colaiácovo MP, Shi Y | title = Developmental roles of the histone lysine demethylases | journal = Development | volume = 136 | issue = 6 | pages = 879–89 |date=March 2009 | pmid = 19234061 | pmc = 2692332 | doi = 10.1242/dev.020966 [/tpl]
Chromosomal regions can adopt stable and heritable alternative states resulting in bistable gene expression without changes to the DNA sequence.

Because DNA methylation and chromatin remodeling play such a central role in many types of epigenic inheritance, the word "epigenetics" is sometimes used as a synonym for these processes. However, this can be misleading. Chromatin remodeling is not always inherited, and not all epigenetic inheritance involves chromatin remodeling.[tpl]cite journal | author = Ptashne M | title = On the use of the word 'epigenetic' | journal = Curr. Biol. | volume = 17 | issue = 7 | pages = R233–6 |date=April 2007 | pmid = 17407749 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2007.02.030 [/tpl]
It has been suggested that the histone code could be mediated by the effect of small RNAs. The recent discovery and characterization of a vast array of small (21- to 26-nt), non-coding RNAs suggests that there is an RNA component, possibly involved in epigenetic gene regulation. Small interfering RNAs can modulate transcriptional gene expression via epigenetic modulation of targeted promoters.[tpl]cite book | author = Morris KL | title = RNA and the Regulation of Gene Expression: A Hidden Layer of Complexity | chapter = Epigenetic Regulation of Gene Expression | publisher = Caister Academic Press | location = Norfolk, England | year = 2008 | pages = | isbn = 1-904455-25-5 [/tpl][tpl]page needed|date=August 2013[/tpl]

===RNA transcripts and their encoded proteins===

Sometimes a gene, after being turned on, transcribes a product that (either directly or indirectly) maintains the activity of that gene. For example, Hnf4 and MyoD enhance the transcription of many liver- and muscle-specific genes, respectively, including their own, through the transcription factor activity of the proteins they encode. RNA signalling includes differential recruitment of a hierarchy of generic chromatin modifying complexes and DNA methyltransferases to specific loci by RNAs during differentiation and development.[tpl]cite journal | author = Mattick JS, Amaral PP, Dinger ME, Mercer TR, Mehler MF | title = RNA regulation of epigenetic processes | journal = BioEssays | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 51–9 |date=January 2009 | pmid = 19154003 | doi = 10.1002/bies.080099 [/tpl] Other epigenetic changes are mediated by the production of different splice forms of RNA, or by formation of double-stranded RNA (RNAi). Descendants of the cell in which the gene was turned on will inherit this activity, even if the original stimulus for gene-activation is no longer present. These genes are most often turned on or off by signal transduction, although in some systems where syncytia or gap junctions are important, RNA may spread directly to other cells or nuclei by diffusion. A large amount of RNA and protein is contributed to the zygote by the mother during oogenesis or via nurse cells, resulting in maternal effect phenotypes. A smaller quantity of sperm RNA is transmitted from the father, but there is recent evidence that this epigenetic information can lead to visible changes in several generations of offspring.[tpl]cite web | author= Choi CQ | title=The Scientist: RNA can be hereditary molecule | publisher = The Scientist | url=http://www.the-scientist.com/news/display/23494 | date=25 May 2006 | accessdate = 2006 [/tpl]

===MicroRNAs===

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are members of non-coding RNAs that range in size from 17 to 25 nucleotides. As indicated by Wang et al.,Wang Z, Yao H, Lin S, Zhu X, Shen Z, Lu G, Poon WS, Xie D, Lin MC, Kung HF (2012). Transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of human microRNAs" Cancer Lett 331(1) 1-10. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2012.12.006. PMID 3246373 miRNAs regulate a large variety of biological functions in plants and animals. So far, in 2013, about 2000 miRNAs have been discovered in humans and these can be found online in an miRNA database.http://www.mirbase.org/cgi-bin/browse.pl Each miRNA expressed in a cell may target about 100 to 200 messenger RNAs that it downregulates.Lim LP, Lau NC, Garrett-Engele P, Grimson A, Schelter JM, Castle J, Bartel DP, Linsley PS, Johnson JM (2005). Microarray analysis shows that some microRNAs downregulate large numbers of target mRNAs" Nature 433(7027) 769-773. [tpl]DOI|10.1038/nature03315[/tpl] PMID 15685193 Most of the downregulation of mRNAs occurs by causing the decay of the targeted mRNA, while some downregulation occurs at the level of translation into protein.Lee D, Shin C (2012).

It appears that about 60% of human protein coding genes are regulated by miRNAs.Friedman RC, Farh KK, Burge CB, Bartel DP (2009). Most mammalian mRNAs are conserved targets of microRNAs" Genome Res 19(1) 92-105. doi: 10.1101/gr.082701.108. PMID 18955434 Many miRNAs are epigenetically regulated. About 50% of miRNA genes are associated with CpG islands, that may be repressed by epigenetic methylation. Transcription from methylated CpG islands is strongly and heritably repressed.Goll MG, Bestor TH (2005). Eukaryotic cytosine methyltransferases" Annu Rev Biochem 74:481-514. PMID 15952895  Other miRNAs are epigenetically regulated by either histone modifications or by combined DNA methylation and histone modification.

===sRNAs===

sRNAs are small (50-250 nucleotides), highly-structured, non-coding RNA fragments found in bacteria. They control gene expression including virulence genes in pathogens and are viewed as new targets in the fight against drug-resistant bacteria.[tpl]cite journal |author=Howden BP, Beaume M, Harrison PF, et al. |title=Analysis of the Small RNA Transcriptional Response in Multidrug-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus after Antimicrobial Exposure |journal=Antimicrob.

===Prions===

Prions are infectious forms of proteins. In general, proteins fold into discrete units that perform distinct cellular functions, but some proteins are also capable of forming an infectious conformational state known as a prion. Although often viewed in the context of infectious disease, prions are more loosely defined by their ability to catalytically convert other native state versions of the same protein to an infectious conformational state. It is in this latter sense that they can be viewed as epigenetic agents capable of inducing a phenotypic change without a modification of the genome.[tpl]cite journal | title = Epigenetic inheritance and prions| author=Yool A, Edmunds WJ| journal = Journal of Evolutionary Biology | year = 1998 | pages = 241–242 | volume=11 | doi = 10.1007/s000360050085 | issue=2[/tpl]
Fungal prions are considered by some to be epigenetic because the infectious phenotype caused by the prion can be inherited without modification of the genome.  PSI+ and URE3, discovered in yeast in 1965 and 1971, are the two best studied of this type of prion.[tpl]cite journal|title=PSI, a cytoplasmic suppressor of super-suppression in yeast | author = Cox BS| journal = Heredity | volume = 20 | pages = 505–521 | year = 1965 | doi = 10.1038/hdy.1965.65 | issue = 4[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Lacroute F | title = Non-Mendelian mutation allowing ureidosuccinic acid uptake in yeast | journal = J.

In PSI+ cells, the loss of the Sup35 protein (which is involved in termination of translation) causes ribosomes to have a higher rate of read-through of stop codons, an effect that results in suppression of nonsense mutations in other genes.[tpl]cite journal | author = Liebman SW, Sherman F | title = Extrachromosomal psi+ determinant suppresses nonsense mutations in yeast | journal = J.

===Structural inheritance systems===

In ciliates such as Tetrahymena and Paramecium, genetically identical cells show heritable differences in the patterns of ciliary rows on their cell surface. Experimentally altered patterns can be transmitted to daughter cells. It seems existing structures act as templates for new structures. The mechanisms of such inheritance are unclear, but reasons exist to assume that multicellular organisms also use existing cell structures to assemble new ones.[tpl]cite journal | author = Sapp J | title = Concepts of organization.

==Functions and consequences==

===Development===

Somatic epigenetic inheritance through epigenetic modifications, particularly through DNA methylation and chromatin remodeling, is very important in the development of multicellular eukaryotic organisms. The genome sequence is static (with some notable exceptions), but cells differentiate into many different types, which perform different functions, and respond differently to the environment and intercellular signalling. Thus, as individuals develop, morphogens activate or silence genes in an epigenetically heritable fashion, giving cells a "memory". In mammals, most cells terminally differentiate, with only stem cells retaining the ability to differentiate into several cell types ("totipotency" and "multipotency"). In mammals, some stem cells continue producing new differentiated cells throughout life, such as in neurogenesis, but mammals are not able to respond to loss of some tissues, for example, the inability to regenerate limbs, which some other animals are capable of. Unlike animals, plant cells do not terminally differentiate, remaining totipotent with the ability to give rise to a new individual plant. While plants do utilise many of the same epigenetic mechanisms as animals, such as chromatin remodeling, it has been hypothesised that some kinds of plant cells do not use or require "cellular memories", resetting their gene expression patterns using positional information from the environment and surrounding cells to determine their fate.[tpl]cite journal | author = Costa S, Shaw P | title = 'Open minded' cells: how cells can change fate | journal = Trends Cell Biol. | volume = 17 | issue = 3 | pages = 101–6 |date=March 2007 | pmid = 17194589 | doi = 10.1016/j.tcb.2006.12.005 | url= http://cromatina.icb.ufmg.br/biomol/seminarios/outros/grupo_open.pdf | format=PDF | quote= This might suggest that plant cells do not use or require a cellular memory mechanism and just respond to positional information. However, it has been shown that plants do use cellular memory mechanisms mediated by PcG proteins in several processes, ... (p.104)[/tpl]
Epigenetics can be divided into predetermined and probabilistic epigenesis. Predetermined epigenesis is a unidirectional movement from structural development in DNA to the functional maturation of the protein. "Predetermined" here means that development is scripted and predictable. Probabilistic epigenesis on the other hand is a bidirectional structure-function development with experiences and external molding development.[tpl]cite journal | author = Griesemer J, Haber MH, Yamashita G, Gannett L | title = Critical Notice: Cycles of Contingency – Developmental Systems and Evolution | journal = Biology & Philosophy |date=March 2005 | volume = 20 | issue =2–3 | pages = 517–544 | doi = 10.1007/s10539-004-0836-4[/tpl]

===Medicine===

Epigenetics has many and varied potential medical applications as it tends to be multidimensional in nature.[tpl]cite journal | author = Chahwan R, Wontakal SN, Roa S | title = The multidimensional nature of epigenetic information and its role in disease | journal = Discov Med | volume = 11 | issue = 58 | pages = 233–43 |date=March 2011 | pmid = 21447282 | doi = [/tpl] Congenital genetic disease is well understood, and it is also clear that epigenetics can play a role, for example, in the case of Angelman syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome. These are normal genetic diseases caused by gene deletions or inactivation of the genes, but are unusually common because individuals are essentially hemizygous because of genomic imprinting, and therefore a single gene knock out is sufficient to cause the disease, where most cases would require both copies to be knocked out.[tpl]OMIM|105830[/tpl]

===Evolution===

Epigenetics can impact evolution when epigenetic changes are heritable. A sequestered germ line or Weismann barrier is specific to animals, and epigenetic inheritance is more common in plants and microbes. Eva Jablonka and Marion Lamb have argued that these effects may require enhancements to the standard conceptual framework of the modern evolutionary synthesis.[tpl]cite book | author = Lamb MJ, Jablonka E | title = Evolution in four dimensions: genetic, epigenetic, behavioral, and symbolic variation in the history of life | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge, Mass | year = 2005 | pages = | isbn = 0-262-10107-6 | oclc = | doi = | accessdate = [/tpl]See also Denis Noble The Music of Life see esp pp. 93–8 and p. 48 where he cites Jablonka & Lamb and Massimo Pigliucci's review of Jablonka and Lamb in Nature 435, 565–566 (2 June 2005) Other evolutionary biologists have incorporated epigenetic inheritance into population genetics models[tpl]cite journal|last=Maynard Smith|first=John|title=Models of a Dual Inheritance System|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|year=1990|volume=143|issue=1|pages=41–53|doi=10.1016/S0022-5193(05)80287-5|pmid=2359317[/tpl] or are openly skeptical.[tpl]cite journal |author = Lynch, M. |year = 2007 |title = The frailty of adaptive hypotheses for the origins of organismal complexity |journal = PNAS |volume = 104 |pages = 8597–8604 |doi = 10.1073/pnas.0702207104 |bibcode = 2007PNAS..104.8597L |pmid = 17494740 |pmc = 1876435 |issue = suppl. 1 [/tpl]
Two important ways in which epigenetic inheritance can be different from traditional genetic inheritance, with important consequences for evolution, are that rates of epimutation can be much faster than rates of mutation[tpl]cite journal | author = Rando OJ, Verstrepen KJ | title = Timescales of genetic and epigenetic inheritance | journal = Cell | volume = 128 | issue = 4 | pages = 655–68 |date=February 2007 | pmid = 17320504 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2007.01.023 [/tpl] and the epimutations are more easily reversible.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Lancaster|first1=Alex K.|last2=Masel |first2=Joanna|title=The evolution of reversible switches in the presence of irreversible mimics|journal=Evolution|date=1 September 2009|volume=63|issue=9| pages=2350–2362|doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2009.00729.x|pmid=19486147|pmc=2770902[/tpl] An epigenetically inherited element such as the PSI+ system can act as a "stop-gap", good enough for short-term adaptation that allows the lineage to survive for long enough for mutation and/or recombination to genetically assimilate the adaptive phenotypic change.[tpl]cite journal| author=Griswold CK, Masel J | title = Complex Adaptations Can Drive the Evolution of the Capacitor PSI+, Even with Realistic Rates of Yeast Sex| journal = PLoS Genetics| volume = 5| issue=6 | pages = e1000517| year=2009| pmid=19521499| pmc=2686163| doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000517 |url=http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1000517| editor1-last=Úbeda| editor1-first=Francisco[/tpl] The existence of this possibility increases the evolvability of a species.

One study indicates that traumatic experiences can produce fearful memories which are passed to future generations via epigenetics. A study carried out on mice in 2013 found that mice could produce offspring which had an aversion to certain items which had been the source of negative experiences for their ancestors.Fearful Memories Passed Down to Mouse Descendants: Genetic imprint from traumatic experiences carries through at least two generations, By Ewen Callaway and Nature magazine  | Sunday, 1 December 2013.Mice can 'warn' sons, grandsons of dangers via sperm, by Mariette Le Roux, 12/1/13. Reports stated that:
  For the study, author Brian Dias and co-author Kerry Ressler trained mice, using foot shocks, to fear an odour that resembles cherry blossoms. Later, they tested the extent to which the animals' offspring startled when exposed to the same smell. The younger generation had not even been conceived when their fathers underwent the training, and had never smelt the odour before the experiment.
 The offspring of trained mice were "able to detect and respond to far less amounts of odour... suggesting they are more sensitive" to it, Ressler told AFP of the findings published in the journal Nature Neuroscience. They did not react the same way to other odours, and compared to the offspring of non-trained mice, their reaction to the cherry blossom whiff was about 200 percent stronger, he said.
The scientists then looked at a gene, M71, that governs the functioning of an odour receptor in the nose that responds specifically to the cherry blossom smell. The gene, inherited through the sperm of trained mice, had undergone no change to its DNA encoding, the team found. But the gene did carry epigenetic marks that could alter its behaviour and cause it to be "expressed more" in descendants, said Dias. This in turn caused a physical change in the brains of the trained mice, their sons and grandsons, who all had a larger glomerulus—a section in the olfactory (smell) unit of the brain.

PMID 16009939 studied young monozygotic (identical) twins and older monozygotic twins. They found that although such twins were epigenetically indistinguishable during their early years, older twins had remarkable differences in the overall content and genomic distribution of 5-methylcytosine DNA and histone acetylation. The twin pairs who had spent less of their lifetime together and/or had greater differences in their medical histories were those who showed the largest differences in their levels of 5methylcytosine DNA and acetylation of histones H3 and H4.

==Epigenetic effects in humans==

===Genomic imprinting and related disorders===

Some human disorders are associated with genomic imprinting, a phenomenon in mammals where the father and mother contribute different epigenetic patterns for specific genomic loci in their germ cells.[tpl]cite journal | author = Wood AJ, Oakey RJ | title = Genomic imprinting in mammals: emerging themes and established theories | journal = PLoS Genet. | volume = 2 | issue = 11 | pages = e147 |date=November 2006 | pmid = 17121465 | pmc = 1657038 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.0020147 [/tpl] The best-known case of imprinting in human disorders is that of Angelman syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome—both can be produced by the same genetic mutation, chromosome 15q partial deletion, and the particular syndrome that will develop depends on whether the mutation is inherited from the child's mother or from their father.[tpl]cite journal | author = Knoll JH, Nicholls RD, Magenis RE, Graham JM, Lalande M, Latt SA | title = Angelman and Prader-Willi syndromes share a common chromosome 15 deletion but differ in parental origin of the deletion | journal = Am.

Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is also associated with genomic imprinting, often caused by abnormalities in maternal genomic imprinting of a region on chromosome 11.

In 2008, the National Institutes of Health announced that $190 million had been earmarked for epigenetics research over the next five years. In announcing the funding, government officials noted that epigenetics has the potential to explain mechanisms of aging, human development, and the origins of cancer, heart disease, mental illness, as well as several other conditions. Some investigators, like Randy Jirtle, PhD, of Duke University Medical Center, think epigenetics may ultimately turn out to have a greater role in disease than genetics.[tpl]cite news |first=Laura |last=Beil |title= Medicine's New Epicenter?

====DNA methylation in cancer====

DNA methylation is an important regulator of gene transcription and a large body of evidence has demonstrated that aberrant DNA methylation is associated with unscheduled gene silencing, and the genes with high levels of 5-methylcytosine in their promoter region are transcriptionally silent. DNA methylation is essential during embryonic development, and in somatic cells, patterns of DNA methylation are in general transmitted to daughter cells with a high fidelity. Aberrant DNA methylation patterns have been associated with a large number of human malignancies and found in two distinct forms: hypermethylation and hypomethylation compared to normal tissue. Hypermethylation is one of the major epigenetic modifications that repress transcription via promoter region of tumour suppressor genes. Hypermethylation typically occurs at CpG islands in the promoter region and is associated with gene inactivation. Global hypomethylation has also been implicated in the development and progression of cancer through different mechanisms.[tpl]cite book | author = Wong NC, Craig JM | title = Epigenetics: A Reference Manual | publisher = Caister Academic Press | location = Norfolk, England | year = 2011 | pages = | isbn = 1-904455-88-3  [/tpl]

====DNA repair epigenetics in cancer====

Germ line (familial) mutations have been identified in 34 different DNA repair genes that cause a high risk of cancer, including, for example BRCA1 and ATM. These are listed in the article DNA repair-deficiency disorder. However, cancers caused by such germ line mutations make up only a very small proportion of cancers. For instance, germ line mutations cause only 2% to 5% of colon cancer cases.Jasperson KW, Tuohy TM, Neklason DW, Burt RW (2010). Hereditary and familial colon cancer" Gastroenterology 138(6) 2044-2058. doi: 10.1053/j.gastro.2010.01.054. PMID 20420945
Epigenetic reductions in expression of DNA repair genes, however, are very frequent in sporadic (non-germ line) cancers, as shown among some representative cancers in the table in this section, while mutations in DNA repair genes in sporadic cancer are very rare.Wood LD, Parsons DW, Jones S, Lin J, Sjöblom T, Leary RJ, Shen D, Boca SM, Barber T, Ptak J, Silliman N, Szabo S, Dezso Z, Ustyanksky V, Nikolskaya T, Nikolsky Y, Karchin R, Wilson PA, Kaminker JS, Zhang Z, Croshaw R, Willis J, Dawson D, Shipitsin M, Willson JK, Sukumar S, Polyak K, Park BH, Pethiyagoda CL, Pant PV, Ballinger DG, Sparks AB, Hartigan J, Smith DR, Suh E, Papadopoulos N, Buckhaults P, Markowitz SD, Parmigiani G, Kinzler KW, Velculescu VE, Vogelstein B (2007).

====Variant histones H2A in cancer====

The histone variants of the H2A family are highly conserved in mammals, playing critical roles in regulating many nuclear processes by altering chromatin structure. One of the key H2A variants, H2A.X, marks DNA damage, facilitating the recruitment of DNA repair proteins to restore genomic integrity. Another variant, H2A.Z, plays an important role in both gene activation and repression. A high level of H2A.Z expression is ubiquitously detected in many cancers and is significantly associated with cellular proliferation and genomic instability. Histone variant macroH2A1 is important in the pathogenesis of many types of cancers, for instance in hepatocellular carcinoma.[tpl]cite journal |author=Rappa F, Greco A, Podrini C, et al. |title=Immunopositivity for histone macroH2A1 isoforms marks steatosis-associated hepatocellular carcinoma |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=e54458 |year=2013 |pmid=23372727 |pmc=3553099 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0054458 |editor1-last=Folli |editor1-first=Franco|bibcode = 2013PLoSO...854458R [/tpl]

Direct comparisons between identical twins constitute the ideal experimental model for testing environmental epigenetics, because DNA sequence differences that would be abundant in a singleton-based study do not interfere with the analysis. Research has shown that a difference in the environment can produce long-term epigenetic effects, and different developmental monozygotic twin subtypes may be different with respect to their susceptibility to be discordant from an epigenetic point of view.Ballestar, E.

One of the first high-throughput studies of epigenetic differences between monozygotic twins focused in comparing global and locus-specific changes in DNA methylation and histone modifications in a sample of 40 monozygotic twin pairs.Fraga MF, Ballestar E, Paz MF et al (2005) Epigenetic differences arise during the lifetime of monozygotic twins. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 102:10604–10609 In this case, only healthy twin pairs were studied, but a wide range of ages was represented, between 3 and 74 years. One of the major conclusions from this study was that there is an age-dependent accumulation of epigenetic differences between the two siblings of twin pairs. This accumulation suggests the existence of epigenetic “drift”.
A more recent study, where 114 monozygotic twins and 80 dizygotic twins were analyzed for the DNA methylation status of around 6000 unique genomic regions, concluded that epigenetic similarity at the time of blastocyst splitting may also contribute to phenotypic similarities in monozygotic co-twins. This supports the notion that microenvironment at early stages of embryonic development can be quite important for the establishment of epigenetic marks.Kaminsky ZA, Tang T, Wang SC et al (2009) DNA methylation profiles in monozygotic and dizygotic twins.

==Epigenetics in microorganisms==

Bacteria make widespread use of postreplicative DNA methylation for the epigenetic control of DNA-protein interactions. Bacteria make use of DNA adenine methylation (rather than DNA cytosine methylation) as an epigenetic signal. DNA adenine methylation is important in bacteria virulence in organisms such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Vibrio, Yersinia, Haemophilus, and Brucella. In Alphaproteobacteria, methylation of adenine regulates the cell cycle and couples gene transcription to DNA replication. In Gammaproteobacteria, adenine methylation provides signals for DNA replication, chromosome segregation, mismatch repair, packaging of bacteriophage, transposase activity and regulation of gene expression.[tpl]cite journal | author = Casadesús J, Low D | title = Epigenetic gene regulation in the bacterial world | journal = Microbiol.

The filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa is a prominent model system for understanding the control and function of cytosine methylation. In this organisms, DNA methylation is associated with relics of a genome defense system called RIP (repeat-induced point mutation) and silences gene expression by inhibiting transcription elongation.[tpl]cite journal | author = Lewis ZA, Honda S, Khlafallah TK, Jeffress JK, Freitag M, Mohn F, Schübeler D, Selker EU | title = Relics of repeat-induced point mutation direct heterochromatin formation in Neurospora crassa | journal = Genome Res. | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 427–37 |date=March 2009 | pmid = 19092133 | pmc = 2661801 | doi = 10.1101/gr.086231.108 [/tpl]
The yeast prion PSI is generated by a conformational change of a translation termination factor, which is then inherited by daughter cells. This can provide a survival advantage under adverse conditions. This is an example of epigenetic regulation enabling unicellular organisms to respond rapidly to environmental stress. Prions can be viewed as epigenetic agents capable of inducing a phenotypic change without modification of the genome.[tpl]cite book | author = Jorg Tost | title = Epigenetics | publisher = Caister Academic Press | location = Norfolk, England | year = 2008 | pages = | isbn = 1-904455-23-9  [/tpl]
Direct detection of epigenetic marks in microorganisms is possible with single molecule real time sequencing, in which polymerase sensitivity allows for measuring methylation and other modifications as a DNA molecule is being sequenced.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1101/gr.136739.111 |title=Modeling kinetic rate variation in third generation DNA sequencing data to detect putative modifications to DNA bases |year=2012 |last1=Schadt |first1=E.
