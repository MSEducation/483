[[Vehicle registration plates of Moldova]]

CATEGORIES: Vehicle registration plates by country, Transport in Moldova, Moldova transport-related lists

License plates in Moldova were introduced on November 30, 1992. They consist of seven characters: two letters for the region (except for Chişinău, which only has the letters C and K), two letters for the series and three digits. The characters are black on a white background. The left side of the plate carries the coat of arms of Moldova with the country index MD (before 1994 the country index on car plates was MLD) and since November 1, 2011, it has a vertical blue background, similar to the European Union plates. Additionally, the owners now can request to have only one or two digits instead of three.[tpl]cite web|title=Avem numere noi!
