==Technical Informations==

HD share's video playback technology was based on Macromedia's Flash Player.  This technology allows the site to display videos with quality comparable to more established video playback technologies (such as Windows Media Player, QuickTime and RealPlayer) that generally require the user to download and install a web browser plugin in order to view video.  Flash also requires a plug-in, but Adobe considers the Flash 7 plug-in to be present on about 90% of online computers.Adobe Flash Player Version Penetration Adobe Systems Users can view videos in windowed mode or full screen mode and it is possible to switch modes during playback without reloading it due to the full-screen function of Adobe Flash Player 9. The video can also be played back with third-party media players such as GOM Player, gnash, VLC as well as some ffmpeg-based video players.
Videos uploaded to HD share weren't limited in length and had a maximum size of 4 Gigabytes.http://www.hdshare.tv/upload The best format that HD share could display was 1280*720.http://www.lokigroup.com/products
