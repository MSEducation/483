[[Warad-Sin]]

CATEGORIES: Sumerian rulers, Amorite kings, 18th-century BC rulers

Warad-Sin ruled the ancient Near East city-state
of Larsa from 1770 BC to 1758 BC. There are indications that his
father Kudur-Mabuk was co-regent or at very least the power behind the
throne. His sister En-ane-du was high priestess of the moon god in Ur.
