===Commission of Enquiry===

When Hotham's Royal Commission report, initiated before the conflict, was finally handed down it was scathing in its assessment of all aspects of the administration of the gold fields, and particularly the Eureka Stockade affair. According to Blainey, "It was perhaps the most generous concession offered by a governor to a major opponent in the history of Australia up to that time. The members of the commission were appointed before Eureka...they were men who were likely to be sympathetic to the diggers."
The report made several major recommendations, one of which was to restrict Chinese immigration. Its recommendations were only put into effect after the Stockade. The gold licences were then abolished, and replaced by an annual miner's right and an export fee based on the value of the gold. Mining wardens replaced the gold commissioners, and police numbers were cut drastically. The Legislative Council was expanded to allow representation to the major goldfields and Peter Lalor and John Basson Humffray were elected for Ballarat, although there were property qualifications with regards to eligibility to vote in upper house elections in Victoria until the 1950s. After 12 months, all but one of the demands of the Ballarat Reform League had been granted. Lalor and Humffray both enjoyed distinguished careers as politicians, with Lalor later elected as Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Victoria.

===Peter Lalor===

Following the battle, rebel leader, Irishman Peter Lalor, wrote in a statement to the colonists of Victoria, "There are two things connected with the late outbreak (Eureka) which I deeply regret. The first is, that we shouldn't have been forced to take up arms at all; and the second is, that when we were compelled to take the field in our own defence, we were unable (through want of arms, ammunition and a little organisation) to inflict on the real authors of the outbreak the punishment they so richly deserved."[ref]
</ref>
Lalor stood for Ballarat in the 1856 elections and was elected unopposed. As he was the Eureka hero his policies were not scrutinised at all before the election.
During a speech in the Legislative Council in 1856 he said, "I would ask these gentlemen what they mean by the term 'democracy'. Do they mean Chartism or Republicanism? If so, I never was, I am not now, nor do I ever intend to be a democrat. But if a democrat means opposition to a tyrannical press, a tyrannical people, or a tyrannical government, then I have been, I am still, and will ever remain a democrat."
Historians, including Weston Bate suggested that there was some hypocrisy in Lalor's folk hero status due to his post-stockade political opportunism and self-interest.Bate, Weston. "Lucky City". Page 184

==Political legacy==

On 1857 Friday, 24 November a bill granting universal suffrage for white males was passed in Victorian parliament.  It was the first in Australia to grant universal male suffrage. Peter Lalor is recorded to have voted against the bill in parliament.Bate, Weston. "Lucky City". Page 133
As a result of the democratic effect of the rebellion, some have therefore identified the Eureka Rebellion as the birth of Australian democracy or interpreted it as a political revolt, though its political significance is often disputed outside of Victoria. Additionally, as such, this has had the effect of elevating the status of the Eureka flag to national symbolism, [tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl] [tpl]by whom|date=May 2013[/tpl] which is frequently employed by political radicals as a general purpose symbol of protest for a wide variety of anti-establishment non-conformist causes.

===Debate of political significance===

The Eureka Stockade (and other events) has been characterised as the "Birth of Australia". [tpl]By whom|date=April 2011[/tpl] Its actual significance is uncertain; it has been variously mythologised by particular interest groups as a revolt of free men against imperial tyranny, of independent free enterprise against burdensome taxation, of labour against a privileged ruling class, or as an expression of republicanism: yet the writings of Raffaello Carboni, who was present at the Stockade, make it clear that "amongst the foreigners ... there was no democratic feeling, but merely a spirit of resistance to the licence fee"; and he also disputes the accusations "that have branded the miners of Ballarat as disloyal to their QUEEN" (emphasis as in the original).RC:108,153 The affair continues to raise echoes in Australian politics to the present day, and from time to time one group or another calls for the existing Australian flag to be replaced by the Eureka Flag.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/eureka-an-answer-to-that-jack-in-the-corner-gets-a-little-bit-warmer-20110125-1a4be.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Eureka?

The Eureka Stockade was certainly the most prominent rebellion in Australia's history and, depending on how one defines rebellion, can be regarded as the only such event. (But see also Rum Rebellion, Vinegar Hill and more recently the New Guard.) Its significance, however, remains debatable. Some historians believe that the prominence of the event in the public record has come about because Australian history does not include a major armed rebellion phase equivalent to the French Revolution, the English Civil War, or the American War of Independence: in consequence (according to this view) the Eureka story tends to be inflated well beyond its real significance.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/stories/s290806.htm |title=Lateline – 7/5/2001: Historians discuss Eureka legend . Australian Broadcasting Corp |publisher=ABC |location=Australia  |accessdate=29 November 2011[/tpl] Others, however, maintain that Eureka was a seminal event and that it marked a major change in the course of Australian history. [tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2011[/tpl]
In 1980, historian Geoffrey Blainey drew attention to the fact that many miners were temporary migrants from Britain and the United States, who did not intend to settle permanently in Australia. He wrote:
In 1999, the Premier of New South Wales, Bob Carr, dismissed the Eureka Stockade as a "protest without consequence".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/stories/s73410.htm |title=7.30 Report – 14 December 1999: The Eureka rebellion |publisher=ABC |location=Australia  |date=14 December 1999 |accessdate=29 November 2011[/tpl] Deputy Prime MinisterJohn Anderson made the Eureka flag a federal election campaign issue in 2004 saying "I think people have tried to make too much of the Eureka Stockade...trying to give it a credibility and standing that it probably doesn't enjoy."[tpl]dead link|date=November 2011[/tpl]
In 2004, the Premier of Victoria, Steve Bracks, delivered an opening address at the Eureka 150 Democracy ConferenceSteve Bracks, Opening Address, Eureka 150 Democracy Conference[tpl]dead link|date=November 2011[/tpl] stating "that Eureka was about the struggle for basic democratic rights. It was not about a riot – it was about rights."

==Commemoration==

The materials used to build the stockade were rapidly removed to be used for the mines, and the entire area around the site was so extensively worked that the original landscape became unrecognisable, so identifying the exact location of the stockade is now virtually impossible.
A diggers memorial was erected in the Ballarat Cemetery on 22 March 1856 near marked graves. Sculpted in stone from the Barrabool Hills by James Leggatt in Geelong it features a pillar bearing the names of the deceased miners and bearing the inscription "Sacred to the memory of those who fell on the memorable 3rd of December, 1854, in resisting the unconstitutional proceedings of the Victorian Government."
A Soldiers Memorial was erected many years later in 1876 and is an obelisk constructed of limestone sourced from Waurn Ponds with the words "Victoria" and "Duty" carved in its north and south faces respectively.  In 1879 a cast iron fence was added to the memorials and graves.
Over the next thirty years, press interest in the events that had taken place at the Eureka Stockade dwindled, but Eureka was kept alive at the campfires and in the pubs, and in memorial events in Ballarat. In addition, key figures such as Lalor and Humfray were still in the public eye.

===1880s===

Eureka had not been forgotten: it was readily remembered. [tpl]citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl] Similar flags have been flown at rebellions since including a flag similar [tpl]Clarify|date=September 2010[/tpl] to the Eureka flag which was flown above the Barcaldine strike camp in the 1891 Australian shearers' strike.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl]  Flag of the Southern Cross (1887), Eureka (A Fragment) (1889), The Fight at Eureka Stockade (1890), and Freedom on the Wallaby (1891),
In 1889, Melbourne businessmen employed renowned American cyclorama artist Thaddeus Welch, who teamed up with local artist Izett Watson to paint [tpl]convert|1000|sqft|m2[/tpl] of canvas of the Eureka Stockade, wrapped around a wooden structure. When it opened in Melbourne, the exhibition was an instant hit. The Age reported in 1891 that "it afforded a very good opportunity for people to see what it might have been like at Eureka". The Australasian claimed "that many persons familiar with the incidents depicted, were able to testify to the fidelity of the painted scene". The people of Melbourne flocked to the cyclorama, paid up and had their picture taken before it. It was eventually dismantled and disappeared from sight.

===1890s===

Mark Twain visited the Victorian Goldfields in 1895. Following his visit, he said of the Eureka Stockade:

Memorials to soldiers and miners are located in the Ballarat Old CemeterySearch the Heritage Register and Inventory[tpl]Dead link|date=May 2010[/tpl] and the Eureka Stockade Memorial is located within the Eureka Stockade Gardens and is listed on the Australian National Heritage List./

===1950s===

In 1954, the centenary of the event was officially celebrated; according to Geoffrey Blainey, who was in attendance, no one, apart from a small group of communists, was there.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/Children-of-rebellion-maintain-the-rage/2004/11/26/1101219745009.html | location=Melbourne |work=The Age |location=Australia | first=James | last=Button | title=Children of rebellion maintain the rage | date=27 November 2004[/tpl] Plays commemorating the events were held at major theatres.

===1990s===

A purpose built Interpretation centre was erected in 1998 in suburb of Eureka near the site of the stockade. Designed to be a new landmark for Ballarat, the building featured an enormous sail emblazoned with the Eureka Flag.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eurekaballarat.com/ |title=The Eureka Centre |publisher=Eurekaballarat.com |accessdate=29 November 2011[/tpl] Before its development there was considerable debate over whether a replica or reconstruction of wooden structures was appropriate, however it was eventually decided against and this is seen by many as a reason for the apparent failure of the centre to draw significant tourist numbers. Due primarily to falling visitor numbers the centre was redeveloped between 2009–11.[tpl]dead link|date=November 2011[/tpl]

===2000s===

In 2004, the 150th anniversary was celebrated. An Australian postage stamp featuring the Eureka Flag was released along with a set of commemorative coins. A ceremony in Ballarat known as the lantern walk was held at dawn. However, Prime Minister John Howard did not attend any commemorative events, and refused to allow the flag to fly over Parliament House.Gerard Henderson.

In November 2004 then Premier of Victoria Steve Bracks announced that the Ballarat V/Line rail service would be renamed the Eureka Line to mark the 150th anniversary to take effect from late 2005 at the same time as a renaming of Spencer Street Station to Southern Cross Station,[ref]
[tpl]dead link|date=August 2012[/tpl][/ref] however the proposal was criticised by community groups including the Public Transport Users Association. Renaming of the line did not go ahead, however Spencer Street (railway) Station did become Southern Cross Station on 13 December 2005 with Bracks stating the name would resonate with Victorians because it "stands for democracy and freedom because it flew over the Eureka Stockade".Mathew Murphy Time's up at last for railway landmark The Age, 14 December 2005
Eureka Tower, completed in 2006 is named in honour of the event and features symbolic aspects in its design including an architectural red stripe representing the blood spilt during the battle.
The site of the Eureka Stockade in Ballarat is currently being redeveloped with the support of grants from the City of Ballarat and the Victorian and Federal Governments.
It will feature the new Museum of Australian Democracy at Eureka (M.A.D.E) that will draw on the touchstone of Eureka and its newly restored flag, and put the Eureka Stockade into the context of 2600 years of democracy.
M.A.D.E's highly interactive exhibition, based on the premise of People + Power = Democracy,  is expected to open in early 2013, followed by a national rollout of public onsite and online programs.
Deputy Premier, the Hon. Peter Ryan, told the Legislative Assembly, sitting in Ballarat in 2012, that M.A.D.E would be 'be a magnificent tribute to the events' of the Eureka Stockade.
The Museum's M.A.D.E You Look booklet says M.A.D.E will be 'an online platform and immersive museum with a refreshing approach to culture, civics, history and citizenship. M.A.D.E puts the past into a contemporary context, celebrates Australia’s achievements and inspires new ways of thinking about issues like equality, freedom of speech, parliamentary representation and the rule of law'. The museum 'will ignite debate about what it means to be an effective Australian in the 21st Century'.

===Eureka Stockade (1907)===

A black and white silent film directed by Arthur and George Cornwell, produced by the Australasian Cinematograph Company.
The surviving seven minute fragment (original length unknown) shows street scenes of Ballarat is believed to be part of the 1907 film, the second feature film made in Australia (after the 1906 production, The Story of the Kelly Gang). The film was first screened in the Athenaeum Hall, Melbourne on 19 October 1907. The film impressed critics of the time and was found to be a stirring portrayal of the events surrounding the Eureka Stockade, but failed to connect with audiences during the two weeks it was screened. Other scenes in the lost reels of the film were believed to have included gold seekers leaving London, issuing of licences, licence hunting, diggers chained to logs and rescued by mates, diggers burning Bentley's Hotel, the Rebellion, building the stockade, troops storming the stockade and the stockade in ruins.
