The TW Hydrae association is a group of approximately thirty very young stars located 50 parsecs[tpl]cite journal | bibcode=2005ApJ...634.1385M | author=Mamajek| title= A Moving Cluster Distance to the Exoplanet 2M1207b in the TW Hydrae Association | journal= The Astrophysical Journal| volume=634 | issue=2 | year=2005 | pages=1385â€“1394| doi= 10.1086/468181 |arxiv = astro-ph/0507416 [/tpl] from Earth that share a common motion and appear to all be roughly the same age, 5-10 million years old. The best studied members of this stellar association
are TW Hydrae (nearest known accreting T Tauri star to the Earth), HR 4796 (an A-type star with resolved dusty debris disk; the most massive known group member), HD 98800 (a quadruple star system with debris disk), and 2M1207 (accreting brown dwarf with remarkable planetary-mass companion 2M1207b).
