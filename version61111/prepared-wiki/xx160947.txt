Crossoloricaria is a genus of armored catfish native to South America with one species ranging into Central America.

==Taxonomy==

Crossloricaria is classified in the Pseudohemiodon group in the tribe Loricariini of the subfamily Loricariinae. This genus is poorly diagnosed and is in need of revision. Its only diagnostic character (incomplete abdominal cover consisting of a double median row of plates) is shared by two other representatives of the Pseudohemiodon group, Apistoloricaria and Rhadinoloricaria. On top of this, C. rhami has a complete abdominal cover of plates, rendering this diagnostic feature invalid. Crossoloricaria also has some traits such as lip structure and barbel length that places it closer to Pseudohemiodon.
