[[Horsepower]]

CATEGORIES: Imperial units, Units of power, Customary units of measurement in the United States

Horsepower (hp) is the name of several units of measurement of power, the rate at which work is done. The most common conversion factor, especially for electrical power, is 1 hp = 746 watts. The term was adopted in the late 18th century by Scottish engineer James Watt to compare the output of steam engines with the power of draft horses. It was later expanded to include the output power of other types of piston engines, as well as turbines, electric motors and other machinery."Horsepower", Encyclopedia Britannica Online. Retrieved 2012-06-24."International System of Units" (SI), Encyclopedia Britannica Online. Retrieved 2012-06-24. The definition of the unit varied between geographical regions. Most countries now use the SI unit watt for measurement of power. With the implementation of the EU Directive 80/181/EEC on January 1, 2010, the use of horsepower in the EU is only permitted as supplementary unit."Directive 2009/3/EC of the European Pparliament and of the Council of 11 March 2009", Official Journal of the European Union.

==Definitions of term==

Units called "horsepower" have differing definitions:

==History of the unit==

The development of the steam engine provided a reason to compare the output of horses with that of the engines that could replace them. In 1702, Thomas Savery wrote in The Miner's Friend:Rochester history department website: "The miner's friend" Accessed July 21, 2011 "So that an engine which will raise as much water as two horses, working together at one time in such a work, can do, and for which there must be constantly kept ten or twelve horses for doing the same. Then I say, such an engine may be made large enough to do the work required in employing eight, ten, fifteen, or twenty horses to be constantly maintained and kept for doing such a work…" The idea was later used by James Watt to help market his improved steam engine.  He had previously agreed to take royalties of one third of the savings in coal from the older Newcomen steam engines.[tpl]Cite web |url= http://www.pballew.net/arithm17.html#hp |title=Math Words — horsepower |publisher= pballew.net |accessdate=2007-08-11 |postscript=  [/tpl]  This royalty scheme did not work with customers who did not have existing steam engines but used horses instead.  Watt determined that a horse could turn a mill wheel 144 times in an hour (or 2.4 times a minute).  The wheel was 12 feet in radius; therefore, the horse travelled 2.4 × 2π × 12 feet in one minute.  Watt judged that the horse could pull with a force of 180 pounds.  So:
This was rounded to an even 33,000 ft·lbf/min.[tpl]Cite journal|last=Tully |first=Jim |publisher=American Society of Mechanical Engineers |title=Philadelphia Chapter Newsletter |date = September 2002|url=http://sections.asme.org/Philadelphia/sept02.htm |accessdate=2007-08-11|postscript=[/tpl]
Others[tpl]Who|date=November 2009[/tpl] recount that Watt determined that a pony could lift an average [tpl]convert|220|lbf|kN|abbr=on[/tpl] [tpl]convert|100|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] per minute over a four-hour working shift.  Watt then judged a horse was 50% more powerful than a pony and thus arrived at the 33,000 ft·lbf/min figure.[tpl]cite web|last=Marshall|first=Brian|title=How Horsepower Works|url=http://www.howstuffworks.com/horsepower.htm|accessdate=27 June 2012[/tpl][tpl]Better source|date=November 2013[/tpl] Engineering in History recounts that John Smeaton initially estimated that a horse could produce 22,916 foot-pounds per minute.  John Desaguliers had previously suggested 44,000 foot-pounds per minute and Tredgold 27,500 foot-pounds per minute.  "Watt found by experiment in 1782 that a 'brewery horse' could produce 32,400 foot-pounds per minute."  James Watt and Matthew Boulton standardized that figure at 33,000 the next year.[tpl]Cite journal  |url=http://print.google.com/print?id=AVn_Sm56OCoC&pg=171&lpg=171&dq=smeaton&sig=6N_TJXrLqwQI-Fm7mU9ebKS1djA |title=Engineering in History  |first= Richard Shelton |last= Kirby |publisher=Dover Publications |page=171 |date= August 1, 1990 |isbn=0-486-26412-2 |accessdate=2007-08-11  |postscript=[/tpl]
Most observers familiar with horses and their capabilities estimate that Watt was either a bit optimistic or intended to underpromise and overdeliver; few horses can maintain that effort for long.  Regardless, comparison with a horse proved to be an enduring marketing tool.
In 1993, R. D. Stevenson and R. J. Wassersug published an article calculating the upper limit to an animal's power output.[tpl]Cite journal |last=Stevenson |first=R. D. |last2=Wassersug |first2=R. J. |year=1993 |title=Horsepower from a horse |journal=Nature |volume=364 |issue=6434 |page=195 |doi=10.1038/364195a0 [/tpl] The peak power over a few seconds has been measured to be as high as 14.9 hp. However, Stevenson and Wassersug observe that for sustained activity, a work rate of about 1 hp per horse is consistent with agricultural advice from both 19th and 20th century sources.
When considering human-powered equipment, a healthy human can produce about 1.2 hp briefly (see orders of magnitude) and sustain about 0.1 hp indefinitely; trained athletes can manage up to about 2.5 hp brieflyEugene A. Avallone et. al, (ed), Marks' Standard Handbook for Mechanical Engineers 11th Edition , Mc-Graw Hill, New York 2007 ISBN 0-07-142867-4 page 9-4
and 0.3 hp for a period of several hours.

==Calculating power==

If torque and angular speed are known, the power may be calculated. The relationship when using a coherent system of units (such as SI) is simply
The constant 5252 is the rounded value of (33,000 ft·lbf/min)/(2π rad/rev).
When torque is in inch pounds:
The constant 63,025 is the rounded value of (33,000 ft·lbf/min) × (12 in/ft)/(2π rad/rev).

==Current definitions==

The following definitions have been widely used:
In certain situations it is necessary to distinguish between the various definitions of horsepower and thus a suffix is added: hp(I) for mechanical (or imperial) horsepower, hp(M) for metric horsepower, hp(S) for boiler (or steam) horsepower and hp(E) for electrical horsepower.
Hydraulic horsepower is equivalent to mechanical horsepower. The formula given above is for conversion to mechanical horsepower from the factors acting on a hydraulic system.

===Mechanical horsepower===

Assuming the third CGPM (1901, CR 70) definition of standard gravity, gn=9.80665 m/s2, is used to define the pound-force as well as the kilogram force, and the international avoirdupois pound (1959), one mechanical horsepower is:
|-
|1 hp
|≡ 33,000 ft-lbf/min
|colspan=3|by definition
|-
|
|= 550 ft·lbf/s
|since
|align=right|1 min 
|= 60 s
|-
|
|= 550×0.3048×0.453592376 m·kgf/s

|}
Or given that 1 hp = 550 ft·lbf/s, 1 ft = 0.3048 m, 1 lbf ≈ 4.448 N, 1 J = 1 N·m, 1 W = 1 J/s: 1 hp = 746 W

===Metric horsepower (PS, cv, hk, pk, ks, ch)[tpl]anchor|Metric horsepower[/tpl][tpl]anchor|PS[/tpl]===

The various units used to indicate this definition (PS, cv, hk, pk, ks and ch) all translate to horse power in English, so it is common to see these values referred to as horsepower or hp in the press releases or media coverage of the German, French, Italian, and Japanese automobile companies. British manufacturers often intermix metric horsepower and mechanical horsepower depending on the origin of the engine in question. Sometimes the metric horsepower rating of an engine is conservative enough so that the same figure can be used for both 80/1269/EEC with metric hp and SAE J1349 with imperial hp.
DIN 66036 defines one metric horsepower as the power to raise a mass of 75 kilograms against the earth's gravitational force over a distance of one metre in one second; this is equivalent to 735.49875 W or 98.6% of an imperial mechanical horsepower.
In 1972, the PS was rendered obsolete by EEC directives, when it was replaced by the kilowatt as the official power measuring unit. It is still in use for commercial and advertising purposes, in addition to the kW rating, as many customers are still not familiar with the use of kilowatts for engines.
Other names for the metric horsepower are the Dutch [tpl]lang|nl|paardenkracht[/tpl] (pk), the French [tpl]lang|fr|chevaux[/tpl] (ch), the Russian [tpl]lang|ru|Лошадиная сила[/tpl] (лс), the Swedish [tpl]lang|sv|hästkraft[/tpl] (hk), the Finnish [tpl]lang|fi|hevosvoima[/tpl] (hv), the Norwegian and Danish [tpl]lang|da|hestekraft[/tpl] (hk), the Hungarian [tpl]lang|hu|lóerő[/tpl] (LE), the Czech [tpl]lang|cs|koňská síla[/tpl] and Slovak  [tpl]lang|sk|konská sila[/tpl] (k or ks), the Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian [tpl]lang|sr|konjska snaga[/tpl] (KS), the Bulgarian [tpl]lang|bg|Конска сила[/tpl], the Macedonian [tpl]lang|mk|Коњска сила[/tpl] (KC), the Polish [tpl]lang|pl|koń mechaniczny[/tpl], Slovenian [tpl]lang|sl|konjska moč[/tpl](KM) and the Romanian [tpl]lang|ro|cal-putere[/tpl] (CP), which all equal the German [tpl]lang|de|Pferdestärke[/tpl] (PS).

====CV====

In the 19th century, the French had their own unit, which they used instead of the CV or horsepower. It was called the poncelet and was abbreviated p.

===Electrical horsepower===

The horsepower used for electrical machines is defined as exactly 746 W. The nameplates on electrical motors show their power output, not their power input. Outside the United States watts are generally used for electrical power applications.

===Drawbar horsepower===

Drawbar horsepower (dbhp) is the power a railway locomotive has available to haul a train or an agricultural tractor to pull an implement. This is a measured figure rather than a calculated one. A special railway car called a dynamometer car coupled behind the locomotive keeps a continuous record of the drawbar pull exerted, and the speed. From these, the power generated can be calculated. To determine the maximum power available, a controllable load is required; it is normally a second locomotive with its brakes applied, in addition to a static load.
Example: How much power is needed to pull a drawbar load of 2,025 pounds-force at 5 miles per hour?

===RAC horsepower (taxable horsepower)===

This measure was instituted by the Royal Automobile Club in Britain and was used to denote the power of early 20th-century British cars. Many cars took their names from this figure (hence the Austin Seven and Riley Nine), while others had names such as "40/50 hp", which indicated the RAC figure followed by the true measured power.
Taxable horsepower does not reflect developed horsepower; rather, it is a calculated figure based on the engine's bore size, number of cylinders, and a (now archaic) presumption of engine efficiency. As new engines were designed with ever-increasing efficiency, it was no longer a useful measure, but was kept in use by UK regulations which used the rating for tax purposes.
This is equal to the displacement in cubic inches divided by 10π then divided again by the stroke in inches.
Since taxable horsepower was computed based on bore and number of cylinders, not based on actual displacement, it gave rise to engines with 'undersquare' dimensions (bore smaller than stroke) this tended to impose an artificially low limit on rotational speed (rpm), hampering the potential power output and efficiency of the engine.
The situation persisted for several generations of four- and six-cylinder British engines: for example, Jaguar's 3.4-litre XK engine of the 1950s had six cylinders with a bore of [tpl]convert|83|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3[/tpl] and a stroke of [tpl]convert|106|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3[/tpl],[tpl]Cite web |first= Dan |last= Mooney |url= http://www.classicjaguar.com/xkengine.html |title= The XK engine by Roger Bywater |publisher= Classicjaguar.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-13 |postscript= [/tpl] where most American automakers had long since moved to oversquare (large bore, short stroke) V-8s (see, for example, the early Chrysler Hemi).

==Measurement==

The power of an engine may be measured or estimated at several points in the transmission of the power from its generation to its application. A number of names are used for the power developed at various stages in this process, but none is a clear indicator of either the measurement system or definition used.
In the case of an engine dynamometer, power is measured at the engine's flywheel. With a chassis dynamometer or rolling road, power output is measured at the driving wheels. This accounts for the significant power loss through the drive train.
In general:
All the above assumes that no power inflation factors have been applied to any of the readings.
Engine designers use expressions other than horsepower to denote objective targets or performance, such as brake mean effective pressure (BMEP). This is a coefficient of theoretical brake horsepower and cylinder pressures during combustion.

===Nominal horsepower===

Nominal horsepower (nhp) is an early 19th-century rule of thumb used to estimate the power of steam engines.
nhp = 7 x area of piston x equivalent piston speed/33,000
For paddle ships the piston speed was estimated as 129.7 x (stroke)1/3.35
The stroke was the distance moved by the piston.
For the nominal horsepower to equal the actual power it would be necessary for the mean steam pressure in the cylinder during the stroke to be [tpl]convert|48|kPa|psi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] and for the piston speed to be of the order of 54–75 m/min.
The French Navy used the same definition of nominal horse power as Britain.

===Indicated horsepower===

Indicated horsepower (ihp) is the theoretical power of a reciprocating engine if it is completely frictionless in converting the expanding gas energy (piston pressure × displacement) in the cylinders.  It is calculated from the pressures developed in the cylinders, measured by a device called an engine indicator – hence indicated horsepower. As the piston advances throughout its stroke, the pressure against the piston generally decreases, and the indicator device usually generates a graph of pressure vs stroke within the working cylinder. From this graph the amount of work performed during the piston stroke may be calculated.
Indicated horsepower was a better measure of engine power than nominal horsepower (nhp) because it took account of steam pressure.  But unlike later measures such as shaft horsepower (shp) and brake horsepower (bhp), it did not take account of power losses due to transmission and gear boxes (if any).

===Brake horsepower===

Brake horsepower (bhp) is the measure of an engine's horsepower before the loss in power caused by the gearbox, alternator, differential, water pump, and other auxiliary components such as power steering pump, muffled exhaust system, etc. Brake refers to a device which was used to load an engine and hold it at a desired rotational speed. During testing, the output torque and rotational speed were measured to determine the brake horsepower.  Horsepower was originally measured and calculated by use of the "indicator" (a James Watt invention of the late 18th century), and later by means of a De Prony brake connected to the engine's output shaft.
More recently, an engine dynamometer is used instead of a De Prony brake. Although the output delivered to the driving wheels is less than that obtainable at the engine's crankshaft, a chassis dynamometer gives an indication of an engine's "real world" horsepower after losses in the drive train and gearbox.

===Shaft horsepower===

Shaft horsepower (shp) is the power delivered to the propeller shafts of a steamship (or one powered by diesel engines or nuclear power), or an aircraft powered by a piston engine or a gas turbine engine, and the rotors of a helicopter. This shaft horsepower can be measured with instruments, or estimated from the indicated horsepower and a standard figure for the losses in the transmission (typical figures are around 10%). This measure is not commonly used in the automobile industry, because in that context drive train losses can become significant.

==Engine power test codes==

Engine power test codes determine how the power and torque of an automobile engine is measured and corrected. Correction factors are used to adjust power and torque measurements to standard atmospheric conditions to provide a more accurate comparison between engines as they are affected by the pressure, humidity, and temperature of ambient air.Heywood, J.B. "Internal Combustion Engine Fundamentals", ISBN 0-07-100499-9 [tpl]Please check ISBN|reason=Check digit (9) does not correspond to calculated figure.[/tpl], page 54 There exist several standards for this purpose, some described below.

===Society of Automotive Engineers===

====SAE gross power====

Prior to the 1972 model year, American automakers rated and advertised their engines in brake horsepower (bhp), frequently referred to as SAE gross horsepower, because it was measured in accord with the protocols defined in SAE standards J245 and J1995. As with other brake horsepower test protocols, SAE gross hp was measured using a stock test engine, generally running with few belt-driven accessories and sometimes fitted with long tube test headers in lieu of the OEM exhaust manifolds. The atmospheric correction standards for barometric pressure, humidity and temperature for testing were relatively idealistic.

====SAE net power====

In the United States, the term bhp fell into disuse in 1971-72, as automakers began to quote power in terms of SAE net horsepower in accord with SAE standard J1349. Like SAE gross and other brake horsepower protocols, SAE Net hp is measured at the engine's crankshaft, and so does not account for transmission losses. However, the SAE net power testing protocol calls for standard production-type belt-driven accessories, air cleaner, emission controls, exhaust system, and other power-consuming accessories. This produces ratings in closer alignment with the power produced by the engine as it is actually configured and sold.

====SAE certified power====

In 2005, the SAE introduced "SAE Certified Power" with SAE J2723.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sae.org/certifiedpower/ |title=Certified Power - SAE J1349 Certified Power SAE International |publisher=Sae.org |date= |accessdate=2011-07-18[/tpl] This test is voluntary and is in itself not a separate engine test code but a certification of either J1349 or J1995 after which the manufacturer is allowed to advertise "Certified to SAE J1349" or "Certified to SAE J1995" depending on which test standard have been followed. To attain certification the test must follow the SAE standard in question, take place in an ISO9000/9002 certified facility and be witnessed by an SAE approved third party.
A few manufacturers such as Honda and Toyota switched to the new ratings immediately, with multi-directional results; the rated output of Cadillac's supercharged Northstar V8 jumped from [tpl]convert|440|to|469|hp|kW|abbr=on[/tpl] under the new tests, while the rating for Toyota's Camry 3.0 L 1MZ-FE V6 fell from [tpl]convert|210|to|190|hp|kW|abbr=on[/tpl]. The company's Lexus ES 330 and Camry SE V6 were previously rated at [tpl]convert|225|hp|kW|abbr=on[/tpl] but the ES 330 dropped to [tpl]convert|218|hp|kW|abbr=on[/tpl] while the Camry declined to [tpl]convert|210|hp|kW|abbr=on[/tpl]. The first engine certified under the new program was the 7.0 L LS7 used in the 2006 Chevrolet Corvette Z06.  Certified power rose slightly from [tpl]convert|500|to|505|hp|kW|sigfig=3|abbr=on[/tpl].
While Toyota and Honda are retesting their entire vehicle lineups, other automakers generally are retesting only those with updated powertrains. For example, the 2006 Ford Five Hundred is rated at 203 horsepower, the same as that of 2005 model. However, the 2006 rating does not reflect the new SAE testing procedure as Ford is not going to spend the extra expense of retesting its existing engines. Over time, most automakers are expected to comply with the new guidelines.
SAE tightened its horsepower rules to eliminate the opportunity for engine manufacturers to manipulate factors affecting performance such as how much oil was in the crankcase, engine control system calibration, and whether an engine was tested with premium fuel. In some cases, such can add up to a change in horsepower ratings. A road test editor at Edmunds.com, John Di Pietro, said decreases in horsepower ratings for  some '06 models are not that dramatic. For vehicles like a midsize family sedan,  it is likely that the reputation of the manufacturer will be more important.Jeff Plungis, Asians Oversell Horsepower, Detroit News

===Deutsches Institut für Normung 70020===

DIN 70020 is a standard from German DIN regarding road vehicles. Because the German word for horsepower is ''Pferdestärke, in Germany it is commonly abbreviated to PS''. DIN hp is measured at the engine's output shaft, and is usually expressed in metric (Pferdestärke) rather than mechanical horsepower.
