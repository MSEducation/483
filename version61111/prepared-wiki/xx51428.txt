The Giro d'Italia ([tpl]IPA-it|ˈdʒiːro diˈtaːlja[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-en|Tour of Italy[/tpl]) is an annual stage race bicycle race primarily held in Italy, while also occasionally passing through nearby countries.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/344716-the-history-of-the-giro-ditalia/|title=The History of the Giro d'Italia.|author=Gregg Seltzer|publisher=Livestrong|date=26 May 2011|accessdate=30 July 2012[/tpl] The race was first organized in 1909 to increase sales of the newspaper La Gazzetta dello Sport;[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.larousse.fr/encyclopedie/divers/Tour_dItalie/147186 |language=French |title=Tour d'Italie ou Giro d'Italia|publisher=Larousse.fr |date=30 March 2012 |accessdate=10 August 2012|trans_title=Tour of Italy or Giro d'Italia[/tpl] however it is currently run by RCS Sport.[tpl]cite web|url=http://bikeraceinfo.com/giro/giro1909.html#story |title=1909 Giro d'Italia |work= Bike Race Info |publisher=Dog Ear Publishing |last1=McGann |first1=Bill |last2=McGann |first2=Carol |accessdate=30 July 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rcsmediagroup.it/wps/portal/mg/!ut/p/c1/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3iXgBDLkGBLIwN_P29nA6MAj8DAYGcvA29Dc6B8JIq8oQFQ3sTfwNTJwwjIJE23v6eLgZFlWKCns5epoburGQHdfh75uan6BbmhEeWOiooAtx-tyg!!/dl2/d1/L0lDUmlTUSEhL3dHa0FKRnNBL1lCUlp3QSEhL2Vu/?wai= |title=RCS Sport |work=RCSMediaGroup |publisher=RCS MediaGroup S.p.A. |date=24 January 2013|accessdate=20 June 2013[/tpl] The race has been held annually since its first edition in 1909, except when it was stopped for the two world wars. As the Giro gained prominence and popularity the race was lengthened, and the peloton expanded from primarily Italian participation to riders from all over the world. The Giro is a UCI World Tour event, which means that the teams that compete in the race are mostly UCI Proteams, with the exception of the teams that the organizers can invite.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uci.ch/templates/UCI/UCI2/layout.asp?MenuId=MTUyMjQ |title=2012 - 2013 UCI Road Calendar |work=Union Cycliste Internationale|publisher=Union Cycliste Internationale|accessdate=6 June 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |author= Nigel Wynn |url=http://www.cyclingweekly.co.uk/news/latest/530629/uci-worldtour-calendar-2012.html |title=UCI WorldTour calendar 2012 |work=Cycling Weekly|publisher=IPC Media Limited|date=2 November 2011|accessdate=6 August 2012[/tpl]
Along with the Tour de France and Vuelta a España, the Giro makes up cycling's prestigious three-week-long Grand Tours.[tpl]cite news|url=http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/news.php?id=features/2007/abu_dhabi07 |title=Million dollar, baby! |work=Cycling News |publisher=Future Publishing Limited |date=12 January 2007 |accessdate=21 May 2011 [/tpl] The Giro is usually held during late May and early June. While the route changes each year, the format of the race stays the same, with the appearance of at least two time trials, the passage through the mountains of the Alps,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.perthnow.com.au/sport/ryder-hesjedal-in-pink-as-giro-ditalia-hits-the-alps/story-e6frg1wu-1226361346818 |title=Ryder Hesjedal in pink as Giro d'Italia hits the Alps|work=Perth Now|publisher=News Ltd |date=20 May 2012|accessdate=30 July 2012[/tpl] including the Dolomites,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.trektravel.com/classic-climbs-dolomites-bike-tour.php |title=Classic Climbs of the Dolomites Bike Tours, Biking Trips, & Bicycle Vacations of a Lifetime|work=Trek Travel|publisher=Trek Travel, LLC.|accessdate=30 July 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://bikeplustours.com/index.php/tours-rides/cycle-tour-catalogue/29-giro-ditalia-in-the-dolomites |title=Giro d’Italia in the Dolomites |work=BikePlusTours |date=8 August 2011 |accessdate=30 July 2012[/tpl] and the finish in the Italian city of Milan.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tourism.milan.it/wps/portal/!ut/p/c0/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3hzS0O_QGcLEwP_ICNTA08D_2APT1dHYwMDE_3g1Dz9gmxHRQCvgnB_/?WCM_PORTLET=PC_7_791NQC840OR250I0OSHIEA3007_WCM&WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/wps/wcm/connect/en/situr/home/giro_italia |title=Giro d'Italia |work=Milan Tourism |publisher=Milano City |date=5 May 2012 |accessdate=10 August 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/races/giro-ditalia-2012/stage-21 |title=May 27, Stage 21: Milan (ITT) 31.5km |work=Cycling News|publisher=Future Publishing Limited|accessdate=19 July 2012[/tpl] Like the other Grand Tours, the modern editions of the Giro d'Italia normally consist of 21 day-long segments (stages) over a 23-day period that includes 2 rest days.
All of the stages are timed to the finish. After finishing the riders' times are compounded with their previous stage times. The rider with the lowest aggregate time is the leader of the race and gets to don the coveted pink jersey.[tpl]cite web|author=Laura Weislo|url=http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/road/2008/giro08/?id=/features/2008/giro_classifications08|title=Giro d'Italia classifications demystified|date=13 May 2008|work=Cycling News|publisher=Future Publishing Limited|accessdate=27 August 2009[/tpl] While the general classification gathers the most attention there are other contests held within the Giro: the points classification for the sprinters, the mountains classification for the climbers, young rider classification for the riders under the age of 25, and the team classification for the competing teams. The 2013 edition of the race was won by Italian rider Vincenzo Nibali.

==History==

===1908–1909: The idea and first race===

The idea of the holding a bicycle race that navigated around Italy was first suggested when La Gazzetta dello Sport editor Tullo Morgagni sent a telegram to both the paper's owner, Emilio Costamagna, and cycling editor, Armando Cougnet, stating the need for an Italian tour.[tpl]cite book | last=Fotheringham | first=William | authorlink=William Fotheringham | title = Century of Cycling: The Classic Races and Legendary Champions | chapter = The Heroic Age | publisher = MBI Publishing Company | date = 30 June 2003 | location = London, England, United Kingdom | pages = 103–104 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=N2P_8ArwhPQC&pg=PT19&dq=ganna+1909+giro | accessdate = 17 July 2012 | isbn =978-0-7603-1553-8[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://bikeraceinfo.com/giro/giro1909.html |title=1909 Giro d'Italia |work=Bike Race Info |date= |author= Bill and Carol McGann |publisher=Dog Ear Publishing|accessdate=10 July 2012[/tpl] At the time La Gazzetta's rival, Corriere della Sera was planning on holding a bicycle race of its own, after the success they had gained from holding an automobile race.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Speciali/Giroditalia/2005/eng/storiadelgiro.html|title=History|work=La Gazzetta dello Sport|publisher=RCS MediaGroup|accessdate=15 September 2010[/tpl] Morgagni then decided to try and hold their race before Corriere della Sera could hold theirs, but La Gazzetta lacked the money. However, after the success La Gazzetta had with creating the Giro di Lombardia and Milan – San Remo, the owner Costamagna decided to go through with the idea. Their bike race was announced on August 7, 1908 in the first page of that day's edition of La Gazzetta dello Sport. The race was to be held in May of 1909. The idea of the race was inspired by the Tour de France and the success that L'Auto had gained from it.[tpl]cite news|author=Leslie Reissner |url=http://www.pezcyclingnews.com/page/features/?id=84149#.UcXheZzNnsI|title=The Giro d’Italia: Don’t Go Home Yet! |date=23 June 2011|work=PezCycling News|accessdate=27 May 2012[/tpl]
Since the organizers lacked the funds, 25,000 lira, needed to hold the race, they consulted Primo Bongrani, an accountant at the bank Cassa di Risparmio and friend of the three organizers. Bongrani proceeded to go around Italy asking for donations to help hold the race. Bongrani's efforts were largely successful, he had procured enough money to cover the operating costs. The money that was to be given out as prizes came from a casino in San Remo after Francesco Sghirla, a former Gazzetta employee, encouraged it to contribute to the race. Even Corriere, La Gazzetta's rival, gave 3,000 lire to the race's fund.
On 13 May 1909 at 02:53 am 127 riders started the first Giro d'Italia at Loreto Place in Milan. The race was split into eight stages covering [tpl]convert|2448|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. A total of 49 riders finished, with Italian Luigi Ganna winning.[tpl]cite news |url=http://hemeroteca.mundodeportivo.com/preview/1909/06/10/pagina-3/607616/pdf.html |title=La Vuelta De Italia |language=Spanish |date=10 June 1909 |page=3 |newspaper=El Mundo Deportivo |accessdate=27 May 2012| format=PDF |trans_title=The Giro d'Italia[/tpl] Ganna won three individual stages and the General Classification. Ganna received 5325 lira as a winner’s prize, with the last rider in the general classification receiving 300 lira. The Giro's director received only 150 lira a month, 150 lira fewer than the last-placed rider.

===1910–1924: Italian domination===

During these years, and up until 1950, the winners of the Giro d'Italia were exclusively of Italian descent.[tpl]cite web|url=http://bikeraceinfo.com/giro/giro1950.html |title=1950 Giro d'Italia |work= Bike Race Info |publisher=Dog Ear Publishing |last1=McGann |first1=Bill |last2=McGann |first2=Carol |accessdate=6 August 2012[/tpl] The 1909 edition of the Giro was such a success that the organizers added two more stages and over [tpl]convert|500|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] to the race.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bikeraceinfo.com/giro/giro1910.html |title=1910 Giro d'Italia |work= Bike Race Info |publisher=Dog Ear Publishing |last1=McGann |first1=Bill |last2=McGann |first2=Carol |accessdate=6 August 2012[/tpl] The organizers also restructured the point distribution to determine the overall leader; the stage winner would get one point for finishing first, second place got two points, and so on until the 51st and up finishers, who would just receive 51 points. The first non-Italian stage winner, Jean-Baptiste Dortignacq, came in the 1910 edition of the race; he won the second stage of the race. Carlo Galetti led from stage two until the finish.[tpl]cite news|url=http://hemeroteca.mundodeportivo.com/preview/1910/06/16/pagina-3/618975/pdf.html|title=La Vuelta De Italia|language=Spanish|date=16 June 1910|page=3|newspaper=El Mundo Deportivo|accessdate=27 May 2012|format=PDF|trans_title=The Giro d'Italia[/tpl] The 1911 Giro d'Italia was the first Giro to not have the start or finish of the race in Milan.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bikeraceinfo.com/giro/giro1911.html |title=1911 Giro d'Italia |work= Bike Race Info |publisher=Dog Ear Publishing |last1=McGann |first1=Bill |last2=McGann |first2=Carol |accessdate=6 August 2012[/tpl] The start and finish for the race was in the Italian capital, Rome – in order to celebrate Italy's 50th anniversary of unification. The 1911 edition also saw the first foreign rider to lead the race, the Frenchmen Lucien Petit-Breton, and the first repeat winner of the race, Carlo Galetti.[tpl]cite news|url=http://hemeroteca.mundodeportivo.com/preview/1911/06/15/pagina-3/1374492/pdf.html|title=La Vuelta De Italia|language=Spanish|date=15 June 1911|page=3|newspaper=El Mundo Deportivo|accessdate=27 May 2012|format=PDF|trans_title=The Giro d'Italia[/tpl]
The 1912 Giro d'Italia saw some big changes to how the general classification was to be run, while still being based around a point system.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bikeraceinfo.com/giro/giro1912.html |title=1912 Giro d'Italia |work= Bike Race Info |publisher=Dog Ear Publishing |last1=McGann |first1=Bill |last2=McGann |first2=Carol |accessdate=6 August 2012[/tpl] The race was to be centered around the team instead of the individual, meaning that the leader of the race would be a team instead of an individual. Teams were allowed only four riders for each squad.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cyclingrevealed.com/timeline/Race%20Snippets/GdI/GdI_1912.htm|author=Barry Boyce|title=Cycling Revealed Timeline|work=The Giro in 1912... A Team Competition |publisher=CyclingRevealed |accessdate=6 August 2012[/tpl] The changes to the general classification was met with strong opposition from the start. Fourteen teams lined up at the start in Milan. Team Atala, which consisted of Luigi Ganna, Carlo Galetti, Eberardo Pavesi, and Giovanni Micheletto, led the race from start to finish.[tpl]cite news|url=http://hemeroteca.mundodeportivo.com/preview/1912/06/13/pagina-4/1385665/pdf.html|title=La Vuelta De Italia|language=Spanish|date=13 June 1912|page=4|newspaper=El Mundo Deportivo|accessdate=27 May 2012|format=PDF|trans_title=The Giro d'Italia[/tpl] Luigi Ganna was the only member of Team Atala that didn't finish the race, he dropped out during the fifth stage. Galetti became the first three time winner of the Giro d'Italia.
Next year's race was the last Giro to be run with a points system.[tpl]cite web|url=http://bikeraceinfo.com/giro/giro1913.html |title=1913 Giro d'Italia |work= Bike Race Info |publisher=Dog Ear Publishing |last1=McGann |first1=Bill |last2=McGann |first2=Carol |accessdate=6 August 2012[/tpl] The Giro's peloton that year was completely Italian. The race saw the first appearance of Costante Girardengo, who would win the sixth stage, and come to dominate the Giro in the future. Carlo Oriani, who had just gotten out of serving the Italian military in the Italo-Turkish War, won the race by six points over the second place finisher, Eberardo Pavesi.[tpl]cite news|url=http://hemeroteca.mundodeportivo.com/preview/1913/05/29/pagina-3/606537/pdf.html|title=La Vuelta De Italia|language=Spanish|date=29 May 1913|page=3|newspaper=El Mundo Deportivo|accessdate=27 May 2012|format=PDF|trans_title=The Giro d'Italia[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://hemeroteca.mundodeportivo.com/preview/1913/05/29/pagina-4/1383034/pdf.html|title=La Vuelta De Italia|language=Spanish|date=29 May 1913|page=4|newspaper=El Mundo Deportivo|accessdate=27 May 2012|format=PDF|trans_title=The Giro d'Italia[/tpl] The 1914 Giro d'Italia saw the calculation of the general classification shift from a points system to a time based system.[tpl]cite web|url=http://bikeraceinfo.com/giro/giro1914.html |title=1914 Giro d'Italia |work= Bike Race Info |publisher=Dog Ear Publishing |last1=McGann |first1=Bill |last2=McGann |first2=Carol |accessdate=6 August 2012[/tpl] Riders would now have their finishing times for each stage totaled together to determine the overall leader. Eighty-one riders entered the 1914 edition of the race, but only eight of them finished the race completely.[tpl]cite news|url=http://hemeroteca.mundodeportivo.com/preview/1914/06/11/pagina-3/1394122/pdf.html|title=La Vuelta De Italia|language=Spanish|date=29 May 1913|page=4|newspaper=El Mundo Deportivo|accessdate=27 May 2012|format=PDF|trans_title=The Giro d'Italia[/tpl] The grueling race was won by Alfonso Calzolari, who won by almost two hours over the second place finisher. A Giro was planned for 1915, but the plans were scrapped when Italy entered World War I. After the war ended, the race resumed in 1919.[tpl]cite web|url=http://bikeraceinfo.com/giro/giro1919.html |title=1919 Giro d'Italia |work= Bike Race Info |publisher=Dog Ear Publishing |last1=McGann |first1=Bill |last2=McGann |first2=Carol |accessdate=6 August 2012[/tpl]
The 1919 edition of the race navigated through the ruined parts of Northern Italy, which made it hard for the organizers. Costante Girardengo, the winner of the Giro that year, became the first rider to lead the Giro from start to finish. In route to winning the Giro, Girardengo won seven of the ten stages that comprised that year's Giro. The Giro also witnessed its first foreign rider to place on the podium in Marcel Buysse. Buysse finished third overall, just a little over an hour slower than Girardengo. Next year's Giro began with close to fifty riders and finished with just ten of those fifty riders.[tpl]cite web|url=http://bikeraceinfo.com/giro/giro1920.html |title=1920 Giro d'Italia |work= Bike Race Info |publisher=Dog Ear Publishing |last1=McGann |first1=Bill |last2=McGann |first2=Carol |accessdate=6 August 2012[/tpl] The first stage of the 1920 Giro d'Italia briefly went into Switzerland, which was the first time that the Giro had ever left its home country of Italy. Girardengo, the winner of the previous year's Giro, was widely believed to be the favorite, but the injuries sustained from crashes in the second stage forced him to withdraw from the race. Gaetano Belloni capitalized on Girardengo's troubles, along with Giuseppe Olivieri, the race leader after stage 1, and Carlo Galetti's withdrawals in the second stage, to win the stage and take the lead. Belloni went on to win the Giro, proving to those who called him "the Eternal Second" that he could win a race.
Costante Girardengo won the first four stages of the 1921 Giro d'Italia and led the race through the first four days.[tpl]cite web|url=http://bikeraceinfo.com/giro/giro1921.html |title=1921 Giro d'Italia |work= Bike Race Info |publisher=Dog Ear Publishing |last1=McGann |first1=Bill |last2=McGann |first2=Carol |accessdate=6 August 2012[/tpl] During the fifth stage, Girardengo was involved in a crash, seeing that Girardengo was in trouble, Belloni attacked. Girardengo chased for [tpl]convert|60|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] before calling it quits. Belloni was then the new leader after stage 5's conclusion. Giovanni Brunero was the only rider close to Belloni at that point. Brunero attacked during the race's seventh stage to win the stage and take the overall lead by close to a minute. Brunero held that lead all the way to the finish in Milan. The 1922 Giro d'Italia saw some controversy amongst the general classification contenders.[tpl]cite web|url=http://bikeraceinfo.com/giro/giro1922.html |title=1922 Giro d'Italia |work= Bike Race Info |publisher=Dog Ear Publishing |last1=McGann |first1=Bill |last2=McGann |first2=Carol |accessdate=6 August 2012[/tpl] In the race's first stage, Giovanni Brunero received an illegal wheel change – Brunero took a wheel from his teammate Alfredo Sivocci – and Brunero was ultimately penalized 25 minutes. Costante Girardengo and Gaetono Belloni, along with their respective teams Maino and Bianchi, wanted Brunero to be expelled from the Giro for the illegal wheel change. Both the Maino and Bianchi squads eventually withdrew from the Giro due to their outrage with the organizer's decision to give Brunero a 25 minute penalty. Brunero went on to win the Giro d'Italia, his second one of his career.
The 1923 Giro d'Italia was dominated by Costante Girardengo, he won eight out of the ten stages that made up that year's Giro.[tpl]cite web|url=http://bikeraceinfo.com/giro/giro1923.html |title=1923 Giro d'Italia |work= Bike Race Info |publisher=Dog Ear Publishing |last1=McGann |first1=Bill |last2=McGann |first2=Carol |accessdate=6 August 2012[/tpl] Girardengo wasn't able to distance himself too far from his stiffest competition, he won the Giro by only thirty-seven seconds over the second place finisher Giovanni Brunero. This was Girardengo's second career win of the Giro d'Italia. Girardengo, Brunero, and Gaetano Belloni didn't start the 1924 edition due to an argument over the start money.[tpl]cite web|url=http://bikeraceinfo.com/giro/giro1924.html |title=1924 Giro d'Italia |work= Bike Race Info |publisher=Dog Ear Publishing |last1=McGann |first1=Bill |last2=McGann |first2=Carol |accessdate=6 August 2012[/tpl] Their choice not to participate gave the other general classification hopefuls a bigger chance to win the Giro. Giuseppe Enrici cemented his lead of the race, after his performance during the horrid weather conditions in stage eight. This was Enrici's biggest win in his career. The 1924 edition of the Giro also saw the only woman to ever compete in the history of the Giro d'Italia, Alfonsina Strada. She was eliminated from the race after the seventh stage, but the organizers allowed her to race the stages still; however she wouldn't be included in the general classification. Strada made it all the way to the Giro's finish in Milan; she finished around twenty hours slower than the winner Enrici.

===1925–1935: The Binda years===

The 1925 Giro d'Italia saw the emergence of a new star, Alfredo Binda.[tpl]cite web|url=http://bikeraceinfo.com/giro/giro1925.html |title=1925 Giro d'Italia |work= Bike Race Info |publisher=Dog Ear Publishing |last1=McGann |first1=Bill |last2=McGann |first2=Carol |accessdate=6 August 2012[/tpl] Despite winning six stages of the Giro, Costante Girardengo did not win the Giro. Binda gained the lead after the fifth stage, when he and a few other general classification contenders attacked while Girardengo was repairing a flat tire on his bike. Girardengo moved back up to second overall after the incident in stage five, but he couldn't overpower Alfredo Binda. Next year's Giro had 204 riders start in Milan, but only 40 of those riders made it back to the finish in Milan.[tpl]cite web|url=http://bikeraceinfo.com/giro/giro1926.html |title=1926 Giro d'Italia |work= Bike Race Info |publisher=Dog Ear Publishing |last1=McGann |first1=Bill |last2=McGann |first2=Carol |accessdate=6 August 2012[/tpl] In the first stage of the race, Alfredo Binda crashed and lost a great deal of time. Binda then began to work for his teammate, Giovanni Brunero. Binda won six of the stages in the race, while leading Brunero to his record third Giro d'Italia victory.
The 1927 Giro d'Italia was dominated by Alfredo Binda.[tpl]cite web|url=http://bikeraceinfo.com/giro/giro1927.html |title=1927 Giro d'Italia |work= Bike Race Info |publisher=Dog Ear Publishing |last1=McGann |first1=Bill |last2=McGann |first2=Carol |accessdate=6 August 2012[/tpl] On the way to his victory, Binda won a record twelve stages; a record which still stands today. Alfredo Binda also led the Giro from start to finish, which had previously only been done by Costante Girardengo (in 1919). The organizers made some changes to the race that year, the stage winner now received a one minute time bonus and stages were now occasionally run on consecutive days, where before they had at least one rest day before each stage. Binda returned the next year to win six of the twelve stages, along with the Giro itself.[tpl]cite web|url=http://bikeraceinfo.com/giro/giro1928.html |title=1928 Giro d'Italia |work= Bike Race Info |publisher=Dog Ear Publishing |last1=McGann |first1=Bill |last2=McGann |first2=Carol |accessdate=6 August 2012[/tpl] Binda first captured the lead after the fourth stage, where he distanced himself greatly from his competitors. Binda became the second person to win three Giro d'Italias in their career. That year also saw a record number of participants at 298 riders, with 126 of those reaching the finish in Milan.
In 1929 Alfredo Binda dominated once again.[tpl]cite web|url=http://bikeraceinfo.com/giro/giro1929.html |title=1929 Giro d'Italia |work= Bike Race Info |publisher=Dog Ear Publishing |last1=McGann |first1=Bill |last2=McGann |first2=Carol |accessdate=6 August 2012[/tpl] On the way to his third consecutive, and fourth career, Giro d'Italia victory, Binda won a record eight consecutive stages.[tpl]cite web|url=http://paris.thover.com/article/142/fr/le-parcours-du-giro-d-italia-2009---le-tour-d-italie-fete-son-100eme-anniversaire-comme-il-se-doit.html|title=le Tour d'Italie fête son 100ème anniversaire comme il se doit|work=Velowire|language=French|date=15 December 2008|accessdate=15 September 2010[/tpl] This Giro began in Rome, which was the second time that the Giro hadn't began in Milan in the history of its running. When Binda came to the finish in Milan, he was booed by some of the spectators, which bothered him greatly. The next year, Binda was paid 22,500 lire, the same amount of money the winner of the Giro would get, not to participate in the Giro.[tpl]cite web|url=http://bikeraceinfo.com/giro/giro1930.html |title=1930 Giro d'Italia |work= Bike Race Info |publisher=Dog Ear Publishing |last1=McGann |first1=Bill |last2=McGann |first2=Carol |accessdate=6 August 2012[/tpl] Binda's absence left the field open for everyone else. The eventual winner, Luigi Marchisio, gained the lead after winning the third stage of the race and held it all the way to the finish in Milan. Marchisio held a slim fifty-two second lead for the last six stages of the race to the finish in Milan. Marchisio became the youngest rider to win the Giro at 21 years, 1 month, and 13 days; his record stood for ten years before being broken by Fausto Coppi.
The famed race leader's maglia rosa, pink jersey, was introduced in the 1931 edition of the Giro.[tpl]cite web|url=http://bikeraceinfo.com/giro/giro1931.html |title=1931 Giro d'Italia |work= Bike Race Info |publisher=Dog Ear Publishing |last1=McGann |first1=Bill |last2=McGann |first2=Carol |accessdate=6 August 2012[/tpl] The color pink was chosen for the leader's jersey since La Gazzetta dello Sport printed its news on a pink paper. The maglia rosa was first worn by Learco Guerra, who won the first stage of the race. Alfredo Binda returned to the Giro, only to retire while leading during the sixth stage. The eventual winner, Francesco Camusso, attacked during the eleventh stage to claim the lead of the race. Binda came into the 1932 Giro d'Italia in bad form, so he decided to work for his teammate Antonio Pesenti.[tpl]cite web|url=http://bikeraceinfo.com/giro/giro1932.html |title=1932 Giro d'Italia |work= Bike Race Info |publisher=Dog Ear Publishing |last1=McGann |first1=Bill |last2=McGann |first2=Carol |accessdate=6 August 2012[/tpl] The German Hermann Buse gained the lead of the Giro from the second stage to the sixth stage, in doing so he became the first German to lead the Giro. During the seventh stage of the race, Pesenti gained the lead of the race by winning the stage by means of a solo attack. Pesenti held the lead to the end of the race.
The Mountains classification was introduced in the 1933 Giro d'Italia, along with the first individual time trial.[tpl]cite web|url=http://bikeraceinfo.com/giro/giro1933.html |title=1933 Giro d'Italia |work= Bike Race Info |publisher=Dog Ear Publishing |last1=McGann |first1=Bill |last2=McGann |first2=Carol |accessdate=6 August 2012[/tpl] The organizers also expanded the Giro's total stage number to 17, it had been around twelve the few preceding years.

Bergamaschi originally came to the Giro to work for his teammate, the great Costante Girardengo.

===1936–1953: Bartali and Coppi battle for supremacy===

Due to Italy's political stance at the time, the 1936 Giro d'Italia saw no foreign participation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://bikeraceinfo.com/giro/giro1936.html |title=1936 Giro d'Italia |work= Bike Race Info |publisher=Dog Ear Publishing |last1=McGann |first1=Bill |last2=McGann |first2=Carol |accessdate=6 August 2012[/tpl] The organizers of the race also included the first uphill individual time trial in the Giro's history; the time trial went [tpl]convert|20|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] up to the summit of Monte Terminillo. Gino Bartali took the lead of the race by attacking on the final climb of the hilly ninth stage of the race. Bartali held that lead all the way to Milan. Along with the general classification, Bartali won his second consecutive mountains classification title. For the 1937 Giro d'Italia the organizers decided to include the Dolomites for the first time in the history of the Giro d'Italia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.larousse.fr/encyclopedie/article/Le_Giro_a_100_ans/11018987|title=Le Giro a 100 ans|language=French |work=larousse.fr|accessdate=16 September 2010|trans_title=The Giro d'Italia is 100 Years Old[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://bikeraceinfo.com/giro/giro1937.html |title=1937 Giro d'Italia |work= Bike Race Info |publisher=Dog Ear Publishing |last1=McGann |first1=Bill |last2=McGann |first2=Carol |accessdate=6 August 2012[/tpl] In addition to that, the organizers included the first team time trial in the Giro's history.

Bartali displayed his dominance in the mountains and gained the lead after the uphill stage 8a time trial. Bartali carried the maglia rosa all the way to Milan, winning his second consecutive Giro d'Italia.
Gino Bartali, the winner of the 1936 and 1937 Giro d'Italias, was ordered by the Italian government to race the Tour de France instead of the Giro in 1938.[tpl]cite web|url=http://bikeraceinfo.com/giro/giro1938.html |title=1938 Giro d'Italia |work= Bike Race Info |publisher=Dog Ear Publishing |last1=McGann |first1=Bill |last2=McGann |first2=Carol |accessdate=6 August 2012[/tpl] Giovanni Valetti, the eventual winner, took the lead of the 1938 Giro d'Italia after the mountainous ninth stage. Valetti had a lead of a minute and a half after that stage, but he built upon his lead as the Giro went on. He finished almost nine minutes ahead of the second place rider Ezio Cecchi. The 1939 Giro d'Italia was a battle between Gino Bartali and Giovanni Valetti.[tpl]cite web|url=http://bikeraceinfo.com/giro/giro1939.html |title=1939 Giro d'Italia |work= Bike Race Info |publisher=Dog Ear Publishing |last1=McGann |first1=Bill |last2=McGann |first2=Carol |accessdate=6 August 2012[/tpl] The race had been led primarily Cino Cinelli early on; Cinelli lost the lead to Secondo Magni after stage 9a. Magni lost the lead to Giovanni Valetti after the stage 9b individual time trial. Valetti lost the lead to Gino Bartali in the fifteenth stage after he had attacked on the Passo Rolle. Bartali would lose the lead to Valetti after flatting multiple times and crashing in the sixteenth stage. Valetti would go on to win his second consecutive Giro d'Italia, while Bartali left the Giro with his fourth mountains classification title.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.larousse.fr/encyclopedie/article/Le_Giro_a_100_ans/11018987|title=Le Giro a 100 ans|publisher=larousse.fr|accessdate=16 September 2010[/tpl]
Bartali came to the 1940 Giro d'Italia with a strong Legnano team and high ambitions to win the overall crown.[tpl]cite web|url=http://bikeraceinfo.com/giro/giro1940.html |title=1940 Giro d'Italia |work= Bike Race Info |publisher=Dog Ear Publishing |last1=McGann |first1=Bill |last2=McGann |first2=Carol |accessdate=6 August 2012[/tpl] His hopes were derailed when he crashed in the race's second stage and lost a good deal of time. Fausto Coppi was then promoted to the new team leader after Bartali's misfortunes. Coppi took the lead after attacking on the Abetone in the race's eleventh stage. Coppi managed to keep the lead of the race all the way to the race's finish in Milan, where he officially won his first Giro d'Italia. Coppi became the youngest rider to ever win the Giro at 20 years, 8 months and 25 days old, breaking the record that was held by Luigi Marchisio.[tpl]cite news|url=http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/28052010/58/giro-d-italia-top-five-giro-d-italia-finishes.html |title=Top five:Giro d'Italia finishes |work=Eurosport|publisher=Yahoo! and Eurosport|date=24 May 2010|accessdate=4 September 2010|author=Eurosport[/tpl] Bartali didn't leave the Giro empty handed, he won two stages near the end of the race along with the mountains classification. World War II brought the Giro's annual running to a halt after the 1940 edition. Coppi was put into the Italy's services, he served in Tunisia; while Bartali went to the Vatican after 1942 racing season.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sportvox.fr/article.php3?id_article=24691|title=Le Centenaire du Giro|language=French |work=SportVox|publisher=Amaury Sport Organisation|date=5 May 2009|accessdate=16 September 2010|trans_title=The Centennial of the Giro[/tpl]
Benito Mussolini, Italy's dictator at the time, tried to keep the bicycle races going while Italy was involved in the Second World War.[tpl]cite web|url=http://bikeraceinfo.com/giro/giro1941.html |title=1941 Giro d'Italia |work= Bike Race Info |publisher=Dog Ear Publishing |last1=McGann |first1=Bill |last2=McGann |first2=Carol |accessdate=6 August 2012[/tpl] The Giro consumed so much gasoline, food, and other supplies that it would hurt Italy's efforts towards the war, so the Giro that people were familiar with wasn't run. The government created a new "point series" Giro that would comprise the major one day races that were run in Italy, where the riders would earn points based on their placing in each race. Some of the notable races that comprised this "Giro" were the Milan – San Remo and the Giro di Lombardia. The new "point series" Giro was first won by Gino Bartali in 1942. The 1943 edition of the government's Giro was interrupted after Allie forces landed in Sicily and after Mussolini was deposed. After Mussolini's reign ended, bicycle racing came to a complete stop in Italy.
The Giro resumed its annual running in 1946.[tpl]cite web|url=http://bikeraceinfo.com/giro/giro1946.html |title=1946 Giro d'Italia |work= Bike Race Info |publisher=Dog Ear Publishing |last1=McGann |first1=Bill |last2=McGann |first2=Carol |accessdate=6 August 2012[/tpl] The organizers added the black jersey, or the maglia nera, for the last rider in the overall classification.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Ciclismo/Primo_Piano/2008/01_Gennaio/11/numero_nero_1101.shtml |title=Giro, la Maglia nera diventa Numero nero |language=Italian |work=La Gazzetta dello Sport|publisher=RCS MediaGroup|location=Milan, Italy|date=11 January 2008|accessdate=4 August 2012|trans_title=The Giro, the black jersey becomes the black number[/tpl] Bartali and Coppi returned to the Giro, but this time they were on separate teams. Coppi was put into difficulty in stage nine, where he lost a good deal of time. During the twelfth stage of the race, the route was set to pass through Pieris on the way to Trieste. In Pieris, there were some Yugoslavs who threw stones at some armed Italian guards. Gunfire erupted soon and the stage was ultimately cancelled, with close to twenty riders being escorted to Trieste. There were also riots that took place in Trieste since Yugoslavia and Italy both claimed that as part of their territory.  Bartali first gained the lead after the thirteenth stage of the race. Bartali would hold that lead to the finish in Milan without winning a stage in the race. In addition to winning the general classification, Bartali won the mountains classification.
The 1947 Giro d'Italia was the first Giro to have all competing riders be a part of a trade team, rather than some competing as independents.[tpl]cite web|url=http://bikeraceinfo.com/giro/giro1947.html |title=1947 Giro d'Italia |work= Bike Race Info |publisher=Dog Ear Publishing |last1=McGann |first1=Bill |last2=McGann |first2=Carol |accessdate=6 August 2012[/tpl] Although Fausto Coppi won the fourth stage, Bartali took the early lead of the race as the two riders, along with Aldo Ronconi, broke away on the ascent of the Abetone and raced into Prato. Bartali held that lead until the sixteenth stage, where he lost the lead to Fausto Coppi. During the sixteenth stage Bartali's chain dropped on the climb of the Falzarego, Coppi saw this and attacked. The same misfortune struck Coppi on the descent of the Falzarego, which allowed Bartali to rejoin him. Coppi attacked on the Passo Pordoi, but this time Bartali could not keep up. Coppi went on to win the stage and gain the overall lead, which he held all the way to Milan. The 1948 Giro d'Italia featured the smallest margin of victory between any competing riders in the history of the Giro d'Italia; Fiorenzo Magni won by eleven seconds over Ezio Cecchi.[tpl]cite web|url=http://bikeraceinfo.com/giro/giro1948.html |title=1948 Giro d'Italia |work= Bike Race Info |publisher=Dog Ear Publishing |last1=McGann |first1=Bill |last2=McGann |first2=Carol |accessdate=6 August 2012[/tpl] Magni set up his victory by being a part of the breakaway that succeeded in the race's ninth stage. Magni gained close to thirteen minutes on the favorites of the race in Bartali and Coppi. Ezio Cecchi briefly gained the lead of the race for two stages, but Magni regained the lead after the seventeenth stage which saw the race travel over the Pordoi Pass. Fausto Coppi and his team, Bianchi, suspected Magni to have received help from the spectators; Magni was ultimately given a two minute penalty. The penalty to Magni wasn't enough to prevent him from winning the race, but he did so by the slimmest of margins.
Fausto Coppi returned to the Giro in 1949 with aims to win again.[tpl]cite web|url=http://bikeraceinfo.com/giro/giro1949.html |title=1949 Giro d'Italia |work= Bike Race Info |publisher=Dog Ear Publishing |last1=McGann |first1=Bill |last2=McGann |first2=Carol |accessdate=6 August 2012[/tpl] After the ninth stage of the race, Coppi was close to ten minutes behind the race leader Adolfo Leoni. However, Coppi made up over nine minutes on the Leoni during the tenth stage.

His opposition came from the returning champion Berzin and teammate Piotr Ugrumov who attacked each other repeatedly, which greatly hurt their chances. In addition to the general classification, Rominger also won the points and intergiro classifications.

==Classifications==

A few riders from each to aim to win overall but there are three further competitions to draw riders of all specialties: points, mountains, and a classification for young riders with general classification aspirations. The oldest of the four classifications is the general classification. The leader of each aforementioned classifications wears a distinctive jersey. If a rider leads more than one classification that awards, he wears the jersey of the most prestigious classification. The abandoned jersey is worn by the rider who is second in the competition.

===General classification===

The most sought after classification in the Giro d'Italia is the general classification. All of the stages are timed to the finish, after finishing the riders' times are compounded with their previous stage times; so the rider with the lowest aggregate time is the leader of the race. The leader is determined after each stage's conclusion. The leader of the race also has the privilege to wear the race leader's pink jersey. The jersey is presented to the leader rider on a podium in the stage's finishing town. If a rider is leading more than one classification that awards a jersey, he will wear the maglia rosa since the general classification is the most important one in the race. The lead can change after each stage. The winner of the 2013 Giro d'Italia was Vincenzo Nibali.
The color pink was chosen as the magazine that created the Giro, La Gazzetta dello Sport, printed its newspapers on pink paper. The pink jersey was added to the race in the 1931 edition and it has since become a symbol of the Giro d'Italia. The first rider to wear the pink jersey was Learco Guerra. Each team brings multiple pink jerseys in advance of the Giro in case one of their riders becomes the overall leader of the race. Riders usually try to make the extra effort to keep the jersey for as long as possible in order to get more publicity for the team and the sponsor(s) of the team. Eddy Merckx wore the jersey for 78 stages, more than any other rider in the history of the Giro d'Italia.[tpl]cite news|author=VeloNews.com|url=http://velonews.competitor.com/2005/06/news/happy-birthday-eddy_8224|title=Happy Birthday, Eddy!|date=17 June 2005 |work=VeloNews|publisher=Competitor Group, Inc|accessdate=23 June 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|author=VeloNews.com|url=http://velonews.competitor.com/2012/03/news/giro-ditalia-hall-of-fame-inducts-eddy-merckx-as-its-first-member_209438|title=Giro d’Italia Hall of Fame inducts Eddy Merckx as its first member|date=15 March 2012 |work=VeloNews|publisher=Competitor Group, Inc|accessdate=23 June 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://ftp.cyclingnews.com/road/2009/giro09/?id=/features/2009/giro09_eddy_merckx |title=The Belgian Italians couldn't resist - Eddy Merckx |date=28 May 2011 |work=Cycling News|publisher=Future Publishing Limited|accessdate=1 October 2012[/tpl] Three riders have won the general classification five times in their career: Alfredo Binda, Fausto Coppi, and Eddy Merckx.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.infostradasports.com/download/media/handbook.pdf|title=Giro d'Italia 2009|page=187|publisher=Infostrada sports|year=2009|accessdate=29 June 2011|format=PDF[/tpl]
The general classification winner was not always determined by a time system. In the inaugural Giro d'Italia the organizers chose to have a points system over a system based around elapsed time after the scandal that engulfed the 1904 Tour de France. In addition to that, the organizers chose the point system since it would be cheaper to count the placings of the riders rather than clocking the riders during each stage. The race leader was calculated by adding up each rider's placings in each stage and the rider with the lowest total was the leader; if a rider placed second in the first stage and third in the second stage, he would have five points total. The system was modified a year later to give the riders who placed 51st or higher in a stage 51 points and keep the point distribution system the same for the riders who placed 1st through 50th in a stage. The calculation remained unmodified until 1912 where the organizers chose to have the race be centered around teams, while still keeping the point system. The next year race organizers chose to revert to the system used in 1911. In 1914, the organizers shifted to the system used nowadays, where riders would have their finishing times for each stage totaled together to determine the overall leader.
These are the time bonuses that the riders receive for crossing the lines in the first few positions:[tpl]cite web|url=http://images2.gazzettaobjects.it/Speciali/Giroditalia/2012/en/Regulation.pdf|title=Formula and Itinerary|publisher=Gazzetta della Sport|year=2012|accessdate=29 June 2012|section=18|pages=6–7[/tpl]

===Mountains classification===

The mountains classification is the second oldest jersey awarding classification in the Giro d'Italia. The mountains classification was added to the Giro d'Italia in 1933 Giro d'Italia and was first won by Alfredo Binda. During mountain stages of the race, points are awarded to the rider who is first to reach the top of each significant climb. Points are also awarded for riders who closely follow the leader up each climb. The number of points awarded varies according to the hill classification, which is determined by the steepness and length of that particular hill.
The climbers' jersey is worn by the rider who, at the start of each stage, has the largest amount of climbing points. If a rider leads two or more of the categories, the climbers' jersey is worn by the rider in second, or third, place in that contest. At the end of the Giro, the rider holding the most climbing points wins the classification. In fact, some riders, particularly those who are neither sprinters nor particularly good at time-trialing, may attempt only to win this particular competition within the race. The Giro has four categories of mountains. They range from category 4, the easiest, to category 1, the hardest. There is also the Cima Coppi, the highest point reached in a particular Giro, which is worth more points than the race's other first-category climbs. Gino Bartali has won the mountains classification a record seven times.
The classification awarded no jersey to the leader until the 1974 Giro d'Italia, when the organizers decided to award a green jersey to the leader. The green jersey was used until 2012, when the classification's sponsor, Banca Mediolanum, renewed its sponsorship for another four years and desired the jersey to be blue rather than green.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/blue-mountains-jersey-for-2012-giro-ditalia |title=Blue Mountains Jersey For 2012 Giro D'Italia |work=Cycling News|publisher=Future Publishing Limited |author= Cycling News|date=17 December 2011 |accessdate=20 June 2013[/tpl] Stefano Pirazzi won the mountains classification at the 2013 Giro d'Italia.
The point distribution for the mountains is as follows:

===Points classification===

The points classification is the third oldest of the four jersey current awarding classifications in the Giro d'Italia. It was introduced in the 1966 Giro d'Italia and was first won by Gianni Motta. Points are given to the rider who is first to reach the end of, or determined places during, any stage of the Giro. The red jersey is worn by the rider who at the start of each stage, has the largest amount of points. The rider whom at the end of the Giro, holds the most points, wins the points competition. Each stage win, regardless of the stage's categorization, awards 25 points, second place is worth 20 points, third 16, fourth 14, fifth 12, sixth 10, and one point less per place down the line, to a single point for fifteenth. This means that a true sprinter might not always win the points classification. The classification was added to draw the participation of the sprinters. The classification has been won four times by two riders: Francesco Moser and Giuseppe Saronni. The 2013 winner of the classification was Mark Cavendish.
In addition, stages can have one or more intermediate sprints: 8, 6, 4, 3, 2, 1 points are awarded to the first six cyclists passing these lines. These points also count toward the TV classification (Traguardo Volante, or "flying sprint"), a separate award.
The first year the points classification was used, it had no jersey that was given to the leader of the classification. In the 1967 Giro d'Italia, the red jersey was added for the leader of the classification. However, in 1969 the red jersey was changed to a cyclamen (purple) colored jersey. It remained that color until 2010 when the organizers chose to change the jersey back to the color red; in a return to the original color scheme for the three minor classifications, which reflected the colors of the Italian flag.[tpl]cite news|author=Cycling News|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/2010-giro-jersey-presented-in-florence|title=2010 Giro jersey presented in Florence|date=15 January 2010|work=Cycling News|publisher=Future Publishing Limited|accessdate=20 June 2013| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100118120616/http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/2010-giro-jersey-presented-in-florence| archivedate= 18 January 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
The point distribution for the sprints are as follows:

===Young rider classification===

The Young rider classification is restricted to the riders that are under the age of 25.[tpl]cite news|url=http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/news.php?id=news/2006/dec06/dec04news|title=First Edition Cycling News for December 4, 2006|author=Gregor Brown|work=Cycling News|publisher=Future Publishing Limited|date=4 December 2006|accessdate=30 July 2012[/tpl] The leader of the classification is determined the same way as the general classification, with the riders' times being added up after each stage and the eligible rider with lowest aggregate time is dubbed the leader. This classification was added to the Giro d'Italia in the 1976 edition, with Alfio Vandi being the first to win the classification after placing seventh overall. The classification was not contested between the years of 1995 and 2006. The classification was reintroduced in the 2007, and has been in each Giro since. The Giro d'Italia awards a white jersey to the leader of the classification. Evgeni Berzin is the only rider in the history of the Giro d'Italia to win the young rider classification and the general classification in the same year; Berzin won both classifications in 1994. Two riders have won the young rider classification twice in their respective careers: Vladimir Poulnikov and Pavel Tonkov. In 2013 it was won by Carlos Betancur.

===Team classifications===

There are two team classifications that are contested at the Giro d'Italia: the Trofeo Fast Team and the Trofeo Super Team. The Trofeo Fast Team is the older of the two as it was introduced in the first Giro d'Italia. It was first won by Atala. The Trofeo Fast Team is calculate by adding the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time. The classification just called the team classification in each edition until the organizers changed it to the Trofeo Fast Team for the 1994 Giro d'Italia. [tpl]ct|SKY|2013[/tpl] won the Trofeo Fast Team classification in 2013.
The Trofeo Super Team was introduced at the 1993 Giro d'Italia as the team points classification. The name Trofeo Super Team was adopted for the 1994 edition of the Giro and been used ever since. The classification was first won by Ariostea in 1993. The classification is a team points classification, with the top 20 placed riders on each stage earning points (20 for first place, 19 for second place and so on, down to a single point for 20th) for their team. [tpl]ct|MOV|2013[/tpl] won the Trofeo Super Team classification in 2013.

===Minor classifications===

Other less well-known classifications, whose leaders did not receive a special jersey, are awarded during the Giro. These awards were based on points earned throughout the three weeks of the tour. Each mass-start stage had one intermediate sprint, the Traguardo Volante, or T.V. The T.V. gave bonus seconds towards the general classification, points towards the regular points classification, and also points towards the T.V. classification. This award was known by various names in previous years, and was previously time-based. In 2013 this classification was renamed to the sprints classification and was won by Rafael Andriato.
Other awards include the Combativity classification, which was a compilation of points gained for position on crossing intermediate sprints, mountain passes and stage finishes. It was won by Mark Cavendish in 2013. The Azzurri d'Italia classification is based on finishing order; however, points were only awarded for the top three finishers in each stage. It was also most recently won by Mark Cavendish. Additionally, the Trofeo Fuga Pinarello rewarded riders who took part in a breakaway at the head of the field, each rider in an escape of ten or fewer riders getting one point for each kilometre that the group stayed clear. [tpl]ct|FAR|2013[/tpl]'s Rafael Andriato was first in this competition in 2013. Teams were given penalty points for minor technical infringements. [tpl]ct|LIQ|2013[/tpl] won the Fair Play classification after only accumulating twenty points in the 2013 edition.

===Defunct classifications===

In 1946 the maglia nera (black jersey) was introduced and awarded the cyclist who was last in the general classification. Riders sometimes deliberately wasted time in order to become last overall and so wear the black jersey. The classification was short lived, as it was last contested in the 1951 Giro d'Italia. The classification was won twice by Luigi Malabrocca, who won the classification in 1946 and 1947. The last winner of the maglia nera was Giovanni Pinarello.
The intergiro classification was introduced in 1989 and first won by Yugoslavian Jure Pavlič.[tpl]cite web|url=http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/road/2008/giro08/?id=history |title=91st Giro d'Italia – GT |work=Cycling News|publisher=Future Publishing Limited |date=1 June 2008 |accessdate=20 June 2013[/tpl] In each stage there would be a point, before the finish, where the riders would be timed until they crossed the line. The times from each stage would then be added together for each rider to determine the leader of the classification. The leader of the classification was awarded a blue jersey.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.radsport-seite.de/giro_intergiro.html |title=Giro d'Italia, Intergiro-Wertung |publisher=Radsport-seite.de |author=|date= |accessdate=4 August 2012[/tpl] The classification was run each year since its addition until 2005. The last winner of the classification was Stefano Zanini. Fabrizio Guidi won the classification three times, the most by any rider. Guidi won the classification in 1996, 1999, and 2000.
There was also a combination classification that was introduced in the 1985 Giro d'Italia and was first won by Urs Freuler.[tpl]cite news|url=http://hemeroteca.mundodeportivo.com/preview/1985/06/10/pagina-34/1120026/pdf.html|title=Hinault: Tres Vidas En Rosa|language=Spanish|date=10 June 1985|page=34|newspaper=El Mundo Deportivo|accessdate=27 May 2012|format=PDF|trans_title=Hinault: Three Lives In Pink[/tpl] The classification was discontinued after the 1988 Giro d'Italia.

==Types of stages==

A stage is a unit of the race that covers a portion of the Giro d'Italia's route in one day. Nowadays the Giro d'Italia contains either twenty-one stages or twenty stages and a prologue, with a prologue being an individual time trial under [tpl]convert|8|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] in length.[tpl]Cite journal| url=http://www.uci.ch/includes/asp/getTarget.asp?type=FILE&id=34028| page=40| publication-date=1 February 2012| title=UCI Cycling Regulations, Part II: Road Races| publisher=UCI| postscript=[tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl] There are three types of stages that are used in the Giro d'Italia: the mass-start stages, individual time trials, and team time trials.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/tour-de-france-time-trials-mountains-stages-prolog.html |title=Tour de France: Time Trials, Mountains Stages, Prologues, and More – For Dummies |publisher=Dummies.com |date=2008-11-07 |accessdate=6 August 2012[/tpl] The mass-start stages make up most of the twenty-one racing days of each year's Giro d'Italia. Individual time trials are used at least twice per each edition of the Giro d'Italia. The team time trials, on the other hand, are used once per each race if they are included by the organizers. Italian Mario Cipollini's 42 stage victories are the most in the history of the Giro d'Italia, while Alfredo Binda has the second most with 41.[tpl]cite news|url=http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/06052011/58/giro-d-italia-giro-d-italia-numbers.html|title=Giro d'Italia – Giro d'Italia: In numbers|date=6 May 2011|work=Eurosport|publisher=Yahoo! and Eurosport|accessdate=13 August 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dailypeloton.com/displayarticle.asp?pk=5226 |title=87th Giro d'Italia: a bit of History |publisher=dailypeloton.com |author=Fabio |date=9 November 2003 |accessdate=29 October 2007[/tpl]

===Mass-start stages===

Most of the stages in the race are usually mass-start stages, with the whole peloton starting together. Mass-start stages begin in different towns with a send off to gain publicity, the riders ride without racing. The riders then ride a few kilometers around the stage's start town before reaching kilometer zero, where the race director then waves a flag to start the stage's racing. Once the flag is waved there are usually attacks by the riders to form a breakaway.
Riders are permitted to touch, but not push or nudge, each other. The first to cross the line wins. On flat stages or stages with low hills, which generally predominate in the first week, this leads to spectacular mass sprints.
All riders in a group finish in the same time as the lead rider, which helps avoid dangerous mass sprints. It is not unusual for the entire field to finish in a group, taking time to cross the line but being credited with the same time. When riders fall or crash within the final 3 kilometers of a stage with a flat finish, they are awarded the same time as the group they were in before they crashed. This change encourages riders to sprint to the finish for points awards without fear of losing time to the group. The final kilometer of racing is indicated by a red banner on an arch that also reads "Arrivo."
Time bonuses were awarded in the Giro for finishing high in the stages, in the first three positions. The stage's first placed rider receives twenty seconds, second placed twelve seconds, and the third placed rider receives six seconds.

====Mountains stages====

The Giro d'Italia is known for its steep and difficult climbs. Each race features a few stages that contain many climbs of high severity. The race traditionally passes through the Alps and the Dolomites. The first Alpine pass included was the Sestriere in 1911. The Dolomites were first included in the Giro in 1937, when the race crossed over the Rolle Pass and the Passo di Costalunga. Some of the most famous mountains used in the Giro are the Passo dello Stelvio,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/features/the-stelvio-the-sacred-mountain-of-the-giro-ditalia|title=The Stelvio: The sacred mountain of the Giro d'Italia|author=Daniel Friebe|work=Cycling News|publisher=Future Publishing Limited|date=25 May 2012|accessdate=30 July 2012[/tpl] Passo Pordoi, and the Passo di Gavia. Since 1965 the highest point in the Giro d'Italia has been dubbed the Cima Coppi in honor of the great Italian climber Fausto Coppi.
Stages in the mountains often cause major shifts in the general classification. On ordinary stages, most riders stay in the peloton to the finish; however during mountain stages, it is not uncommon for riders to lose 30 minutes or to be eliminated after finishing outside the time limit.

===Individual time trials===

Riders in a time trial compete individually against the clock. If the first stage of the Giro is a time trial, then order is determined by a draw to establish the team's sequence. Once the team's order is chosen, then the teams can choose the starting order. If the incumbent winner of the Giro d'Italia is participating, he will start last. The riders are given staggered start times between one and three minutes. Once the first stage has been run and the general classification standing has been established, the riders' start order is determined by the inverse standings of the general classification, with the highest ranked person going last and the lowest ranked person going first. The first time trial was in the 1933 Giro d'Italia; it was between Bologna and Ferrara, and stretched [tpl]convert|62|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. The first time trial was won by Alfredo Binda.
The first stage in modern Giros is often a short trial, a prologue, to decide who wears pink on the opening day. To be classified as a prologue, the time trial must be shorter than [tpl]convert|8|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] in length. The first prologue occurred in the 1968 Giro d'Italia. The route stretched [tpl]convert|5.7|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] around the streets of Campione d'Italia and was won by the Frenchman Charly Grosskost. The riders raced the course in an unusual format, with the riders racing in ten groups of thirteen and the time not being counted towards their overall time.
There are usually two or three time trials, with team time trials being included in the tally, in each modern edition of the Giro d'Italia. The final time trial has sometimes been the final stage, more recently often the penultimate stage.

===Team time trial===

A team time trial (TTT) is a race against the clock in which each team rides alone. The order for the team time trial is determined by the inversed order of the team classification, except for the race leader's team who is always the last to start. The teams' start times are staggered by five minutes. The riders work together in the team time trial by taking turns at the front, to lift the pace and break the wind for their teammates to save them energy.  The time is that of the fifth rider of each team: riders more than a bike-length behind their team's fifth rider are awarded their own times. The TTT has been criticized for favoring strong teams and handicapping strong riders in weak teams. The most recent team time trial in the Giro was in the 2013 edition, which was won by [tpl]ct|SKY|2013[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/cycling/10038875/Giro-dItalia-2013-stage-two-Team-Sky-storm-to-victory-in-team-time-trial-as-Salvatore-Puccio-takes-maglia-rosa.html |title=Giro d'Italia 2013, stage two: Team Sky storm to victory in team time-trial as Salvatore Puccio takes maglia rosa |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited |date=5 May 2013 |accessdate=4 August 2012|author= Ian Chadband[/tpl]

===Stage towns===

Each stage begins and ends in a city. Most stages have different start cities and end cities, while some stages have the same starting and ending location. Milan has hosted the most stage starts and finishes with 137 since the race traditionally finishes in Milan. In addition to that, the race used to begin in Milan during the race's early existence. Milan has hosted the most starts and finishes for Giro d'Italia stages, with Rome being a close second and many towns having hosted over 25 stages.

==The start and finish of the Giro==

The start of the Giro d'Italia is a big deal and cities pay lots of money to host the start or finish of a stage.[tpl]cite news|author=Gregor Brown|url=http://velonews.competitor.com/2012/12/tour-de-france/foreign-grand-tour-starts-are-big-business_269064|title=Foreign grand tour starts are big business|date=15 December 2012 |work=VeloNews|publisher=Competitor Group, Inc|accessdate=23 June 2012[/tpl] For the start of the Giro itself, the cities are willing to pay much more money. The money the city and other investors put into get the start is quickly earned back. Former race director said that the cities often earn ten times the money they invested.
For nearly half a century, the Giro started and finished by Milan, the city where the headquarters of the Gazzetta dello Sport were located. The first time the race didn't start or finish in Milan was in 1911, where the start and finish were moved to Rome to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Italy's unification. With the occasional exception, the start and finish in Milan was the standard for the Giro d'Italia. However since 1960 the place of departure has changed each year. Some years (1965, 1966, 1968, 1970, 1973, 1975, 1981–1989) the finish was also changed, but in 1990 the traditional finish in Milan was restored.[tpl]cite web|url=http://velovoices.com/2012/05/11/friday-feature-giro-ditalia-foreign-starts/ |title=Friday Feature: Giro d’Italia starts on foreign soil |work=Velo Voices |author=Sheree |date=12 May 2012|accessdate=6 August 2012[/tpl]

The Giro takes place mainly in Italy, but some stages have departure or conclusion locations in other countries, especially in neighboring countries such as San Marino, France, Monaco, Switzerland, Austria, and Slovenia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bianchiusa.com/racing/news/archive/2011/april/article/2012-giro-ditalia-start-to-denmark/ |title=2012 Giro d'Italia Start: to Denmark! |work=Bianchi USA |author=|date=1 April 2011 |accessdate=6 August 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dailypeloton.com/girotofour.asp |title=Giro d'Italia Stage Detail |publisher=Daily Peloton |author= Fabio|date= |accessdate=6 August 2012[/tpl] Some stages have been held in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany (2002 and 2006), and Greece (1996). The 2012 edition of the Giro started in Denmark, with stages in Herning and Horsens.[tpl]cite news|url=http://velonews.competitor.com/2011/04/news/2012-giro-ditalia-to-start-in-denmark-not-washington-d-c_166317 |title=2012 Giro d’Italia to start in Denmark, not Washington, D.C. |author=VeloNews.com |work=VeloNews|publisher=Competitor Group, Inc |date=24 May 2010 |accessdate=1 April 2011[/tpl]

===Starts outside Italy===

For the first 47 editions of the race, the race started in Italian soil and in 1965 the race made its first foreign start in San Marino, and has since had nine more foreign starts.[tpl]cite web|author=Alasdair Fotheringham |url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/the-most-international-giro-ditalia-ever |title=The Most International Giro D’Italia Ever? |work=Cycling News|publisher=Future Publishing Limited |date=5 May 2012 |accessdate=20 August 2012[/tpl] The organizers also chose to host the start of the Giro in a foreign country to help build its fan base, so that it can rival the Tour de France. The race organizers are limited in their use of the foreign start since. A foreign start far away from Italy forces the organizers to use a rest day as a travel day after the initial stages abroad. The UCI countered this by making a rule that the first rest day can first be used after the fifth stage, or day of racing. The most recent start outside Italy was in 2012 when the race started in Denmark. The race stayed in Denmark for three stages before being transferred onto Italian soil.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/giro-ditalia-2012-danish-stages-announced |title=Giro D'Italia 2012: Danish Stages Announced |work=Cycling News|publisher=Future Publishing Limited |author= Cycling News |date= 5 October 2011|accessdate=20 August 2012[/tpl] Denmark put in $3.86 million to host the first three stages of the race.
