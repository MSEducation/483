"Ike's Wee Wee" is the fourth episode of the second season of the animated television series South Park, and the 16th episode of the series overall. It first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on May 20, 1998. In the episode, school counselor Mr. Mackey is fired, and turns to drugs. Meanwhile, the boys misconstrue what circumcision entails, and try to save Kyle's younger brother Ike from his upcoming bris.
The episode was written and directed by series co-creator Trey Parker. "Ike's Wee Wee" satirizes certain attitudes towards drug users, and explores whether family can only mean those who are related by blood. This episode introduced Ike's backstory as an adopted Canadian child. "Ike's Wee Wee" received positive responses from fans, as well as critics who especially praised the episode for its touching moments. A line often repeated by Mr. Mackey in this episode, "drugs are bad, m'kay?", has entered popular culture, and has been referenced in various songs, articles, and court documents.

==Plot==

Mr. Mackey, the school counselor, is giving a drug and alcohol prevention lecture for the class, emphasizing that smoking, drinking, marijuana, and LSD "are bad." He passes a sample of marijuana around the class so that the children can learn its smell, but it is never passed back up to the front. We later see that Mr. Garrison stole it. But as a result, Mackey is fired, and is later kicked out of his house by his landlord, leaving him homeless. A desperate Mackey gives in to trying marijuana one night in an alley, and later, LSD. Soon enough, Mr. Mackey becomes a drug-addled hippie, and meets a hippie woman, with whom he decides to get married. While on honeymoon in India, Mr. Mackey is captured by the A Team, Mr. Garrison and Principal Victoria and is taken into rehab. Mr. Mackey emerges clean from rehab and is given his job back. 
Meanwhile, Kyle invites Stan, Cartman and Kenny to his younger brother Ike's bris. When they learn more about what a bris is, and misconstrue it as a party where they are going to "chop off his penis", Kyle is shocked and tries to find a way to hide his brother from his parents and the circumcision process. Kyle puts Ike on a train to Nebraska and makes an Ike-style doll out of meat bones in an attempt to not arouse his parents' suspicions. This backfires when the doll is eaten by a dog, and both the dog and doll are run over by a fuel tanker which then explodes in front of the Broflovskis' house, which leads to them to think that Ike is dead. It is at the funeral that Kyle finds out that Ike is not his biological brother, but was adopted from Canada. Upon discovering this, Kyle decides that Ike is not his "real brother" and he no longer cares about him. His parents are shocked by what has happened, and Ike is retrieved from Nebraska. During the funeral, Kenny falls into an open grave and the gravestone falls on him.
The day of the bris arrives, and Kyle is grounded. When the mohel arrives to perform the bris, Ike flees to Kyle's room in terror. Seeing Ike in distress and some old pictures prompts a change of heart in Kyle, and he defends his brother fiercely before it is explained to him what a circumcision actually is, at which point Stan and Cartman decide they want to be circumcised too. They then watch the process, and Kyle is relieved to see Ike unharmed. The episode ends with Mr. Mackey attempting to explain drugs to the children again, and the boys arguing about whose bris should be the next.

==Production==

"Ike's Wee Wee" was written and directed by series co-creator Trey Parker. The scene where Mr. Mackey loses the marijuana cigarette in class was inspired by a real event from Parker's life, where a counselor came into his class in seventh grade, and passed around a lit piece of marijuana, which then disappeared. At the beginning and end of the episode, there are scenes where the kids imitate Mr. Mackey's voice to him, while he is oblivious to the fact that he is being made fun of. Parker and his classmates used to do the same thing to their counselor in junior high school who was the basis for Mr. Mackey's character.[tpl]Cite conference |url=http://www.comedycentral.com/aspen/chat_southpark.shtml |title=South Park Comes Home |date=March 7, 1998 |conference=The US Comedy Arts Festival |location=Aspen, Colorado |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/200101111753/http://www.comedycentral.com/aspen/chat_southpark.shtml |archivedate=January 11, 2001 |accessdate=December 22, 2011[/tpl][tpl]Cite South Park commentary|1|Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo[/tpl] Parker said that he was especially proud of Chef's line "There's a time and a place for everything, and it's called college", which is something Parker believes in, noting that if he had a child, he would tell him: "Do whatever you want, just wait till college because you don't know what the fuck's up right now."[tpl]Cite journal |first=Steve |last=Pond |date=June 2000 |title=Interview: Trey Parker and Matt Stone |magazine=Playboy |publisher=Playboy Publishing |volume=47 |issue=6 |pages=65–80[/tpl] Chef's sentence would later return in the season four episode "The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000".
The episode introduced Ike's backstory as a Canadian child adopted by the Broflovskis.

"Ike's Wee Wee" features regular voice acting from series creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone for most characters, Mary Kay Bergman (credited as Shannen Cassidy) for female characters, and Isaac Hayes for Chef. Additional dialogue was provided by South Park audio engineer Bruce Howell, while Ike's lines were uttered by Howell's then-5-year-old son Jesse.[tpl]Cite web |url=http://digitalcontentproducer.com/mag/video_crappy_possible_method/ |title='As Crappy As Possible': The Method Behind the Madness of South Park |date=May 1, 1998 |first=Matt |last=Cheplic |work=Millimeter |accessdate=December 22, 2011[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][tpl]Cite web |url=http://www.southparkstudios.com/fans/faq/353336 |title=FAQ: Who does the voice of Kyle's little brother Ike? |date=March 2, 2002 |publisher=South Park Studios |accessdate=December 9, 2011[/tpl]

==Themes==

"Ike's Wee Wee" raises the question of who really can be considered one's family. At first, Kyle's implicit idea is that family consists of "those for whom we care that are related by blood".[tpl]Cite book |editor-last=Arp |editor-first=Robert |title=South Park and Philosophy: You Know, I Learned Something Today |publisher=Blackwell Publishing (The Blackwell Philosophy & Pop Culture Series) |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-4051-6160-2 |chapter=8: The Philosophical Passion of the Jew: Kyle the Philosopher |last1=Devlin |first1=William J. |pages=88–90[/tpl] Based on this viewing of family, he no longer feels the need to help Ike when he learns that they are not related by blood. As the story progresses, Kyle questions his initial beliefs, and forms the episode's central moral by saying that "Family isn't about whose blood you have. It's about who you
care about."[tpl]Cite book |editor-last=Weinstock |editor-first=Jeffrey Andrew |title=Taking South Park Seriously |last=Becker |first=Matt |chapter=Chapter 8: 'I Hate Hippies' |publisher=SUNY Press |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-7914-7566-9 |page=159 |quote=In fact, the idea that family is more about for whom you care than about whose blood you share is the central moral of 'Ike's Wee Wee.'[/tpl] Thus, Kyle's reformed view of family not only includes his adopted brother, but his friends as well. Kyle's questioning of his own morals has been likened to engaging in the dialectical Socratic method of inquiry.
The other plot in "Ike's Wee Wee" satirizes certain drug subcultures, as well as drug use, and societal attitudes towards drug users. The way the episode portrays Mr. Mackey's lack of real knowledge about drug use and addiction has been described as an example of South Park satirizing left-wing politics, when "they lead to the sort of hypocrisy inconsistent with a proper open society."[tpl]Cite book |editor-last=Arp |editor-first=Robert |title=South Park and Philosophy: You Know, I Learned Something Today |publisher=Blackwell Publishing (The Blackwell Philosophy & Pop Culture Series) |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-4051-6160-2 |chapter=10: South Park and the Open Society: Defending Democracy Through Satire |last1=Curtis |first1=David Valleu |last2=Erion |first2=Gerald J. |pages=116–117[/tpl]

==Cultural references==

Part of the episode revolves around the practice of religious male circumcision in Judaism, and the related ceremony called the brit milah or bris, and the boys' misunderstanding of the tradition (to which they refer as "circumstition"). The boys believe that circumcision entails the cutting off of one's penis, which they refer to by the childish colloquial term "wee wee", except for Cartman, who insists on calling it "fireman". Cannabis is also referred to by various names, including weed, grass, pot, and marijuana, in which Mr. Mackey constantly pronounces the letter j as [tpl]IPA|/dʒ/[/tpl] (as in jam), which makes Kyle mispronounce the drug as "marry-Jew wanna".
Drug use is often portrayed in conjunction with the hippie subculture, through hippie characters such as the two teenagers that give LSD to Mackey, and the woman that he befriends and eventually marries.[tpl]Cite web |title=South Park: 'Ike's Wee Wee' script |publisher=Comedy Central, South Park Studios |first=Trey |last=Parker |year=1998 |url=http://www.spscriptorium.com/Southparkpdfs/204.pdf |accessdate=December 9, 2011[/tpl] Jimbo and Cartman both use the term hippie pejoratively. During their argument, Jimbo tells Mackey that he should just go to a Grateful Dead concert. On two occasions, the episode shows people watching Teletubbies while high on marijuana or in rehab.[tpl]Cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=QLlbAAAAIBAJ&sjid=VFINAAAAIBAJ&pg=4015%2C2621555 |title='Teletubbies' are just a bit overbearing for this guy |first=Mark |last=McGuire |date=February 18, 1999 |newspaper=Record-Journal |page=A6 |agency=Albany Times Union |quote=There was an episode of 'South Park' that nailed it, showing a group at the Betty Ford clinic getting a substitute fix and easing withdrawal symptoms by watching the show. |accessdate=January 4, 2012[/tpl] Teletubbies is a British children's television show that started in 1997. In his drug prevention speech, Mackey claims that LSD was made famous by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, former members of The Beatles. Both Lennon and McCartney are known to have experimented with the drug.[tpl]Cite book |last=Hertsgaard |first=Mark |authorlink=Mark Hertsgaard |year=1995 |chapter=We All Want to Change the World: Drugs, Politics, and Spirituality |title=A Day in the Life: The Music and Artistry of the Beatles |isbn=978-0-385-31377-3 |publisher=Delacorte Press[/tpl]
While walking home, Mr. Mackey drunkenly sings the 1983 Pat Benatar song "Love Is a Battlefield". During Ike's supposed funeral, a bagpipe player starts playing the Hebrew folk song "Hava Nagila". At the funerals, the priest uses the phrase "Ashes to ashes, dust to dust", from the Anglican burial service. When the townspeople start to harass Mackey, one of them shouts "Now we see what you and Homer Simpson have in common... Dope!" This references the famous catchphrase from The Simpsons, "D'oh!", which sounds similar to the word dope, meaning illicit drugs. At Kyle's house, Kyle's parents offers the boys a dish called "GaHekgafuga", which is not a real dish.[tpl]Cite web |url=http://www.southparkstudios.com/fans/faq/353970 |title=FAQ: What is the name of the dish that Kyle's mom is supposed to make in the 'Ike's Wee Wee' episode?

Mackey is taken to rehabilitation to the Betty Ford Clinic, which is based on a real-life hospital.
A common plot device is referenced, where a shoulder angel (represents conscience) and a shoulder devil (representing temptation) appear near a character. This concept is spoofed in the episode, as both the devil and the angel suggest to Mackey that he should drink the beer. When Stan tells Kyle what he thinks a bris means, a dolly zoom is used, which is an unsettling filmmaking effect often used to show that a character is undergoing a major realization. The hallucinogenic effects of certain drugs are portrayed by different means. When inhaling cannabis, the alley that Mr. Mackey is in suddenly turns very colorful. After taking LSD, Mr. Mackey's head inflates like a giant balloon, and then literally detaches from his body, and floats away. 
In the scene when the boys are talking to Chef, he leaves without answering the boys' sexual question, angrily saying, "Dammit, children, why do I always have to be the one to explain all this stuff to you. Ask your parents for once!" This is in reference to Chef's tendency to give advice to the boys. While the children are trying to think of what is the most important thing for a man, Cartman says "Ham?", to which Stan angrily replies, "No, not ham, you fat fuck!". This exchange was used verbatim between the same characters in The Spirit of Christmas, the 1995 short film that was the precursor to South Park.[tpl]Cite newsgroup |title=Anyone catch this? |author=User "Alyssa" |date=May 24, 1998 |newsgroup=alt.tv.southpark |id=01bd8798$68f04f00$4a16a5ce@primenet.primenet.com |url=http://groups.google.com/group/alt.tv.southpark/msg/82cc1ddf0ff39252 |accessdate=December 28, 2011[/tpl]

"Ike's Wee Wee" was met with favorable reviews. Critics especially praised the episode for its touching moments, in contrast with the off-color humor often employed in the series. In his review of the episode in the Chicago Tribune, Allan Johnson praised the episode, especially in comparison with the first two episodes of the season, and wrote that "'Ike's Wee Wee' ranks with some of the better episodes of 'South Park.'" Upon the series reaching its 100th episode in 2003, the same writer also listed "Ike's Wee Wee" as one of the "top 10 episodes that have made [tpl]Interp|South Park[/tpl] one of the most provocative comedies on TV."[tpl]Cite news |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2003-04-09/features/0304090091_1_south-park-music-teacher-comedy-central |title=Whoever thought this show would last 100 episodes? |date=April 9, 2003 |first=Allan |last=Johnson |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |location=Chicago, Illinois |accessdate=December 22, 2011[/tpl] A South Park review in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette said about the series that "[tpl]Interp|i[/tpl]n the midst of all this potty-mouthed humor, there are moments that are downright touching", and particularly highlighted the ending of "Ike's Wee Wee" as an example, explaining that "all's well in the end, and Kyle and the boys learn a lesson about family values that even Dan Quayle would approve of."[tpl]Cite news |title=Naughty boys: 'Very Bad Things' and 'South Park' flaunt a twisted sense of humor |newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |location=Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania |publisher=Block Communications |date=May 21, 1999 |page=42 |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=z44zAAAAIBAJ&pg=3937%2C427628 |accessdate=January 30, 2012[/tpl] In 2000, visitors of the Comedy Central website chose "Ike's Wee Wee" as their favorite episode during a voting called "South Park e-Lections", held around the time of the United States presidential election that year.[tpl]Cite web |url=http://comedycentral.com/southpark/e_lections/index.tin |title=South Park e-Lections |year=2000 |publisher=Comedy Central |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/200011170210/http://comedycentral.com/southpark/e_lections/index.tin |archivedate=November 17, 2000 |accessdate=December 22, 2011[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal |magazine=Spin |volume=17 |issue=3 |date=March 2001 |title=On the Download |last=Radestsky |first=Ary Tye |page=56 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YzBMbiDVcKoC&lpg=PA56&dq=%22ike's%20wee%20wee%22&pg=PA56#v=onepage&q=%22ike's%20wee%20wee%22&f=false[/tpl]
Mr. Mackey's line "drugs are bad, m'kay?" has entered popular culture.
