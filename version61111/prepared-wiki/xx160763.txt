HD 11964 b is an extrasolar planet, a gas giant like Jupiter approximately 107 light-years away in the constellation of Cetus.  The planet orbits the yellow subgiant star HD 11964 in a nearly-circular orbit, taking over 5 years to complete a revolution around the star at a distance of 3.34 astronomical units.
The planet was discovered in 2005 and published as part of the Catalog of Nearby Exoplanets under the designation HD 11964 b. However since that time there has been confusion as to the designations of the planets in the HD 11964 system, leading to some sources designating this planet as "HD 11964 c".[tpl]cite journal | url=http://www.iop.org/EJ/article/0004-637X/646/1/523/64035.html | title=Two Suns in The Sky: Stellar Multiplicity in Exoplanet Systems | author=Raghavan, D. et al. | year=2006 | journal=The Astrophysical Journal | volume=646 | issue=1 | pages=523â€“542 | doi=10.1086/504823 | bibcode=2006ApJ...646..523R|arxiv = astro-ph/0603836 [/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://exoplanet.eu/planet.php?p1=HD+11964&p2=c |title=Notes for planet HD 11964 c |accessdate=2008-12-15 |work=The Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia |author=Schneider, J. [/tpl] In a recent review of the properties of multi-planet extrasolar planetary systems, the discovery team has stated that the correct designation for this planet is HD 11964 b.
