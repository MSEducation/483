Robin Christopher (born June 18, 1965) is an American actress. She is known for her role as Skye Chandler Quartermaine on the ABC soap operas All My Children, One Life to Live, and General Hospital.

==Career==

Christopher is the only actor to have played the same character (Skye Chandler) as a regular cast member on all three of ABC's soap operas: All My Children (1987–91, 2000), One Life to Live (1998–2001) and General Hospital (2001–08, 2010, 2011, 2012). Christopher portrayed Lorna Devon on Another World (1994–97).  In both roles, on two different networks, Christopher's biological mother was portrayed by soap opera star Linda Dano, who played Skye's mother, Rae Cummings, on All My Children, One Life to Live, Port Charles, and General Hospital, and Lorna's mother, Felicia Gallant, on Another World.
When Christopher began playing Skye Chandler, the character was known as Skye Patterson. Over the years, the character married, divorced, remarried, redivorced, and believed on two occasions to have discovered and grown closer to her biological family, the Chandlers on All My Children and Quartermaines on General Hospital, only to discover her biological origins to be far murkier than originally realized.
In accord with Skye's nomadic journey through the ABC soaps and ultimate independence, Robin Christopher has often been referred to by fans as the 'Greta Garbo of soap opera', evoking in her performance the glamour and emotional depth of Classical Hollywood cinema.
In 1993, Christopher guest starred in two episodes of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine's first season, "Duet" and "In the Hands of the Prophets", as the Bajoran engineer Neela.
