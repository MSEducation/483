==Background==

Joyce Clyde Hall became captivated by a salesman who stopped by his family's store in 1906 in Norfolk, Nebraska. Driven by the postcard craze of 1903, Hall decided to venture from retail of various products to wholesale of postcards. He moved his business to a larger market of Kansas City. As time went on, Hall became more convinced that greeting cards would become more prominent than postcards. Greeting cards, according to J.C. Hall, represented class, promised discretion and "they were more than a form of communication—they were a social custom.”[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2012[/tpl]
By 1915, the company was known as Hall Brothers and sold Valentine's Day and Christmas cards. In 1917, Hall and his brother Rollie "invented" modern wrapping paper when they ran out of traditional colored tissue paper. In 1922, the company expanded throughout the country.[tpl]cite web | url=http://corporate.hallmark.com/history/Early-Innovation-1910s-30s | title=Early Innovation 1910s–30s | publisher=Hallmark Corporate | accessdate=June 8, 2011[/tpl] The staff grew from 4 to 120 people, and the line increased from holiday cards to include everyday greeting cards.
In 1928, the company adopted the name "Hallmark", after the hallmark symbol used by goldsmiths in London in the 14th century, and began printing the name on the back of every card. In the same year, the company became the first in the greeting card industry to advertise their product nationally. Their first advertisement appeared in Ladies' Home Journal and was written by J.C. Hall himself. In 1931, the Canadian William E. Coutts Company, Ltd., a major card maker, became an affiliate of Hall Brothers, which was Hall Brothers' first international business venture.
In 1944, it adopted its current slogan, "When you care enough to send the very best." It was created by C. E. Goodman, a Hallmark marketing and sales executive, and written on a 3x5 card. The card is on display at the company headquarters. In 1951, Hall sponsored a television program for NBC that gave rise to the Hallmark Hall of Fame, which has won 80 Emmy Awards.[tpl]cite web | url= http://corporate.hallmark.com/Company/Hallmark-Hall-Of-Fame | title= Corporate Information: Hallmark Hall of Fame History[/tpl] Hallmark now has its own cable television channel, the Hallmark Channel which was established in 2001. For a period of about 15 years, Hallmark owned a stake in the Spanish language network Univision.
In 1954, the company name was changed from Hall Brothers to Hallmark. In 1958, William E. Coutts Company, Ltd., was acquired by Hallmark; until the 1990s, Hallmark's Canadian branch was known as "Coutts Hallmark".
In 1998, Hallmark made a number of acquisitions, including Britain-based Creative Publishing (a recent spinoff of Fine Art Developments), and U.S. based InterArt.[tpl]cite news |date= July 10, 1998 |url= http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1893&dat=19980710&id=H6kfAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ctYEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4673,1369321 |title= Hallmark Cards agrees to buy British competitor |work= Southeast Missourian |agency= Associated Press [/tpl][tpl]cite news |date= September 11, 1998 |url= http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=onxaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=WksDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4201,2183816&dq |title= Hallmark buys firm |work= Victoria Advocate [/tpl]

On September 6, 2007, Paris Hilton filed an injunction lawsuit against Hallmark Cards Inc. in U.S. District Court over the unlawful use of her picture and catchphrase "That's hot" on a greeting card. The card is titled "Paris's First Day as a Waitress" with a photograph of Hilton's face on a cartoon of a waitress serving a plate of  food, with a Hilton's dialogue bubble, "Don't touch that, it's hot." (which had a registered trademark on February 13, 2007). Hilton's attorney Brent Blakely said that the infringement damages would be based on profits from the $2.49 greeting cards. Julie O'Dell said that Hallmark used the card as parody, protected under fair use law.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/celebrity/paris-hilton-sues-over-hallmark-card | title=Paris Hilton Sues Over Hallmark Card | work=The Smoking Gun | date=September 7, 2007 | accessdate=December 12, 2008[/tpl]
Neil Armstrong sued Hallmark Cards in 1994 after they used his name and a recording of his quote, "That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind" in a Christmas ornament without permission. The lawsuit was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount of money which Armstrong donated to Purdue University. The case caused Armstrong and NASA to be more careful about the usage of astronaut names, photographs and recordings, and to whom he had granted permission. For non-profit and government public-service announcements, he would usually give permission.[tpl]cite book | title=First Man: The Life of Neil A.
