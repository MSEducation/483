===Loss===

Her tenth and final sortie began with her departure from La Pallice on 16 January 1943. On the 20th, she sent a radio message: "Sehrohr unklar" (periscope unready for action), and was never heard from again. She had suffered no casualties to her crew until lost with all hands. She most probably sank because of technical problems and was officially declared missing on 28 January 1943.[tpl]cite book|author = Paul Kemp | title = Die deutschen und österreichischen U-Boot-Verluste in beiden Weltkriegen| language=German| year = 1998 | publisher = Urbes | ISBN = 978-3-924896-43-0 | page = 103[/tpl]
