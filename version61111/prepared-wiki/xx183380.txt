This is a list of capital cities, including the legislature or seat of government, of Pakistan and its current and former provinces, territories, and states.

==National capital==

Islamabad has been the capital of Pakistan since the 1960s, succeeding the coastal city of Karachi, which had been selected as the capital in 1947 by Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the driving force behind the creation of Pakistan. The legislature was based in Dacca in the province of East Bengal (later renamed East Pakistan). Karachi was and still is the largest city and economic capital of Pakistan. It remained the seat of government until 1959, when the military president, Ayub Khan, decided to build a new capital in the north of Pakistan, near the general headquarters of the Pakistani Armed Forces at Rawalpindi. The main reasons for the new location were that the new capital city would reflect the diversity of the Pakistani people, it would be separated from the business and commercial activity of Karachi, and also it would be easily accessible from all parts of the country.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.visitislamabad.net/islamabad/files/file-detail.asp?var=history-of-islamabad|title=History of Islamabad|publisher=Capital Development Authority|accessdate=2008-01-03[/tpl] linked from [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.islamabad.gov.pk/islamabad/default.asp|title=Visit Islamabad: Islamabad the beautiful|publisher=Capital Development Authority[/tpl] The move to Islamabad was not completed until the late 1960s and for some years several government ministries were based in nearby Rawalpindi.
