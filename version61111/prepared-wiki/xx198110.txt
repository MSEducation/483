Reggae rock is a subgenre of reggae fusion that primarily uses the genres reggae, rock and ska. The term "reggae rock" has been used to categorize bands like Sublime, Sublime with Rome, Pepper, Slightly Stoopid, The Expendables, Iration, The Dirty Heads, Rebelution, 311 and, to some extent, heavier bands such as Fishbone and Bad Brains. The somewhat related term "ragga metal" has been used to describe bands that combine metal and ragga, such as Dub War, Skindred and Zeroscape. Reggae rock found its rise in popularity in the 1990s in Long Beach, California, with the band Sublime. The genre has lately found a boost in popularity with the 2010 song "Lay Me Down" by The Dirty Heads featuring Rome Ramirez from Sublime with Rome, which peaked at number 1 on both the US Billboard Alternative Songs and Rock Songs charts.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.billboard.com/artist/300985/dirty+heads/chart?f=377 |title= Dirty Heads – Alternative Songs Chart History |work= Billboard |publisher= Prometheus Global Media |accessdate= 17 February 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=  Dirty Heads – Rock Songs Chart History |url= http://www.billboard.com/artist/300985/dirty+heads/chart?f=902 |work= Billboard |publisher= Prometheus Global Media |accessdate= 17 February 2013[/tpl]
