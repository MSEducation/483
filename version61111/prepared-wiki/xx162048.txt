Pedal Steal is an album by Terry Allen released on his Fate label in 1985. The album was commissioned as a soundtrack for the Margaret Jenkins Dance Company in San Francisco. Itâ€™s loosely based on Wayne Gailey, a steel guitar player who wandered Texas and New Mexico in the late 1960s-early 1970s, and one of the first that Allen heard use the instrument for rock and roll.
