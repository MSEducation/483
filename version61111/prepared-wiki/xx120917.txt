[[Skeena Mountains]]

CATEGORIES: Skeena Mountains, Physiographic sections, Skeena Country

The Skeena Mountains, also known as the Skeenas, are a subrange of the Interior Mountains of northern British Columbia, Canada, essentially flanking the upper basin of the Skeena River.  They lie just inland from the southern end of the Boundary Ranges of the Coast Mountains, and also of the northern end of the Kitimat Ranges (another subrange of the Coast Mountains).  Their southern limit is described by the Bulkley River (a major tributary of the Skeena; its valley and that of the lower Skeena River are used by BC Highway 16) and the upper northwestern reaches of Babine and Takla Lakes, and on their northeast by the upper reaches of the Omineca River.  
To the north the Skeenas abut the southern Tahltan Highland and Klastline Plateau, part of the southern reaches of the Stikine Plateau and the Spatsizi Plateau, another subplateau of the Stikine Plateau, which includes the uppermost part of the course of the Stikine River. To the northwest, across the narrow confines of the Spatsizi Plateau, are the Stikine Ranges of the Cassiar Mountains, while to the east of the Skeenas are the Omineca Mountains, while their southward counterparts are the Hazelton Mountains, all part of the Interior Mountains.  Physiographically, they are a section of the larger Yukon-Tanana Uplands province,[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2009[/tpl] which in turn are part of the larger Interior System physiographic division (known in Wikipedia by its American name, the Intermontane Plateaus).
