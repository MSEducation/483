[[Post-transitional metal]]

CATEGORIES: Periodic table, Poor metals

In chemistry, post-transition metals are metallic elements in Groups 13 to 16 of the periodic table. They are physically weak metals that show significant nonmetallic chemistry, consistent with their location between the 'true metals'[tpl]#tag:ref|The true metals comprise Group 11, the transition elements, including the 4f and 5f elements, and the typical members of Groups 1 and 2 (Wells 1985, pp. 1277, 1280).|group=n[/tpl] (to their left) and the metalloids (to their right). Among metals they are distinguished by having a combination of relatively low melting points (all less than 950 K) and relatively high electronegativity values (all more than 1.6, revised Pauling).
The descriptive phrase 'other metals' is used here as there is no accepted short-hand term for these metals. Occasionally, some or all of them have instead been referred to as B-subgroup metals, poor metals, or post transition metals; and by at least ten other alternative labels. All of these labels are surveyed later in this article.
Physically, they are soft (or brittle), mechanically weak metals with melting points lower than those of the transition metals; most also have boiling points lower than those of the transition metals. Being close to the metal-nonmetal border, their crystalline structures tend to show covalent or directional bonding effects, having generally greater complexity or fewer nearest neighbours than other metallic elements.[tpl]#tag:ref|Most metals crystallise in close-packed structures with high bulk coordination numbers (8+ to 12, or higher). This is because total metallic bonding energy is optimised in the absence of interatomic gaps and increased when each atom has the greatest possible number of nearest-neighbour atoms. Most metals bordering the nonmetals have more complex structures, with lower bulk coordination numbers (4+ to 6+). This is attributed to the influence of a partial covalent bonding component in the crystal structures of these elements, which dictates fewer nearest neighbours.Russell & Lee 2005, p. 5|group=n[/tpl]
Chemically, the other metals are characterised—to varying degrees—by covalent bonding tendencies, acid-base amphoterism and the formation of anionic species such as aluminates, stannates, and bismuthates (in the case of aluminium, tin, and bismuth, respectively). They can also form Zintl phases (half-metallic compounds formed between highly electropositive metals and moderately electronegative metals or metalloids).Benbow 2008, p. 45; Gupta U 2010, p. 49
