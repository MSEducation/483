==Reception==

The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow awarded the album 4 stars stating "The influence of Miles Davis' early fusion period is felt throughout the music but there is nothing derivative about the often-surprising results. As with Wayne Shorter's best albums, this set rewards repeated listenings.".Yanow, S.  Allmusic Review accessed July 4, 2011
