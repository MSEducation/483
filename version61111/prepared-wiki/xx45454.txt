Pool of Radiance was released in June 1988; it was initially available on the Commodore 64, Apple II series and IBM PC compatible computers. A version for the Atari ST was also announced.  The Macintosh version was released in 1989. The Macintosh version featured a slightly different interface and was intended to work on black-and-white Macs like the Mac Plus and the Mac Classic. The screen was tiled into separate windows including the game screen, text console, and compass. Graphics were monochrome and the display window was relatively small compared to other versions. The Macintosh version featured sound, but no music. The game's Amiga version was released two years later. The PC 9800 version 『プール・オブ・レイディアンス』 in Japan was fully translated (like the Japanese Famicom version) and featured full-color graphics. The game was ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System under the title Advanced Dungeons & Dragons: Pool of Radiance, released in April 1992.[tpl]cite web|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/nes/rpg/advanceddungeonsdpor/index.html|title=Advanced Dungeons & Dragons: Pool of Radiance|work=gamespot UK[/tpl]
The original Pool of Radiance game shipped with a 28-page introductory booklet, which describes secrets relating to the game and the concepts behind it. The booklet guides players through the character creation process, explaining how to create a party. The game also included the 38-page Adventurer's Journal, which provides the game's background. The booklet features depictions of fliers, maps, and information that characters see in the game. The package also included a translation decoder wheel. After the title screen, a copy protection screen was displayed consisting of two pictures and a line. The player was required to use the decoder wheel to line up the pictures, then enter the word revealed on the decoder wheel. After three unsuccessful attempts, the game automatically shut down.

==Reception==

In Computer Gaming World[tpl]'[/tpl]s preview of Pool of Radiance in July 1988, the writer noted a sense of deja vu. He described the similarity of the game's screen to earlier computer RPGs. For example, the three-dimensional maze view in the upper-left window was similar to Might & Magic or Bard's Tale, both released in the mid-1980s. The window with a listing of characters was featured in 1988's Wasteland; and the use of an active character to represent the party was part of Ultima V. The reviewer also noted that the design approach for game play was closer to SSI's own Wizard's Crown than to the other games in the genre.[tpl]cite journal |title=Reflections on a "Pool of Radiance" |author=Wilson, Johnny L. |journal=Computer Gaming World |issue=49 |url=http://cgw.vintagegaming.org/galleries/index.php?year=1988&pub=2&id=49 |date=July 1988 |pages=20–21[/tpl]
Pool of Radiance received positive reviews. G.M. called the game's graphics "good" and praised its role-playing and combat aspects. They felt that "roleplayers will find Pools is an essential purchase, but people who are solely computer games oriented may hesitate before buying it ... it will be their loss". Tony Dillon from Commodore User giving it a score of 9 out of 10. The only complaint was a slightly slow disk access, but the reviewer was impressed with the game's features, awarding it a Commodore User superstar and proclaiming it "the best RPG ever to grace the C64, or indeed any other computer".[tpl]cite journal |last=Dillon |first=Tony |date=October 1988 |title=Pool of Radiance |journal=Commodore User |url=http://amr.abime.net/issue_805_pages |pages=34–35 [/tpl] Issue #84 of the British magazine Computer + Video Games rated the game highly, saying that "Pools is a game which no role player or adventurer should be without and people new to role playing should seriously consider buying as an introductory guide".[tpl]cite journal |title=Reviews |author=Wayne |journal=Computer + Video Games |issue=84 |date=October 1988|pages=18–19, 21 |isbn=0-8247-8502-9[/tpl] Another UK publication, The Games Machine, gave the game an 89% rating. The reviewer noted that the third-person arcade style combat view is a great improvement for SSI, as they had traditionally incorporated simplistic graphics in their role-playing games. The reviewer was critical that Pool of Radiance was not original in its presentation and that the colors were a little drab, but concluded that the game is "classic Dungeons & Dragons which SSI have recreated excellently".[tpl]cite journal |title=Pool Your Resources |author= |journal=The Games Machine |issue=12 |date=November 1988 |url=http://amr.abime.net/issue_825_pages |page=69[/tpl] A review from Zzap was less positive, giving the game a score of 80%. The reviewer felt that the game required too much "hacking, slicing and chopping" without enough emphasis on puzzle solving. The game was awarded 49% for its puzzle factor.[tpl]cite journal |title=Pool of Radiance |url=http://www.zzap64.co.uk/cgi-bin/displaypage.pl?issue=044&page=127&thumbstart=0&magazine=zzap&check=1 |publisher=Zzap |issue=44 date=December 1988 |page=127 |accessdate=21 February 2008[/tpl]
Three reviewers for Computer Gaming World had conflicting reactions. Ken St. Andre - designer of the Tunnels & Trolls RPG - approved of the game despite his dislike of the D&D system, praising the art, the mixture of combat and puzzles, and surprises. He concluded, "take it from a 'rival' designer, Pool of Radiance has my recommendation for every computer fantasy role-playing gamer". Tracie Forman Hicks, however, stated that over-faithful use of the D&D system left it behind others like Ultima and Wizardry. She also disliked the game's puzzles and lengthy combat sequences.[tpl]cite news | title=Mirror Images in a "Pool of Radiance" | work=Computer Gaming World | date=December 1988 | accessdate=3 November 2013 | author=St. Andre, Ken; Hines, Tracie Forman | pages=28[/tpl] Scorpia also disliked the amount of fighting in a game she otherwise described as a "well-designed slicer/dicer", concluding that "patience (possibly of Job is required to get through this one".[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1991&pub=2&id=87 | title=C*R*P*G*S / Computer Role-Playing Game Survey | work=Computer Gaming World | date=October 1991 | accessdate=18 November 2013 | author=Scorpia | pages=16[/tpl] Shay Addams from Compute! stated that experienced role-playing gamers "won't find anything new here", but recommended it to those who "love dungeons, dragons, and drama".[tpl]cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1989-02-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_105_1989_Feb#page/n65/mode/2up | title=Pool of Radiance | work=Compute! | date=February 1980 | accessdate=10 November 2013 | author=Addams, Shay | pages=62[/tpl] In their March 1989 "The Role of Computers" column in Dragon magazine #143, Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser (often called "The Lessers") gave Pool of Radiance a three-page review. The reviewers praised Pool of Radiance as "the first offering that truly follows AD&D game rules", calling it a "great fantasy role-playing game" that "falls into the must-buy category for avid AD&D game players". The reviewers advised readers to "rush out to your local dealer and buy Pool Of Radiance". They considered it SSI's flagship product, speculating that it would "undoubtedly bring thousands of computer enthusiasts into the adventure-filled worlds of TSR". The Dragon reviewers criticized the "notoriously slow" technology of the C64/128 system but added that the C64/128 version would become nearly unplayable without a software-based fastloader utility which Strategic Simulations integrated into the game. Conversely, the reviewers felt that the MS-DOS version was extremely fast, so much so that they had to slow the game operation down in order to read all the on-screen messages. They found that the MS-DOS version played at twice the speed of the C64/128 version when using the Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA) graphics mode.
Alex Simmons, Doug Johns, and Andy Mitchell reviewed the Amiga version of Pool of Radiance for Amiga Action magazine in 1990, giving it a 79% overall rating. Mitchell preferred the game Champions of Krynn, which had been released by the time the Amiga version of Pool of Radiance became available; he felt that Pool of Radiance was "more of the same" when compared to Champions, but was less playable and with more limited actions for players. Simmons felt that Pool of Radiance looked primitive and seemed less polished when compared with Champions of Krynn; he felt that although Pool was not up to the standard of Champions, he said it was still "a fine little game". Johns, on the other hand, felt that Pool of Radiance was well worth the wait, considering it very user-friendly despite being less polished than Champions of Krynn.[tpl]cite journal |title= |author=Simmons, Alex, Doug Johns, and Andy Mitchell |journal=Amiga Action |issue=14 |date=November 1990 |pages=72–73[/tpl]
Pool of Radiance was well received by the gaming press and won the Origins Award for Best Fantasy or Science Fiction Computer Game of 1988.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/1988 |title=1988 List of Winners |work=Academy of Adventure Gaming, Arts & Design |publisher=Origins Games Fair |accessdate=3 June 2009 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080507063608/http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/1988 |archivedate = May 7, 2008[/tpl] For the second annual "Beastie Awards" in 1989, Dragon's readers voted Pool of Radiance the most popular fantasy role-playing game of the year, with Ultima V as the runner-up. The Apple II version was the most popular format, the PC DOS/MS-DOS came in a close second, and the Commodore 64/128 got the fewest votes. The primary factor given for votes was the game's faithfulness to the AD&D system as well as the game's graphics and easy-to-use user interface to activate commands.[tpl]cite journal |title=The Beastie Knows Best |author=Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser |journal=Dragon |issue=151 |date=November 1989 |page=36[/tpl] Pool of Radiance was also selected for the RPGA-sponsored Gamers' Choice Awards for the Best Computer Game of 1989.[tpl]cite journal |title=The Gamers Have Chosen! |author=The Dragon editors |journal=Dragon |issue=151 |date=November 1989 |page=85[/tpl] In 1990 the game received the fifth-highest number of votes in a survey of Computer Gaming World readers' "All-Time Favorites".[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1990&pub=2&id=67 | title=CGW Readers Select All-Time Favorites | work=Computer Gaming World | date=January 1990 | accessdate=15 November 2013 | pages=64[/tpl]
Allen Rausch, writing for GameSpy's 2004 retrospective "A History of D&D Video Games", concluded that although the game "certainly had its flaws (horrendous load times, interface weirdness, and a low-level cap among others), it was a huge, expansive adventure that laid a good foundation for every Gold Box game that followed".[tpl]cite web | first=Allen | last=Rausch | date=August 15, 2004 | title=A History of D&D Video Games | publisher=GameSpy | url=http://pc.gamespy.com/articles/538/538865p2.html | accessdate=2009-12-23 [/tpl] Stan Stepanic of GameFreaks365 gave a highly positive, though somewhat reserved, review of the NES port of Pool of Radiance, scoring it at 8/10.  He commented, "...it's great to see a game like this on the NES because there really wasn't anything of this caliber at the time, RPG or otherwise. Adults were rarely given anything since nearly every title was aimed at younger audiences, so this is one of the few cases where programmers were trying to appeal to an older audience...if you're a fan of a true RPG, this is the game for you, you'll be thoroughly impressed and absorbed."[ref]
