[[Pale Snaketail]]

CATEGORIES: Gomphidae, Odonata of North America, Animals described in 1874

Ophiogomphus severus is a species of dragonfly in the family Gomphidae. It is commonly known as the pale snaketail.

==Characteristics==

===Naiad===

The naiad of the pale snaketail is large and robust with a length of 1 inch (25 mm). It has a curved hook on the top of each abdominal segment two through nine, and it has a single, rear-facing spine on each side of abdominal segments seven through nine. The abdomen turns up at the tip.

===Adult===

The pale snaketail is a medium-sized dragonfly with a length of 2-2.2 inches (50–55 mm) and wingspan of 2.6-2.8 inches (67–72 mm). Its face and thorax are a yellowish green color. The top of its thorax may be marked with black while each side is unmarked. Its abdomen is black and marked with yellow on the top of every segment. The underside of the tip of its abdomen is marked with yellow and is swollen as in other members of this family. The abdomen of the female may appear olive brown to yellowish green, especially when viewed from the side.

==Geographical range==

==Habitat==

The pale snaketail occurs near low elevation rivers and streams.

==Flight season==

This dragonfly has a flight season of mid-May to September. In California this dragonfly species has a flight season of May to August.

==Diet==

===Adult===

The pale snaketail will eat almost any soft-bodied flying insect such as mosquitoes, flies, butterflies, moths, mayflies, and flying ants or termites.

===Naiad===

The naiad of the pale snaketail feeds on a wide variety of aquatic insects, including mosquito larvae, other aquatic fly larvae, mayfly larvae, and freshwater shrimp. It will also feed on small fish and tadpoles.

==Ecology==

Snaketail naiads can be very selective in their habitat choices and will often occur only in certain stretches of a particular river or stream. They seem to be more tolerant of higher stream gradients and lower water temperatures than most members of this family, and are often found in cold trout streams. These naiads will burrow into the sand or mud, leaving the upturned tip of their abdomen exposed. This will allow them to breathe while buried by pumping water in and out of the tip of the abdomen. Unlike most species, snaketail naiads generally emerge as adults during the day. Adult pale snaketails generally fly from mid-May to September, and are commonly seen perching on gravel bars. They also have different flight seasons depends on range. These dragonflies cannot tolerate cooler temperatures and are rarely seen flying on cool or cloudy days. This dragonfly is probably the most common member of the family Gomphidae in Idaho. 

==Reproduction==

After both genders mate, the female flies singly, without the male attached, to lay her eggs by dipping the tip of her abdomen in rivers or streams while perching on a rock.

==Similar species==

The pale snaketail looks similar to the Great Basin snaketail, it has two curved lines. They are not wavy lines. The sinuous snaketail has a double wavy stripe. The bison snaketail has a single line that is thick. The brimstone clubtail has rings all around its abdomen. 

==Subspecies==

There are two described subspecies of Ophiogomphus severus. The following are the two subspecies:

==Conservation==

Populations of pale snaketails are widespread, abundant, and secure. This species is unthreatened.
