===Basketball career===

Romeo was invited, in the summer of 2006, to the Reebok-sponsored ABCD Camp, which is considered the premier basketball camp in the United States. The Teaneck, New Jersey-based ABCD Camp is an invitation-only basketball showcase previously attended by high-profile players including Kobe Bryant, Stephon Marbury, Tracy McGrady, LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony. Surrounded by future NBA players such as O. J. Mayo, Derrick Rose, and Kevin Love, Miller looked out of place and averaged less than 2 points a game throughout the camp. The Wall Street Journal made an article on March 8, entitled "A Hot Prospect," cites Sonny Vaccaro, the longtime director of the ABCD Camp, as explaining, "he invited Romeo Miller to the 2006 camp, primarily as a favor to Percy Miller, whom he knew from the club basketball circuit." In the article, Vaccaro indicated, "If you're looking for the profile of an athlete who plays basketball at USC, he's not it."Jon Weinbach (March 7, 2008). A Hot Prospect? The Wall Street Journal. Retrieved July 28, 2008.
On April 13, 2007, Miller verbally committed to the University of Southern California (USC) and signed a letter of intent on November 19, 2007.
Miller, a 5'11" point guard, played one year at Windward High School before he transferred and became a three-year starter at Beverly Hills High School.  As a junior, during the 2005–2006 high school season, he averaged 13.9 points and 5.6 assists per game.Player Bio:  Percy Miller USC Trojans' Men's Basketball. Retrieved May 21, 2010.Antracia Merrill-Moorings, Lil Romeo to shoot hoops for USC, Frost Illustrated. Retrieved May 6, 2007. As a senior, during the 2006–2007 high school season, he averaged 8.6 points and 9.0 assists per game.
According to The Wall Street Journal, it appears the decision to grant Miller a full scholarship at USC was largely driven by his relationship with friend and teammate Demar DeRozan, the 6-foot-6 All-American forward who was rated as the number five prospect in the country on Scout.com. The Wall Street Journal reported Coach Tim Floyd as saying, "Last April...Percy Miller called while driving both players from a tournament in Fayetteville, Ark...Percy Miller said 'Demar and Romeo are ready to make their decision, and would you like to have them both on scholarship?'...'I said absolutely.'"  Miller and DeRozan began playing in the 2008–2009 season.
