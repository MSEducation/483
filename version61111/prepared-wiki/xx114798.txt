[[Eburneana]]

CATEGORIES: Salticidae

Eburneana is a genus of the spider family Salticidae (jumping spiders).
Like several other salticids, this genus mimicks ants.

==Description==

Eburneana are rather big ant-like (8 to 12Â mm) spiders with a constricted cephalothorax. The body is very flat and rather slender. The cephalic and thoracic parts are parted by a clear constriction to mimic the ant body plan. Unlike other African ant-like salticids Eburneana has the chelicerae located more posteriorly, rich leg spination and clearly visible large spigots on the posterior spinnerets.

==Relationships==

The structure of genitalia and the shape of the first legs resembles males of the subfamily Pelleninae, but the phylogenetic relationships of Eburneana to other genera are unclear.

==Name==

The genus is named after the Latin name of Ivory Coast, Litus Eburneum, where one of the species was first found.
