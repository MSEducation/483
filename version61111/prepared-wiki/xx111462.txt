[[Generic filter]]

CATEGORIES: Forcing (mathematics)

Formally, let P be a poset (partially ordered set), and let F be a filter on P; that is, F is a subset of P such that:
Now if D is a collection of dense open subsets of P, in the topology whose basic open sets are all sets of the form {q|qâ‰¤p} for particular p in P, then F is said to be ''D''-generic if F meets all sets in D; that is,
Similarly, if M is a transitive model of ZFC (or some sufficient fragment thereof), with P an element of M, then F is said to be M''-generic''', or sometimes '''generic over ''M, if F meets all dense open subsets of P that are elements of M.
