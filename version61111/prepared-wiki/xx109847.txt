Holland & Hart LLP is a law firm of more than 450 lawyers in 15 offices across the Mountain West and in Washington, D.C. 

==History==

Holland & Hart began in 1947 when former Colorado state legislator Stephen Hart rebelled against what he described as the "very monopolistic, establishment-oriented" old firm culture in Denver where "nobody could expect to become a partner unless he was born into it or married into it," according to the Colorado Lawyer.[tpl]cn|date=April 2014[/tpl] After he was denied partnership at a local firm, Hart started his own practice with his friend Josiah Holland. Among Holland & Hart's guiding principles for the firm was spurning legalese in favor of communications which were "earthy and comprehensible to the man on the street." In addition to serving local business leaders, Holland & Hart championed regional historical preservation causes.[tpl]cn|date=April 2014[/tpl]
Starting as a two-man outfit, Holland & Hart has become one of the largest firms in the Mountain West. Among the firm’s most notable practices are litigation, business law, tax and estates, employment law, energy and natural resources intellectual property and real estate law.[tpl]cn|date=April 2014[/tpl]
