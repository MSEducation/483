==Biography==

Born as the ninth son of Tokugawa Ieyasu, his childhood name was Gorōtamaru. While still a young child, he was appointed leader of first the fief of Kofu in Kai Province and later the fief of Kiyosu in Owari Province. In 1610, he was appointed leader of the Owari Domain (present-day Nagoya), one of the most important regions in the country, thus founding the Owari-Tokugawa house. A holder of the 2nd court rank, junior grade (ju-ni-i), he had the title of dainagon (major counselor).
Yoshinao's principal wife was Princess Haru, the daughter of Asano Yoshinaga of Kii (whose family was later transferred to Hiroshima), and his concubines included Osai and Ojō no Kata. He had two children: Mitsutomo, who succeeded him as daimyo of Owari, and Itoko, who married Hirohata Tadayuki, a court noble.
Yoshinao began learning Shinkage-ryū from Yagyū Hyōgonosuke at age 16, and was named the 4th sōke at age 21.
