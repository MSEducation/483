[[Overpressure]]

CATEGORIES: Pressure, Explosives, Shock waves

Overpressure (or blast overpressure) is the pressure caused by a shock wave over and above normal atmospheric pressure.  The shock wave may be caused by sonic boom or by explosion, and the resulting overpressure receives particular attention when measuring the effects of nuclear weapons or thermobaric bombs.

==Effects of overpressure==

According to an article in the journal Toxicological Sciences,
 "Blast overpressure (BOP), also known as high energy impulse noise, is a damaging outcome of explosive detonations and firing of weapons. Exposure to BOP shock waves alone results in injury predominantly to the hollow organ systems such as auditory, respiratory, and gastrointestinal systems."[ref]"Pulmonary Biochemical and Histological Alterations after Repeated Low-Level Blast Overpressure Exposures",
