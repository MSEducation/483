The Grass Is Greener is an album by Colosseum, released in April 1970. In contrast to other albums by Colosseum, The Grass Is Greener was released only in the United States, on the Dunhill/ABC label. It was conceived as a U.S. alternative to November 1969's Valentyne Suite, complete with a muted, blue-green variation of the aforementioned album's cover. It features four tracks recorded with then-new guitarist/vocalist Dave "Clem" Clempson in the winter of 1969 ("Jumping Off The Sun," "Lost Angeles," "Rope Ladder To The Moon," "Bolero"); three tracks from the 1969 Vertigo LP Valentyne Suite but with vocal and guitar parts provided by Clempson ("Butty's Blues," "The Machine Demands A Sacrifice," "The Grass Is Greener") instead of James Litherland; and one track, "Elegy," that appears to be the same as the original from Valentyne Suite, including Litherland's vocal. The record was remastered and released as a bonus disc in Sanctuary Records' 2003 deluxe CD edition of Valentyne Suite.
