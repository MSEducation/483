At the center of the city sits a church. Masses are held throughout the week and many of the local people walk around the square at night.  There are stalls with cheap "bon bons" (little candies) and other treats. 
Caucaia has a rich Catholic heritage, with many other demoninations as well. A LDS Church is down the street from the center of town.  
There are unlit areas to the south and tourists should stay in the center of town at night. The beaches to the north should also be avoided when dark settles in.
