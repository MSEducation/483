[[Tarsier]]

CATEGORIES: Mammals of Southeast Asia, Tarsiers

Tarsiers are haplorrhine primates of the family Tarsiidae, which is itself the lone extant family within the infraorder Tarsiiformes. Although the group was once more widespread, all the species living today are found in the islands of Southeast Asia.

==Evolutionary history==

===Fossil record===

Fossils of tarsiiform primates are found in Asia, Europe, and North America, with disputed fossils from Africa, but extant tarsiers are restricted to several Southeast Asian islands, including the Philippines, Sulawesi, Borneo, and Sumatra. The fossil record indicates their dentition has not changed much, except in size, in the past 45 million years.
Within the family Tarsiidae, there are two extinct genera, Xanthorhysis  and Afrotarsius.  However, the placement of Afrotarsius is not certain,[tpl]cite book | last1 = Gunnell | first1 = G. | last2 = Rose | first2 = K. | editor1-last = Hartwig | editor1-first = W.C. | title = The Primate Fossil Record | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-521-66315-6 | chapter = Tarsiiformes: Evolutionary History and Adaptation[/tpl] and is sometimes listed in its own family, Afrotarsiidae, within the infraorder Tarsiiformes,McKenna, M.C., and Bell, S.K. 1997. Classification of Mammals Above the Species Level. Columbia University Press, New York, 337–340 pp. ISBN 0-231-11013-8 or considered an anthropoid primate.
So far, three fossil species of the genus Tarsius are known from the fossil record:
The genus Tarsius has a longer fossil record than any other primate genus, but the assignment of the Eocene and Miocene fossils to the genus is questionable.[tpl]cite book | last = Simons | first = E.L. | year = 2003 | title = Tarsiers: past, present, and future | editor1-last = Wright | editor1-first = P.C. | editor2-last = Simons | editor2-first = E.L. | editor3-last = Gursky | editor3-first = S. | chapter = The Fossil Record of Tarsier Evolution | isbn = 978-0-8135-3236-3[/tpl]

===Classification===

The phylogenetic position of extant tarsiers within the order Primates has been debated for much of the past century, and tarsiers have alternately been classified with strepsirrhine primates in the suborder Prosimii, or as the sister group to the simians (=Anthropoidea) in the infraorder Haplorrhini. Analysis of SINE insertions, a type of macromutation to the DNA, is argued to offer very persuasive evidence for the monophyly of Haplorrhini, where other lines of evidence, such as DNA sequence data, remain ambiguous. Thus, some systematists argue the debate is conclusively settled in favor of a monophyletic Haplorrhini. In common with simians, tarsiers have a mutation in the L-gulonolactone oxidase (GULO) gene which confers need for vitamin C in the diet. Since the strepsirrhines do not have this mutation and have retained the ability to make vitamin C, the genetic trait which confers the need for it in the diet would tend to place tarsiers with haplorrhines.[tpl]cite journal | title = Vitamin C biosynthesis in prosimians: Evidence for the anthropoid affinity of Tarsius | author = Pollock, J. I. & Mullin, R. J. | journal = American Journal of Physical Anthropology | year = 1986 | volume = 73 | issue = 1 | pages = 65–70 | doi = 10.1002/ajpa.1330730106 | url = http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/110488482/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0 | pmid = 3113259[/tpl]
At a lower phylogenetic level, the tarsiers have, until recently, all been placed in the genus Tarsius, while it was debated whether the species should be placed in two (a Sulawesi and a Philippine-western group) or three separate genera (Sulawesi, Philippine and western groups).[tpl]cite journal |last=Brandon-Jones |first=D. |authorlink= |coauthors=et al. |year=2004 |title=Asian primate classification |journal=International Journal of Primatology |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=97–164 |doi=10.1023/B:IJOP.0000014647.18720.32 |url= |accessdate= |quote= [/tpl] Species level taxonomy is complex, with morphology often being of limited use compared to vocalizations.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl] Further confusion existed over the validity of certain names. Among others, the widely used T. dianae has been shown to be a junior synonym of T. dentatus, and comparably, T. spectrum is now considered a junior synonym of T. tarsier.
In 2010, Colin Groves and Myron Shekelle suggested splitting the genus Tarsius into three genera, the Philippine tarsiers (genus Carlito), the western tarsiers (genus Cephalopachus), and the eastern tarsiers (genus Tarsius). This was based on differences in dentition, eye size, limb and hand length, tail tufts, tail sitting pads, the number of mammae, chromosome count, socioecology, vocalizations, and distribution. The senior taxon of the species, T. tarsier was restricted to the population of a Selayar island, which then required the resurrection of the defunct taxon T. fuscus. Their classification, which includes several newly described species, is as follows:[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Groves | first1 = C. | last2 = Shekelle | first2 = M. | title = The Genera and Species of Tarsiidae | journal = International Journal of Primatology | volume = 31 | issue = 6 | pages = 1071–1082 | year = 2010 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/j3712t1357863121/fulltext.pdf | format = PDF | doi = 10.1007/s10764-010-9443-1[/tpl]

==Anatomy and physiology==

Tarsiers are small animals with enormous eyes; each eyeball is approximately 16 mm in diameter and is as large as its entire brain.[tpl]cite book |last= Shumaker |first= Robert W. |coauthors= Benjamin B. Beck |title= Primates in Question |publisher= Smithsonian Books |year= 2003 |isbn= 1-58834-151-8 [/tpl] The unique cranial anatomy of the tarsier results from the need to balance their large eyes and heavy head so they are able to wait silently for nutritious prey.Shekelle, Myron, and Gursky. (2010) "Why tarsiers? Why now? An introduction to the special edition on tarsiers." International Journal Of Primatology 31(6): 937-940. Academic Search Premier. Web. 18 Apr. 2013. Tarsiers have an incredibly strong auditory sense because their auditory cortex is very distinct. Tarsiers also have very long hind limbs, due mostly to the extremely elongated tarsus bones of the feet, from which the animals get their name. The combination of their elongated tarsi and fused tibiofibulae makes them morphologically specialized for vertical clinging and leaping.Rasmussen, D. T., Conroy, G. C., & Simons, E. L. (1998). Tarsier-like locomotor specializations in the Oligocene primate Afrotarsius. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 95, 14848–14850. The head and body range from 10 to 15 cm in length, but the hind limbs are about twice this long (including the feet), and they also have a slender tail from 20 to 25 cm long. Their fingers are also elongated, with the third finger being about the same length as the upper arm. Most of the digits have nails, but the second and third toes of the hind feet bear claws instead, which are used for grooming. Tarsiers have very soft, velvety fur, which is generally buff, beige, or ochre in color.[tpl]cite book |editor=Macdonald, D.|author= Niemitz, Carsten|authorlink=Carsten Niemitz| year=1984 |title= The Encyclopedia of Mammals|publisher= Facts on File|location=New York|pages= 338–339|isbn= 0-87196-871-1[/tpl]
Unlike other prosimians, tarsiers lack any toothcomb, and their dental formula is also unique:[tpl]DentalFormula|upper=2.1.3.3|lower=1.1.3.3[/tpl]
Unlike many nocturnal vertebrates, tarsiers lack a light-reflecting area (tapetum lucidum) of the eye and have a fovea.
The tarsier's brain is different from other primates in terms of the arrangement of the connections between the two eyes and the lateral geniculate nucleus, which is the main region of the thalamus that receives visual information. The sequence of cellular layers receiving information from the ipsilateral (same side of the head) and contralateral (opposite side of the head) eyes in the lateral geniculate nucleus distinguishes tarsiers from lemurs, lorises, and monkeys, which are all similar in this respect.[tpl]cite journal |last=Rosa |first=M.

Philippine tarsiers are capable of hearing frequencies as high as 91 kHz. They are also capable of vocalizations with a dominant frequency of 70 kHz.[tpl]cite journal |last=Ramsier |first=Marissa A. |authorlink= |coauthors=Cunningham A.J.; Moritz G.L.; Finneran J.J.; Williams C.V.; Ong P.S.; Gursky-Doyen S.L.; Dominy N.J. |year=2012 |title=Primate communication in the pure ultrasound |journal=Biology Letters |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2011.1149[/tpl]

==Behavior==

Tarsiers are the only extant entirely carnivorous primates: they are primarily insectivorous, and catch insects by jumping at them. They are also known to prey on  birds, snakes, lizards, and bats.
Pygmy tarsiers differ from other species of tarsiers in terms of their morphology, communication, and behavior.Grow, Nanda, and Sharon Gursky-Doyen. "Preliminary Data On The Behavior, Ecology, And Morphology Of Pygmy Tarsiers ( Tarsius Pumilus)." International Journal Of Primatology 31.6 (2010): 1174-1191. Academic Search Premier. Web. 18 Apr. 2013. The differences in morphology that distinguish pygmy tarsiers from other species of tarsiers are likely based on their high altitude environment.Musser, G. G., & Dagosto, M. (1987). The identity of Tarsius pumilus, a pygmy species endemic to the montane mossy forests of Central Sulawesi. American Museum Novitates, 2867, 1–53
All tarsier species are nocturnal in their habits, but like many nocturnal organisms, some individuals may show more or less activity during the daytime. Based on the anatomy of all tarsiers, they are all adapted for leaping even though they all vary based on their species.Dagosto, M., Gebo, D. L., & Dolino, C. (2001). Positional behavior and social organization of the Philippine tarsier (Tarsius syrichta). Primates, 42, 233–243.Niemitz, C. (1977). Zur funktionsmorphologie und biometrie der gattung Tarsius, Storr, 1780. Cour Forschung Institut Senckenberg, 25, 1–161. Niemitz, C. (1979). Relationships among anatomy, ecology, and behavior: A model developed in the genus Tarsius, with thoughts about phylogenetic mechanisms and adaptive interactions. In S. 1190 N. Grow, S.

An investigation and review of the territorial behaviour and social organization of the genus Tarsius. In C. Niemitz (Ed.), Biology of tarsiers (pp. 117–128). New York: Gustav Fischer
Ecological variation is responsible for differences in morphology and behavior in tarsiers because different species become adapted to local conditions based on the level of altitude.Körner, C. (2007). The use of ‘altitude’ in ecological research. Trends in Ecology and Evolution, 22, 569–574. For example, the colder climate at higher elevations can influence cranial morphology.Rae, T. C., Hill, R. I., Hamada, Y., & Koppe, T. (2003). Clinal variation of maxillary sinus volume in Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata). American Journal of Primatology, 59, 153–158.
Gestation takes about six months,[tpl]cite journal |last=Izard |first=Kay M. |authorlink= |coauthors=Wright, Simons |year=1985 |title=Gestation length in Tarsius bancanus |journal=Am J Primatology |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=327–331 |doi=10.1002/ajp.1350090408 |url= |accessdate= |quote= [/tpl] and tarsiers give birth to single offspring. Young tarsiers are born furred, and with open eyes, and are able to climb within a day of birth. They reach sexual maturity by the end of their second year. Sociality and mating system varies, with tarsiers from Sulawesi living in small family groups, while Philippine and western tarsiers are reported to sleep and forage alone.
Tarsiers tend to be extremely shy animals.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2011[/tpl]

==Conservation==

Tarsiers have never formed successful breeding colonies in captivity. This may be partly due to their special feeding requirements.[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1002/zoo.1430120207 | title = Habitat Use, Foraging Behavior, and Activity Patterns in Reproducing Western Tarsiers, Tarsius bancanus, in Captivity: A Management Synthesis | last1 = Roberts | first1 = M. | last2 = Kohn | first2 = F. | journal = Zoo Biology | year = 1993 | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | pages = 217–232 | url = http://si-pddr.si.edu/dspace/bitstream/10088/503/1/Roberts1993.pdf | format = PDF[/tpl][tpl]cite book | editor1-last = Shekelle | editor1-first = M. | editor2-last = Maryano | editor2-first = T. | editor3-last = Groves | editor3-first = C. | editor4-last = Schulze | editor4-first = H. | editor5-last = Fitch-Snyder | editor5-first = H. | title = Primates of the Oriental Night | publisher = LIPI Press | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-979-799-263-7 | last1 = Shekelle | first1 = M. | last2 = Nietsch | first2 = A. | chapter = Tarsier Longevity: Data from a Recapture in the Wild and from Captive Animals | pages = 85–89 | url = http://tarsier.org/products_files/2008-POTON-p85-ShekelleNietsch-Longevity.pdf | format = PDF[/tpl][tpl]cite book | editor1-last = Shekelle | editor1-first = M. | editor2-last = Maryano | editor2-first = T. | editor3-last = Groves | editor3-first = C. | editor4-last = Schulze | editor4-first = H. | editor5-last = Fitch-Snyder | editor5-first = H. | title = Primates of the Oriental Night | publisher = LIPI Press | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-979-799-263-7 | last1 = Severn | first1 = K. | last2 = Dahang | first2 = D. | last3 = Shekelle | first3 = M. | chapter = Eastern Tarsiers in Captivity, Part I: Enclosure and Enrichment | pages = 91–96 | url = http://www.tarsier.org/products_files/2008-POTON-p91-Severnetal-CaptivityEnclosure.pdf | format = PDF[/tpl][tpl]cite book | editor1-last = Shekelle | editor1-first = M. | editor2-last = Maryano | editor2-first = T. | editor3-last = Groves | editor3-first = C. | editor4-last = Schulze | editor4-first = H. | editor5-last = Fitch-Snyder | editor5-first = H. | title = Primates of the Oriental Night | publisher = LIPI Press | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-979-799-263-7 | last1 = Severn | first1 = K. | last2 = Dahang | first2 = D. | last3 = Shekelle | first3 = M. | chapter = Eastern Tarsiers in Captivity, Part II: A Preliminary Assessment of Diet | pages = 97–103 | url = http://www.tarsier.org/products_files/2008-POTON-p97-Dahangetal-CaptiveDiet.pdf | format = PDF[/tpl][tpl]cite book | last = Fitch-Snyder | first = H. | chapter = History of Captive Conservation of Tarsiers | pages = 227–295 | title = Tarsiers: Past, Present, and Future | editor1-last = Wright | editor1-first = P.C. | editor2-last = Simons | editor2-first = E.L. | editor3-last = Gursky | editor3-first = S. | year = 2003 | publisher = Rutgers University Press | isbn = 0-8135-3236-1[/tpl]
A sanctuary near the town of Corella, on the Philippine island of Bohol, is having some success restoring tarsier populations.  The Philippines Tarsier Foundation (PTFI) has developed a large, semiwild enclosure known as the Tarsier Research and Development Center. Carlito Pizarras, also known as the "Tarsier man", founded this sanctuary where visitors can watch tarsiers up close in the wild (naturally without touching them).  As of 2011, the sanctuary was taken care of by him and his brother.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl] The trees in the sanctuary are populated with nocturnal insects that make up the tarsier's diet.[tpl]cite journal |last=Jachowski |first=David S. |authorlink= |coauthors=Pizzaras, Carlito |year=2005 |title=Introducing an innovative semi-captive environment for the Philippine tarsier (Tarsius syrichta) |journal=Zoo Biology |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=101–109 |doi=10.1002/zoo.20023 |url= |accessdate= |quote= [/tpl]
The conservation status of all tarsiers is vulnerable to extinction. Tarsiers are a conservation dependent species meaning that they need to have more and improved management of protected habitats or they will definitely become extinct in the future.
The 2008-described Siau Island tarsier is regarded as Critically Endangered and was listed among The World's 25 Most Endangered Primates by Conservation International and the IUCN/SCC Primate Specialist Group in 2008.[tpl]cite web | title=Siau Island Tarsier | url=http://www.primate-sg.org/siau07.htm | first1 = Myron | last1 = Shekelle | first2 = Agus | last2 = Salim | publisher= IUCN/SSC Primate Specialist Group | accessdate= January 2010[/tpl]
