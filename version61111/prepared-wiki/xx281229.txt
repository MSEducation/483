Mac McEntire, writing for DVD Verdict, said that he liked the film, but that "long stretches of dialogue with little to no action might be true to the era to which this film pays tribute, but it might move a little too slowly for some of today's viewers". Andy McKeague, of Monsters and Critics, wrote that "‘Zombie’ is a fun film, but one you need to be in the right mood for. It has all the markings of the 50’s TV cop shows it deliberately resembles and enough of the E.T. savvy to appeal to fans of ‘Plan 9’ to ‘The X-files’".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/dvd/reviews/article_6321.php/DVD_Review_I_Was_a_Zombie_for_the_FBI |title=DVD Review: I Was a Zombie for the FBI |last=McKeague |first=Andy |date=September 16, 2005 |website=Monsters and Critics |accessdate=August 9, 2013[/tpl]
