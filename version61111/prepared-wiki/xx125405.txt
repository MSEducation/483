Stoke-sub-Hamdon (or Stoke sub Hamdon) is a large village and civil parish in the South Somerset district of Somerset, England. It is situated 5 miles (8 km) west of Yeovil, with which it is linked by the A3088 road. The parish is located near the River Parrett, and includes the village of East Stoke.

==History==

The village stretches around Ham Hill which is a geological Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), Iron Age hill fort, Roman site, and country park. The hill has given its name to the distinctive quarried hamstone which is quarried from a ridge of sandy limestone rock that is elevated above the lower lying clay vales and nearby Somerset Levels. It is of particular importance to geologists because of the assemblages of fossils which it contains, the sedimentary features which it displays and the way it relates to other rocks of equivalent age in the close vicinity.[tpl]cite web | title=Ham Hill | url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1000144.pdf | accessdate=2006-07-17[/tpl] The Bronze Age and Iron Age hill fort was occupied by the Durotriges tribe. A Roman milestone was found at Venn Bridge in 1930: apparently it was made as an element in a colonnade and afterwards converted to a milestone inscribed with the name of the emperor Flavius Severus who ruled in 305-306 AD.[tpl]cite book |title=The Roman Inscriptions of Britain.

In the 10th century the estate passed to Glastonbury Abbey, but after the Norman Conquest was held by the Robert, Count of Mortain and granted to Robert FitzIvo. It then passed down through the Beauchamps of Hatch, becoming known as Stoke Beauchamp. It was acquired by the Duchy of Cornwall in 1443 and is still held by the Duchy.[tpl]cite book|last=Bush|first=Robin|title=Somerset: The Complete Guide|publisher=Dovecote Press|date=1994|pages=197–198|isbn=1-874336-26-1[/tpl] The parish of Stoke was part of the Tintinhull Hundred.[tpl]cite web|title=Somerset Hundreds|url=http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/SOM/Miscellaneous/|publisher=GENUKI|accessdate=22 October 2011[/tpl]
The village is the site of the 14th century Stoke sub Hamdon Priory which is a former priest's house of the chantry chapel of St Nicholas, which was destryoed after the dissolution of the monasteries. The priory has been owned by the National Trust since 1946,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-vh/w-visits/w-findaplace/w-stokesubhamdonpriory/ |title=Stoke sub Hamdon Priory |accessdate=2007-11-11 |work=National Trust [/tpl] and designated by English Heritage as a grade I listed building.[tpl]cite web | title=The Priory, or Parsonage Farmhouse  | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=441493 | accessdate=2007-11-11[/tpl]

The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council’s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council.
The village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of South Somerset, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Yeovil Rural District.[tpl]cite web|title=Yeovil RD|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10186286|work=A vision of Britain Through Time|publisher=University of Portsmouth|accessdate=4 January 2014[/tpl] The district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism.
