John Andrew Afford (born 12 May 1964, in Crowland, Lincolnshire) was an English cricketer. He was a right-handed batsman and a left-arm slow bowler who played for Nottinghamshire.
Afford made his first-class debut for Nottinghamshire against Oxford University, during the 1984 season, appearing in single game during the 1984 County Championship season, but it wasn't until two years later that he would get a  regular first-team place, playing just two County Championship games during the 1985 season.
Afford played several times in the Second XI Championship in 1987 and 1988 and he returned to play several matches for the first team in 1989.
Afford started the following season promisingly, making the selection for an England A fixture against Zimbabwe in 1990 which the team won by nine wickets, and in which team-mate and three-time Test cricketer Steve Watkin took a 23-ball duck batting from tenth in the order. He finished the year being awarded his cap.
In 1991 the team's Second XI flourished, winning the Second XI Trophy with Afford putting in a strong bowling performance along the way to Nottinghamshire's top placing in the North Zone, and taking the wicket of Ali Brown in the final. Afford, now partnered on a regular basis by former England Test batsman Eddie Hemmings.
In total, Afford took 468 first-class wickets, including hauls of 10 wickets in a match on two occasions, and five-wicket innings on sixteen occasions, with his best haul of 6-51 coming against Lancashire. The two ten-wicket innings came against Kent and Sussex.
Andy Afford was editor of All Out Cricket between 2002 and 2011, nominated as one of the British Society of Magazine Editors (BSME) sports editors of the year in 2011. He now works as publishing director of The Cricketer magazine.[tpl]cn|date=March 2014[/tpl]
