There Goes the Neighborhood is the fifth studio album by Joe Walsh, released in 1981.

==History==

The album's biggest hit "A Life of Illusion" was recorded in 1973 with Joe Walsh's first solo band Barnstorm but was not completed. The overdubs and final mixes were completed during the There Goes the Neighborhood sessions and released on the album. The promotional video for the track shows the coming to life of the album's cover. This song also appeared in the opening credits of "The 40-Year-Old Virgin" and appears as the first song on its soundtrack.
Another track "Rivers (of the Hidden Funk)" was a track Joe wrote for the Eagles' 1979 album The Long Run, but was left off. The track featured a guest appearance by Walsh's Eagles-mate Don Felder (who co-wrote the track) on talk box guitar. "Rivers..." received a good bit of FM radio airplay.
The album's final track "You Never Know" is a song about rumors and hearsay, including not-so-veiled swipes at other members of the Eagles and their management with lines like "The Frontline grapevine jury's in a nasty mood / you might be guilty, honey, you never know." (Frontline Management was Irving Azoff's management firm at the time). Don Felder appears on guitar on this track performing rhythm and dual lead guitar solos with Walsh.
Eagles bandmate Timothy B. Schmit sang backing vocals on the opening track "Things."
Note this album is not available on iTunes, unlike the artist's previous and subsequent work; no explanation has been given for this.

==Reception==

Writing for Allmusic, critic Ben Davies wrote of the album "Joe Walsh's long and varied career has had its ups and downs, to say the least. Here, you see Walsh in good old rock form... The rock legend's trademark sound is prominently featured throughout the album, and undoubtedly here he performs some of his finest solos. The only qualm that one can pick is that the whole album is in a much-similar vein."
