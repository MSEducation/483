GeoClue is a software framework which can be used to enable geospatial awareness in applications. GeoClue uses the D-Bus inter-process communication mechanism to provide location information,http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/GeoClue#Learnmore but there is also a Qt Mobility API in the works.http://gitorious.org/~juhvu/qt-mobility/meego-location-qt-mobility Through this it aims to simplify development of location aware applications and promote code reuse within the free software and open source communities by defining a logical boundary between the applications and underlying location providers. GeoClue is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License and is currently available for Linux.
GeoClue ships in several Linux distributions including Ubuntu, Debian and Fedora. It is also the positioning service of the MeeGo mobile Linux distribution,[tpl]cite web|url=http://meego.com/developers/meego-architecture|title=MeeGo Architecture|date=2010-02-11|accessdate=2010-04-04[/tpl] Tizen [tpl]cite web|url=http://download.tizen.org/misc/media/conference2012/wednesday/ballroom-b/%202012-05-09_1145-1225-overview_of_tizen_location.pdf|title=Overview of Tizen Location|date=2012-05-09|accessdate=2013-01-15[/tpl] and the GNOME stack, uses by e.g. GNOME Maps.https://developer.gnome.org/platform-overview/stable/
