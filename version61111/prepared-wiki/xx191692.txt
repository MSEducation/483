Uttoxeter Road (also known as Four Trees) is a cricket ground located along the Uttoxeter Road between the villages of Lower Tean and Checkley in Staffordshire. The ground is surrounded on all sides by countryside.
The ground first appears on maps in 1924. Although located in Staffordshire, it was Derbyshire who used the ground for two List A matches, one in the 1991 Refuge Assurance League against Glamorgan and another against Hampshire in the 1993 AXA Equity & Law League.[tpl]cite web|url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/395_a.html|title=List A Matches played on Four Trees, Checkley|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=27 January 2013[/tpl] In the first match, Derbyshire made 251 all out from 39 overs, with Alan Warner's 51 the highest score of the innings. Daren Foster returned best figures for Glamorgan, with figures of 3/30.
