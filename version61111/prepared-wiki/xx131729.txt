[[The Soap Lady]]

CATEGORIES: 2001 novels, American children's novels

The Soap Lady is a 2001 children's novel by underground comics writer/artist Renee French.  It focuses on themes of friendship and acceptance instead of Renee's normal themes of sex and death.  It is about a dirty young boy named Rollo who finds a naked woman made out of soap who washed up upon shore. To her normal readers, it was quirky to see Renee French write and illustrate a children's book (which originally began as a black comedy book in the disguise of kids' book). Renee's book marked her absence from comics, having her pursue a second career as an author for children's books (under the pen-name Rainy Dohaney). The book is based on the exhibit at the Mutter Museum.
