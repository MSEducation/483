The High Commissioner of the United Kingdom to the Republic of Cameroon is the United Kingdom's foremost diplomatic representative in Cameroon.
In 1960 the French colony of Cameroon became independent as the Republic of Cameroun. The southern part of British Cameroons merged with it in 1961 to form the Federal Republic of Cameroon. The country was renamed the United Republic of Cameroon in 1972 and the Republic of Cameroon in 1984. Cameroon joined the British Commonwealth in 1995: before then the British diplomatic representatives were Ambassadors, but now that Cameroon is in the Commonwealth the British representatives are High Commissioners.
British Ambassadors and High Commissioners to Cameroon have also been non-resident ambassadors to the Central African Republic from 1966 until 1970 and from 1982; to the Republic of Chad from 1966 until 1970 and from 1990; to the Republic of Equatorial Guinea from 1969; and to the Gabonese Republic from 1966 until 1978 and from 1995.
