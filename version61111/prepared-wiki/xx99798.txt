The Dacia Logan is a small family car produced jointly by the French manufacturer Renault and its Romanian subsidiary Dacia since 2004. It is currently at its second generation and has been manufactured at Dacia's automobile plant in Mioveni, Romania, and at Renault's plants in Morocco, Brazil, Turkey, Russia, Colombia, Iran, India and South Africa.
It has also been marketed as the Renault Logan, Nissan Aprio, Mahindra Verito, Renault Tondar 90, Lada Largus (the MCV), Nissan NP200 (the pick-up) or Renault Symbol (the second generation), depending on the existing presence or positioning of the Renault brand.

==Logan I (2004–2008)==

Designed at Renault's Technocentre near Paris, the Logan was the result of four years of development of the project X90, announced by Renault in 1999, after the buyout of Dacia in 1998.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.daciagroup.com/en/the-logan-project.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110708220614/http://daciagroup.com/en/the-logan-project.html |title=The Logan Project |publisher=Dacia |date=28 January 2010 |archivedate=8 July 2011 |accessdate=9 October 2010[/tpl]
During a visit to Russia by French President Jacques Chirac, Louis Schweitzer noted that at Lada and Renault dealerships the €6,000 Ladas were selling very well while the €12,000 Renaults stayed in the showroom. "Seeing those antiquated cars, I found it unacceptable that technical progress should stop you making a good car for €6,000." (He later revised this target to €5,000). "I also drew up a list of specifications in three words – modern, reliable and affordable – and added that everything else was negotiable."[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2007[/tpl] The cheapest version of the car is €5,900, and the price can reach €11,200, depending on equipment and customs duty. (The base model for Western Europe, where it is badged as a Dacia but generally sold in Renault dealerships, is somewhat more expensive).
The Logan was designed from the outset as an affordable car, and has many simplified features to keep costs down. It replaces many older cars in production, including the Romanian Dacia 1310 series of Renault 12-based cars.
It was officially launched in June 2004,[tpl]cite web|title=Dacia Logan, lansata la Bucuresti si la Technocentre, Franta|url=http://www.romanialibera.ro/editie/index.php?url=articol&tabel=z03062004&idx=7|publisher=Romania Libera|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20040607183001/http://www.romanialibera.ro/editie/index.php?url=articol&tabel=z03062004&idx=7|archivedate=7 June 2004|date=3 June 2004[/tpl] and began marketing in September 2004.[tpl]cite web|title=Drive test Logan: cum a aleargat Dacia printre stancile din Turcia pentru clientii de acasa|url=http://www.zf.ro/auto/drive-test-logan-cum-a-aleargat-dacia-printre-stancile-din-turcia-pentru-clientii-de-acasa-2903143/|publisher=Ziarul Financiar|accessdate=31 July 2013|date=8 September 2004[/tpl] Renault originally had no plans to sell the Logan in Western Europe, but in June 2005, began importing a more expensive version of the car, starting at around €7,500.[tpl]cite web|title=Logan arrives on Western European markets|url=http://www.renault.co.ir/images/pdf/Logan.pdf|publisher=Renault Pars|accessdate=8 August 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060207090511/http://www.renault.co.ir/images/pdf/Logan.pdf|archivedate=9 June 2005[/tpl]  It was an unexpected success with people wanting an inexpensive, no-frills car they could repair themselves.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2011[/tpl]
The Logan was launched in India in April 2007, as a collaboration with Mahindra, who helped Renault cut costs by 15%.[tpl]cite book|last1=Sirkin|first1=Harold L.|last2=Hemerling|first2=James W.|last3=Bhattacharya|first3=Arindam K.|title=GLOBALITY: Competing with Everyone from Everywhere for Everything'|publisher=Business Plus|location=New York|isbn=0-446-17829-2|url=http://www.bcg.com/globality|page=304|date=11 June 2008[/tpl] India was the first right-hand drive market for the Logan. It was almost an instant success with impressive sales in the first few months.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.dn.se/ekonomi/eu-intrade-ger-extra-fart-at-rumansk-bil|title=EU-inträde ger extra fart åt rumänsk bil|work=Dagens Nyheter|date=19 December 2006[/tpl] [tpl]Failed verification|date=September 2012[/tpl] Since then Mahindra and Renault have parted ways, but the Logan continues to be sold by Mahindra, with technical support from Renault. Its awkward styling has resulted in lower than expected sales. The company has later introduced the name Verito to the car, which since then only had Mahindra badges.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.carmayogi.in/new-a-event/197-mahinda-verito.html |title=Mahindra launches Verito sedan: drops Renault badges, name |publisher = Carmayogi.in |date=27 April 2011 |accessdate=27 April 2011[/tpl]

===Facelift===

On 1 July 2008, almost four years after the release of the first Logan, a facelifted version called the Dacia New Logan was announced.[tpl]cite web |last=Tan |first=Paul |url=http://paultan.org/archives/2008/07/02/facelifted-dacia-new-logan/ |title=Facelifted Dacia New Logan |publisher=Paultan.org |accessdate=9 October 2010[/tpl] The new version features a more modern design and a more attractive and more comfortable interior.[tpl]cite web|title=2009 Dacia Logan news, pictures, and information|url=http://www.conceptcarz.com/vehicle/z16586/Dacia-Logan.aspx|publisher=Conceptcarz.com|accessdate=28 January 2012[/tpl]

===Features===

The Logan is based on the B0 platform used for the Renault Clio II and for other Renault and Nissan models.[tpl]cite journal|title=Dacia Lodgy. Un monospace à 10 000 €!|journal=Auto Plus|date=28 November 2011|issue=1212|pages=21|url=http://www.autonews.fr/|quote=Il ne s'agit plus de la base de la Clio 2, comme pour les autres modèles de la gamme ...[/tpl] It has 50% fewer parts than a high-end Renault vehicle and has a limited number of electronic devices. This makes the car cheaper to produce and easier and cheaper to repair.
Some parts are also much simpler than those of its competitors. For example, rear-view mirrors are symmetrical and can be used on either side of the car, the windshield is flatter than usual, and the dashboard is a single injection-molded piece.
The developers have taken into account several differences between road and climate conditions in developed and developing countries. The Logan suspension is soft and strong, and the chassis sits visibly higher than most other compact cars to help it negotiate dirt roads and potholes on ill-maintained asphalt roads. The engine is specially prepared to handle lower quality fuel, whereas the air conditioning is powerful enough to lower the temperature several degrees (temperatures above 40 °C are common in the Middle East and the Mediterranean Sea).

===Trim levels===

In Romania, it was initially available with four trim levels: Ambiance, Preference, Laureate and Ambition. The basic level Ambiance featured driver airbag, body-colored bumpers, wheel trims and central locking. The second level Preference added passenger airbag, power steering, electric front windows, radio, two rear seat head restraints and remote locking. The third level Laureate added front fog lights, air conditioning, trip computer, electric mirrors, three rear seat head restraints and a multi-adjustable driver seat.[tpl]cite web|title=Echipamente|url=http://www.dacia.ro/images/Echipamente.pdf|publisher=Dacia|accessdate=23 August 2013|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050208005220/http://www.dacia.ro/images/Echipamente.pdf|archivedate=8 February 2005[/tpl] The top level Ambition also had ABS, electric rear windows, CD player and alloy wheels.

===Safety===

In June 2005, the car achieved a three-star rating at the EuroNCAP crash tests.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.euroncap.com/tests/dacia_logan_2005/221.aspx |title=Dacia Logan |publisher=Euro NCAP |accessdate=9 October 2010[/tpl] This result confirms initial expectations stated previously by Renault.
Depending on the equipment level, standard on some variants and optional on others, the facelifted Logan comes with driver, passenger and side airbags.[tpl]cite web|title=Dacia New Logan brochure|url=http://www.daciamodellen.nl/docs/ro-brochure-dacia-logan-sedan-2008-08.pdf|publisher=Dacia|accessdate=9 September 2013|date=28 August 2008[/tpl] In terms of active safety, all versions feature the latest generation Bosch 8.1 ABS, which incorporates EBD (electronic brakeforce distribution) and EBA (emergency brake assist).

The new agreement gave M&M more flexibility in engineering the car to suit the needs of the Indian consumer. The Logan was marketed with the Mahindra-Renault logo until the end of March 2011. Following the dissolution of the Indian joint venture between Renault India and M&M in 2010, Mahindra retained the rights to produce and sell the Logan under its own name of Mahindra Verito, with minor alterations to the front, but retaining Renault petrol and diesel engines.[tpl]cite web|title=Logan now renamed into Verito|url=http://indiaautoindustry.blogspot.com/2011/04/logan-now-renamed-into-verito.html|publisher=India Auto Industry|accessdate=13 January 2012|date=25 April 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Why Choose Verito|url=http://www.mahindraverito.com/why_choose_verito.html|publisher=Mahindra Verito|accessdate=26 January 2012[/tpl] On 26 July 2012, a facelifted version of the car was revealed by Mahindra in New Delhi,[tpl]cite web|title=2012 Mahindra Verito Facelift launched at Rs 5.27 lakh|url=http://www.oncars.in/Car-News-Detail/2012-Mahindra-Verito-Facelift-launched-at-Rs-5-27-lakh/2775|publisher=OnCars.in|date=26 July 2012|accessdate=5 September 2012[/tpl] and on 5 June 2013, a notchback version was launched in Mumbai, called the Verito Vibe.[tpl]cite web|title=2013 Mahindra Verito Vibe Launched At Rs 5.63 Lakh Ex-Mumbai|url=http://overdrive.in/news/2013-mahindra-verito-vibe-launched-at-rs-5-63-lakh-ex-mumbai/|publisher=Overdrive|accessdate=5 August 2013|date=5 June 2013[/tpl]

Logan production began with a 4-door sedan, followed by a wagon in September 2006. Four other models, a pick-up truck, a panel van, a related hatchback (the Sandero) and a facelifted sedan followed in 2007 and 2008. Dacia sales for 2006 were over €1.5 billion, 19.6% more than in 2005. Annual production has reached almost 250,000 cars, half for exports. As of March 2009, more than 1.3 million vehicles on the Logan platform have been sold worldwide.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId=143467#2 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090311223811/http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId=143467 |title=Renault Launches Sandero in South Africa |publisher=Edmunds.com |date=9 March 2009 |archivedate=11 March 2009 |accessdate=9 October 2010[/tpl] On 3 September 2009, it was announced that one million Dacia cars on the Logan platform X90 have been produced at the Mioveni plant: 576,887 Logans, 246,869 Logan MCVs, 144,931 Sanderos and Stepways, 19,897 Logan VANs and 11,416 Logan Pick-Ups.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.romaniantimes.at/news/Business/2009-09-03/2704/_One_million_Dacia_cars_produced_at_Mioveni_plant__ |title=One million Dacia cars produced at Mioveni plant |work=Romanian Times |accessdate=9 October 2010[/tpl]
One of the reasons for the increase in sales is the dependability of Dacia cars. In a recent survey conducted by a French magazine, Dacia cars were voted one of the safest cars in France. Another reason is their low maintenance and repair costs.

The panel van variant of the Logan was launched on 23 January 2007, in Bucharest.[tpl]cite web|title=Dacia sets out to conquer the commercial vehicle market with Logan VAN|url=http://www.daciagroup.com/en/press-releases/dacia-sets-out-to-conquer-the-commercial-vehicle-market-with-logan-van.html|publisher=Dacia Group|date=23 January 2007|accessdate=26 January 2012[/tpl] It is a small business oriented vehicle, with 2,500 litre loading space and 800 kg payload. The Logan VAN is more or less an MCV without the rear side windows and therefore has the same safety features and uses the same engines as the other models (except the 1.6 16v engine). Production of this model was stopped in August 2012. Since its launch, over 53,000 units were manufactured.[tpl]cite web|title=Productia de utilitare Dacia, mutata definitiv in Maroc|url=http://transporter.ro/s-10255-Stiri-Productia-de-utilitare-Dacia--mutata-definitiv-in-Maroc|publisher=Transporter.ro|date=20 September 2012|accessdate=29 September 2012[/tpl]
