==History of the Archive and medieval documentation==

The origin of the Archive of the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela is located in the medieval treasury and in the archival and documental organizations that were developed by archbishops Diego Gelmírez, during the first half of the 12th century, and Berenguel de Landoira, in the first half of the 14th. Since the moment of the inventio, or discovery of the apostolic building, in the 9th century, the enormous political and socioeconomic development of the new ecclesiastical institution that looked after the place made necessary the conservation, in order to justify its rights, of all kinds of documentation: royal, pontifical, ecclesiastic and civilian; a documentation integrated, together with existing books and codices, in the Treasury.
As time passed, there was conformed a documentary mass integrated by documentation in tombs, single documents, and later documents of modern and contemporary period. Was the first bishop and archbishop of the see, Diego Gelmírez, towards the first third of the 12th century, the first one that developed an archival order minimally of the set, with a selection of documentation, an organization and the copy in new supports, giving place to codex as the Tumbo A (12th-13th centuries) in his earlier phase, cartulary with the royal documentation of the 9th-13th centuries and with a miniature gallery of kings, queens and princesses of Castile-Leon. In this century is also produced the Codex Calixtinus, the medieval Jacobean history strongpoint.
Two centuries later the archbishop Berenguel of Landoira, after finish an urban revolt in Santiago, developed a second work of rearrangement, upon the same base of selection, ordainment, documentation organization and copy to new supports. Thus, were produced the Tumbo B and C, with royal documentation, pontifical, ecclesiastic and civilian.
