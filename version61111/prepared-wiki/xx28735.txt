Sorbo started his acting career in 1986 making guest appearances in several television series such as 1st & Ten, Murder She Wrote and The Commish.
In 1994, he shot to fame when he played the role of Hercules in the television film Hercules and the Amazon Women. This was the first in a series of television films that served as pilots for the TV series Hercules: The Legendary Journeys, which ran from 1995 to 1999. He also directed a few episodes of the series. At the same time, Sorbo also guest-starred as Hercules in episodes of the 1995–2001 spin-off series Xena: Warrior Princess and provided the voice of Hercules in the 1998 direct-to-video animated film Hercules and Xena - The Animated Movie: The Battle for Mount Olympus.
Other voice-over work followed, with Sorbo providing the voices of Reiko and Quan Chi in the 1997 video game Mortal Kombat 4. In between the years playing Hercules, he played his first leading film role in Kull the Conqueror (1997).
After Hercules came to an end, Sorbo played the starring role of Captain Dylan Hunt in the science-fiction drama series Andromeda from 2000 to 2005. In 2006, he played a recurring role on the final season of The O.C. and guest-starred in the sitcom Two and a Half Men. In 2007, he starred in the direct-to-video film Walking Tall: The Payback, which was a sequel to the 2004 film Walking Tall. He reprised his role in the second sequel, Walking Tall: Lone Justice which released later that year. He also starred in the Lifetime Channel film Last Chance Café, the Hallmark Channel film Avenging Angel, co-starring his real life wife Sam Jenkins and guest starred as a bounty hunter in the season-two episode "Bounty Hunters!" of the series Psych. He appeared in the 2008 spoof film Meet the Spartans, which was a box office success[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.the-numbers.com/charts/weekly/2008/20080125.php |title=Weekend Box Office Chart for January 25th, 2008 |publisher=The Numbers |date=January 25, 2008 |accessdate=October 18, 2012[/tpl] despite being universally negatively reviewed by critics.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/meet_the_spartans/ |title=Meet the Spartans |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |date= |accessdate=October 18, 2012[/tpl] He starred in the Albert Pyun directed SciFi Vampire flick Tales of the Ancient Empire.[tpl]cite web|last=Woman |first=The |url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/36619/pre-order-tales-ancient-empire-new-work-progress-screengrab |title=Pre-Order Tales of an Ancient Empire; Work-in-Progress Screengrab & Behind-the-Scenes Clip | Horror Movie, DVD, & Book Reviews, News, Interviews at Dread Central |publisher=Dreadcentral.com |date=March 26, 2010 |accessdate=October 18, 2012[/tpl]
He served as Executive Producer and star of the movie Abel's Field in 2012.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.christianactivities.com/abels-field-kevin-sorbo-and-samuel-davis |title=Abel's Field with Kevin Sorbo and Samuel Davis an Inspiring Movie – Christian Activities |publisher=christianactivities.com |date= |accessdate=February 21, 2013[/tpl]
In 2012, Sorbo appeared in an episode of "Celebrity Ghost Stories" to recount an experience he had while in Minnesota shortly after he graduated from college. He and his girlfriend claimed to have seen the ghost of the "Bride of White Rock Lake" – a woman who supposedly died on her wedding day, murdered by a former lover.
Sorbo voiced one of the main protagonists, Prometheus, in the Wii video game The Conduit.
Sorbo returned to the role of Hercules in a more sinister portrayal, in the video game God of War III released for the PlayStation 3 in March 2010.
In July 2013, Sorbo, along with his wife, Sam, provided voice over for characters in the video game Cloudberry Kingdom♙[tpl]cite web|last=Conditt |first=Jessica |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2012/10/03/kevin-sorbo-sam-sorbo-martin-olson-star-in-cloudberry-kingdom/ |title=Kevin Sorbo, Sam Sorbo, Martin Olson star in Cloudberry Kingdom |publisher=Joystiq |date=October 3, 2012 |accessdate=October 16, 2013[/tpl]
In an outtake clip from the Hercules TV series posted in 2010, Sorbo, portraying an evil Doppelgänger of his regular character, says "Wait a minute. This isn't my world. Disappointed!"[tpl]cite web  | last =  | first =  | title = Hercules – 'Disappointed'  | url = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O1hM-k3aUY | publisher =  YouTube | date =  | accessdate = 26 July 2013 [/tpl] Due to the non-sequitur sound of the line, the scene, which attracted more than three million views,[tpl]cn|date=February 2014[/tpl] was widely misinterpreted as Sorbo reading aloud the stage direction "disappointed". Sorbo explained in 2013 interview that "disappointed" did not appear in the script, but rather was him breaking character as an in-joke between him and the crew. He was referencing a scene from the film A Fish Called Wanda in which Otto (played by Kevin Kline) cracks a safe only to find it empty, and screams, "Disappointed!" at it in frustration.[tpl]cite web  | last =  | first =  | title = Kevin Sorbo explains "disappointed" Meaning – YouTube | url = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p53iqTPLt_E | publisher =  | date =  | accessdate = 26 July 2013 [/tpl]

==Personal life==

On January 5, 1998, Sorbo married actress Sam Jenkins, whom he met the previous year when she had a guest role on Hercules. They have three children: Braedon Cooper (born 2001), Shane Haaken (born 2004), and Octavia Flynn (born 2005). Sorbo is the spokesman and chair of A World Fit for Kids! (AWFFK!), a non-profit organization that trains teenagers to become mentors to younger children.
In late 1997 while on a publicity tour for Kull the Conqueror and between the fourth and fifth seasons of Hercules, the newly engaged Sorbo experienced an aneurysm in his shoulder which caused three strokes.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.cbn.com/media/player/index.aspx?s=/mp4/MW154v2_WS |title=Hercules Actor Kevin Sorbo's Miracle Healing – CBN TV – Video |publisher=Cbn.com |date= |accessdate=October 18, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/19/kevin-sorbo-true-strength-hercules_n_1017368.html | title=Kevin Sorbo's 'True Strength': 'Hercules' Star Says Strokes Were Blessings In Disguise | work=Huffington Post | date=October 19, 2011 | accessdate=April 14, 2013 | author=Gostin, Nicki[/tpl] As a result, he was weakened for the next several years, a condition kept secret from the public while he recovered. During the last two seasons of Hercules (the fifth and sixth, which aired in 1998 and 1999), Sorbo had a reduced filming schedule to accommodate his condition, and more guest stars were brought in to lighten the load.[tpl]cite web|last=Hammel |first=Sara |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20533357,00.html |title=Hercules Star Kevin Sorbo Reveals He's Had Several Strokes |publisher=People.com |date= |accessdate=October 18, 2012[/tpl] The strokes, thought to be triggered when chiropractic manipulation of his shoulder released multiple blood clots from the aneurysm, left Sorbo with a permanent 10 percent vision loss, weakness, impaired balance, and migraines.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.express.co.uk/life-style/health/304852/Kevin-Sorbo-Three-strokes-left-me-fighting-for-my-life | title=Kevin Sorbo: Three strokes left me fighting for my life | work=Daily Express | date=February 28, 2012 | accessdate=April 14, 2013 | author=Symons, Jane[/tpl] In his 2011 autobiography True Strength, Sorbo revealed the details of his injury and how his new wife Sam helped him recover.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/True-Strength-Journey-Hercules-Mortal/dp/B008PH08NO/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0?ie=UTF8&qid=1375519514&sr=8-1 |title=True Strength: My Journey from Hercules to Mere Mortal--and How Nearly Dying Saved My Life |publisher=Da Capo Press |date=October 11, 2011 |accessdate=August 3, 2013[/tpl]
