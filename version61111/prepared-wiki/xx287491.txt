[[Blame It On the Game]]

CATEGORIES: Passion (rapper) albums, 1999 albums

Blame It On the Game is the second studio album by American former rapper Passion released on March 23, 1999 through Select-O-Hits and her own label, Yo Playa Patna Records. Contrary to popular belief, Baller's Lady was not her only album. The album was mostly produced by former collaborator Kirv, and also was co-produced by Passion herself, which was a change since she only co-wrote and did styling for her first album.http://www.amazon.com/Blame-It-Game-Passion/dp/B00000IAFMhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/blame-it-on-the-game-mw0001054281http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/store/artist/album/0,,393892,00.html
