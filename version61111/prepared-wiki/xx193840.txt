[[Potentilla crantzii]]

CATEGORIES: Potentilla

Potentilla crantzii (Alpine Cinquefoil) is a flowering plant of the genus Potentilla in the family Rosaceae.
The synonym P. verna as described by Linnaeus is usually assigned to this plant in recent times. In much of the 20th century botanists tended to believe it referred to P. aurea. Yet earlier authors commonly misapplied P. verna to Spring Cinquefoil (P. neumanniana).
