The Shoe is a hamlet in the parish of North Wraxall, in the north-west of Wiltshire in England.  It is situated a few miles north of Bath, at the junction of the Fosse Way (the old Roman road running from Exeter to Lincoln) and the A420 (running from Bristol to Oxford).  The Shoe is named after the inn,  called The Horse-shoe.[tpl]cite web|title=Wiltshire Community History|url=http://history.wiltshire.gov.uk/community/getcom.php?id=172|work=Wiltshire Council|publisher=Wiltshire Council|accessdate=25 February 2013[/tpl]

The Shoe Inn, marked on the 1:25,000 Ordnance Survey map, has now become a private house, although a board for public notices and a post box are still outside; there was a public telephone box but this has now been relocated to the grounds of The Community Hall.  There is a garage, a row of cottages ("Fosse Cottages") and a few larger houses.  Just off the Fosse Way, about 400 yards north of the A420 junction, lies the new North Wraxall Village Hall, now called The Community Hall, offering a playgroup and other amenities.
