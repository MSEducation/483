[[Morpeth Dock]]

CATEGORIES: Birkenhead docks

Morpeth Dock is a dock at Birkenhead, Wirral Peninsula, England. Built between 1844 and 1847, it also included a smaller branch dock to the east. It is named after Lord Morpeth, the 7th Earl of Carlisle, who was the First Commissioner of Woods and Forests.
Originally, the dock connected directly to the River Mersey via locks, although the entrance channel has since been partially infilled and the locks removed after being disused for some years. Access to the Great Float via Egerton Dock has also been removed, making both docks effectively landlocked.[tpl]citation|title=Birkenhead Docks|first=Ian|last=Collard|publisher=Tempus Publishing|date=2007|page=73|isbn=978-0-7524-4259-4[/tpl]
Morpeth Dock was used by GWR as the Birkenhead end of cross-river traffic to the Manchester Dock.
Part of the dock and its former branch were filled in to provide a site for a water treatment plant.

==One O'Clock Gun==

Situated close to the dock and overlooking the river, the One O'Clock Gun provided a time signal to shipping on the Mersey.  It was fired electrically from Bidston Observatory for the first time on 21 September 1867 and the original cannon was a relic of the Crimean War. Due to the advent of radio and increasing maintenance costs, by 1932 it was proposed to discontinue the practice. Although this did not occur, firing was suspended during the Second World War. The tradition ceased altogether on 18 July 1969.[tpl]citation|url=http://www.pol.ac.uk/home/history/gun.html|title=The Time Ball & The One O'Clock Gun|publisher=Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory|accessdate=12 October 2007[/tpl]
A One O'Clock Gun is still fired at Edinburgh Castle.

==Bomb discovery==

Birkenhead docks, as well as the surrounding area, were heavily bombed by the Luftwaffe during the Second World War. In May 2006, a 60-year-old, 500kg (1,102lb) bomb was discovered by the Royal Navy's Northern Diving Group and disposed of by the minesweeper HMS Atherstone.[tpl]citation|url=http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/server?show=ConWebDoc.5833&outputFormat=html|title=Atherstone Sails Around Britain and Finds A Bomb!|publisher=Royal Navy|accessdate=12 October 2007[/tpl] It was found embedded in mud in the river, near to the former entrance to Morpeth Dock and may have been disturbed during dredging work at the Twelve Quays ferry terminal. The bomb was later detonated in Liverpool Bay.[tpl]citation|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/secondworldwar/story/0,,1776452,00.html|title=Bomb disrupts Mersey shipping|publisher=Guardian Unlimited|date=17 May 2006|accessdate=12 April 2007 | location=London | first=David | last=Ward[/tpl]

==Events==

Morpeth Dock is due to be transformed under plans for the London 2012 olympics art project. New York based artist Anthony McCall will create Projected Column, a slender, sinuous, spinning column of cloud rising into the sky from the surface of the water in the disused dock. The project will be produced by FACT (Foundation for Art and Creative Technology).
Extending upwards as far as the eye can see, and visible on a clear day from up to 100 km away, the column will disappear and re-appear in slow structured sequences, punctuating the skyline.
