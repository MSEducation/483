[tpl]nihongo|Quest Corporation|クエスト[/tpl] was a Japanese video game company founded in 1988. They were originally known as Bothtec, which had developed The Scheme, a Metroidvania-style open world action role-playing game featuring music by Yuzo Koshiro, that same year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/scheme/scheme.htm|author=Kurt Kalata|title=The Scheme |publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101|accessdate=2011-03-18|quote=Released in 1988 for the PC-88 by a company called Bothtec (which would later become the studio known as Quest, who eventually went on to create Ogre Battle), The Scheme is a side-scrolling action-RPG vaguely similar to Castlevania II: Simon's Quest and Metroid.[/tpl]
Quest is best known for its critically acclaimed tactical role-playing game series Ogre Battle. In 1995, key members Yasumi Matsuno, Hiroshi Minagawa, and Akihiko Yoshida left Quest to join Square,[tpl]cite web | author=IGN Staff | title=Square Completes Acquisition of Quest | publisher=www.ign.com | date= 19 June 2002 |url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/362/362710p1.html | accessdate=2006-05-20[/tpl] where they developed Final Fantasy Tactics and Vagrant Story, and have worked on Final Fantasy XII as part of Square Enix. In 2002, Quest was purchased by Square; although the purchase reunited some of Quest's developers with their former colleagues, it likely signaled the end of the Ogre Saga franchise as at Square Enix the former Quest staff continued to work on the Final Fantasy Tactics sequels Final Fantasy Tactics Advance (2003) and Final Fantasy Tactics A2 (2007) while the Ogre Saga creator Yasumi Matsuno left the company in 2005. Matsuno later reunited with his former team to help design and direct the PSP remake of Tactics Ogre on a freelance basis. It is unknown whether Matsuno will rejoin with his friends and colleagues for another title at Square-Enix.
