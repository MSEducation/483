Harry S. Truman's inaugural address, known as the Four Point Speech, was delivered by United States president Harry S. Truman, on Thursday, January 20, 1949.
In a world only recently emerged from the shadow of World War II, in which freedom and human rights seemed under threat from many sides, this was Truman's response. 
He challenged both Democrats and Republicans to assist people around the world  struggling for freedom and human rights; to continue programs for world economic recovery; to strengthen international organizations; and to draw on the expertise of the United States to help people across the world help themselves in the struggle against ignorance, illness and despair.
