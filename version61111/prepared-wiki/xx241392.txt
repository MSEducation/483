==Origins==

The 50th Law grew out of the friendship and mutual admiration between 50 Cent and Robert Greene.[tpl]cite news|last=Alder|first=Daniel|title=50 Cent's Partner In Prose|url=http://www.forbes.com/2009/07/08/fifty-cent-music-publishing-business-media-cash-kings-fifty.html|newspaper=Forbes|date=September 7, 2009[/tpl] Greene's book The 48 Laws of Power, which has long been a staple in the hip hop world, came to the attention of 50 Cent, who asked his manager to arrange a meeting. Greene said that he was surprised by 50 Cent's persona and was impressed by his "Zen-like calmness" and eye for strategy.The 50th Law. Power Seduction and War. June 11, 2009.

According to Greene, 50 Cent is an example of what Machiavelli called a New Prince, a leader who emerges in a time of chaos or turmoil and rewrites the rules. According to 50 Cent, Greene's books describe the laws and strategies used by hustlers on the street, even if they might not know the "technical terms" for what they were doing.50 Cent Presents "The 50th Law" - Book with Robert Greene.
