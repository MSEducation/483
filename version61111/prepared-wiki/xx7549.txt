Manx (native name [tpl]lang|gv|Gaelg[/tpl] or [tpl]lang|gv|Gailck[/tpl], pronounced [tpl]IPA-gv|ɡilk|[/tpl] or [tpl]IPA|ɡilɡ[/tpl]Jackson 1955, 49), also known as Manx Gaelic, and as the Manks language,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/dictionaryofmank00creg/dictionaryofmank00creg_djvu.txt |title=Full text of "A dictionary of the Manks language, with the corresponding words or explanations in English : interspersed with many Gaelic proverbs, the parts of speech, the genders, and the accents of the Manks words are carefully marked : with some etymological observations, never before published" |publisher=Archive.org |accessdate=2013-11-15[/tpl] is a Goidelic language of the Indo-European language family, historically spoken by the Manx people. Only a small minority of the Isle of Man's population is fluent in the language, but a larger minority has some knowledge of it. It is widely considered to be an important part of the island's culture and heritage. Although the last native speaker, Ned Maddrell, died in 1974, the language has never fallen completely out of use. However in recent years the language has been the subject of revival efforts, so that despite the small number of speakers, the language has become more visible on the island, with increased signage and radio broadcasts. The revival of Manx has been aided by the fact that the language was well recorded; for example, the Bible was translated into Manx, and a number of audio recordings were made of native speakers.

==Names of the language==

===Manx===

In Manx the language is called Gaelg or Gailck, a word which shares the same etymological root as the English word "Gaelic". The sister languages of Irish and Scottish Gaelic, use Gaeilge and Gàidhlig respectively for their languages. The form with the definite article is frequently used in Manx, e.g. y Ghaelg or y Ghailck.
To distinguish it from the other two forms of Gaelic, the phrases Gaelg/Gailck Vannin (Gaelic of Mann) and Gaelg/Gailck Vanninnagh (Manx Gaelic) may also be used.
In addition, the nickname "Çhengey ny Mayrey" (the mother tongue/tongue of the mother) is occasionally used.

===English===

The language is usually referred to in English as Manx. The term Manx Gaelic is also often used, for example when discussing the relationship between the three Goidelic languages (Irish, Scottish Gaelic, and Manx) or to avoid confusion with Anglo-Manx, the form of English as spoken in the Island. Scottish Gaelic is often referred to in English as simply Gaelic, but this is less common with Manx and Irish.
A calque in Anglo-Manx is use of the definite article in Anglo-Manx e.g. the Manx, the Gaelic, in ways not generally seen in standard English.
The word Manx is frequently spelled as Manks in historical sources, particularly those written by natives of the island; the word means Mannish, and originates from the Norse Mannisk. The name of the island, Man, is frequently spelled as Mann.  It is sometimes accompanied by a footnote explaining that it is a two-syllable word, with the stress on the first syllable, "MAN-en". It comes from the name of the Celtic god "Manannán mac Lir".

==History==

Manx is a Goidelic language, closely related to Irish and Scottish Gaelic.  On the whole it is not mutually intelligible with these, though the speakers of the three languages find it easy to gain passive competency in each other's languages and even spoken competency.
Like Scottish Gaelic and modern Irish, Manx is derived from older forms of Irish. The earliest known language of the Isle of Man was a form of Brythonic.
Manx is descended from Primitive Irish, which is first attested in Ogham inscriptions from the 4th century AD. These writings have been found throughout Ireland and the west coast of Great Britain. Primitive Irish transitioned into Old Irish through the 5th century. Old Irish, dating from the 6th century, used the Latin script and is attested primarily in marginalia to Latin manuscripts, but there are no extant examples from the Isle of Man. By the 10th century Old Irish had evolved into Middle Irish, which was spoken throughout Ireland, in Scotland and the Isle of Man. Like the coastal areas of Scotland and Ireland, the Isle of Man was colonised by the Norse, who left their legacy in certain loanwords, personal names, and placenames such as Laxey (Laksaa) and Ramsey (Rhumsaa).
During the later Middle Ages, the Isle of Man fell increasingly under the influence of England, and from then on the English language has been the chief external factor in the development of Manx. Manx began to diverge from Early Modern Irish in around the 13th century and from Scottish Gaelic in the 15th.Broderick 1993, 228 The language sharply declined during the 19th century and was supplanted by English.
Manx-language books were not printed until the beginning of the 18th century, and there was no Manx–English dictionary until the 19th century. Except for a few ballads composed in the 16th century and some religious literature, there is no pre-20th century literature in the Manx language. The Manx were to all intents and purposes an oral society, with all folklore, history, interpersonal business and the like passed on by word of mouth.[tpl]Harvcolnb|Cumming|1848|pp=315–316[/tpl] Appendix M
In 1848, J. G. Cumming wrote that, "there are ... few persons (perhaps none of the young) who speak no English," and Henry Jenner estimated in 1874 that about 30% of the population habitually spoke Manx (12,340 out of a population of 41,084). According to official census figures, 9.1% of the population claimed to speak Manx in 1901; in 1921 the percentage was only 1.1%.Gunther 1990, 59–60 Since the language had fallen to a status of low prestige, parents tended not to teach the language to their children, thinking that Manx would be useless to them compared with English.
Following the decline in the use of Manx during the 19th century, [tpl]lang|gv|Yn Cheshaght Ghailckagh[/tpl] (The Manx Language Society) was founded in 1899. By the middle of the 20th century only a few elderly native speakers remained (the last of them, Ned Maddrell, died on 27 December 1974), but by then a scholarly revival had begun to spread and many people had learned Manx as a second language. The revival of Manx has been aided by the recording work done in the 20th century by researchers. Most notably, the Irish Folklore Commission was sent in with recording equipment in 1948 by Éamon de Valera. There is also the work conducted by language enthusiast and fluent speaker Brian Stowell, who is considered personally responsible for the current revival of the Manx language.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2008[/tpl]
In the 2011 census, 1,823 out of 80,398, or 2.27% of the population, claimed to have knowledge of Manx.Isle of Man Census Report 2011. Retrieved 2012-10-19. This is an increase of 134 people, from the 2001 census.Manx Gaelic revival 'impressive'. Retrieved 2008-11-30. The largest concentration of speakers was in Douglas, with 566 people professing an ability to speak, read or write in Manx. Peel had the second largest number of speakers, with 179 people professing an ability to speak, read or write in Manx. Other large concentrations included Onchan (146), and Ramsey (149).
Manx given names are once again becoming common on the Isle of Man, especially Moirrey and Voirrey (Mary, properly pronounced similar to the Scottish Moira, but often mispronounced as Moiree/Voiree when used as a given name by non-Manx speakers), Illiam (William), Orry (from the Manx King of Norse origin), Breeshey (also Breesha) (Bridget), Aalish (also Ealish)
(Alice), Juan (Jack), Ean (John), Joney,
Fenella (Fionnuala), Pherick (Patrick) and Freya (from the Norse Goddess) remain popular.

==Literature==

Because Manx has never had a large user base, it has never been practical to produce large amounts of written literature. A body of oral literature, on the other hand, did exist. It is known that the "Fianna" tales and the like were known, with the Manx ballad Fin as Oshin commemorating Finn MacCool and Ossian.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/fulltext/mb1896/p002.htm |title=pp2/5 Manx Ballads - Fin as Oshin |publisher=Isle-of-man.com |accessdate=2013-11-15[/tpl] With the coming of Protestantism, this slowly disappeared, while a tradition of carvals, religious songs or carols, developed with religious sanction[tpl]When|date=February 2009[/tpl].
As far as is known, there was no distinctively Manx written literature before the Reformation, and by this time any presumed literary link with Ireland and Scotland, such as through Irish-trained priests, had been lost. The first published literature in Manx was the Book of Common Prayer, translated by John Phillips, the Welsh-born Bishop of Sodor and Man (1605–33). The early Manx script does have some similarities with orthographical systems found occasionally in Scotland and in Ireland for the transliteration of Gaelic, such as the Book of the Dean of Lismore, as well as in some cases extensive texts based on English and Scottish English orthographical practices of the time.  Little secular Manx literature has been preserved.
When the Anglican church authorities commenced the production of written literature in the language in the 18th century, the system developed by John Philips was further "anglicized", the one Welsh-retention being the use of [tpl]angle bracket|y[/tpl] to represent schwa (e.g. [tpl]lang|gv|cabbyl[/tpl] [tpl]IPA|kaːβəl[/tpl] "horse" and [tpl]lang|gv|cooney[/tpl] [tpl]IPA|kuːnə[/tpl] "help" as well as [tpl]IPA|/ɪ/[/tpl] (e.g. [tpl]lang|gv|fys[/tpl] [tpl]IPA|fɪz[/tpl] “knowledge”), though it is also used to represent [tpl]IPA|j[/tpl], as in English (e.g. [tpl]lang|gv|y Yuan[/tpl] [tpl]IPA|juːan[/tpl] "John" (vocative), [tpl]lang|gv|yeeast[/tpl] [tpl]IPA|jiːəst[/tpl] "fish").
Later pieces included short stories and poetry. Translations also occurred, notably of Paradise Lost in 1796.
In 2006, the first full length novel in Manx, Dunveryssyn yn Tooder-Folley (The Vampire Murders) was published by Brian Stowell, after being serialised in the press.

===The Railway Series===

Although the books of The Railway Series by the Reverend W. Awdry were written in English, Manx had a significant influence on the world in which they were set. Thomas the Tank Engine and his fellow locomotive characters live on the fictional Island of Sodor, which is to the east of the Isle of Man, but at the same time loosely based on it. It has its own language, "Sudric", which "is fast dying out and is akin to Manx and Gaelic"[tpl]cite web|title=The History of Sodor and its Railways|publisher=The Real Lives of Thomas the Tank Engine|url=http://www.pegnsean.net/~railwayseries/history.htm|accessdate=12 January 2011[/tpl] – but the difference between Manx and Sudric is not enough to prevent the two communities understanding one another.[ref]

A lot of the names are clearly based on Manx forms, but often the nouns are inverted to match English word order. Some of the locations have quasi-Manx names, e.g. Killdane, which comes from "Keeill-y-Deighan" (Church of the Devil),[ref]
