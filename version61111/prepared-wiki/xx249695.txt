Avogadrite ((K,Cs)BF4) is a potassium-caesium tetrafluoroborate. Avogadrite crystallizes in the orthorhombic system (space group Pnma) with cell parameters a 8.66 Å, b 5.48 Å and c Å 7.03. The mineral is only found as a sublimation product around volcanic fumaroles.

==History==

The mineral was discovered by the Italian mineralogist Ferruccio Zambonini
in 1926. He analyzed several samples from the volcanic fumaroles close to Mount Vesuvius and from the Lipari islands. He named it after the Italian scientist Amedeo Avogadro (1776–1856).[tpl]cite journal | first = Ferruccio | last = Zambonini | title =  Sulla presenza, tra i prodotti dell' attuale attivita del Vesuvio, di una varietá cesifera del fluoborato di potassio, (On the presence, among the products of Vesuvius, of a caesium-bearing variety of potassium fluoborate), Rend.
