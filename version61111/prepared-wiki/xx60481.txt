La Union ([tpl]lang-ilo|Probincia iti La Union[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-tgl|Probinsya ng La Union[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-pag|Luyag na La Union[/tpl]), is a province of the Philippines located in the Ilocos Region (Region I) on Luzon Island. The province is bordered by Ilocos Sur to the north, Benguet to the east, Pangasinan to the south, and to the west by the shores of the South China Sea. The provincial capital is San Fernando City.

==History==

La Unión, "The Union" in Spanish, was formed in 1850 when the Spanish colonial government of Governor-General Antonio Maria Blanco merged the three southern towns of Ilocos Sur province, the nine northern towns of Pangasinan, and the western towns of Benguet to the east (Eastern Pais del Igorotes in the Cordilleras). Pangasinenses were the majority in the new province because most towns had been in the Province of Pangasinan.
On October 29, 1849, Governor General Claveria issued a "promovido" to fuse the Pangasinan-Ilokos-Cordillera areas  into "La Union".  On March 2, 1850, Governor General Antonio Maria Blanco signed the Superior Decreto of La Union  (34th province from Cebu-1565), with Captain Toribio Ruiz de la Escalera as the first Gobernador Military y Politico.  Isabella II of Spain decreed the province's creation on April 18, 1854.  In 1661, Andres Malong (Pangasinan) failed to recover La Union from the Spaniards after the Battle of Agoo.La Union Profile: La Union History - Province of La Union :: Official Website
In 1896, the people of La Union began a revolt against the Spanish, who had called La Union “Una Provincia Modelo", ed by Manuel Tinio Y Bondoc under Emilio Aguinaldo. The Americans collaborated with the Filipinos to end the Spanish.
Dr. Lucino Almeida became the Presidente Provincial of the American regime, followed by the election of La Union’s first Civil Governor in 1901, Don Joaquin Joaquino Ortega, Grandfather of Governor Manuel C.
