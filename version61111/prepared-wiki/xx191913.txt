==History==

The SBIOA Educational Trust one of the best schools in Tamil Nadu was founded in 1978 by Mr. E.A.G. Moses who was the General Secretary of the State Bank of India Officers Association (Chennai Circle). The SBOA School & Junior College affiliated to the CBSE board was then started for the benefit of the Bank's officers' children. In 1983, the SBIOA Educational Trust started a new school providing education in the Matriculation board syllabus also, on the same campus as the SBOA CBSE - and called it the SBOA Matriculation and Higher Secondary School.ShickShack.com - Information page

As the demands for education in Anna Nagar grew, along with the strength of the SBOA Matric school, a separate campus was required and hence the school was moved to its current location in 1994. The SBOA Matric is now functioning independently in a campus of its own right, away from the SBOA CBSE school. Later, the SBOA Matric procured and acquired the then defunct Sri Chakra School nearby and developed it in another campus.
