α-Methyltryptamine (αMT, AMT, Indopan) is a psychedelic, stimulant, and entactogen drug of the tryptamine class.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/tihkal/tihkal48.shtml | title = Erowid Online Books : "TIHKAL" - #48 a-MT | work = | accessdate = [/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/amt/amt.shtml | title = Erowid AMT (alpha-methyltryptamine) Vault | work = | accessdate = [/tpl] It was originally developed as an antidepressant by workers at Upjohn in the 1960s.

==Chemistry==

αMT is tryptamine with a methyl substituent at the alpha carbon. Its chemical relation to tryptamine is analogous to that of amphetamine to phenethylamine, amphetamine being α-methylphenethylamine. αMT is closely related to the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) which partially explains its mechanism of action.

==Pharmacology==

αMT acts as a relatively balanced reuptake inhibitor and releasing agent of the main three monoamines; serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine,[tpl]cite journal | author = Nagai F, Nonaka R, Satoh Hisashi Kamimura K | title = The effects of non-medically used psychoactive drugs on monoamine neurotransmission in rat brain | journal = European Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 559 | issue = 2-3 | pages = 132–7 |date=March 2007 | pmid = 17223101 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejphar.2006.11.075 | url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0014-2999(06)01381-1[/tpl] and as a non-selective serotonin receptor agonist.[tpl]cite journal | author = Nonaka R, Nagai F, Ogata A, Satoh K | title = In vitro screening of psychoactive drugs by (35)SGTPgammaS binding in rat brain membranes | journal = Biological & Pharmaceutical Bulletin | volume = 30 | issue = 12 | pages = 2328–33 |date=December 2007 | pmid = 18057721 | doi = 10.1248/bpb.30.2328| url = http://joi.jlc.jst.go.jp/JST.JSTAGE/bpb/30.2328?from=PubMed[/tpl]

===MAOI activity===

αMT has been shown as a reversible inhibitor of the enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO) in-vitro[tpl]cite doi|10.1254/jjp.41.191[/tpl] and in-vivo.[tpl]cite pmid|13851725[/tpl]
In rats the potency of αMT as an MAO-A inhibitor in the brain was approximately equal to that of harmaline at equimolar doses.[tpl]refn|group=note|MAOI potency was comparable at 7 µM/kg, equivalent to 1.5mg/kg of Harmaline and 1.2mg/kg of αMT. At 70µM/kg αMT was a much less effective MAOI than harmaline.[tpl]cite pmid|13898151[/tpl][/tpl] Dexamphetamine did not enhance the 5-hydroxytryptophan-induced rise of serotonin at any level.
A typical dose of harmaline for MAO inhibition is 150 mg,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/tihkal/tihkal13.shtml |title=Shulgin, A (1997) TIHKAL |publisher=Erowid.org |accessdate=2013-10-16[/tpl]  higher than any typical αMT dose[tpl]cite web | url = https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/amt/amt_dose.shtml | title = AMT Dosage | accessdate = 2013-10-16 | date = 2011-02-02 | publisher = Erowid[/tpl] so αMT's MAOI activity at typical doses will be significant but not total. The danger rises exponentially as αMT doses approach 150 mg due to increased monoamine release and increased MAO inhibition.

==Metabolism==

2-Oxo-AMT, 6-hydroxy-AMT,[tpl]cite DOI|10.1007/BF02171429[/tpl] 7-hydroxy-αMT and 1′-hydroxy-αMT were detected as metabolites of αMT in male Wistar rats.[tpl]cite doi|10.1080/00498250802491654[/tpl]

==Dosage and effects==

With 20–30 milligrams, euphoria, empathy, and psychedelic effects become apparent and can last as long as 12 hours.[tpl]cite doi|10.1080/02791072.2012.704592[/tpl] A dose exceeding 40 mg is generally considered as strong. In rare cases or extreme doses the duration of effects might exceed 24 hours. αMT in freebase form is reported by users to have been smoked, with doses of between and 2–5 milligrams being cited.
Reported side effects include anxiety, restlessness, muscle tension, jaw tightness, pupil dilation, tachycardia, headaches, nausea, and vomiting, among other effects that might commonly be attributed to LSD, psilocybin, DMT and MDMA, such as delusions and hallucinations.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/amt/amt_effects.shtml | title = Erowid AMT Vault : Effects | work = | accessdate = [/tpl]
In spite of some reported experiential similarities to MDMA, the chemicals are structurally unrelated; αMT is a tryptamine while MDMA is a phenethylamine.
Like many other serotonin releasing agents, αMT's analogue αET has been shown to produce long-lasting serotonergic neurotoxicity at very high doses.[tpl]cite journal | author = Huang XM, Johnson MP, Nichols DE | title = Reduction in brain serotonin markers by alpha-ethyltryptamine (Monase) | journal = European Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 200 | issue = 1 | pages = 187–90 |date=July 1991 | pmid = 1722753 | doi = 10.1016/0014-2999(91)90686-K| url = [/tpl] It is possible that αMT could cause the same neurotoxicity.

==Legality==

===Australia===

The 5-Methoxy analogue, 5-MeO-αMT is schedule 9 in Australia and αMT would be controlled as an analogue of this.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/5meo_amt/5meo_amt_law.shtml | title = Erowid 5-MeO-AMT Vault : Legal Status | work = | accessdate = [/tpl]

===Sweden===

Sveriges riksdags health ministry Statens folkhälsoinstitut classified αMT as "health hazard" under the act Lagen om förbud mot vissa hälsofarliga varor (translated Act on the Prohibition of Certain Goods Dangerous to Health) as of Mar 1, 2005,  in their regulation SFS 2005:26 listed as alfa-metyltryptamin (AMT), making it illegal to sell or possess.[tpl]citation | contribution = Förordning om ändring i förordningen (1999:58) om förbud mot vissa hälsofarliga varor; | title = Lagen om förbud mot vissa hälsofarliga varor - SFS 2005:26 | format = pdf | date = February 2005| id = | contribution-url = http://www.notisum.se/rnp/sls/sfs/20050026.pdf | accessdate = 2013-10-07| language = Swedish[/tpl]

===UK===

It is legal in the United Kingdom, however, and does not fall under the tryptamine clause as its substituent is not on the nitrogen position. See "2001 Misuse of Drugs Act: Schedule 1, Regulation 3"2001 Misuse of Drugs Act for more information. Similarly, Canada has no mention of this substance in the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.[tpl]cite web | url = http://isomerdesign.com/Cdsa/schedule.php?structure=C | title = CSDA | work = | accessdate = [/tpl]

===USA===

The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) placed αMT temporarily in schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) on April 4, 2003, pursuant to the temporary scheduling provisions of the CSA (68 FR16427). On September 29, 2004, αMT was permanently controlled as a schedule I substance under the CSA (69FR 58050).[tpl]cite news | title = ALPHA-METHYLTRYPTAMINE | date = April 2013 | url = http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drug_chem_info/amt.pdf | work = DEA Office of Diversion Control | accessdate = 2013-10-10 | archiveurl = http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drug_chem_info/amt.pdf|archivedate=2013-10-01[/tpl]

==Reported Deaths==

Deaths from αMT are rare but as a powerful monoamine releaser injury can occur when excessive doses are taken or when taken with drugs such as MAOIs.[tpl]cite doi| 10.1093/bja/aei210[/tpl] "drugs such as MDMA, ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine), if combined with MAOIs (including moclobemide) do also cause fatalities because they act as serotonin releasers" Most fatalities are not verified but those which are involve excessive doses[tpl]cite journal|last=Boland|first=Diane M.|coauthors=Andollo W, Hime GW, Hearn WL|title=Fatality Due to Acute Alpha-methyltryptamine Intoxication|journal=Journal of Analytical Toxicology|date=July–August 2005|volume=29|pages=394–397|url=http://jat.oxfordjournals.org/content/29/5/394.full.pdf|accessdate=October 1, 2013|doi=10.1093/jat/29.5.394[/tpl] or coingestion with other drugs.[tpl]cite news|title=Call for ban on drug after reveller's death|url=http://www.thisissomerset.co.uk/Torch-carriers-miles-home/story-15588409-detail/story.html#axzz2glqAXLdX|accessdate=October 1, 2013|newspaper=Western Gazette|date=March 22, 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6KPbybynr|archivedate=2013-10-16[/tpl] A British teenager died after consuming 1 g of αMT in August 2013.[tpl]cite news | title = Southampton 'legal high' death deemed 'accidental' | date = 2013-11-12 | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-24915409 | work = BBC News | accessdate = 2013-11-19[/tpl]
