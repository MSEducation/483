Parr Reservoir or Parr Shoals Reservoir is an impoundment of the Broad River in Peak, South Carolina.  It is the last dam on the Broad River before the river reaches Columbia, South Carolina and the Columbia Canal. The lake is mainly used as a holding pond of sorts, as the water is pulled in and out and used to cool the turbines of a nearby nuclear power plant. Some anglers will fish for catfish in the main river channel, while bass fishing is mainly held back to Heller's and Cannon creeks, as well as the tailrace below Lake Monticello. Because of fluctuating water levels, and millions of submerged trees lurking underneath the shallow water, it is an extremely dangerous body of water to fish.[tpl]cn|date=June 2012[/tpl]
