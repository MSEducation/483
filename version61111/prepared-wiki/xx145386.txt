Parioglossus galzini is a species of dartfish presently known only from the island of Rapa Iti, French Polynesia.
This tiny fish (up to [tpl]convert|2.3|cm|in[/tpl] SL) is found on substrates of mud and rubble in shallow inshore waters of less than [tpl]convert|1.5|m|ft[/tpl] in depth. It can be distinguished from its congeners in several ways, most notably by the complete absence of a dark lateral stripe and the presence of a membrane linking the two dorsal fins in both sexes.[tpl]FishBase species |genus= Parioglossus|species= galzini| month = December | year = 2013[/tpl]
