Marudhanayagam is a long-delayed high budget Indian Tamil film directed and produced by Kamal Haasan. The film, which started in October 1997 with an exclusive launch by Queen Elizabeth II, originally pulled together several prominent names across Indian cinema as its principal cast and crew. However since the launch, the film despite rumours of resurfacing, is yet to resume its shoot.

===Development===

Kamal Haasan had been pondering directing a historical film for a period of four to five years and unsuccessfully contemplated doing a historical musical on the lines of Ambikapathy, with the idea of making a film which had only verses for dialogue. Writer Sujatha then suggested Kamal Haasan looked at a folk ballad edited by Tamil scholar Vanamamalai, which introduced them to the historical figure of Muhammed Yusuf Khan, an 18th-century warrior.[tpl]cite web|author=Sudhakar |url=http://www.oocities.org/sujathapage/english/einterview1.html |title=Interview with Sujatha |publisher=Oocities.org |date=1998-05-17 |accessdate=2011-09-21[/tpl] Kamal Haasan immediately agreed at the prospect and felt that the story had all the potential of a good historical film, being appealed to by the elevation from the nadir to the top of Khan's life. Sujatha revealed that nearly 80% of the film would faithfully adapt Samuel Charles Hill's biography of Khan also known as Marudha Nayagam, and to only use imagination where no solid or substantial information is available such as his conversion to Islam. The team in 1998, for the first time in India, planned to use a computer for screenplay writing, using a particular software called the Movie Magic Screenwriter with Sujatha working as a screenplay doctor. French screenwriter Jean-Claude Carrière was also involved in readying the screenplay for the film, as was historian S. Muthiah and poets Puviarasu and Gnanakoothan.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/009200906201340.htm |title=The Hindu News Update Service |publisher=Hindu.com |date=2009-06-20 |accessdate=2011-09-21[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/group/soc.culture.indian.kerala/browse_thread/thread/18ccf192b8169b37/469d3c533bbbd947?pli=1 |title=Kamal's New Project & Obsession ! - soc.culture.indian.kerala | Google Groups |publisher=Groups.google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-21[/tpl]
The producers and Kamal Haasan managed to rope in Queen Elizabeth II to appear as the chief guest at the launch of the project which took place in the MGR Film City on October 16, 1997.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cscsarchive.org:8081/MediaArchive/art.nsf/(docid)/99CA44DC65DFBC7465256941001E4BCD |title=Dose of Indian culture leaves Queen shoeless, speechless - The Times of India |publisher=Cscsarchive.org:8081 |date=1997-10-17 |accessdate=2011-09-21[/tpl] The Queen had spent 20 minutes on the sets of the film, with Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi, politicians S. Jaipal Reddy and G. K. Moopanar, maverick journalist Cho Ramaswamy and veteran actors Sivaji Ganesan and Amrish Puri also in attendance. A teaser was shown at the launch, with a pilot video consisting of a battle scene which would feature for a few minutes in the film, with the production of the particular scene costing Kamal Hassan [tpl]Indian Rupee[/tpl] 1.5 crores alone. In November 1997, it was reported that the film would cost between [tpl]Indian Rupee[/tpl] 60 crores and  [tpl]Indian Rupee[/tpl] 85 crores to make and would subsequently become the most expensive Indian film production till then[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.screenindia.com/old/dec19/cover.htm |title=Cover story |publisher=Screenindia.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-21[/tpl] The music for the trailer of the film was composed by Karthik Raja in late 1997, when Kamal Haasan and he were working together in Kaathala Kaathala.[tpl]cite web|url=http://members.tripod.com/s_jagadish/kamal/maruda.html |title=Marudanayagam |publisher=Members.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-21[/tpl]

===Casting===

The original cast included Vishnuvardhan who played Wajid Khan with Nassar, Om Puri, Amrish Puri also given pivotal roles. Om Puri pulled out of the film in mid-1998 due to prior commitments and Sathyaraj replaced him in the film. When the film was postponed, the team were still waiting to hear back from actors Amitabh Bachchan and Rajinikanth who were approached to play guest roles. Kate Winslet was offered the lead female role of Marsha, but her rejection led to the makers casting a French debutant. Actor Pasupathy, who has since gone on to appear in successful films, was set to make his debut with the film in the role of an antagonist and had shot for five days.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/fr/2004/05/07/stories/2004050701420100.htm |title=The `Virumaandi' villain makes a mark |publisher=The Hindu |date=2004-05-07 |accessdate=2011-09-21[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/12/29/stories/2006122908280200.htm |title=Tamil Nadu / Tiruchi News : I want challenges in life too: Actor Pasupathy |publisher=The Hindu |date=2006-12-29 |accessdate=2011-09-21[/tpl] Furthermore, actor-director R.

The technical team included costume designer Sarika, Kamal Haasan's wife at the time of production, who made a trip to several world museums to get details about the costumes of the British during the 18th century. The make-up duties for the film were shared between Michael Westmore and his apprentice Barry Cooper, with the pair training several Indian make-up artistes during the film's pre-production stages.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.indolink.com/tamil/cinema/Specials/97/Oct/marud/marud.htm |title=Marudanayagam-Scoop! |publisher=Indolink.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-21[/tpl] The graphics of the film were controlled by Pentafour, whose work had been critically acclaimed in Shankar's Jeans.http://www.insight.religaretechnova.com/Insight/DigitalDocs/Stamped/AR1998%20Stamped/AR00L20.PDF Sabu Cyril was appointed head of art direction with Prabhakaran being one of his assistants, while television director Sundar K.

===Filming===

The launch also saw the inaugural shot canned with Kamal Haasan, in the persona of Marudhanayagam, hearing and reacting to an imperial announcement read out by the character played by Nassar, with Om Puri's character looking on.  For the test shoot in Jaipur, Sarika arranged up to 7,000 costumes and accessories to be ready. Official filming began several months later in Velangudi on August 10, 1998 with a scene of where a companion of the lead character, played by Kamal Haasan, is hanged prompting a brief altercation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.indolink.com/tamil/cinema/News/98/October/pnews_11159.html |title=Marudhanayagam Update! |publisher=Indolink.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-21[/tpl]
The film ran into production trouble in November 1998, when a sector of the Tamil community alleged that the film would contain historical misinterpretations of one of the community's historical icons.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/1998/nov/10ss.htm |title=Rediff On The NeT, Movies: Gossip from the southern film industry |publisher=Rediff.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-21[/tpl] Furthermore, another section argued that the film is a distortion of history and that the central character would be portrayed as a hero of the struggle against the British instead of the traitor they felt he was. The allegations prompted Kamal Haasan to abandon extensive sets erected in Karaikudi, in interior Tamil Nadu, and shift to Chalakudy, in Kerala, to continue work on the project.

===Delay===

However production works suddenly ceased after a British company that had planned to co-produce the film backed out and the film has been indefinitely postponed since.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/009200811121860.htm |title=The Hindu News Update Service |publisher=Hindu.com |date=2008-11-12 |accessdate=2011-09-21[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.behindwoods.com/tamil-movie-news-1/jan-10-01/kamal-marudhanayagam-05-01-10.html |title=Kamal on Marudanayagam release - Tamil Movie News - Kamal Haasan | Marudanayagam | Udayanidhi Stalin | KS Ravikumar |publisher=Behindwoods.com |date=2010-01-05 |accessdate=2011-09-21[/tpl] Kamal Haasan had invested [tpl]Indian Rupee[/tpl] 8 crores of his own wealth into the project through and has since revealed that the film would be revived at a future date.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2004/09/13/stories/2004091301120100.htm |title=Kamal, a phenomenon |publisher=The Hindu |date=2004-09-13 |accessdate=2011-09-21[/tpl] In a turn of events, Kamal Haasan announced in November 1999 that shooting will resume in six months after contracts of the technicians and actors were sorted, adding that a French version of the film will also be released.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cscsarchive.org:8081/MediaArchive/art.nsf/(docid)/EBED2E9B65F6A81F65256940004B7BC3 |title=Kamal Hassan may restart work on Marudhanayagam |publisher=Cscsarchive.org:8081 |date=2004-06-20 |accessdate=2011-09-21[/tpl]

The delay of the film has been subject to references in media and film. In Venkat Prabhu's Saroja, the character played by Premji Amaren supposedly stumbles upon a DVD of Marudhanayagam, while in Rajesh's Siva Manasula Sakthi, Santhanam mockingly asks for a song from the shelved film to be played on the radio. Director Vijay revealed that Marudhanayagam was the inspiration behind his successful 2009 film, Madrasapattinam, based on India's Independence movement in 1947.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/tamil/article/55894.html |title=Marudhanayagam inspired Madharasapattinam - Tamil Movie News |publisher=IndiaGlitz |date= |accessdate=2011-09-21[/tpl]
