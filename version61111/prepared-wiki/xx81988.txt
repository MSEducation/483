Julia Eileen Gillard (born 29 September 1961) is a former Australian politician who served as the 27th Prime Minister of Australia, and the Australian Labor Party leader from 2010 to 2013. She was the first woman to hold either position.
Gillard was born in Barry, Wales, and migrated with her family to Adelaide, South Australia, in 1966, attending Mitcham Demonstration School and Unley High School. In 1982, she moved to Melbourne, Victoria. She graduated from the University of Melbourne with a Bachelor of Arts and a Bachelor of Laws in 1986. In 1987, Gillard joined the law firm Slater & Gordon, specialising in industrial law, before entering politics.[tpl]cite web |title=The Hon Julia Gillard MP, Member for Lalor (Vic)|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Senators_and_Members/Parliamentarian?MPID=83L |publisher=Australian House of Representatives |accessdate=24 June 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=The Other Biography: Jacqueline Kent's "The Making of Julia Gillard" by Christine Wallace |work=The Monthly |publisher=Schwartz Publishing |date=October 2009 |url=http://www.themonthly.com.au/books-christine-wallace-other-biography-jacqueline-kent039s-quotthe-making-julia-gillardquot-2015?page=0%2C0 |accessdate=19 October 2009[/tpl]
Gillard was first elected to the House of Representatives at the 1998 federal election for the seat of Lalor. Following the 2001 federal election, she was elected to the Shadow Cabinet and was given the portfolio of Population and Immigration. In 2003, she took on responsibility for both Reconciliation and Indigenous Affairs and Health. In December 2006, when Kevin Rudd was elected as Labor Leader and became Leader of the Opposition, Gillard was elected unopposed as his deputy.
Gillard became the first female Deputy Prime Minister of Australia upon Labor's victory in the 2007 federal election, also serving as Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion. On [tpl]Nowrap|24 June 2010[/tpl], after Rudd lost the support of his party and resigned, Gillard was elected unopposed as the Leader of the Labor Party, thus becoming the 27th Prime Minister of Australia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2010/s2935655.htm|last1=Curtis|first1=L.|last2=Hall|first2=E.|title=Gillard becomes first female PM |work=ABC News |date=24 June 2010 |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=13 October 2010[/tpl] The subsequent 2010 federal election saw the first hung parliament since the 1940 federal election.

==Early life and career==

Gillard was born on 29 September 1961, in Barry, Wales. After she suffered from bronchopneumonia as a child, her parents were advised it would aid her recovery if they were to live in a warmer climate. This led the family to migrate to Australia in 1966, settling in Adelaide.[tpl]cite episode|title=Julia Gillard in Person|series=Counterpoint|serieslink=Counterpoint (Radio National)|network=Radio National|airdate=20 September 2004|transcript=yes|transcripturl=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/counterpoint/stories/2004/1203667.htm[/tpl] In 1974, eight years after they arrived, Gillard and her family became Australian citizens. As a result Gillard held dual Australian/British citizenship until she renounced her British citizenship prior to entering Parliament in 1998.[tpl]Wayback|df=yes|url=http://www.pm.gov.au/your-pm|title=Prime Minister Julia Gillard|date=20110624003839[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/profile/julia-gillard/|title=Julia Gillard|publisher=Forbes.com LLC|accessdate=23 December 2012[/tpl] Gillard's mother, Moira Gillard (née Mackenzie), currently lives in Pasadena, South Australia.

In 1987, Gillard joined the law firm Slater & Gordon at Werribee, Melbourne, working in industrial law. In 1990, at the age of 29, she was admitted as a partner. Gillard took leave of absence in September 1995 to campaign for a Senate seat and resigned in May 1996, to work as chief of staff to Victorian opposition leader John Brumby.[tpl]cite web|url=http://afr.com/p/national/abbott_presses_gillard_over_union_3tBHaCU0dupjJb9JUPxBFJ |title=Abbott presses Gillard over union corruption role |publisher=Afr.com |date= |accessdate=16 June 2013[/tpl] According to The Australian newspaper, Gillard's departure occurred "amid fractured relationships between partners at Slater & Gordon" partly attributable to the AWU affair.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/julia-gillard-declares-file-closed-on-union-scandal-allegations/story-fn59niix-1226457045231 |title=Julia Gillard declares file closed on union scandal allegations |publisher=The Australian |date= 24 August 2012|accessdate=28 June 2013[/tpl]

==Politics==

Introduced to politics in her second year at the University of Adelaide by the daughter of a State Labor Minister, Gillard joined the Labor Club and became involved in a campaign to fight federal education budget cuts.
After moving to Melbourne, in 1983 Gillard became the second woman to lead the Australian Union of Students. She was also formerly the secretary of the left-wing organisation, Socialist Forum.[tpl]cite news |first=Lincoln |last=Wright |title=Will Julia Gillard's past cause red faces? |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/national/will-julias-past-cause-red-faces/story-e6frf7l6-1111114587478 |newspaper=Herald Sun |publisher=News Limited |date=7 August 2007 |accessdate=23 June 2010[/tpl]
In 1995, Gillard took leave from her legal firm to contest the 1996 federal election as a Senate candidate, standing third on the ALP's ticket, although she was unsuccessful.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/no-contradiction-on-julia-gillard-information/story-fn59niix-1226453684136|title='No contradiction' on Julia Gillard information|work=The Australian|date=20 August 2012|accessdate=20 August 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Coorey|first=Phillip|title=Gillard cleared of wrongdoing by former employer|url=http://www.theage.com.au/opinion/political-news/gillard-cleared-of-wrongdoing-by-former-employer-20120819-24gnf.html|accessdate=21 August 2012|newspaper=The Age|date=20 August 2012|location=Melbourne[/tpl]
One year later in 1996, Gillard resigned from her position with Slater & Gordon in order to become the Chief of Staff to John Brumby, at that time the Leader of the Opposition in Victoria. She was responsible for drafting the affirmative-action rules within the Labor Party in Victoria that set the target of pre-selecting women for 35 per cent of "winnable seats".[tpl]cite web |last=Gillard |first=Julia |title=Personal Perspectives on Parliament Lower House: Lower House |work=One Hundred Years of Women's Suffrage in Australia, Centenary Issue |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia |year=2003 |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/pubs/pops/pop41/gillard.pdf |pages=34–36 |accessdate=29 June 2010[/tpl] She also played a role in the foundation of EMILY's List, the pro-choice fund-raising and support network for Labor women.[tpl]cite news |last=Summers |first=Anne |title=Historic moment, but barriers remain for half the population |url=http://www.theage.com.au/opinion/politics/historic-moment-but-barriers-remain-for-half-the-population-20100624-z3bp.html |accessdate=26 June 2010 |newspaper=The Age |publisher=Fairfax Media |date=25 June 2010 | location=Melbourne[/tpl]

==Member of Parliament==

Gillard was first elected to the House of Representatives at the 1998 federal election representing Lalor, a safe Labor seat near Melbourne, replacing Barry Jones who retired. She made her maiden speech to the House on 11 November 1998.[tpl]cite web |title=Ms Julia Gillard MP, Member for Lalor (Vic), First speech to Parliament |url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22chamber%2Fhansardr%2F1998-11-11%2F0011%22|publisher=Parliament of Australia |date=11 November 1998 |accessdate=28 August 2012[/tpl]

===Shadow Cabinet===

After Labor's defeat at the 2001 federal election, Gillard was elected to the Shadow Cabinet under then-Labor Leader Simon Crean, where she was given responsibility for Population and Immigration. In February 2003, she was given additional responsibilities for Reconciliation and Indigenous Affairs.[tpl]cite news |title=Crean names new team |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/politics/2003/02/item20030218083501_1.htm |newspaper=ABC News |date=18 February 2003 |accessdate=24 June 2010 |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=July 2012[/tpl] In these roles, in the wake of the Tampa and Children Overboard affairs, which were partly credited with Labor's 2001 election loss, Gillard developed a new immigration policy for the Labor Party.
Gillard was later promoted to the position of Shadow Minister for Health in July 2003.[tpl]cite news|first=Phillip|last=Hudson|title=ALP rising star for key health role|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/07/01/1056825394336.html|newspaper=The Age |publisher=Fairfax |date=2 July 2003|accessdate=24 June 2010 | location=Melbourne[/tpl] During this time, she shadowed Tony Abbott, with the rivalry between the two often attracting attention from the media.[tpl]cite news|first=David|last=Wroe|title=Doctor groups hail promotion of 'head kicker'|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/09/29/1064819869888.html|newspaper=The Age  |publisher=Fairfax |date=30 September 2003|accessdate=24 June 2010 | location=Melbourne[/tpl] She was later given additional responsibility for managing opposition business in the House of Representatives by new Labor Leader Mark Latham.[tpl]cite news|first=Cynthia|last=Banham|title=Gillard's loyalty pays off|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/12/02/1070351584392.html|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald  |publisher=Fairfax |date=3 December 2003|accessdate=24 June 2010[/tpl]
In the aftermath of Labor's fourth consecutive defeat in the 2004 federal election it was widely speculated that Gillard might challenge Jenny Macklin for the deputy leadership, but she did not do so.[tpl]cite news|first=Michelle|last=Grattan|title=Beazley no to Gillard as deputy|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/Beazley-no-to-Gillard-as-deputy/2005/01/21/1106110948133.html|newspaper=The Age  |publisher=Fairfax |date=22 January 2005|accessdate=24 June 2010 | location=Melbourne[/tpl] Gillard had been spoken of as a potential future leader of the party for some years, but never stood in a leadership contest. After Mark Latham resigned as Labor Leader in January 2005, Gillard appeared on ABC's Australian Story in March 2006, after which an Ipsos Mackay poll conducted for Network Ten's Meet the Press found that more respondents would prefer Gillard to be Labor Leader; she polled 32% compared with Beazley's 25% and Kevin Rudd's 18%.[tpl]cite episode|title=The Gillard Diaries|series=Australian Story|serieslink=Australian Story|network=ABC1|airdate=6 March 2006|transcript=yes|transcripturl=http://www.abc.net.au/austory/content/2006/s1586140.htm[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Julia Gillard preferred ALP leader: poll|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/Julia-Gillard-preferred-ALP-leader-poll/2006/04/02/1143916403791.html|newspaper=The Age |publisher=Fairfax |date=2 April 2006|accessdate=18 May 2007 | location=Melbourne[/tpl] Although she had significant cross-factional support, she announced on 25 January 2005 that she would not contest the leadership, allowing Beazley to be elected unopposed.[tpl]cite news|first=Michelle|last=Grattan|title=Gillard tells Beazley to be a bold leader|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/Gillard-tells-Beazley-to-be-a-bold-leader/2005/01/26/1106415664780.html|newspaper=The Age  |publisher=Fairfax |date=27 January 2005|accessdate=24 June 2010 | location=Melbourne[/tpl]

===Deputy Leader of the Opposition===

On 1 December 2006, as part of a cross-factional political partnership with Kevin Rudd, Gillard challenged Jenny Macklin for the deputy leadership.[tpl]cite news|first=Phillip|last=Hudson|author2=Coorey, Phillip|title=Rudd, Gillard confirm challenge|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/its-beazley-v-rudd/2006/12/01/1164777759776.html|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |publisher=Fairfax |date=1 December 2006|accessdate=24 June 2010[/tpl] After Rudd successfully replaced Beazley as Labor Leader on 4 December 2006, Macklin chose to resign, meaning that Gillard became Deputy Leader unopposed.[tpl]cite news|first=Phillip|last=Coorey|title=We'll rebuild nation, says Rudd|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/well-rebuild-nation-says-rudd/2006/12/04/1165080877872.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |publisher=Fairfax |date=5 December 2006|accessdate=24 June 2010[/tpl] In the subsequent reshuffle, Gillard was allocated responsibility for Employment, Workplace Relations and Social Inclusion, as well as being made Deputy Leader of the Opposition.[tpl]cite news|first=Michelle|last=Grattan|title=Plums for Rudd men in shadow reshuffle|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/plums-for-rudd-men-in-shadow-reshuffle/2006/12/10/1165685554688.html|newspaper=The Age  |publisher=Fairfax |date=11 December 2006|accessdate=24 June 2010 | location=Melbourne[/tpl]
Later, deposed opposition leader Kim Beazley said of Gillard's role in his Shadow Cabinet in the lead up to the Rudd/Gillard challenge – "I had some very loyal supporters... and I also had some very effective people who were not so supportive and she was one of them".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/austory/specials/shewhowaits/default.htm |title=Australian Story :: She Who Waits |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=21 June 2010 |accessdate=16 June 2013[/tpl]

==Deputy Prime Minister==

After the Labor Party's victory in the 2007 federal election, Gillard was sworn in as the first ever female Deputy Prime Minister of Australia on 3 December 2007.[tpl]cite news|first=Cosima|last=Marriner|title=Gillard reveals: it was the go-girl factor|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/gillard-reveals-it-was-the-gogirl-factor/2007/11/25/1195975870414.html|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald  |publisher=Fairfax |date=26 November 2007|accessdate=24 June 2010[/tpl] In addition to being made Deputy Prime Minister, Gillard was given responsibility for a so-called "super ministry", the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations.
In her role as Minister for Education, Gillard travelled to Washington D.C., where she signed a deal with US Secretary of Education Arne Duncan to encourage improved policy collaboration in education reform between both countries.[tpl]cite news|first=Dan|last=Harrison|title=Ms Gillard goes to Washington|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/education/ms-gillard-goes-to-washington-20091016-h0wx.html|newspaper=The Age  |publisher=Fairfax |date=19 October 2009|accessdate=19 October 2009 | location=Melbourne[/tpl] As Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Gillard removed the WorkChoices industrial relations regime introduced by the Howard Government, and replaced it with the Fair Work Bill.[tpl]cite news|first=Renee|last=Viellaris|title=WorkChoices finally dead: Julia Gillard|url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,25215771-952,00.html|newspaper=The Australian | publisher=News Limited |date=20 March 2009|accessdate=23 June 2010[/tpl] This established a single industrial relations bureaucracy called Fair Work Australia.[tpl]cite news|title=PM promises not to extend Work Choices|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/Fielding-noncommittal-on-ALPs-IR-plan/2007/10/15/1192300644672.html|newspaper=The Age  |publisher=Fairfax |date=15 October 2007|accessdate=13 November 2007 | location=Melbourne[/tpl] Gillard also oversaw the government's "Building the Education Revolution" program, which allocated $16 billion to build new school accommodation including classrooms, libraries and assembly halls.[tpl]cite news|first=Natasha|last=Bita|title=Grant to trail girl to next school|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/grant-to-trail-girl-to-next-school/story-e6frg6oo-1225771290406|newspaper=The Australian  | publisher=News Limited |date=10 September 2009|accessdate=23 June 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|first=Natasha|last=Bita|title=Julia Gillard to reclaim school payouts|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/julia-gillard-to-reclaim-school-payouts/story-e6frg6oo-1225789767523|newspaper=The Australian  | publisher=News Limited |date=22 October 2009|accessdate=23 June 2010[/tpl]

==Prime Minister==

===2010 leadership vote===

Prime Minister Kevin Rudd suffered a decline in his personal ratings, and a perceived loss of support among his own MPs, following the failure of the Government's insulation program, controversy regarding the implementation of a tax on mining, the failure of the government to secure passage of its carbon trading scheme and some policy debate about immigration policy. Significant disaffection had arisen within the Labor Party as to the leadership style and direction of Rudd.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/qanda/txt/s2933046.htm |title=The Gillard Coup | Q&A | ABC TV |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=28 June 2010 |accessdate=16 June 2013[/tpl] On 23 June 2010 he announced that Gillard had asked him to hold a leadership ballot the following day to determine the leadership of the Labor Party, and hence the Prime Ministership of Australia.[tpl]cite news|first=Michael|last=Harvey|title=Federal Labor MPs moving to axe Kevin Rudd and replace him with Julia Gillard|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/national/labor-considers-axing-rudd/story-e6frf7l6-1225883380388|newspaper=Herald Sun | publisher=News Limited |date=23 June 2010|accessdate=23 June 2010[/tpl]
As late as May 2010, prior to challenging Rudd, Gillard was quipping to the media that "There's more chance of me becoming the full-forward for the Dogs than there is of any change in the Labor Party".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2011/s3336424.htm |title=7.30 |publisher=ABC |date=23 June 2010 |accessdate=16 June 2013[/tpl] Consequently, Gillard's move against Rudd on 23 June appeared to surprise many Labor backbenchers. Daryl Melham when asked by a reporter on the night of the challenge if indeed a challenge was on, replied: "Complete garbage.

Initially, the Sydney Morning Herald reported that the final catalyst for the move on Rudd was sparked by a report that Rudd had used his chief of staff to sound out back benchers on his level of support, thus implying that "he did not trust the repeated assurances by Ms Gillard that she would not stand".[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/gillard--becomes-australias-first-female-prime-minister-as-tearful-rudd-stands-aside-20100624-yzvw.html#ixzz1ko64xQRM | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Julia Gillard, Prime Minister After Labor Leadership Challenge | date=24 June 2010[/tpl] Later, ABC's 7:30 Report said the seeds for the challenge to Rudd came from "factional heavyweights" Bill Shorten and Senator David Feeney, who secured the support of "New South Wales right power broker" Mark Arbib and that Feeney and Arbib went to discuss a challenge with Gillard on the morning of 23 June and a final numbers count began for a challenge.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2010/s2936441.htm |title=The 7.30 Report |publisher=ABC |date=24 June 2010 |accessdate=25 April 2012[/tpl] Accounts have continued to differ as to the extend of Julia Gillard's foreknowledge and planning of the replacement of Rudd.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/pm-julia-gillard-stitched-up-kevin-rudd/story-e6freuy9-1226499866236 |title=PM Julia Gillard stiched up Kevin Rudd |date= |accessdate=28 June 2013[/tpl]
Rudd initially said that he would challenge Gillard, but it soon became apparent that he did not have enough support within the party to survive in his position. Hours before the vote on 24 June, he resigned as Prime Minister and Leader of the Labor Party, leaving Gillard to assume the leadership unopposed. Treasurer Wayne Swan was at the same time elected unopposed to succeed Gillard as Deputy Leader.
Shortly afterward, Gillard was sworn in as the 27th Prime Minister of Australia by Governor-General Quentin Bryce, with Swan being sworn in as Deputy Prime Minister. The members of the Rudd Ministry, with the exception of Rudd himself who returned to the backbenches, subsequently became the members of the First Gillard Ministry.
Later that day, in her first press conference as Prime Minister, Gillard said that at times the Rudd Government "went off the tracks", and "I came to the view that a good Government was losing its way".[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/julia-gillard-is-australias-new-prime-minister/story-e6freuy9-1225883617249 |title=Julia Gillard is Australia's new Prime Minister |author=Malcolm Farr, Alison Rehn, Steve Lewis and Simon Benson |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=24 June 2010 |accessdate=7 July 2010[/tpl] Gillard offered wider explanation of her motivations for replacing Rudd during the 2012 Labor leadership spill in which Rudd challenged Gillard to regain the Labor leadership, telling the media that the Rudd Government had entered a "period of paralysis" and that Rudd's work patterns were "difficult and chaotic".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/national-old/julia-gillard-responds-to-kevin-rudds-resignation-by-calling-leadership-ballot-for-monday/story-e6frfkvr-1226279217149 |title=SHE SAYS: 'Why I had to knife Kevin Rudd' – Gillard confirms leadership spill |publisher=News.com.au |date=23 February 2012 |accessdate=16 June 2013[/tpl]

The leadership question remained a feature of the Gillard Government's terms in office, and amidst ongoing leadership speculation following an ABC TV Four Corners examination of the events leading up to Rudd's replacement which cast doubt on Gillard's insistence that she did not actively campaign for the Prime Ministership, Attorney-General Nicola Roxon spoke of Rudd's record in the following terms: "I don't think we should whitewash history – while there are a lot of very good things our government did with Kevin as prime minister, there were also a lot of challenges, and it's Julia who has seen through fixing a lot of those problems."[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/breaking-news/julia-gillard-still-has-the-numbers-in-any-leadership-vote-with-kevin-rudd-says-nicola-roxon/story-fn3dxity-1226274606927 | title=Julia Gillard still has the numbers in any leadership vote with Kevin Rudd, says Nicola Roxon | date=18 February 2012 | agency=AAP | work=The Australian[/tpl]

===Domestic policies===

====Economy====

Gillard came to office in the aftermath of the global financial crisis of 2007–2008. Government receipts fell during the international downturn and the Rudd Government had employed pump priming expenditure.[tpl]cite news|first=Paul |last=Kelly |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/opinion/columnists/addiction-to-over-promising-in-julia-gillards-government-for-all-seasons/story-e6frg74x-1226537092324 |title=Addiction to over-promising in Julia Gillard's 'government for all seasons' |date=15 December 2012 |accessdate=28 June 2013 |work=The Australian[/tpl] Upon taking over as leader of the ALP on 23 June 2010, Gillard said she could "assure" Australians that the Federal Budget would be in surplus in 2013. The Government continued to promise this outcome until December 2012. Gillard initially ruled out a "carbon tax" but said that she would build community consensus for a price on carbon and open negotiations with the mining industry for a re-vamped mining profits tax.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdXlUdSBOYk |title=23 June Press Conference |publisher=Youtube.com |date=2010-06-23 |accessdate=2013-06-26[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Mclennan |first=David |url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/news/national/national/general/gillard-set-to-get-a-good-government-back-on-track/1867321.aspx |title=Gillard set to get 'a good government back on track' |publisher=The Canberra Times |date=24 June 2010 |accessdate=30 October 2010[/tpl] Following the 2010 hung parliament election result, the ALP elected to adopt the Australian Greens preference for a carbon tax to transition to an emissions trading scheme, establishing a carbon price via the Clean Energy Bill 2011. The government also introduced a revised Minerals Resource Rent Tax and the Queensland Flood Levy.

====Health====

Like her predecessor Rudd, Gillard has said that health is a priority in her agenda. She announced during the 2010 election, that there would be an increase of 270 placements for emergency doctors and nurses and 3,000 extra nursing scholarships over the following 10 years.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/07/27/2965258.htm | title=Rural doctors question Gillard pledge|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=27 July 2010 |accessdate=20 April 2013[/tpl] She also said mental health would be a priority in her second term, with a $277 million suicide-prevention package which would target high-risk groups.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/labor-to-expand-the-mental-health-front-line/story-fn59niix-1225897734559 |title= Labor to expand the mental health front line |work=The Australian |date=28 July 2010 |accessdate=25 March 2011 |publisher=News Limited |first1=Patricia |last1=Karvelas |first2=Adam |last2=Cresswell [/tpl] As the election delivered a hung parliament, a $1.8 billion package was given to rural hospitals, which was agreed to by the independents to support her re-election.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.ninemsn.com.au/national/election2010/7957641/gillard-pledges-to-forge-new-paradigm |title=Gillard pledges $9.9b for rural Australia |publisher=News.ninemsn.com.au |accessdate=4 April 2011[/tpl]
In October 2010, her government introduced legislation to reform funding arrangements for the health system, with the intention of giving the Commonwealth responsibility for providing the majority of funding to public hospitals and 100 per cent of funding for primary care and GP services.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2011[/tpl] In February 2011, Gillard announced extensive revision of the original health funding reforms proposed by the Rudd Government, which had been unable to secure the support of all state governments.

====Immigration====

In relation to population targets for Australia, Gillard told Fairfax Media in August 2010 that while skilled migration is important: "I don't support the idea of a big Australia". Gillard also altered the nomenclature of Tony Burke's role as "Minister for Population" to that of "Minister for Sustainable Population".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/06/27/2938009.htm |title=Gillard shuts door on 'big Australia' |publisher=ABC |location=Australia  |accessdate=4 April 2011[/tpl]

====Asylum seekers====

After winning leadership of the Labor Party, Gillard identified addressing the issue of unauthorised arrivals of asylum seekers as a priority of her government. She announced that negotiations were underway for a return to "offshore processing" of asylum seeker claims. Gillard ruled out a return to processing at Nauru and named East Timor as a preferred location for new detention and processing facilities.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/07/07/2946786.htm |title=This is no Pacific Solution: Gillard |publisher=ABC |location=Australia  |date=7 July 2010 |accessdate=4 April 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-07-13/smith-still-backs-asylum-plan/901834 |title=Smith still backs asylum plan |work=ABC News |publisher=ABC |location=Australia  |date=13 July 2010 |accessdate=8 August 2010[/tpl] The East Timorese Government rejected the plan.[tpl]cite news |first=Joe |last=Kelly |title= East Timor's parliament rejects Gillard plan for regional asylum-seeker centre |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/politics/east-timors-parliament-rejects-gillard-plan-for-regional-asylum-seeker-centre/story-e6frgczf-1225890881986 |newspaper=The Australian |publisher=News Limited | date=25 July 2010 |accessdate=25 March 2011[/tpl]
In October 2010, her government announced that it would open two detention centres for 2000 immigrants, due to the pressures in allowing women and children to be released into the community.

In May 2011, Gillard announced that Australia and Malaysia were finalising an arrangement to exchange asylum seekers. Gillard and Immigration Minister Chris Bowen said they were close to signing a bilateral agreement which would result in 800 asylum seekers who arrive in Australia by boat being taken to Malaysia instead. Australia will take 4,000 people from Malaysia who have previously been assessed as being refugees.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/gillard-announces-malaysian-solution-20110507-1ed0h.html |title=Gillard announces Malaysian solution |work=The Age |location=Melbourne |date=7 May 2011 |accessdate=12 June 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Arrangement with Malaysia on Irregular Maritime Arrivals|url=http://www.immi.gov.au/managing-australias-borders/border-security/irregular-entry/arrangement-malaysia-ima.htm|work=Managing Australia's Borders|publisher=Department of Immigration and Citizenship|accessdate=9 June 2011[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=July 2012[/tpl]

The asylum seeker debate returned during August 2012 following the report of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers, led by retired Air Chief Marshall Angus Houston. Accepting the panel's recommendation, Gillard on 12 August 2012 announced that a bill then before Parliament would be amended to allow the Government to choose sites for off-shore processing. At the same time she announced the Government would nominate Nauru and Manus Island, Papua New Guinea to be re-opened.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/immigration/labor-caucus-backs-expert-panel-on-asylum-policy/story-fn9hm1gu-1226449423972 |title=Labor to act quickly to reopen Nauru, PNG asylum-seeker processing centres |last=Packham |first=Ben |newspaper=The Australian |date=12 August 2012 |accessdate=19 August 2012[/tpl] The amended bill passed with the support of the Opposition on 16 August 2012.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/national/offshore-asylum-laws-through-parliament/story-fndo1sx1-1226451444495 |title=Offshore asylum laws through Parliament |date=16 August 2012 |newspaper=Adelaide Now |first=Anna |last=Caldwell |agency=Australian Associated Press |accessdate=18 August 2012[/tpl]

====Education====

When Gillard became Prime Minister she gave her Education portfolio to Simon Crean.
At the July 2010 National Press Club, Gillard stated "I will make education central to my economic agenda because of the role it plays in developing the skills that lead to rewarding and satisfying work – and that can build a high-productivity, high-participation economy."[tpl]cite web|title=Moving forward to a stronger and fairer economy|url=http://www.pm.gov.au/press-office/moving-forward-stronger-and-fairer-economy|accessdate=24 March 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/gillard-mum-on-rudd-resignation-deal-20100715-10c1x.html?from=age_sb |title=Gillard mum on Rudd 'resignation deal' claim |work=The Age | location=Melbourne |date= 15 July 2010|accessdate=8 August 2010[/tpl] The Gillard Government in January 2011 extended tax cuts to parents to help pay for stationery, textbooks or computer equipment under the Education Tax Refund scheme.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/keep-your-backtoschool-receipts-pm-20110106-19h24.html | title=Keep your back-to-school receipts: PM | date=6 January 2011 |work=Sydney Morning Herald[/tpl]
Gillard continued to put the My School website centre of her education agenda, which was controversial when she implemented when she was the Minister for Education. Although it was popular amongst parents, the website helped parents view statistics of the school their children attended. She has unveiled the revamped version, My School 2.0, promising better information to parents.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.news.com.au/national/myschool-20-website-to-give-parents-better-information-about-their-childs-education/story-e6frfkvr-1225955326426 | work=The Courier-Mail | first1=Emma | last1=Chalmers | first2=Tanya | last2=Chilcott | title=MySchool 2.0 website to give parents better information about their child's education | date=18 November 2010[/tpl]
Universities also placed highly on her education agenda. Legislation due to be voted on in November 2010 that would see the introduction of a national universities regulator was delayed till 2011 following criticisms from the higher education sector. It was also announced by her government that legislation to establish the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency would also be introduced early 2011.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/education/delay-for-uni-standards-legislation-20101115-17ufn.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Delay for uni standards legislation | date=16 November 2010[/tpl]

====Climate change====

The Rudd Labor opposition promised to implement an emissions trading scheme (ETS) before the 2007 federal election which Labor won. Rudd, unable to secure support for his scheme in the Senate, dropped it. During his 2012 leadership challenge against Gillard's prime ministership, Kevin Rudd said that it was Julia Gillard and Wayne Swan who convinced him to delay his Emissions Trading Scheme.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/1629321/Gillard-Swan-urged-govt-to-scrap-ETSRudd |title=Gillard, Swan urged govt to scrap ETS:Rudd |publisher=Sbs.com.au |date= |accessdate=16 June 2013[/tpl]
In her 2010 election campaign, Gillard pledged to build a "national consensus" for a carbon price by creating a "citizens assembly", to examine "the evidence on climate change, the case for action and the possible consequences of introducing a market-based approach to limiting and reducing carbon emissions", over the course of one year. The assembly was to be selected by an independent authority who would select people from the electoral roll using census data.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/federal-election/pm-pledges-peoples-assembly-on-climate-20100722-10myh.html |location=Australia |work=The Age | first1=Adam | last1=Morton | first2=Tom | last2=Arup | title=PM pledges 'people's assembly' on climate | date=23 July 2010[/tpl] The plan was never implemented. After the 2010 Election, Gillard agreed to form a minority government with the Greens and Independents and replaced her "citizens assembly" plan with a climate change panel consisting of Labor, Greens and Independent members of Parliament.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/labor-greens-strike-alliance-deal-for-stable-government/story-e6frg6n6-1225912672100 | title=Gillard PM dumps citizens assembly as Labor, Greens strike alliance deal | date=1 September 2010 | work=The Australian | first1=James | last1=Massola | first2=Samantha | last2=Maiden[/tpl] The panel ultimately announced backing for a temporary carbon tax, leading up to an Emissions Trading Scheme.
During the 2010 Election campaign, Gillard said that no carbon tax would be introduced under a government she led.[tpl]cite news|title=PM says no carbon tax under her govt|url=http://news.ninemsn.com.au/national/election2010/7945914/pm-says-no-carbon-tax-under-her-govt|accessdate=29 July 2012|newspaper=The Australian|date=16 August 2010[/tpl] In the first hung parliament result in 70 years, the Gillard Government, with the support of the Australian Greens and some cross bench independents, negotiated the implementation of a carbon tax (the preferred policy of the Australian Greens), by which a fixed-price carbon tax would proceed to a floating-price ETS within a few years under the plans. The government proposed the Clean Energy Bill in February 2011, which the opposition claimed to be a broken election promise.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/national/pm-gambles-on-carbon-tax-slug/story-e6frf7l6-1226011659564 |title=Tony Abbott calls for election on carbon tax |newspaper=Herald Sun |last=Hudson |first=Phillip |date=26 February 2011 |accessdate=5 May 2011[/tpl]

===Foreign affairs===

During her first major international tour as Prime Minister, Julia Gillard told ABC TV's 7.30 Report:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2010/s3030288.htm |title=The 7.30 Report |publisher=ABC |date=5 October 2010 |accessdate=4 April 2011[/tpl]
 
 

====United States====

Following her 2010 election victory, Gillard selected her former leader Kevin Rudd (a career diplomat) as Foreign Minister. Gillard travelled to the United States in March 2011 to mark the 60th Anniversary of the ANZUS Alliance and was invited to address the United States Congress.
In a 2008 speech in Washington, Gillard endorsed the ANZUS Alliance and described the United States as a civilising global influence.[tpl]cite news|first=Annabel|last=Crabb|title= Latham's cheap shot fails to wound|url=http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/lathams-cheap-shot-fails-to-wound-20090821-etpn.html?page=-1|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |publisher=Fairfax Media |date=22 August 2009|accessdate=25 March 2011[/tpl] Her former colleague and leader Mark Latham wrote in a 2009 article for the Australian Financial Review that these comments were "hypocritical", given past private communications Gillard had exchanged with him which apparently mocked elements of American foreign policy: "One of them concerned her study tour of the US, sponsored by the American Government in 2006—or to use her moniker—'a CIA re-education course'. She asked me to 'stand by for emails explaining George Bush is a great statesman, torture is justified in many circumstances and those Iraqi insurgents should just get over it'."[tpl]cite news|title=Latham lashes out at 'hypocrite' Gillard|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/latham-lashes-out-at-hypocrite-gillard-20090820-es2r.html|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |publisher=Fairfax Media |date=21 August 2009|accessdate=25 March 2011|location=Melbourne[/tpl]

A parliamentary debate was conducted for four sitting weeks of parliament, with the agreement between Gillard and Abbott that it is necessary to stay in Afghanistan and prevent it from becoming a safe haven for terrorists.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.news.com.au/breaking-news/australian-prime-minister-gillard-closes-debate-on-afghanistan/story-e6frfku0-1225955429143 | agency=AAP | first=Andrea | last=Hayward | title=Australian Prime Minister Gillard closes debate on Afghanistan | date=18 November 2010[/tpl]

===Gender politics===

During the course of Gillard's prime ministership, sexism has been a contentious issue for a number of Labor and Greens Party figures as well as some commentators.Simon Benson cited in [tpl]cite news|last=Summers|first=Anne|title=The gender agenda: Gillard and the politics of sexism|url=http://www.theage.com.au/opinion/political-news/the-gender-agenda-gillard-and-the-politics-of-sexism-20120225-1tv7n.html|work=The Age |location=Australia|accessdate=2012-02-26[/tpl] Former Labor Party advisor Anne Summers said in 2012 that "Gillard is being persecuted both because she is a woman and in ways that would be impossible to apply to a man".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newcastle.edu.au/unit/equity-diversity/human-rights-social-justice-lecture|title=Her Rights at Work (R-rated version), The Political Persecution of Australia's First Female Prime Minister|author=Anne Summers|date=31 August 2012|accessdate=23 March 2013[/tpl] In reply, journalist Peter Hartcher wrote, "She was a woman when she was popular; she can't be unpopular now because she's a woman.

====Misogyny speech====

In an August 2012 press conference regarding the AWU scandal, Gillard was critical of The Australian newspaper for writing about her connection to the affair and of what she called "misogynist nut jobs on the internet". Gillard said that she had been "the subject of a very sexist smear campaign".[tpl]cite web|last=Lane|first=Sabra|title=PM hits out at 'sexist smear campaign'|url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2012/s3574539.htm|work=ABC News|publisher=|accessdate=10 November 2012|date=23 August 2012[/tpl] In early October, the Opposition Leader's wife accused the Gillard Government of a deliberate campaign to smear her husband, Tony Abbott, on gender issues.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-10-05/abbott27s-wife-talks-about-the-27real-tony27/4296898 |title=Wife defends Abbott over sexism claims |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=5 October 2012 |accessdate=16 June 2013[/tpl] On 8 October 2012, Gillard also raised "sexism and misogyny" in a speech opposing a motion to remove Peter Slipper, her choice as Speaker of the House of Representatives, after revelations of inappropriate conduct on his part became public.[tpl]cite news|last=Lester|first=Amelia|title=Ladylike: Julia Gillard’s Misogyny Speech|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2012/10/julia-gillards-misogyny-speech.html|accessdate=20 January 2013|newspaper=The New Yorker|date=9 October 2012[/tpl] Gillard linked the speech to the context of the then ongoing Alan Jones "died of shame" controversy.[tpl]cite news|last=McDonald|first=Mark|title=Australian Leader Unleashes Blistering Speech|url=http://rendezvous.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/11/gillards-blistering-speech-a-model-for-obama/|accessdate=20 January 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=11 October 2012[/tpl] The speech[tpl]cite news|title=Transcript of Julia Gillard's speech|url=http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/political-news/transcript-of-julia-gillards-speech-20121010-27c36.html|accessdate=24 December 2012|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=10 October 2012[/tpl] was widely reported around the world.[tpl]cite web|last= |first=|title=Gillard's misogyny speech goes global|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-10-10/international-reaction-to-gillard-speech/4305294|work=ABC News|publisher=|accessdate=10 November 2012|date=11 October 2012[/tpl] In Laos soon after for an Asian-European leaders conference, Gillard described comments by François Hollande and Helle Thorning-Schmidt: "The president of France congratulated me on the speech, as did the Prime Minister of Denmark, and some other leaders, just casually as I've moved around, have also mentioned it to me."[tpl]cite web|last=|first=|title=World leaders praise Gillard sexism speech|url=http://news.ninemsn.com.au/national/2012/11/07/10/01/gillard-gets-thumbs-up-for-sexism-speech.|work=Nine News|publisher=|accessdate=10 November 2012|date=7 November 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=|first=|title=Gillard misogyny speech gains French, Danish support|url=http://www.businessspectator.com.au/bs.nsf/Article/Gillard-gets-thumbs-up-for-sexism-speech-ZSU3S?OpenDocument|work=Business Spectator|publisher=|accessdate=10 November 2012|date=7 November 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Farr, Malcolm |first=|title=Obama praises Gillard's sexism speech|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/obama-praises-gillards-sexism-speech/story-e6frg6n6-1226513851310|work=The Australian|publisher=|accessdate=10 November 2012|date=9 November 2012[/tpl] US President Barack Obama reportedly "complimented" Gillard on the speech in a private conversation following his re-election.

===2012 leadership vote===

In the light of poor polling results for the Gillard Government, speculation that Foreign Minister and former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd wished to challenge Gillard for the leadership culminated with Rudd resigning from the Cabinet on 22 February 2012. Rudd told the media "I can only serve as Foreign Minister if I have the confidence of Prime Minister Gillard and her senior ministers" after Gillard failed to repudiate cabinet ministers who publicly criticised Rudd and his tenure as Prime Minister.[tpl]cite web|author=Name |url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/1628677/Rudd-resigns-as-foreign-minister |title=Rudd resigns as foreign minister | SBS World News |publisher=Sbs.com.au |date= |accessdate=30 July 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Benson|first=Simon|title=Kevin Rudd had dinner with Kim Beazley before all hell broke loose|url=http://www.news.com.au/national/kevin-rudd-had-dinner-with-kim-beazley-before-all-hell-broke-loose/story-e6frfkvr-1226279047970|accessdate=23 February 2012|newspaper=Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|date=23 February 2012[/tpl] The situation had been further exacerbated by the revelation on Four Corners that Gillard's staff wrote her victory speech for the 2010 leadership election two weeks prior to her challenge, contradicting Gillard's earlier claims that she had only resolved to challenge Rudd the day before the vote. This revelation caused particular conflict between Labor factions to surface, with Labor MP Darren Cheeseman calling on Gillard to resign, while his colleague Steve Gibbons called Rudd a "psychopath with a giant ego".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-02-19/questions-over-leaked-rudd-video/3838358 |title=Wilkie convinced Rudd will launch challenge – ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |publisher=ABCnet.au |date= |accessdate=30 July 2012[/tpl]

===March 2013 leadership vote===

Despite Gillard's defeating Kevin Rudd comfortably in the 2012 leadership spill, tensions remained in the Labor Party regarding Gillard's leadership.[tpl]cite news|last=Editor |first=Political |url=http://www.news.com.au/national-news/south-australia/kevin-rudds-the-man-who-wont-go-away-for-labor/story-fndo4dzn-1226580626361 |title=Kevin Rudd's the man who won't go away for Labor |publisher=News.com.au |date=18 February 2013 |accessdate=22 March 2013[/tpl] After Labor's polling position worsened in the wake of Gillard announcing the date of the 2013 election, these tensions came to a head when former Labor Leader and Regional Minister Simon Crean called for a leadership spill and backed Rudd on 21 March 2013.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-03-21/live-coverage-labor-leadership-crisis/4586250 |title=Labor leadership crisis|publisher=Abc.net.au |date= 21 March 2013|accessdate=2013-06-26[/tpl] In response, Gillard sacked Crean from his position, and called a leadership spill for 4.30pm that same day.
Ten minutes before the ballot was due to occur, Rudd publicly announced that he would not contest the leadership, in line with the commitment he had made following the 2012 contest. As such, Gillard and Wayne Swan were the only candidates for the Leadership and Deputy Leadership of the Labor Party, and were elected unopposed. This marked the first time in history that an incumbent Labor Leader was elected unopposed at a leadership ballot.[tpl]cite news|last=Farr|first=Malcolm|title=Rudd shies away from PM challenge|url=http://www.news.com.au/national-news/rudd-shies-away-from-pm-challenge/story-fncynjr2-1226602790758|accessdate=21 March 2013|newspaper=News.com.au|date=21 March 2013[/tpl] Several ministers subsequently resigned from the government, including Chief Government Whip Joel Fitzgibbon, Human Services Minister Kim Carr, and Energy Minister Martin Ferguson.
Gillard declared that the question of the Labor leadership was now "settled". Nevertheless, speculation on Gillard's leadership remained a major issue, with polling results indicating an electoral disaster were she to lead the Labor Party into the election. In light of this, media attention once more turned to Kevin Rudd as a possible replacement in the short term. It was reported that Gillard's supporter Bill Shorten was under pressure to ask her to resign, creating a vacancy that Rudd would contest.[tpl]cite news|last=Uhlmann|first=Chris|title=Labor's predicted election defeat raises leadership questions|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-06-10/labors-predicted-election-defeat-raises-leadership/4744842|accessdate=11 June 2013|newspaper=ABC|date=11 June 2013[/tpl]

===June 2013 leadership vote===

By the end of June 2013, Labor's standing in the polls had worsened, and the Coalition had been leading in most opinion polls for two years; one poll in early June showed that Labor would be reduced to as few as 40 seats after the next election.[tpl]cite news|title=Julia Gillard loses significant support among caucus|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-06-09/julia-gillard-loses-significant-support-in-caucus/4742626|accessdate=9 June 2013|newspaper=ABC News|date=9 June 2013[/tpl] With a general election due later that year, even some staunch Gillard supporters began to believe that Labor faced almost certain defeat if Gillard continued as leader. According to the ABC's Barrie Cassidy, the question was not whether Gillard would be ousted as Labor leader, but when the ousting would take place.[tpl]cite news|title=Is Gillard's number up?|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-06-09/cassidy---gillard/4742634|accessdate=9 June 2013|newspaper=ABC News|date=9 June 2013|authorlink=Barrie Cassidy|first=Barrie|last=Cassidy[/tpl]
Following further speculation over her leadership, on 26 June a rumour emerged that supporters of Kevin Rudd were collecting signatures for a letter demanding an immediate leadership vote. That afternoon, before any letter had been published, Gillard called a leadership spill live on television. She challenged any would-be opponent to join her in a pledge that, while the winner would become leader, the loser would immediately retire from politics. Despite his earlier comments that he would not return to the leadership under any circumstances, Kevin Rudd announced that he would challenge Gillard for the leadership, and committed to retiring from politics if he lost. In the party-room ballot later that evening, Rudd defeated Gillard by a margin of 57 votes to 45.[tpl]cite news|author=|url=http://www.news.com.au/national-news/federal-election/labor-leadership-live-kevin-rudd-returns-julia-gillard-loses-support-of-partyroom/story-fnho52ip-1226669921693 |title=Labor leadership live: Kevin Rudd returns, Julia Gillard loses support of partyroom |publisher=News.com.au |date=26 June 2013 |accessdate=2013-06-26[/tpl]

===Resignation===

Following her defeat in the leadership vote on 26 June 2013, Gillard congratulated the winner Kevin Rudd and announced that she would immediately tender her resignation as Prime Minister to the Governor-General, Quentin Bryce.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/national-news/federal-election/labor-leadership-live-kevin-rudd-returns-julia-gillard-loses-support-of-partyroom/story-fnho52ip-1226669921693 |title=Labor leadership live: Kevin Rudd returns, Julia Gillard loses support of partyroom |publisher=News.com.au |date= 26 June 2013|accessdate=28 June 2013[/tpl] She also announced, in keeping with her pledge before the leadership vote, that she would not re-contest her seat of Lalor at the upcoming election, and thus would be retiring from politics. Her resignation as Prime Minister took effect the following day, upon the swearing in of Rudd.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-06-26/rudd-prevails-over-gillard-in-leadership-ballot/4783422 |title=Kevin Rudd defeats Julia Gillard 57-45 in Labor leadership ballot, paving way for a return to PM |author=Griffith, Emma |work=ABC News |location=Australia |date=26 June 2013|accessdate=26 June 2013 [/tpl]

===Euthanasia===

Concerning euthanasia Gillard warned that it may "open the door to exploitation and perhaps callousness towards people in the end stage of life" and that she is not convinced that the policy of pro-euthanasia advocates contain "sufficient safeguards".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/pm-offers-no-hope-to-social-left/story-fn59niix-1226025038933|title=PM offers no hope to social Left|work=The Australian|date=21 March 2011|accessdate=21 March 2011|first=Paul|last=Kelly[/tpl]

===Poker machines===

In 2010, Gillard agreed with Nick Xenophon, Andrew Wilkie and the Australian Greens to introduce poker machine reform legislation, to curb problem gambling, into the parliament by May 2012. After members of the cross bench advised that they would not support this bill in the House of Representatives, Gillard withdrew her support. Wilkie said that many Australians felt "very let down by the PM", and fellow anti-gambling campaigner Xenophon accused the Prime Minister of "backstabbing the person who put her in office".[tpl]cite news|url=http://mpegmedia.abc.net.au/rn/podcast/2012/01/bst_20120123_0732.mp3 |title=Interview with PM Julia Gillard |publisher=Radio National AM |date=23 January 2012 |accessdate=28 January 2012[/tpl]
