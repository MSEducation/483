==Plot summary==

Trianon (Boris Klyuev), a willing mole agent of Americans, is providing his CIA diplomatic-immuned handlers in Moscow with information on Soviet supplies to the fictional African state of Nagonia which he obtains through his high-positioned expert job. The KGB counterintelligence painstakingly identifies and neutralizes him. Trianon kills his fiancee who raised suspicions on his double life and then attempts to commit suicide when arrested, but the KGB secures his apprehension and interrogation.
At the same time in Nagonia, Soviet counterintelligence agent Slavin (Yuri Solomin) risks his life assisting in identification of Trianon and preventing local CIA resident Glabb (Vakhtang Kikabidze) from staging a coup d'etat in the country by pro-American General Ogano against ruling progressive president Grisso. Several foreign whistleblowers providing Slavin with information are killed by Glabb's order.
As the result of successful KGB operation, the TASS state news agency issues a sensational news bulletin exposing the CIA plot.
