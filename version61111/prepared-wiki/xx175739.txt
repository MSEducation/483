It covered present southeastern Georgia, northern Armenia and northwestern Azerbaijan.
Tiflis Governorate was established in 1846 along with the Kutaisi Governorate, after the dissolution of the Georgia-Imeretia Governorate. It was initially formed from uzeyds of Tiflis, Gori, Telavi, Signakh, Yelizavetpol, Erivan, Nakhichevan and Alexandropol and okrugs of Zakataly, Ossetian and Tushino-pshaw-Khevsurian. In 1849, uzeyds of Erivan, Nakhichevan and Alexandropol were attached to Erivan Governorate. In 1859 Ossetian okrug became part of Gori district and Tushino-pshaw-Khevsurian okrug was renamed as Tionets. In 1867, the northern part of Tiflis uzeyd was separated as Dusheti one and Akhaltsikhe uzeyd (It was created after ceding from Ottoman Empire to Russian Empire in 1829) was detached from Kutaisi Governorate and part of Tiflis one. In 1868 Yelizavetpol uzeyd (in the same decree, Kazakh uzeyd was formed from northwestern part of Yelizavetpol one and was attached to Elisabethpol Governorate) was part of Elisabethpol Governorate. In 1874, the southern part of Akhaltsikhe uzeyds was to become Akhalkalaki one and Tionets okrug was elevated as uyezd. Finally southern part of Tiflis Uyezd was to become Borchali Uyezd. The governorate lasted in these boundaries for 50 years, until the Democratic Republic of Georgia was founded.Coats of Arms of the Cities of the Georgia-Imeretia Governorate of the Russian Empire
