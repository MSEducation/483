</ref> for example, describes a simple demonstration, using a straw to blow over the upper surface of a wing. The wing deflects upwards, thus demonstrating that the Coandă effect creates lift. This demonstration correctly demonstrates the Coandă effect as a fluid jet (the exhaust from a straw) adhering to a curved surface (the wing). However, the upper surface in this flow is a complicated, vortex-laden mixing layer, while on the lower surface the flow is [[wikt:quiescence|quiescent]].  The physics of this demonstration are very different from that of the general flow over the wing.<ref name="auerbach">
[/ref] The usage in this sense is encountered in some popular references on aerodynamics.  In the aerodynamics field, the Coandă effect is commonly defined in the more limited sense above and viscosity is used to explain why the boundary layer attaches to the surface of a wing.

==Methods to determine lift on an airfoil==

===Lift coefficient===

If the lift coefficient for a wing at a specified angle of attack is known (or estimated using a method such as thin airfoil theory), then the lift produced for specific flow conditions can be determined using the following equation:[tpl]citation |last=Anderson |first=John D. |year=2004 |title=Introduction to Flight |edition=5th |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=0-07-282569-3 |pages=257–261[/tpl]

===Kutta–Joukowski theorem===

Lift can be calculated using potential flow theory by imposing a circulation. It is often used by practising aerodynamicists as a convenient quantity in calculations, for example thin-airfoil theory and lifting-line theory.
The challenge when using the Kutta–Joukowski theorem to determine lift is to determine the appropriate circulation for a particular airfoil. In practice, this is done by applying the Kutta condition, which uniquely prescribes the circulation for a given geometry and free-stream velocity.
A physical understanding of the theorem can be observed in the Magnus effect, which is a lift force generated by a spinning cylinder in a freestream. Here the necessary circulation is induced by the mechanical rotation acting on the boundary layer, causing it to induce a faster flow around one side of the cylinder and a slower flow around the other.  The asymmetric distribution of airspeed around the cylinder then produces a circulation in the outer inviscid flow.Clancy, L.J., Aerodynamics, Sections 4.5 and 4.6

===Pressure integration===

The force on the wing can be examined in terms of the pressure differences above and below the wing, which can be related to velocity changes by Bernoulli's principle.
The total lift force is the integral of vertical pressure forces over the entire wetted surface area of the wing:Anderson, John D. (2004), Introduction to Flight, Section 5.7 (5th edition), McGraw-Hill.  ISBN 0-07-282569-3
where:
The above lift equation neglects the skin friction forces, which typically have a negligible contribution to the lift compared to the pressure forces.  By using the streamwise vector i parallel to the freestream in place of k in the integral, we obtain an expression for the pressure drag Dp (which includes induced drag in a 3D wing).  If we use the spanwise vector j, we obtain the side force Y.
One method for calculating the pressure is Bernoulli's equation, which is the mathematical expression of Bernoulli's principle.  This method ignores the effects of viscosity, which can be important in the boundary layer and to predict friction drag, which is the other component of the total drag in addition to Dp.
The Bernoulli principle states that the sum total of energy within a parcel of fluid remains constant as long as no energy is added or removed. It is a statement of the principle of the conservation of energy applied to flowing fluids.
A substantial simplification proposes that other forms of energy changes are inconsequential during the flow of air around a wing and that energy transfer in/out of the air is not significant, so the sum of pressure energy and speed energy for any particular parcel of air must be constant. Consequently, an increase in speed must be accompanied by a decrease in pressure and vice-versa. It is named for the Dutch-Swiss mathematician and scientist Daniel Bernoulli, though it was previously understood by Leonhard Euler and others.
Bernoulli's principle provides an explanation of pressure difference in the absence of air density and temperature variation (a common approximation for low-speed aircraft).   If the air density and temperature are the same above and below a wing, a naive application of the ideal gas law requires that the pressure also be the same.  Bernoulli's principle, by including air velocity, explains this pressure difference.  The principle does not, however, specify the air velocity.  This must come from  another source, e.g., experimental data.
In order to solve for the velocity of inviscid flow around a wing, the Kutta condition must be applied to simulate the effects of viscosity.  The Kutta condition allows for the correct choice among an infinite number of flow solutions that otherwise obey the laws of conservation of mass and conservation of momentum.

==Lift forces on bluff bodies==

The flow around bluff bodies – i.e. without a streamlined shape, or stalling airfoils – may also generate lift, besides a strong drag force.  This lift may be steady, or it may oscillate due to vortex shedding. Interaction of the object's flexibility with the vortex shedding may enhance the effects of fluctuating lift and cause vortex-induced vibrations.[tpl]citation |journal=Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics |volume=36 |pages=413–455 |year=2004 |doi=10.1146/annurev.fluid.36.050802.122128 |title=Vortex-induced vibrations |first1=C.H.K. |last1=Williamson |first2=R. |last2=Govardhan |bibcode = 2004AnRFM..36..413W [/tpl] For instance, the flow around a circular cylinder generates a Kármán vortex street: vortices being shed in an alternating fashion from each side of the cylinder.  The oscillatory nature of the flow is reflected in the fluctuating lift force on the cylinder, whereas the mean lift force is negligible.  The lift force frequency is characterised by the dimensionless Strouhal number, which depends (among others) on the Reynolds number of the flow.[tpl]citation |title=Hydrodynamics around cylindrical structures |first1=B. Mutlu |last1=Sumer |first2=Jørgen |last2=Fredsøe |edition=revised |publisher=World Scientific |year=2006 |isbn=981-270-039-0 |pages=6–13, 42–45 & 50–52 [/tpl][tpl]citation |title=Flow around circular cylinders |first=M.M. |last=Zdravkovich |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2003 |isbn=0-19-856561-5 |volume=2 |pages=850–855[/tpl]
For a flexible structure, this oscillatory lift force may induce vortex-induced vibrations.  Under certain conditions – for instance resonance or strong spanwise correlation of the lift force – the resulting motion of the structure due to the lift fluctuations may be strongly enhanced.  Such vibrations may pose problems and threaten collapse in tall man-made structures like industrial chimneys.
