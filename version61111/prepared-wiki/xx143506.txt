Out Louder is an album produced as a collaboration between Medeski Martin & Wood and John Scofield.  It is the first album released under the name "Medeski Scofield Martin & Wood," since 1998's A Go Go was released under Scofield's name alone.  "A Go Go was John's record and we were essentially sidemen, where Out Louder musically comes from all of us" explains Wood.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mmw.net/news.jsp?NEWS_ID=271|title=Medeski Scofield Martin & Wood Out Louder|accessdate=2006-11-21[/tpl]
