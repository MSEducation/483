On 25 March 2005, prosecutor Olga Sánchez asserted that the bombings happened 911 days after the 11 September attacks due to the "highly symbolic and qabbalistic charge for local al-Qaida groups"Un factor "cabalístico" en la elección de la fecha de la matanza en los trenes, "El País", 2005 March 10 [tpl]es icon[/tpl] of choosing that day.

==Responsibility==

On 14 March 2004, Abu Dujan al-Afghani, a purported spokesman for Al-Qaeda in Europe, appeared in a videotape claiming responsibility for the attacks.

Mohamed Darif, a professor of political science at Hassan II University in Mohammedia, stated in 2004 that the history of the Moroccan Combat Group is directly tied to the rise of al-Qaeda in Afghanistan. According to Darif, "Since its inception at the end of the 1990s and until 2001, the role of the organisation was restricted to giving logistic support to al-Qaeda in Morocco, finding its members places to live, providing them with false papers, with the opportunity of marrying Moroccans and with false identities to allow them to travel to Europe. Since 11 September, however, which brought the Kingdom of Morocco in on the side of the fight against terrorism, the organisation switched strategies and opted for terrorist attacks within Morocco itself."[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.realinstitutoelcano.org/analisis/465/ARI-51-2004-I.pdf | title=The Moroccan Combat Group (PDF) | publisher=Real Instituto Elcano | author=Mohamed Darif | date=30 March 2004|format=PDF| accessdate=16 February 2010 [/tpl]

===Allegations of ETA involvement===

Immediate reactions to the attacks in Madrid were the several press conferences held by the Spanish prime minister José María Aznar, the government involving ETA. The Spanish government maintained this theory for two days. Because the bombs were three days before the general elections in Spain, the situation had many political interpretations. The massacre also took place exactly two and a half years after the 11 September attacks on the United States in 2001. Other interpretations of this date since 9/11 points out that the bombing took place 911 days exactly since the 11 September terrorist attack. The United States also initially believed ETA was responsible,http://213.251.145.96/cable/2004/03/04MADRID827.html [tpl]dead link|date=July 2011[/tpl] then questioning if Islamists were responsible.http://213.251.145.96/cable/2004/03/04MADRID893.html [tpl]dead link|date=July 2011[/tpl] Spain's third largest newspaper ABC, immediately labelled the attacks as "ETA's bloodiest attack."ETA comete el atentado más sangriento de su historia, ABC, 11 March 2004
Due to the government theory, statements issued shortly after the Madrid attacks, including from lehendakari Juan José Ibarretxe identified ETA as the prime suspect, but the group, which usually claims responsibility for its actions, denied any wrongdoing."Voters Oust Spanish Government", CBS News "On Sunday, a Basque-language daily published a statement by ETA in which the group for a second time denied involvement in the attacks." [tpl]WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5Pq7scNQt|date =24 June 2007| accessdate=15 July 2011 [/tpl] Later evidence strongly pointed to the involvement of extremist Islamist groups, with the Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group named as a focus of investigations.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4899544.stm |title=BBC on preparations for the trial |publisher=BBC News |date=17 July 2008 |accessdate=5 May 2011[/tpl]
Although ETA has a history of mounting bomb attacks in Madrid,[tpl]cite news|author=Font size Print E-mail Share By Francie Grace |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/03/12/world/main605547.shtml |title=Madrid Massacre Probe Widens |publisher=CBS News |date=11 March 2004 |accessdate=5 May 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110524035948/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/03/12/world/main605547.shtml| archivedate= 24 May 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl] the 11 March attacks exceeded any attack previously attempted by a European organisation. This led some experts to point out that the tactics used were more typical of Islamist militant extremist groups, perhaps with a certain link to al-Qaeda, or maybe to a new generation of ETA activists using al-Qaeda as a role model. Observers also noted that ETA customarily, but not always, issues warnings before its mass bombings and that there had been no warning for this attack. Europol director Jürgen Storbeck commented that the bombings "could have been ETA.... But we're dealing with an attack that doesn't correspond to the modus operandi they have adopted up to now".[tpl]cite news|author=Ewen MacAskill and Richard Norton-Taylor |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,1167839,00.html |title=From Bali to Madrid, attackers seek to inflict ever-greater casualties |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=5 May 2011 |date=12 March 2004[/tpl]
Political analysts believe ETA's guilt would have strengthened the PP's chances of being re-elected, as this would have been regarded as the death throes of a terrorist organisation reduced to desperate measures by the strong anti-terrorist policy of the Aznar administration. On the other hand, an Islamist attack would have been perceived as the direct result of Spain's involvement in Iraq, an unpopular war that had not been approved by the Spanish Parliament.

===Investigation===

All of the devices are thought to have been hidden inside backpacks. The police investigated reports of three people in ski masks getting on and off the trains several times at Alcalá de Henares between 7:00 and 7:10. A Renault Kangoo van was found parked outside the station at Alcalá de Henares containing detonators, audio tapes with Qur'anic verses, and cell phones.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A64633-2004Mar16?language=printer |title=Spain Campaigned to Pin Blame on ETA |work=The Washington Post |date=17 March 2004 |accessdate=5 May 2011[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2013[/tpl]
The provincial chief of TEDAX (the bomb disposal experts of the Spanish police) declared on 12 July 2004 that damage in the trains could not be caused by dynamite, but by some type of military explosive, like C3 or C4.Los TEDAX revisaron "dos veces" todos los vagones del 11-M sin encontrar Goma 2 ni la mochila de Vallecas (Libertad Digital) [tpl]es icon[/tpl] [tpl]dead link|date=July 2011[/tpl] An unnamed source from the Aznar administration claimed that the explosive used in the attacks had been Titadine (used by ETA, and intercepted on its way to Madrid 11 days before).CBS News: Madrid Massacre Probe Widens. Madrid, 11 March 2004 "The bombers used titadine, a kind of compressed dynamite also found in a bomb-laden van intercepted last month as it headed for Madrid, a source at Aznar's office said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Officials blamed ETA then, too."
In March 2007 TEDAX chief claimed that they knew that the unexploded explosive found in the Kangoo van was Goma-2 ECO the very day of the bombings.El 11M se supo que el explosivo era Goma 2 ECO [tpl]Wayback|df=yes|url=http://videos.abc.es/informaciondecontenido.php?con=292|date =20090222010702[/tpl] He also asserted that "it is impossible to know" the components of the explosives that went off in the trains – though he later asserted that it was dynamite. The Judge Javier Gómez Bermúdez replied "I cannot understand" to these assertions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2007/03/14/espana/1173863471.html |title=El ex jefe de Tedax reconoce que sus análisis dejaron 'interrogantes' sobre el explosivo |work=El Mundo |location=Spain |date=14 March 2007 |accessdate=5 May 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110606085519/http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2007/03/14/espana/1173863471.html| archivedate= 6 June 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

===Examination of unexploded devices===

A radio report mentioned a plastic explosive called "Special C". However, the government said that the explosive found in an unexploded device, discovered among bags thought to be victims' lost luggage, was the Spanish made Goma-2 ECO. The unexploded device contained [tpl]convert|10|kg|abbr=on[/tpl] of explosive with [tpl]convert|1|kg|abbr=on[/tpl] of nails and screws packed around it as shrapnel.Millions rally in anger at Madrid bombers (Daily Telegraph) In the aftermath of the attacks, however, the chief coroner alleged that no shrapnel was found in any of the victims.[tpl]cite web|url=http://libertaddigital.com/noticias/kw/11-m/11m/kw/noticia_1276321976.html |title=',"Ni clavos, ni tuercas, ni tornillos; no había metralla entre nuestros 191 muertos"', |publisher=Libertaddigital.com |accessdate=5 May 2011[/tpl]
Goma-2 ECO was never before used by al-Qaeda, but the explosive and the modus operandi were described by The Independent as ETA trademarks, although the Daily Telegraph came to the opposite conclusion.Madrid: The Aftermath: Spain admits bombs were the work of Islamists "For the first time in its history al-Qa'ida has used not the cheap and primitive fertiliser-based bombs familiar in attacks from Yemen to Istanbul, but Goma 2 ECO gelignite, detonated by mobile phones. This sophisticated twin technique has previously been the trademark of ETA, the Basque separatist group." [tpl]dead link|date=July 2011[/tpl]
Two bombs—one in Atocha and another one in El Pozo stations, numbers 11 and 12—were detonated accidentally by the TEDAX. According to the provincial chief of the TEDAX, deactivated rucksacks contained some other type of explosive. The 13th bomb, which was transferred to a police station, contained dynamite, although it did not explode because it was missing two wires connecting the explosives to the detonator. That bomb used a mobile phone (Mitsubishi Trium) as a timer, requiring a SIM card to activate the alarm and thereby detonate.La Policía encuentra una decimotercera mochila bomba en la comisaría de Puente de Vallecas (El Mundo) [tpl]es icon[/tpl] The analysis of the SIM card allowed the police to arrest an alleged perpetrator.

===Suicide of suspects===

On 3 April 2004, in Leganés, south Madrid, four terrorists died in an apparent suicide explosion, killing one Grupo Especial de Operaciones (GEO) (Spanish special police assault unit) police officer and wounding eleven policemen. According to witnesses and media, between five and eight suspects escaped that day.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3560603.stm|title=Madrid bombing suspects|publisher=BBC News |date=10 March 2005|accessdate=31 October 2007[/tpl]
Security forces carried out a controlled explosion of a suspicious package found near the Atocha station and subsequently deactivated the two undetonated devices on the Téllez train. A third unexploded device was later brought from the station at El Pozo to a police station in Vallecas, and became a central piece of evidence for the investigation. It appears that the El Pozo bomb failed to detonate because a cell-phone alarm used to trigger the bomb was set 12 hours late.[tpl]cite news|last=Ghosh |first=Aparisim |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2050314,00.html |title=A Strike at Europe's Heart |work=Time |date=14 March 2004 |accessdate=5 May 2011[/tpl]

===Conspiracy theories===

Sectors of the People's Party (PP), and certain media, such as El Mundo newspaper and the COPE radio station,Spain’s 11-M and the right’s revenge (Open Democracy) continue to support theories relating the attack to a vast conspiracy to remove the governing party from power. Support for the conspiracy was also given by the Asociación de Víctimas del Terrorismo (AVT), Spain's largest association of victims of terrorism.
These theories speculate that ETA and members of the security forces and national and foreign (Morocco) secret services were involved in the bombings.Zaplana claims PSOE "afraid that the truth will come out", The Spain Herald, 30 March 2005.

===Trial===

Judge Juan del Olmo found "local cells of Islamic extremists inspired through the Internet" guilty for the 11 March attacks,El auto de procesamiento por el 11-M (El Mundo) [tpl]es icon[/tpl] not Armed Islamic Group or Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group. These local cells consist of hashish traffickers of Moroccan origin, remotely linked to an al-Qaeda cell that had been already captured. These groups bought the explosives (dynamite Goma-2 ECO) from low-level thieves, police and Guardia Civil confidants in Asturias using money from the small-scale drug trafficking.[tpl]cite news|last=Crumley |first=Bruce |url=http://www.time.com/time/europe/magazine/printout/0,13155,901050321-1037617,00.html |title=Across the Divide |work=Time |date=13 March 2005 |accessdate=5 May 2011[/tpl]
According to El Mundo, "the notes on the Moroccan confidant 'Cartagena' prove that the Police had the leaders of the cell responsible for the 11 March attacks under surveillance."

The trial of 29 accused began on 15 February 2007. According to El País, "the Court dismantled one by one all conspiracy theories" and demonstrated that any link or implication of the bombings with ETA was either misleading or without any foundation. During the trial the defendants withdrew their previous declarations and denied any involvement.Comienza en Madrid el juicio por el mayor atentado islamista registrado en Europa, El País, 15 February 2007 [tpl]es icon[/tpl]El Morabit niega ahora haber sido avisado de los atentados del 11-M, El Mundo, 20 February 2007 [tpl]es icon[/tpl][ref]

==Police surveillance and informants==

In the investigations carried out after the bombings to find out what went wrong in the security services, many individual negligences and miscoordinations between different branches of the police were found. The group dealing with Islamist extremists was very small and in spite of having carried out some surveillances, they were unable to stop the bombings. Also some of the criminals involved in the "Little Mafia" who provided the explosives were police informants and had leaked to their case officers some tips that were not followed up on.
Some of the alleged perpetrators of the bombing were reportedly under surveillance by the Spanish police since 2001."Spain: State Funeral For Madrid Bombing Victims Gathers World Leaders" Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty: "The main suspect remains Moroccan Jamal Zougam, who allegedly had close ties to Islamist militants and who has been under watch by Spanish, French, and Moroccan agents since 2001""Spanish investigators confident" "The lead suspect is Jamal Zougam, who allegedly has close ties with Islamist militants and has been under watch by Spanish, French and Moroccan agents since 2001 at least."Un inspector asegura que perseguían a varios de los acusados desde enero de 2003, ABC: "An inspector assures that several accused were being pursued since January 2003"

==Controversies==

The authorship of the bombings remains a controversial issue in Spain. Sectors of the Partido Popular (PP) and some of the PP-friendly media outlets (primarily El Mundo and the Cadena COPE radio station) claim that there are inconsistencies and contradictions in the Spanish judicial investigation.
As Spanish and international investigations continue to claim the unlikeliness of ETA's active implication, these claims have shifted from direct accusations involving the Basque separatist organizationEl Mundo[tpl]dead link|date=January 2013[/tpl] [tpl]es icon[/tpl] [tpl]WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5Pq7t2P8z|date =24 June 2007| accessdate=15 July 2011 [/tpl] to less specific insinuations and general skepticism.http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2007/06/12/espana/1181678226.html [tpl]es icon[/tpl]
