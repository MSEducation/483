Star Wars is an American epic space opera franchise centered on a film series created by George Lucas. The film series, consisting of two trilogies, has spawned an extensive media franchise called the Expanded Universe including books, television series, computer and video games, and comic books. These supplements to the franchise resulted in significant development of the series' fictional universe, keeping the franchise active in the 16-year interim between the two film trilogies. The franchise depicts a galaxy described as far, far away in the distant past, and it commonly portrays Jedi as a representation of good, in conflict with the Sith, their evil counterpart. Their weapon of choice, the lightsaber, is commonly recognized in popular culture. The franchise's storylines contain many themes, with strong influences from philosophy and religion.
The first film in the series was originally released on May 25, 1977, under the title Star Wars,  by 20th Century Fox, and became a worldwide pop culture phenomenon, followed by two sequels, released at three-year intervals. Sixteen years after the release of the trilogy's final film, the first in a new prequel trilogy of films was released. The three prequel films were also released at three-year intervals, with the final film of the trilogy released on May 19, 2005. In October 2012, The Walt Disney Company acquired Lucasfilm for $4.05 billion and announced that it would produce three new films, with the first film, Star Wars Episode VII, planned for release in 2015.[tpl]cite web|url = http://money.msn.com/business-news/article.aspx?feed=AP&Date=20121030&ID=15733883 |title= Disney to make new 'Star Wars' films, buy Lucas co | last= Nakashima | first = Ryan |work=MSN Money|date=October 30, 2012|accessdate=October 31, 2012[/tpl]  20th Century Fox still retains the distribution rights to the first two Star Wars trilogies, owning permanent rights for the original film Episode IV: A New Hope, while holding the rights to Episodes I–III, V, and VI until May 2020.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/tangled-rights-could-tie-up-384541 | title=Tangled Rights Could Tie Up Ultimate 'Star Wars' Box Set (Analysis) | work =The Hollywood Reporter | date=October 30, 2012 | accessdate=November 12, 2012 | last =Masters | first = Kim[/tpl]
Reactions to the original trilogy were mostly positive, with the last film being considered the weakest, while the prequel trilogy received a more mixed reaction, with most of the praise being for the final film, according to most review aggregator websites. All six of the main films in the series were also nominated for or won Academy Awards. All of the main films have been box office successes, with the overall box office revenue generated by the Star Wars films (including the theatrical Star Wars: The Clone Wars) totalling $4.38 billion,[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/series/StarWars.php | title = Star Wars – Box Office History | work = The numbers | accessdate= June 17, 2010[/tpl] making it the fifth-highest-grossing film series.[tpl]cite web |title=Movie Franchises |work=The Numbers |publisher = Nash Information Services |url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/series/franchisesW.php |accessdate=January 3, 2013[/tpl] The success has also led to multiple re-releases in theaters for the series.

==Setting==

The events depicted in Star Wars media take place in a fictional galaxy. Many species of alien creatures (often humanoid) are depicted. Robotic droids are also commonplace and are generally built to serve their owners.  Space travel is common, and many planets in the galaxy are members of a Galactic Republic, later reorganized as the Galactic Empire.
One of the prominent elements of Star Wars is the "Force", an omnipresent energy that can be harnessed by those with that ability, known as Force-sensitives. It is described in the first produced film as "an energy field created by all living things that surrounds us, penetrates us, and binds the galaxy together."[tpl]Cite video|title=Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|publisher=20th Century Fox|date=2006|medium=DVD[/tpl] The Force allows users to perform various supernatural feats (such as telekinesis, clairvoyance, precognition, and mind control) and can amplify certain physical traits, such as speed and reflexes; these abilities vary between characters and can be improved through training.  While the Force can be used for good, it has a dark side that, when pursued, imbues users with hatred, aggression, and malevolence. The six films feature the Jedi, who use the Force for good, and the Sith, who use the dark side for evil in an attempt to take over the galaxy. In the Star Wars Expanded Universe, many dark side users are Dark Jedi rather than Sith, mainly because of the "Rule of Two" (see Sith Origin).[tpl]Cite video| title= Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace | publisher=20th Century Fox|date=2001|medium=DVD[/tpl][tpl]Cite video | title =Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back|publisher=20th Century Fox|date=2004|medium=DVD[/tpl][tpl]Cite video|title = Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi|publisher=20th Century Fox|date=2004|medium= DVD[/tpl]

==Theatrical films==

The film series began with Star Wars, released on May 25, 1977. This was followed by two sequels: The Empire Strikes Back, released on May 21, 1980, and Return of the Jedi, released on May 25, 1983. The opening crawl of the sequels disclosed that they were numbered as "Episode V" and "Episode VI" respectively, though the films were generally advertised solely under their subtitles. Though the first film in the series was simply titled Star Wars, with its 1981 re-release it had the subtitle Episode IV: A New Hope added to remain consistent with its sequel, and to establish it as the middle chapter of a continuing saga.[tpl]Cite video| people=Lucas, George|date=2004|title=DVD commentary for Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox[/tpl]
In 1997, to correspond with the 20th anniversary of A New Hope, Lucas released a "Special Edition" of the Star Wars trilogy to theaters. The re-release featured alterations to the three films, primarily motivated by the improvement of CGI and other special effects technologies, which allowed visuals that were not possible to achieve at the time of the original filmmaking. Lucas continued to make changes to the films for subsequent releases, such as the first ever DVD release of the original trilogy on September 21, 2004 and the first ever Blu-ray release of all six films on September 16, 2011.[tpl]cite web|accessdate=March 28, 2008|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-56847187.html|title=The Force returns: ‘Star Wars' Special Edition features some new tinkering but same old thrills | work= The Washington Times |date= January 26, 1997| last = Arnold | first = Gary[/tpl]
More than two decades after the release of the original film, the series continued with the long-awaited prequel trilogy; consisting of Episode I: The Phantom Menace, released on May 19, 1999; Episode II: Attack of the Clones, released on May 16, 2002; and Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, released on May 19, 2005.[tpl]cite web|accessdate=March 27, 2008|url=http://www.starwars.com/episode-iii/bts/production/news20040405.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415144223/http://www.starwars.com/episode-iii/bts/production/news20040405.html|archivedate=April 15, 2008|title=Episode III Release Dates Announced|publisher=Star Wars|date=April 5, 2004[/tpl] On August 15, 2008, Star Wars: The Clone Wars was released theatrically as a lead-in to the weekly animated TV series of the same name.

In 2013, it was announced the original Star Wars film will be the first Hollywood film to be dubbed into Navajo.[tpl]cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Star-Wars-translated-into-Navajo/tabid/418/articleID/295833/Default.aspx|work=3 News NZ |title= Star Wars translated into Navajo| date=April 29, 2013[/tpl]

===Plot overview===

The original trilogy begins with the Galactic Empire nearing completion of the Death Star space station, which will allow the Empire to crush the Rebel Alliance, an organized resistance formed to combat Emperor Palpatine's tyranny. Palpatine's Sith apprentice Darth Vader captures Princess Leia, a member of the rebellion who has stolen the plans to the Death Star and hidden them in the astromech droid R2-D2. R2, along with his protocol droid counterpart C-3PO, escapes to the desert planet Tatooine. There, the droids are purchased by farm boy Luke Skywalker and his step-uncle and aunt. While Luke is cleaning R2, he accidentally triggers a message put into the droid by Leia, who asks for assistance from the legendary Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi. Luke later assists the droids in finding the exiled Jedi, who is now passing as an old hermit under the alias Ben Kenobi. When Luke asks about his father, whom he has never met, Obi-Wan tells him that Anakin Skywalker was a great Jedi who was betrayed and murdered by Vader.[tpl]cite web |accessdate= March 29, 2008|url= http://www.ruinedendings.com/film1226plot | title =Star Wars plot summary |publisher=Ruined Endings[/tpl] Obi-Wan and Luke hire the smuggler Han Solo and his Wookiee co-pilot Chewbacca to take them to Alderaan, Leia's home world, which they eventually find has been destroyed by the Death Star. Once on board the space station, Luke and Han rescue Leia while Obi-Wan allows himself to be killed during a lightsaber duel with Vader; his sacrifice allows the group to escape with the plans that help the Rebels destroy the Death Star. Luke himself (guided by the power of the Force) fires the shot that destroys the deadly space station during the Battle of Yavin.
Three years later, Luke travels to find the Jedi Master Yoda, now living in exile on the swamp-infested world of Dagobah, to begin his Jedi training. However, Luke's training is interrupted when Vader lures him into a trap by capturing Han and his friends at Cloud City. During a fierce lightsaber duel, Vader reveals that he is Luke's father and attempts to turn him to the dark side of the Force. Luke escapes and, after rescuing Han from the gangster Jabba the Hutt, returns to Yoda to complete his training, only to find the 900-year-old Jedi Master on his deathbed. Before he dies, Yoda confirms that Vader is Luke's father. Moments later, Obi-Wan's spirit tells Luke that he must confront his father before he can become a Jedi, and that Leia is his twin sister.
As the Rebels attack the second Death Star, Luke battles Vader as the Emperor watches; both Sith Lords intend to turn Luke to the dark side and take him as their apprentice. During the subsequent lightsaber duel, Luke succumbs to his anger and brutally overpowers Vader, but controls himself at the last minute; realizing that he is about to suffer his father's fate, he spares Vader's life and proudly declares his allegiance to the Jedi. An enraged Palpatine then attempts to kill Luke with Force lightning, a sight that moves Vader to turn and kill the Emperor, suffering mortal wounds in the process. Redeemed, Anakin Skywalker dies in his son's arms. Luke becomes a full-fledged Jedi, and the Rebels destroy the second Death Star.
The prequel trilogy begins (32 years before the original film) with the corrupt Trade Federation setting up a blockade of battleships around the planet Naboo in response to the Galactic Republic's taxation of trade routes. The Sith Lord Darth Sidious had secretly planned the blockade to give his alter ego, Senator Palpatine, a pretense to overthrow and replace the Supreme Chancellor of the Republic. At the Chancellor's request, the Jedi Knight Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice, a younger Obi-Wan Kenobi, are sent to Naboo to negotiate with the Federation. However, the two Jedi are forced to instead help the Queen of Naboo, Padmé Amidala, escape from the blockade and plea her planet's crisis before the Republic Senate on Coruscant. When their starship is damaged during the escape, they land on Tatooine for repairs, where Qui-Gon discovers a nine-year-old Anakin Skywalker. Qui-Gon comes to believe that Anakin is the "Chosen One" foretold by Jedi prophecy to bring balance to the Force, and he helps liberate the boy from slavery. The Jedi Council, led by Yoda, reluctantly allows Obi-Wan to train Anakin after Qui-Gon is killed by Palpatine's first apprentice, Darth Maul, during the Battle of Naboo.
The remainder of the prequel trilogy chronicles Anakin's gradual descent to the dark side as he fights in the Clone Wars, which Palpatine secretly engineers to destroy the Jedi Order and lure Anakin into his service. Anakin and Padmé fall in love and secretly wed, and eventually Padmé becomes pregnant. Anakin has a prophetic vision of Padmé dying in childbirth, and Palpatine convinces him that the dark side of the Force holds the power to save her life. Desperate, Anakin submits to Palpatine's Sith teachings and is renamed Darth Vader.
While Palpatine re-organizes the Republic into the tyrannical Empire, Vader participates in the extermination of the Jedi Order, culminating in a lightsaber duel between himself and Obi-Wan on the volcanic planet Mustafar. Obi-Wan defeats his former apprentice and friend, severing his limbs and leaving him to burn to death on the shores of a lava flow. Palpatine arrives shortly afterward and saves Vader by placing him into a mechanical black mask and suit of armor that serves as a permanent life support system. At the same time, Padmé dies while giving birth to twins Luke and Leia. Obi-Wan and Yoda, now the only remaining Jedi alive, agree to separate the twins and keep them hidden from both Vader and the Emperor, until the time comes when Anakin's children can be used to help overthrow the Empire.

===Themes===

Aside from its well known science fictional technology, Star Wars features elements such as knighthood, chivalry, and princesses that are related to archetypes of the fantasy genre.[tpl]Cite video|title=Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy|medium=DVD|date=2004|publisher=Star Wars Trilogy Box Set DVD documentary[/tpl] The Star Wars world, unlike fantasy and science-fiction films that featured sleek and futuristic settings, was portrayed as dirty and grimy. Lucas' vision of a "used future" was further popularized in the science fiction-horror films Alien,[tpl]Cite video|title=The Force Is With Them: The Legacy of Star Wars|publisher=Star Wars Original Trilogy DVD Box Set: Bonus Materials|date=2004[/tpl] which was set on a dirty space freighter; Mad Max 2, which is set in a post-apocalyptic desert; and Blade Runner, which is set in a crumbling, dirty city of the future. Lucas made a conscious effort to parallel scenes and dialogue between films, and especially to parallel the journeys of Luke Skywalker with that of his father Anakin when making the prequels.
Star Wars contains many themes of political science that mainly favor democracy over dictatorship. Political science has been an important element of Star Wars since the franchise first launched in 1977. The plot climax of Star Wars is modeled after the fall of the democratic Roman Republic and the formation of an empire.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.ca/books/about/Star_Wars_and_History.html?id=m81Bg4E_y_IC |title=Star Wars and History - Lucasfilm - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-08-30[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/nights/audio/2388685/star-wars-and-the-roman-empire |title=Radio New Zealand : National : Nights : 26 Aug 2010 : Star Wars and the Roman Empire |publisher=Radionz.co.nz |date=2010-08-26 |accessdate=2013-08-30[/tpl] Star Wars also reflects on the events in America following the September 11 attacks.

===Technical information===

All six films of the Star Wars series were shot in an aspect ratio of 2.39:1. The original trilogy was shot with anamorphic lenses. Episodes IV and V were shot in Panavision, while Episode VI was shot in Joe Dunton Camera (JDC) scope. Episode I was shot with Hawk anamorphic lenses on Arriflex cameras, and Episodes II and III were shot with Sony's CineAlta high-definition digital cameras.[tpl]cite web|accessdate=March 27, 2008|url = http://www.thedigitalbits.com/articles/anamorphic/aspectratios/widescreenorama.html |title=Widescreen-O-Rama|publisher=The Digital Bits[/tpl]

Lucas hired 'the Dean of Special Effects' John Stears, who created R2-D2, Luke Skywalker's Landspeeder, the Jedi Knights' lightsabers, and the Death Star."John Stears, 64, Dies; Film-Effects Wizard".

Anderson trained actor Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker) and performed all the sword stunts as Darth Vader during the lightsaber duels in The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, wearing Vader's costume. Anderson's role in the original Star Wars trilogy was highlighted in the film Reclaiming the Blade, where he shares his experiences as the fight choreographer developing the lightsaber techniques for the movies.[tpl]Citation | url = http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0961079/ | title = Reclaiming the Blade | year = 2009 | publisher = IMDb[/tpl]

===Production history===

====Original trilogy====

In 1971, Universal Studios agreed to make American Graffiti and Star Wars in a two-picture contract, although Star Wars was later rejected in its early concept stages. American Graffiti was completed in 1973 and, a few months later, Lucas wrote a short summary called "The Journal of the Whills", which told the tale of the training of apprentice CJ Thorpe as a "Jedi-Bendu" space commando by the legendary Mace Windy.[tpl]Sfn |Rinzler| 2007| p= 8[/tpl] Frustrated that his story was too difficult to understand, Lucas then began writing a 13-page treatment called The Star Wars on April 17, 1973, which had thematic parallels with Akira Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress.[tpl]Sfn |Kaminski| 2007| p= 50[/tpl] By 1974, he had expanded the treatment into a rough draft screenplay, adding elements such as the Sith, the Death Star, and a protagonist named Annikin Starkiller.
For the second draft, Lucas made heavy simplifications, and introduced the young hero on a farm as Luke Starkiller. Annikin became Luke's father, a wise Jedi knight. "The Force" was also introduced as a mystical energy field. The next draft removed the father character and replaced him with a substitute named Ben Kenobi, and in 1976 a fourth draft had been prepared for principal photography. The film was titled Adventures of Luke Starkiller, as taken from the Journal of the Whills, Saga I: The Star Wars. During production, Lucas changed Luke's name to Skywalker and altered the title to simply The Star Wars and finally Star Wars.[tpl]cite web|accessdate=March 27, 2008|url=http://starwarz.com/starkiller/scripts.htm|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060628065925/http://www.starwarz.com/starkiller/scripts.htm |archivedate=June 28, 2006|title=Starkiller |publisher=Jedi Bendu[/tpl]
At that point, Lucas was not expecting the film to become part of a series. The fourth draft of the script underwent subtle changes that made it more satisfying as a self-contained film, ending with the destruction of the Empire itself by way of destroying the Death Star. However, Lucas had previously conceived of the film as the first in a series of adventures. Later, he realized the film would not in fact be the first in the sequence, but a film in the second trilogy in the saga. This is stated explicitly in George Lucas' preface to the 1994 reissue of Splinter of the Mind's Eye:
The second draft contained a teaser for a never-made sequel about "The Princess of Ondos," and by the time of the third draft some months later Lucas had negotiated a contract that gave him rights to make two sequels. Not long after, Lucas met with author Alan Dean Foster, and hired him to write these two sequels as novels.[tpl]Sfn |Rinzler| 2007| p = 107[/tpl] The intention was that if Star Wars were successful, Lucas could adapt the novels into screenplays.[tpl]Sfn | Kaminski | 2007 | p = 38[/tpl] He had also by that point developed an elaborate backstory to aid his writing process.[tpl]Sfn |Kaminski|2007|p= 134[/tpl]
When Star Wars proved successful, Lucas decided to use the film as the basis for an elaborate serial, although at one point he considered walking away from the series altogether.[tpl]Sfn |Kaminski| 2007| p=142[/tpl] However, Lucas wanted to create an independent filmmaking center—what would become Skywalker Ranch—and saw an opportunity to use the series as a financing agent.[tpl]Cite book| last = Baxter | first = John| title= Mythmaker| year = 1999 | page = 173 | isbn=0-380-97833-4[/tpl] Alan Dean Foster had already begun writing the first sequel novel, but Lucas decided to abandon his plan to adapt Foster's work; the book was released as Splinter of the Mind's Eye the following year. At first Lucas envisioned a series of films with no set number of entries, like the James Bond series. In an interview with Rolling Stone in August 1977, he said that he wanted his friends to each take a turn at directing the films and giving unique interpretations on the series. He also said that the backstory in which Darth Vader turns to the dark side, kills Luke's father and fights Ben Kenobi on a volcano as the Galactic Republic falls would make an excellent sequel.
Later that year, Lucas hired science fiction author Leigh Brackett to write Star Wars II with him. They held story conferences and, by late November 1977, Lucas had produced a handwritten treatment called The Empire Strikes Back. The treatment is very similar to the final film, except that Darth Vader does not reveal he is Luke's father. In the first draft that Brackett would write from this, Luke's father appears as a ghost to instruct Luke.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.hollywoodgothique.com/starwarstrilogy1997.html | publisher = Hollywood Gothique | title= Star Wars: The Original Trilogy – Then And Now | last = Biodrowski | first = Steve | accessdate=March 28, 2008[/tpl]
Brackett finished her first draft in early 1978; Lucas has said he was disappointed with it, but before he could discuss it with her, she died of cancer.[tpl]Sfn | Bouzereau |1997|p=144[/tpl] With no writer available, Lucas had to write his next draft himself. It was this draft in which Lucas first made use of the "Episode" numbering for the films; Empire Strikes Back was listed as Episode II.[tpl]Sfn |Bouzereau|1997|p=135[/tpl] As Michael Kaminski argues in The Secret History of Star Wars, the disappointment with the first draft probably made Lucas consider different directions in which to take the story.[tpl]Sfn |Kaminski|2007|p=161[/tpl] He made use of a new plot twist: Darth Vader claims to be Luke's father. According to Lucas, he found this draft enjoyable to write, as opposed to the yearlong struggles writing the first film, and quickly wrote two more drafts,[tpl]harvnb |Bouzereau|1997|p= 123[/tpl] both in April 1978. He also took the script to a darker extreme by having Han Solo imprisoned in carbonite and left in limbo.[tpl]Cite video|title=Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back|medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox| year = 2004[/tpl]
This new story point of Darth Vader being Luke's father had drastic effects on the series. Michael Kaminski argues in his book that it is unlikely that the plot point had ever seriously been considered or even conceived of before 1978, and that the first film was clearly operating under an alternate storyline where Vader was separate from Luke's father;[tpl]Sfn |Kaminski|2007|pp=120–21[/tpl] there is not a single reference to this plot point before 1978. After writing the second and third drafts of Empire Strikes Back in which the point was introduced, Lucas reviewed the new backstory he had created: Anakin Skywalker was Ben Kenobi's brilliant student and had a child named Luke, but was swayed to the dark side by Emperor Palpatine (who became a Sith and not simply a politician). Anakin battled Ben Kenobi on the site of a volcano and was wounded, but then resurrected as Darth Vader. Meanwhile Kenobi hid Luke on Tatooine while the Republic became the Empire and Vader systematically hunted down and killed the Jedi.[tpl]Sfn |Kaminski|2007|pp= 164–65[/tpl]
With this new backstory in place, Lucas decided that the series would be a trilogy, changing Empire Strikes Back from Episode II to Episode V in the next draft. Lawrence Kasdan, who had just completed writing Raiders of the Lost Ark, was then hired to write the next drafts, and was given additional input from director Irvin Kershner. Kasdan, Kershner, and producer Gary Kurtz saw the film as a more serious and adult film, which was helped by the new, darker storyline, and developed the series from the light adventure roots of the first film.[tpl]Sfn |Kaminski|2007|p= 178[/tpl]
By the time he began writing Episode VI in 1981 (then titled Revenge of the Jedi), much had changed. Making Empire Strikes Back was stressful and costly, and Lucas' personal life was disintegrating. Burned out and not wanting to make any more Star Wars films, he vowed that he was done with the series in a May 1983 interview with Time magazine. Lucas' 1981 rough drafts had Darth Vader competing with the Emperor for possession of Luke—and in the second script, the "revised rough draft", Vader became a sympathetic character. Lawrence Kasdan was hired to take over once again and, in these final drafts, Vader was explicitly redeemed and finally unmasked. This change in character would provide a springboard to the "Tragedy of Darth Vader" storyline that underlies the prequels.[tpl]cite web |accessdate=March 28, 2008 |url=http://www.starwars.com/bio/lawrencekasdan.html |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080606085730/http://www.starwars.com/bio/lawrencekasdan.html |archivedate=June 6, 2008 |title=Lawrence Kasdan |publisher=Star Wars[/tpl]

====Prequel trilogy====

After losing much of his fortune in a divorce settlement in 1987, Lucas had no desire to return to Star Wars, and had unofficially canceled his sequel trilogy by the time of Return of the Jedi.[tpl]Sfn |Kaminski|2007|p=227[/tpl] Nevertheless, the prequels, which were only still a series of basic ideas partially pulled from his original drafts of "The Star Wars" continued to fascinate him with the possibilities of technical advances would make it possible to revisit his 20-year-old material. After Star Wars became popular once again, in the wake of Dark Horse's comic book line and Timothy Zahn's trilogy of novels, Lucas saw that there was still a large audience. His children were older, and with the explosion of CGI technology he was now considering returning to directing.[tpl]Sfn |Kaminski|2007|pp=294–95[/tpl] By 1993 it was announced, in Variety among other sources, that he would be making the prequels. He began penning more to the story, now indicating the series would be a tragic one examining Anakin Skywalker's fall to the dark side. Lucas also began to change how the prequels would exist relative to the originals; at first they were supposed to be a "filling-in" of history tangential to the originals, but now he saw that they could form the beginning of one long story that started with Anakin's childhood and ended with his death. This was the final step towards turning the film series into a "Saga".[tpl]Sfn |Kaminski|2007|pp= 299–300[/tpl]
In 1994, Lucas finally had his first screenplay titled Episode I: The Beginning. Following the release of that film, Lucas announced that he would also be directing the next two, and began working on Episode II at that time.[tpl]Cite journal|journal=Star Wars Insider|title= Star Wars Insider|issue= 45|page= 19 | ref = harv[/tpl] The first draft of Episode II was completed just weeks before principal photography, and Lucas hired Jonathan Hales, a writer from The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, to polish it.[tpl]Sfn |Kaminski|2007| p= 371[/tpl] Unsure of a title, Lucas had jokingly called the film "Jar Jar's Great Adventure."[tpl]Sfn |Kaminski|2007|p=374[/tpl] In writing The Empire Strikes Back, Lucas initially decided that Lando Calrissian was a clone and came from a planet of clones which caused the "Clone Wars" mentioned by Princess Leia in A New Hope;[tpl]Sfn |Bouzereau|1997|p=196[/tpl][tpl]Sfn |Kaminski |2008 |p= 158[/tpl] he later came up with an alternate concept of an army of clone shocktroopers from a remote planet which attacked the Republic and were repelled by the Jedi.[tpl]Sfn | Kaminski |2008 |p= 162[/tpl]  The basic elements of that backstory became the plot basis for Episode II, with the new wrinkle added that Palpatine secretly orchestrated the crisis.[tpl]Cite video|title= Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones|publisher= 20th Century Fox| date = 2002 | medium = DVD[/tpl]
Lucas began working on Episode III before Attack of the Clones was released, offering concept artists that the film would open with a montage of seven Clone War battles.[tpl]Sfn |Rinzler|2005|pp= 13–15[/tpl] As he reviewed the storyline that summer, however, he says he radically re-organized the plot.[tpl]Sfn |Rinzler|2005|p = 36[/tpl] Michael Kaminski, in The Secret History of Star Wars, offers evidence that issues in Anakin's fall to the dark side prompted Lucas to make massive story changes, first revising the opening sequence to have Palpatine kidnapped and his apprentice, Count Dooku, murdered by Anakin as the first act in the latter's turn towards the dark side.[tpl]Sfn |Kaminski|2007|pp=380–84[/tpl] After principal photography was complete in 2003, Lucas made even more massive changes in Anakin's character, re-writing his entire turn to the dark side; he would now turn primarily in a quest to save Padmé's life, rather than the previous version in which that reason was one of several, including that he genuinely believed that the Jedi were evil and plotting to take over the Republic. This fundamental re-write was accomplished both through editing the principal footage, and new and revised scenes filmed during pick-ups in 2004.[tpl]Cite video | title =Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith documentary "Within a Minute"|medium=DVD documentary|date= 2005[/tpl]
Lucas often exaggerated the amount of material he wrote for the series; much of it stemmed from the post‐1978 period when the series grew into a phenomenon. Michael Kaminski explained that these exaggerations were both a publicity and security measure. Kaminski rationalized that since the series' story radically changed throughout the years, it was always Lucas' intention to change the original story retroactively because audiences would only view the material from his perspective.[tpl]Cite video|title=Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith|medium= DVD|date= 2005|publisher= 20th Century Fox[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|title= Director George Lucas Takes a Look Back—and Ahead| last =Arnold | first = William|publisher= Seattle Post-Intelligencer | date = May 12, 2005[/tpl] When congratulating the producers of the TV series Lost in 2010, Lucas himself jokingly admitted, "when Star Wars first came out, I didn't know where it was going either.

====Sequel trilogy====

The sequel trilogy was a reportedly planned trilogy of films (Episodes VII, VIII and IX) by Lucasfilm as a sequel to the original Star Wars trilogy (Episodes IV, V and VI) released between 1977 and 1983.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/NEDgFKFJPSFEID|title= Mark Hamill talks Star Wars 7, 8 and 9!|date= September 10, 2004|publisher=Movieweb|accessdate=October 18, 2008[/tpl] While the similarly discussed Star Wars prequel trilogy (Episodes I, II and III) was ultimately released between 1999 and 2005, Lucasfilm and George Lucas have for many years denied plans for a sequel trilogy, insisting that Star Wars is meant to be a six-part series.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.killermovies.com/s/starwarsepisodeiii/articles/4415.html|title=George Lucas talks on Star Wars sequels 7, 8 & 9|date=September 13, 2004|publisher=Killer Movies|accessdate=October 18, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.industrycentral.net/director_interviews/GL01.HTM|title=George Lucas (Star Wars: Episode I)|first=Mr. Showbiz|publisher=Industry Central|accessdate=October 18, 2008[/tpl] In [tpl]Start date|2008|5[/tpl], speaking about the upcoming Star Wars: The Clone Wars, Lucas maintained his status on the sequel trilogy:
[tpl]quote|"I get asked all the time, 'What happens after Return of the Jedi?,' and there really is no answer for that.

In January 2012, Lucas announced that he would step away from blockbuster films and instead produce smaller art-house films. In an interview regarding whether or not the scrutiny he received from the prequel trilogy and the alterations made on the original trilogy were a factor in his retirement, Lucas stated:
[tpl]quote|"Why would I make any more,... when everybody yells at you all the time and says what a terrible person you are?"[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/17/george-lucas-done-with-star-wars-red-tails_n_1210951.html |title=George Lucas Done With 'Star Wars' Fanboys, Talks 'Red Tails' |last= |first=|work=The Huffington Post|date=January 17, 2012|accessdate=January 17, 2012[/tpl][/tpl]
In October 2012, The Walt Disney Company agreed to buy Lucasfilm and announced that a new Star Wars Episode VII film will be released in 2015.

The canon that he created was the Star Wars saga. Right now, Episode VII falls within that canon. The spin-off movies, or we may come up with some other way to call those films, they exist within that vast universe that he created. There is no attempt being made to carry characters (from the standalone films) in and out of the saga episodes.

====3D releases====

At a ShoWest convention in 2005, Lucas demonstrated new technology and stated that he planned to release the six films in a new 3D film format, beginning with A New Hope in 2007.[tpl]Cite news|url= http://film.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/Guardian/0,4029,1440820,00.html | title =Star Wars to enter third dimension|publisher=Guardian|date=March 18, 2005|accessdate=January 9, 2008|location= London[/tpl] However, by January 2007, Lucasfilm stated on StarWars.com that "there are no definitive plans or dates for releasing the Star Wars saga in 3-D." At Celebration Europe in July 2007, Rick McCallum confirmed that Lucasfilm is "planning to take all six films and turn them into 3-D," but they are "waiting for the companies out there that are developing this technology to bring it down to a cost level that makes it worthwhile for everybody".[tpl]cite web|title= Rick McCallum Talks Live Action TV Series and Star Wars 3-D|publisher=The Official Star Wars Blog|date=July 14, 2007|url= http://starwarsblog.wordpress.com/2007/07/14/rick-mccallum-talks-live-action-tv-series-and-star-wars-3-d/ |accessdate= July 17, 2007[/tpl] In July 2008, Jeffrey Katzenberg, the CEO of DreamWorks Animation, revealed that Lucas plans to redo all six of the movies in 3D.[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.techradar.com/news/world-of-tech/star-wars-3d-not-so-far-far-away-432716 | title = Star Wars 3D not so far, far away| first= Marc| last= Chacksfield| work= World of tech News| publisher=Tech radar | date= July 25, 2008| accessdate = December 8, 2008[/tpl] In late September 2010, it was announced that The Phantom Menace would be theatrically re-released in 3-D on February 10, 2012.[tpl]cite news | url= http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/03/first-3-d-star-wars-film-not-so-far-far-away-phantom-menace-coming-feb-10/ | work = The New York Times | first = Dave | last= Itzkoff | title= First 3-D ‘Star Wars' Film Not So Far, Far Away: ‘Phantom Menace' Coming Feb. 10 | date=March 3, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url = http://starwars.com/movies/episode-i/3dannouncedate/ |title=Star Wars in 3D Gets an Official Release Date|accessdate=2011-03-03 |work = Lucasfilm |publisher= Star wars | date=2011-03-03 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110401182953/http://www.starwars.com/movies/episode-i/3dannouncedate/ | archivedate = 2011-04-01[/tpl] The plan was to re-release all six films in order, with the 3-D conversion process taking up to a year to complete for each film.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/star-wars-saga-set-3d-28485 |title= 'Star Wars' saga set for 3D release starting 2012|last = Fernandez |first= Jay|last2 = Masters | first2=Kim|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=September 28, 2010|accessdate=October 18, 2010[/tpl] However, the 3D re-releases of episodes II and III have been postponed to enable Lucasfilm to concentrate on Episode VII.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-21243143 | title = Star Wars 3D release postponed|work=BBC News|date=January 15, 2013|accessdate=March 17, 2013[/tpl]

==Box office performance==

==Critical reaction==

===Academy Awards===

The six films together were nominated for 25 Academy Awards, of which they won ten. Three of these were Special Achievement Awards.

==Expanded Universe==

The term Expanded Universe (EU) is an umbrella term for officially licensed Star Wars material outside of the six feature films. The material expands the stories told in the films, taking place anywhere from 25,000 years before The Phantom Menace to 140 years after Return of the Jedi. The first Expanded Universe story appeared in Marvel Comics' Star Wars #7 in January 1978 (the first six issues of the series having been an adaptation of the film), followed quickly by Alan Dean Foster's novel Splinter of the Mind's Eye the following month.[tpl]cite web|accessdate=March 27, 2008|url=http://members.aol.com/heywood254/index.html|title=Lost Star Warriors|publisher=AOL[/tpl]
George Lucas retains artistic control over the Star Wars universe. For example, the death of central characters and similar changes in the status quo must first pass his screening before authors are given the go-ahead. In addition, Lucasfilm Licensing devotes efforts to ensure continuity between the works of various authors across companies.[tpl]Cite news|accessdate=March 27, 2008|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2005/05/06/DI2005050600821.html|title=Star Wars: George Lucas' Vision|work=Washington Post |date=May 19, 2005|author=Pollock, Dale[/tpl] Elements of the Expanded Universe have been adopted by Lucas for use in the films, such as the name of capital planet Coruscant, which first appeared in Timothy Zahn's novel Heir to the Empire before being used in The Phantom Menace. Additionally, Lucas so liked the character Aayla Secura, who was introduced in Dark Horse Comics' Star Wars series, that he included her as a character in Attack of the Clones.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/episode-ii/bts/profile/f20020618/index.html|title=From EU to Episode II: Aayla Secura|publisher=Star Wars|accessdate=January 9, 2008[/tpl]
Lucas has played a large role in the production of various television projects, usually serving as storywriter or executive producer.[tpl]cite web|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/859/859974p1.html|accessdate=March 27, 2008|title=Star Wars Live-Action Series Delayed|publisher=IGN|date=March 17, 2008[/tpl] Star Wars has had numerous radio adaptations. A radio adaptation of A New Hope was first broadcast on National Public Radio in 1981. The adaptation was written by science fiction author Brian Daley and directed by John Madden. It was followed by adaptations of The Empire Strikes Back in 1983 and Return of the Jedi in 1996. The adaptations included background material created by Lucas but not used in the films. Mark Hamill, Anthony Daniels, and Billy Dee Williams reprised their roles as Luke Skywalker, C-3PO, and Lando Calrissian, respectively, except in Return of the Jedi in which Luke was played by Joshua Fardon and Lando by Arye Gross. The series also used John Williams' original score from the films and Ben Burtt's original sound designs.[tpl]cite web|accessdate=March 27, 2008|url=http://theforce.net/timeline/film4.asp|title=Ultimate Timeline|publisher=The Force[/tpl]

===Other films===

In addition to the two trilogies and The Clone Wars film, several other authorized films have been produced:

===Animated series===

Following the success of the Star Wars films and their subsequent merchandising, several animated television series have been created:

===Literature===

Star Wars-based fiction predates the release of the first film, with the 1976 novelization of Star Wars (ghost-written by Alan Dean Foster and credited to Lucas). Foster's 1978 novel, Splinter of the Mind's Eye, was the first Expanded Universe work to be released. In addition to filling in the time between A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back, this additional content greatly expanded the Star Wars timeline before and after the film series. Star Wars fiction flourished during the time of the original trilogy (1977–83) but slowed to a trickle afterwards. In 1992, however, Timothy Zahn's Thrawn trilogy debuted, sparking a new interest in the Star Wars universe. Since then, several hundred tie-in novels have been published by Bantam and Del Rey. A similar resurgence in the Expanded Universe occurred in 1996 with the Steve Perry novel Shadows of the Empire, set in between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, and accompanying video game and comic book series.[tpl]cite web|accessdate=March 28, 2008|url=http://www.alandeanfoster.com/version2.0/frameset.htm|title=Alan Dean Foster | work = Version 2.0 | date =March 1, 2008 [/tpl]
LucasBooks radically changed the face of the Star Wars universe with the introduction of the New Jedi Order series, which takes place some 20 years after Return of the Jedi and stars a host of new characters alongside series originals.  For younger audiences, three series have been introduced. The Jedi Apprentice series follows the adventures of Obi-Wan Kenobi and his master Qui-Gon Jinn in the years prior to The Phantom Menace. The Jedi Quest series follows the adventures of Obi-Wan and his apprentice Anakin Skywalker in between The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones. The Last of the Jedi series follows the adventures of Obi-Wan and another surviving Jedi almost immediately, set in between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope.
Marvel Comics published Star Wars comic book series and adaptations from 1977 to 1986. A wide variety of creators worked on this series, including Roy Thomas, Archie Goodwin, Howard Chaykin, Al Williamson, Carmine Infantino, Gene Day, Walt Simonson, Michael Golden, Chris Claremont, Whilce Portacio, Jo Duffy, and Ron Frenz.

In the late 1980s, Marvel announced it would publish a new Star Wars comic by Tom Veitch and Cam Kennedy.  However, in December 1991, Dark Horse Comics acquired the Star Wars license and used it to launch a number of ambitious sequels to the original trilogy instead, including the popular Dark Empire stories.[tpl]cite web |url = http://www.darkhorse.com/company/timeline.php|title= Company timeline|accessdate= April 16, 2008 |publisher= Dark Horse comics[/tpl] They have since gone on to publish a large number of original adventures set in the Star Wars universe.

===Games===

Since 1977, dozens of board, card, video, miniature, and tabletop role-playing games, among other types, have been published bearing the Star Wars name, beginning in 1977 with the board game Star Wars: Escape from the Death Star[tpl]Citation | url = http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/4845/star-wars--escape-from-death-star-game | title = Star Wars: Escape from the Death Star | year = 1977 | type = description | publisher = Board game geek[/tpl] (not to be confused with another board game with the same title, published in 1990).[tpl]Citation | url = http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2725/star-wars-escape-from-the-death-star | title = Star Wars: Escape from the Death Star | year = 1990 | type = description | publisher = Board game geek[/tpl] Star Wars video games commercialization started in 1982 with Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back published for the Atari 2600 by Parker Brothers. Since then, Star Wars has opened the way to a myriad of space-flight simulation games, first-person shooter games, role-playing video games, RTS games, and others. Three different official tabletop role-playing games have been developed for the Star Wars universe: a version by West End Games in the 1980s and 1990s, one by Wizards of the Coast in the 2000s and one by Fantasy Flight Games in the 2010s.

===Fan works===

The Star Wars saga has inspired many fans to create their own non-canon material set in the Star Wars galaxy. In recent years, this has ranged from writing fan-fiction to creating fan films. In 2002, Lucasfilm sponsored the first annual Official Star Wars Fan Film Awards, officially recognizing filmmakers and the genre. Because of concerns over potential copyright and trademark issues, however, the contest was initially open only to parodies, mockumentaries, and documentaries. Fan-fiction films set in the Star Wars universe were originally ineligible, but in 2007 Lucasfilm changed the submission standards to allow in-universe fiction entries.[tpl]Cite news|accessdate=March 28, 2008|url = http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-25279212_ITM |title=Filmmaker Kevin Smith Hosts ‘The Official Star Wars Fan Film Awards' on SCI FI Channel; George Lucas to Present Special Honor | work  = Business Wire|date=April 23, 2002[/tpl]
While many fan films have used elements from the licensed Expanded Universe to tell their story, they are not considered an official part of the Star Wars canon. However, the lead character from the Pink Five series was incorporated into Timothy Zahn's 2007 novel Allegiance, marking the first time a fan-created Star Wars character has ever crossed into the official canon.[tpl]cite web | url= http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/features/20080727-9999-1a27starfilm.html | work = The San Diego Union Tribune | title= Final installment of 'Star Wars' parody is out there - somewhere | author=Peter Rowe | accessdate=March 25, 2009[/tpl] Lucasfilm, for the most part, has allowed but not endorsed the creation of these derivative fan-fiction works, so long as no such work attempts to make a profit from or tarnish the Star Wars franchise in any way.[tpl]Cite news |first = Sarah | last= Knapton|title= Court to rule in Star Wars costume battle|url= http://film.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,2271561,00.html|work=The Guardian |location=UK |date = April 7, 2008|accessdate=April 15, 2008[/tpl]

==Attractions==

Before Disney's acquisition of the franchise, George Lucas had established a partnership in 1986 with Disney and its Walt Disney Imagineering division to create Star Tours, an attraction that opened at Disneyland in 1987. The attraction also had subsequent incarnations at other Disney theme parks worldwide, with the exception of Hong Kong Disneyland.
The attractions at Disneyland and Disney's Hollywood Studios closed in 2010 and at Tokyo Disneyland in 2012, in order to allow the rides to be converted into Star Tours—The Adventures Continue. The successor attraction opened at Disney's Hollywood Studios and Disneyland in 2011, and Tokyo Disneyland in 2013.
The Jedi Training Academy is a live show where children are selected to learn the teachings of the Jedi Knights and the Force in order to become Padawan learners. The show is present at the Rebels stage at Disney's Hollywood Studios and at the Tomorrowland Terrace at Disneyland.
The Walt Disney World Resort's Disney's Hollywood Studios park hosts an annual festival, Star Wars Weekends during specific dates from May to June. The event began in 1997.
