How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria? is an English reality television talent show that documented the search for an undiscovered musical theatre performer to play the role of Maria von Trapp in the 2006 Andrew Lloyd Webber and David Ian stage production of The Sound of Music.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2006/04_april/03/maria.shtml|title=BBC ONE searches for West End star in new Saturday night show|date=3 April 2006|publisher=BBC Press Office|accessdate=18 December 2008[/tpl]
The series was originally devised by the then 'in house' development team at BBC Entertainment Events and was announced by the BBC in April 2006. BBC One broadcast the programme, which was hosted by Graham Norton, on Saturday evenings from 29 July through 16 September 2006.
The title derives from the refrain of "Maria", a song from the first act of The Sound of Music.

==Format==

===Creation===

The lead role of Maria von Trapp in the new West End production of The Sound of Music, to be staged by Andrew Lloyd Webber and David Ian, was to be played by American actress Scarlett Johansson. Negotiations fell through,[tpl]cite web|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/article693325.ece|title=How a West End show won and lost its Hollywood star|last=Sherwin|first=Adam|date=27 July 2006|work=The Times|location=UK|accessdate=18 December 2008|location=London[/tpl] and after a four-year search for an actress to fill the role, it was revealed in November 2005 that Lloyd Webber had approached the BBC to allow the public to cast the role through a Popstars-style talent search, the first time that such a format had been used.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article597135.ece|title=Lloyd-Webber looks to reality TV for a star|last=Dowell|first=Ben|date=27 November 2005|work=The Sunday Times|location=UK|accessdate=28 December 2008|location=London[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/maria/about/about_show.shtml|title=About the show|publisher=BBC|accessdate=20 December 2008[/tpl]
This was the first programme to allow the public to cast a leading role in a West End show, and it was initially criticised. However, it won International Emmy and Royal Television Society awards and became the first of a series of collaborations between the BBC and Lloyd Webber, including Any Dream Will Do, I'd Do Anything, and Over the Rainbow. The series also led to versions and similar series abroad.

===Expert panel===

To assess and train the potential Marias and judge them during the live shows, an expert panel was chosen. The panel comprised:
Lloyd Webber also asked Denise van Outen to participate in the series, but she turned him down, saying that she "felt uncomfortable about being on the panel and giving my criticism". She later became a judge on follow-up series, Any Dream Will Do.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2007/apr/29/broadcasting.observerreview|title=Blonde justice|last=Cadwalladr|first=Carole|date=29 April 2007|work=The Observer|location=UK|accessdate=3 July 2009[/tpl]

===Auditions===

Open auditions were held around the UK in April and May 2006, open to both professionals and amateurs over the age of 17. The top 200 made it through to the London callbacks where they performed for Ian, Barrowman and Tyler to secure one of 50 places at Lloyd Webber's "Maria School", where over four days they would receive vocal and drama training from the expert panel.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2006/07_july/11/maria.shtml|title=How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria? - from Saturday 29 July 2006, 6.50 pm, BBC ONE|date=11 July 2006|publisher=BBC Press Office|accessdate=29 June 2009[/tpl]
Several additional performers were selected over this fifty contestant limit; one being Briony, who had been rejected initially due to nerves hampering her performance, but who returned for a second chance and was allowed in by Ian. A further four, whom the panel had rejected, were contacted by Lloyd Webber himself as he personally believed them to be potential Marias.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/maria/maria/news/2006/07/31/35229.shtml|title=The Auditions|date=31 July 2006|publisher=BBC|accessdate=29 June 2009[/tpl]
During "Maria School", contestants were eliminated to leave twenty, who were then taken to Lloyd Webber's house, where they performed for fifty people from the entertainment business. Ten finalists were then chosen by the panel and taken through to the live studio finals.
The series started on Saturday 29 July 2006, and the first two programmes followed the audition stages of the competition before revealing the final ten at the end of the second programme.

===Live finals===

The final ten contestants then competed in the live studio finals held on Saturday nights over six weeks. Each week the contestants sang and performed during the live show, receiving comments from the judges following their performance. The public then got a chance to vote for their favourite Maria, and the two contestants with the fewest votes performed a sing-off in front of Lloyd Webber, who then decided which Maria to keep in the contest. This was repeated with the top ten, the top nine and the top eight. With the top seven and top five, two were voted off in the program, and there were two different sing-offs.
Lloyd Webber had no say in the final casting decision, when in the concluding edition of the series it was left to the public to choose who should play Maria out of the final two contenders, Connie Fisher and Helena Blackman. After more than 2 million votes were cast, the winning entrant was revealed as Fisher, who won a six-month contract to play Maria in the West End production, performing six out of the eight weekly shows.[tpl]cite web|title=Problem solved!

The profits from the telephone votes went to a bursary for young performers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2006/07_july/11/maria_bursary.shtml|title=How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria? – The bursary|publisher=BBC Press Office|date=11 July 2006|accessdate=27 December 2008[/tpl] Lloyd Webber also donated his fee to the bursary.

==Finalists==

Ten potential Marias were selected as finalists who would appear on the live shows. Abi Finley and Aoife Mulholland auditioned together having known each other from college, and both made it to the finals. One of the original 10 finalists, Emilie Alford, withdrew from the competition after deciding it was not for her. She was replaced by Siobhan Dillon, who lost a place in the final ten following a sing-off against Alford and Laura Sicurello in front of Lloyd Webber. This earned her the nickname "Second Chance Maria".[tpl]cite web|title=How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria? finalists|publisher=BBC Press Office|date=6 August 2006|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2006/08_august/06/maria.shtml|accessdate=26 May 2008[/tpl]

==Live shows==

The live shows saw the finalists eliminated one by one following both individual and group performances. Once eliminated, the leaving contestant ended the programme by leading a performance of "So Long, Farewell" from The Sound of Music with the remaining contestants.

===Week six===

In the run-up to the final, the three finalists and Lloyd Webber visited Salzburg to visit some of the locations made famous by The Sound of Music, including Leopoldskron Palace and Nonnberg Abbey, to give the finalists a chance to understand the real Maria von Trapp.[tpl]cite web|title=The Hills are Alive... |publisher=BBC|date=13 September 2006|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/maria/maria/news/2006/09/13/36369.shtml|accessdate=26 May 2008[/tpl]
The grand finale saw Connie win the competition, with Helena coming second and Siobhan third. The show performances were:

==Winner==

Following a public telephone vote, 23-year-old Connie Fisher was chosen as Maria and performed the role in the West End from November 2006 to February 2008. The series also helped the careers of the other finalists, some of whom later took leading roles in West End shows. Semi-finalist Aoife Mulholland also took up the role of Maria in April 2007 for two shows a week, after Fisher was advised to reduce her performances to six per week.

==After the series==

Following the final, Lloyd Webber was criticised after it was revealed that actress Emma Williams had been hired to perform the two performances per week that Fisher would not.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5355508.stm|title=Lloyd Webber defends Maria plans|date=18 September 2006|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=20 December 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5370892.stm|title='Alternate' Maria quits musical|publisher=BBC News|date=22 September 2006|accessdate=22 September 2006[/tpl] Prior to The Sound of Music opening Williams "withdrew her services", reportedly because her role had been downgraded from four shows per week to two, leaving Fisher to perform all eight shows unless indisposed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/article639557.ece|title=Maria climbs highest mountain|last=Bale|first=Joanna|date=17 November 2006|work=The Times |location=UK|accessdate=27 December 2008|location=London[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs-old/latest/2006/09/23/how-do-you-solve-another-problem-like-maria-115875-17805843/|title=How do you solve another problem like Maria?|last=Cummins|first=Fiona|date=23 September 2006|work=Daily Mirror|location=UK|accessdate=20 December 2008[/tpl]

==Reception==

Lloyd Webber was initially criticised for wanting to cast the role through a television talent search, and he and the BBC were also criticised by the actors union Equity. They stated that they believed their members would find the series "demeaning to their profession" and that it was not a "proper way" to choose a performer.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.equity.org.uk/AboutUs/Magazine/default.aspx?edition=22&page=2|title=Maria show "disappointing",  programme should not be made, Equity says|date=Summer 2006|publisher=Equity Magazine|accessdate=27 December 2008[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
The series opened to mostly negative reviews from the press,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/article602685.ece|title=How do you find a girl to play Maria?|last=Teeman|first=Tim|date=8 August 2006|work=The Times|location=UK|accessdate=27 December 2008|location=London[/tpl] with the Daily Mail stating that the series was a "trainwreck".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/article625907.ece|title=Lord Angry lays into the luvvies|last=Teeman|first=Tim|date=4 September 2006|work=The Times|location=UK|accessdate=6 February 2009|location=London[/tpl] In response to the criticism, Lloyd Webber told The Times:
 "This programme is providing a platform for musical theatre that it has never had before. The only people upset with Maria are a few precious luvvies who think things should be done a certain way." 
Lloyd Webber and the BBC were also criticised for giving the production "11 hours of free publicity on prime-time television"[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/13/theater/13mari.html|title=Six Million Casting Directors I.S.O. Maria|last=Riding|first=Alan|date=13 September 2006|work=The New York Times|accessdate=6 February 2009[/tpl] and that the series could be "considered commercial advertising". The BBC Trust's Editorial Standards Committee disagreed, saying that the corporation retained "editorial control of the programme" and avoided "disproportionate prominence for Lloyd Webber and the production".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/18280/bbc-did-not-unfairly-promote-lloyd-webber|title=BBC did not unfairly promote Lloyd Webber|last=Hemley|first=Matthew|date=20 September 2007|work=The Stage|accessdate=6 February 2009[/tpl]

Following the conclusion of the series on a ratings high and positive reviews for Fisher following her opening night, the series was followed by a number of similar series from both the BBC and other broadcasters in the UK and abroad. It was credited with helping London theatres reach record ticket sales and attendances in 2007 and, according to The Independent, for "persuading a new, younger audience to see the shows in the flesh".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/reality-tv-shows-create-boom-in-theatre-attendance-770895.html|title=Reality TV shows create boom in theatre attendance|last=Byrne|first=Ciar|date=18 January 2008|work=The Independent|location=UK|accessdate=6 February 2009[/tpl]
The series was shown on BBC America in the United States from June 2009. It was described as being "refreshing in its simplicity" in a "landscape that lately seems dominated by audition-heavy musical competitions" by LA Times critic Mary McNamara,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-maria6-2009jun06,0,3257419.story|title=Review: How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria? on BBC America|last=McNamara|first=Mary|date=6 June 2009|work=LA Times|accessdate=3 July 2009[/tpl] but Brian Lowry of Variety didn't feel that it would be successful in the U.S.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117940408.html|title=How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria?|last=Lowry|first=Brian|date=3 June 2009|work=Variety|accessdate=3 July 2009[/tpl]

===Awards===

The series won three awards, and received nominations for another two:

==Follow-up and international series==

The success of the series led to its becoming the first in a series of West End themed talent contests produced by the BBC in collaboration with Lloyd Webber. 2007 saw Any Dream Will Do search for a new male lead to play Joseph for a production of Lloyd Webber's and Tim Rice's Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. This was followed in 2008 by I'd Do Anything, which sought a lead to play Nancy and three young performers to play the lead in a production of the musical Oliver!. In 2010, Over the Rainbow cast Dorothy and a dog to play Toto in the forthcoming stage production of the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz. The BBC also collaborated with Lloyd Webber to find a performer for Britain's entry into the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 through Eurovision: Your Country Needs You.
On 20 August 2006, it was reported that Lloyd Webber had taken legal action against David Ian. Lloyd Webber reportedly wanted to take the format to the United States to cast a Broadway theatre production of Grease. Lloyd Webber discovered that Ian had already brought the idea to NBC, who announced they will look for unknowns to play Sandy Dumbrowski and Danny Zuko, via reality TV show Grease: You're the One that I Want! with Ian and BBC Worldwide, leaving Lloyd Webber furious. Ian said "I don't understand the problem. Andrew has no connection with the stage show Grease, which I have successfully produced in the UK. There is a new production of Grease on Broadway in the spring of 2007, that's why I've been asked to judge on You're The One That We Want."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/article/david%20ian%20i%20dont%20understand%20andrews%20problem_1005649|title=David Ian: 'I don't understand Andrew's problem'|accessdate=27 August 2006|author=Wenn|publisher=contactmusic.com|date=1 February 2007[/tpl] This was followed in the UK with the ITV1 series Grease Is the Word, with Ian as a judge. It aired against Any Dream Will Do in 2007.
Op zoek naar Evita (Looking for Evita) was produced in the Netherlands in 2007, followed by Op zoek naar Joseph (Looking for Joseph) in 2008, Op zoek naar Mary Poppins (Looking for Mary Poppins) in 2009 and Op zoek naar Zorro (Looking for Zorro) in 2011 and even Op zoek naar Annie (Looking for Annie) in 2012. In 2008 a Canadian version of the show with the same title, searched for a Maria for an upcoming Toronto production of The Sound of Music; this show was initiated by Lloyd Webber, and was aired on CBC Television. In 2009 Vtm aired a Flemish version titled [tpl]lang|nl|Op zoek naar Maria[/tpl] (Looking for Maria).
