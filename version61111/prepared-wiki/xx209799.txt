[[Value noise]]

CATEGORIES: Noise, Computer graphic techniques

Value noise is a type of noise commonly used as a procedural texture primitive in computer graphics. It is conceptually different, and often confused with gradient noise examples of which are the Perlin noise and Simplex noise. This method consists of a creation of a lattice of points which are assigned random values. The noise function then returns the interpolated number based on the value of the neighboring lattice points.
To improve the quality of the generated noise, multiple octaves of this noise can be generated and then summed together. This technique produces results very similar to Perlin noise at the cost of lower quality while having a simpler algorithm.David Ebert, Kent Musgrave, Darwyn Peachey, Ken Perlin, and Worley.
