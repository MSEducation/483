Through various methods of study over many decades, modern Egyptologists now have an accurate understanding of how mummification was achieved in Ancient Egypt. The first and most important step was to halt the process of decomposition, by removing the internal organs and washing out the body with a mix of spices and palm wine. The only organ left behind was the heart, as tradition held the heart was the seat of thought and feeling and would therefore still be needed in the afterlife. After cleansing, the body was then dried out with natron inside the empty body cavity as well as outside on the skin. The internal organs were also dried and either sealed in individual jars, or wrapped to be replaced within the body. This process typically took forty days.
After dehydration, the mummy was wrapped in many layers of linen cloth. Within the layers, Egyptian priests placed small amulets to guard the decedent from evil. Once the mummy was completely wrapped, it was coated in a resin in order to keep the threat of moist air away. Resin was also applied to the coffin in order to seal it. The mummy was then sealed within its tomb, alongside the worldly goods that were believed to help aid it in the afterlife.

==Mummification in other cultures==

===Africa===

In addition to the mummies of Egypt, there have been instances of mummies being discovered in other areas of the African continent. The bodies show a mix of anthropogenic and spontaneous mummification, with some being thousands of years old.

====Libya====

The mummified remains of an infant were discovered during an expedition by archaeologist Fabrizio Mori to Libya during the winter of 1958-1959 in the natural cave structure of Uan Muhuggiag.[tpl]sfn|Cockburn|1998|p=281[/tpl] After curious deposits and cave paintings were discovered on the surfaces of the cave, expedition leaders decided to excavate. Uncovered alongside fragmented animal bone tools was the mummified body of an infant, wrapped in animal skin and wearing a necklace made of ostrich egg shell beads. Professor Tongiorgi of the University of Pisa radiocarbon-dated the infant to between 5,000-8,000 years old. A long incision located on the right abdominal wall, and the absence of internal organs, indicated that the body had been eviscerated post-mortem, possibly in an effort to preserve the remains.[tpl]sfn|Cockburn|1998|p=282[/tpl] A bundle of herbs found within the body cavity also supported this conclusion.[tpl]cite news|title=Science: Older than Egypt?|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,865145,00.html|accessdate=13 November 2013|newspaper=Time|date=21 December 1959[/tpl] Further research revealed that the child had been around 30 months old at the time of death, though gender could not be determined due to poor preservation of the sex organs.[tpl]sfn|Cockburn|1998|p=281-282[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Wan Muhuggiag|url=http://www.temehu.com/wan-muhuggiag.htm|accessdate=13 November 2013[/tpl]

====South Africa====

The first mummy ever discovered in South Africa[tpl]cite web|last=Deem|first=James|title=Khoi Mummy|url=http://www.mummytombs.com/mummylocator/group/khoi.htm|accessdate=13 November 2013[/tpl]  was found in the Baviaanskloof Wilderness Area by Dr. Johan Binneman in 1999.[tpl]cite web|title=Baviaanskloof Wilderness Area|url=http://www.routes.co.za/naturereserves/baviaanskloof/|publisher=SA Routes|accessdate=13 November 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Smith|first=Rodger|title=Ancient Communications|url=http://www.languageofthewilderness.nl/upload/Rock%20Art%20Survey%20Part%201.pdf|publisher=Vodacom SA|accessdate=13 November 2013|date=September 2001[/tpl] Nicknamed Moses, the mummy was estimated to be around 2,000 years old. After being linked to the indigenous Khoi culture of the region, the National Council of Khoi Chiefs of South Africa began to make legal demands that the mummy be returned shortly after the body was moved to the Albany Museum in Grahamstown.[tpl]cite web|last=Khan|first=Farook|title=Khoi chiefs want their mummy back|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/khoi-chiefs-want-their-mummy-back-1.16968#.UoMuC_mThM4|publisher=Independent Online|accessdate=13 November 2013[/tpl]

===Asia===

The mummies of Asia are usually considered to be accidental. The decedents were buried in just the right place where the environment could act as an agent for preservation. This is particularly common in the desert areas of the Tarim Basin and Iran. Mummies have been discovered in more humid Asian climates, however these are subject to rapid decay after being removed from the grave.

====China====

Mummies from various dynasties throughout China's history have been discovered in several locations across the country. They are almost exclusively considered to be unintentional mummifications. Many areas in which mummies have been uncovered are difficult for preservation, due to their warm, moist climates. This makes the recovery of mummies a challenge, as exposure to the outside world can cause the bodies to decay in a matter of hours.[ref]

An example of a Chinese mummy that was preserved despite being buried in an environment not conducive to mummification is Xin Zhui. Also known as Lady Dai, she was discovered in the early 1970s at the Mawangdui archaeological site in Changsha.[ref]
