==Origin: Chu Chin Chow?==

The name "Chin Chin Chu" is probably taken from  Chu Chin Chow, a popular British musical comedy from 1916.  In "Chu Chin Chow" the second song is actually entitled "My name is Chu Chin Chow".  This is identical to the Indian film song name, with the exception of the first 'chu'.  In Howrah Bridge the seductive Helen is playing the role of a girl who was Chinese.  She also makes reference to Alaadin from the Arabian Nights which is the theme of the original `Chu Chin Chow`.
