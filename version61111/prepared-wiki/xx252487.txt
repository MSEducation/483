Wieki Somers (Sprang-Capelle, 1976) is a Dutch designer. She works together with Dylan van den Berg under the name Studio Wieki Somers. Somers is considered part of the second generation of Dutch designers who have gained international acclaim. Unlike the first generation of Dutch designers, who have focused mainly on conceptual, functional designs, this second generation also recognizes the importance of aesthetics.VIVID: Wieki Somers
In October 2009, Studio Wieki Somers won the Golden Eye (the award for best Dutch design) at the Dutch Design Awards with the Merry-go-round Coat Rack, designed for the cloakroom of Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen in Rotterdam. By pulling ropes, coats are raised onto the carousel-like construction, making them appear to be floating in space."Studio Wieki Somers winnaar Golden Eye 2009",Dutch Design Awards The coat rack was also nominated in 2009 at the London Design Museum's Designs of the Year awards.Brit Insurance Designs of the Year

In 2007, Somers was commissioned by the Gemeentemuseum Den Haag in The Hague to design a tulip vase, Departed glory."Wieki Somers", Tubelight
