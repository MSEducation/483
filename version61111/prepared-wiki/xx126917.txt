==Club career==

James began his career at Falkirk in 1993, making 48 appearances and scoring nine goals in his six years with the Bairns.
In 1999, James moved to one of his hometown clubs, Hearts, for whom he only made 14 appearances in two years. 
In 2001, he was loaned out to Airdrieonians. He joined on a permanent basis later that year.
After only nine months in Lanarkshire, James returned to his first club, Falkirk, with whom he went on to make over 50 appearances and scored six goals in three years.
James joined St. Johnstone just prior to the 2005–06 season. He scored his first goal for the club on 15 October 2005, in a 3–1 win over Brechin City at McDiarmid Park.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/results3.sd?gameid=456637 |title=The Internet Soccer Database |publisher=www.soccerbase.com |date=2005-10-15 |accessdate=2009-06-04[/tpl]
In April 2007, James was one of three St. Johnstone players named in the SPFA's Scottish Division One "Team of the Year", voted for by the managers.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_div_1/6586371.stm |title=Division One "Team of the Year" |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-04-23 |accessdate=2009-06-04[/tpl]
Going into the 2008-2009 season, appearances by James were limited due to a series of injuries although he did make an appearance for the St Johnstone reserves against Arbroath, St Johnstone going on to lose 2-0.
James moved to Ayr United on a 28-day emergency loan in March 2009 as he attempted to regain fitness following injury. He returned to St. Johnstone in April, missing Ayr's successful promotion to the Scottish First Division, though he failed to make another first-team appearance for St. Johnstone and was released at the end of the season. He signed a one year deal with Ayr on 4 June 2009.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ayrunitedfc.co.uk/index.asp?p=news&newsid=1601 |title=Ayr United Football Club - Official Website |publisher=Ayrunitedfc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-06-04[/tpl]  He then left the club at the end of the 2009-10 season.

==International career==

James received one cap for the Scotland national under-21 football team in 1997, but, due to extreme inability, was never called up for the senior squad.
