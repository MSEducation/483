With its ornate 19th century buildings, large avenues, prestigious schools, museums and various parks, the arrondissement has long been known as one of French high society's favorite places of residence (comparable to New York's Upper East Side or London's Kensington and Chelsea)http://www.parislogue.com/places-in-paris/deciphering-the-16th-arrondissement.html eyes of an American-born on the exclusive 16th to such an extent that the  phrase "le 16e" ([tpl]IPA-fr|lə sɛzjɛm[/tpl]) has been associated with great wealth in French popular culture. Indeed, the 16th arrondissement is France's fourth richest district for average household income, following the 8th, 7th and 6th arrondissements; with the south of the 17th arrondissement and Neuilly-sur-Seine, they form the most affluent and prestigious residential area in France.
The 16th arrondissement hosts several large sporting venues, including: the Parc des Princes, which is the stadium where Paris Saint-Germain football club plays its home matches; Roland Garros Stadium, where the French Open tennis championships are held; and Stade Jean-Bouin, home to the Stade Français rugby union club.  The Bois de Boulogne, the second-largest public park in Paris (behind only the Bois de Vincennes), is also located in this arrondissement.

==Marcel Petiot==

A notorious serial murder case, which generated an international media circus, centered in the 16th arrondissement during the Nazi occupation of France during World War II. The focal point of the case was French doctor Marcel Petiot, who in 1941 bought a house at 21 Rue le Sueur in "the heart of Paris's fashionable 16th arrondissement".[tpl]cite book|author=King, David|title=Death in the City of Light|publisher=Crown|location=New York|year=2011|isbn=0-307-45289-1|edition=1st[/tpl] On 11 March 1944, Petiot's neighbors complained to police of a foul stench in the area and of large amounts of smoke billowing from a chimney of the house. Fearing a chimney fire, the police summoned firemen, who entered the house and found a roaring fire in a coal stove in the basement. In the fire, and scattered in the basement, were human remains. Following an investigation, during which time Petiot attempted to evade capture, "the monster of rue Le Sueur" was ultimately arrested and went on trial on 19 March 1946, facing 135 criminal charges.  He was convicted of 26 counts of murder and sentenced to death. On 25 May, Petiot was beheaded, after a stay of several days due to a problem in the release mechanism of the guillotine.
