Universal is the tenth album by Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, released in 1996. It features songwriting contributions from co-founder Paul Humphreys, who departed the band in 1989, and Karl Bartos (formerly of Kraftwerk). The album spawned the band's first Top 20 hit in the UK for over five years with the track "Walking on the Milky Way". However, follow-up single "Universal" and the album itself performed poorly and this lack of success prompted singer Andy McCluskey to disband the group. It would remain their final album for over a decade until the band's reunion.

==Reception==

Stephen Thomas Erlewine in AllMusic remarked: "Universal is a rote collection of synth-pop and dance-pop from OMD, demonstrating only a fraction of the sophisticated craft that made its predecessor Liberator enjoyable, and none of the adventurous spirit of their '80s records."
