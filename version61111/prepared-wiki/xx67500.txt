[[File:Río Grande de Loíza.jpg|150px|thumb|"Río Grande de Loíza!... Great river. Great flood of tears...
save those greater that come from the eyes of my soul for my enslaved people" Julia de Burgos, "El Rio Grande de Loiza"]]
Later in life, Burgos became romantically involved with Dr. Juan Isidro Jimenes Grullón, a Dominican physician. According to Grullón,  many of her poems during that time were inspired by the love that she felt for him.  In 1939, Burgos and Jimenes Grullón traveled first to Cuba where she attended the University of Havana and then later to New York where she worked as a journalist for Pueblos Hispanos, a progressive newspaper.
Shortly after their arrival in Cuba, Burgos' relationship with  Jimenes Grullón began to show tension. After trying to save her relationship, she instead left and returned once again to New York, however this time alone, where she took menial jobs to support herself.  In 1943, she married Armando Marín, a musician from Vieques.  In 1947, the marriage also ended in divorce, lapsing Burgos into further depression and alcoholism.
In February 1953, she wrote one of her last poems, "Farewell in Welfare Island".Julia de Burgos. Gale It was written during her last hospitalization and is believed to be the only poem she wrote in English. In the poem she foreshadows her death and reveals an ever darker concept of life:

On June 28, 1953, Julia de Burgos left the home of a relative in Brooklyn, where she had been residing. She disappeared without leaving a clue as to where she went.
It was later discovered that on July 6, 1953, she collapsed on a sidewalk in the Spanish Harlem section of Manhattan, and later died of pneumonia at a hospital in Harlem at the age of 39. Since no one claimed her body and she had no identification on her, the city gave her a pauper's burial on Hart Island, the city's only potter's field.
Eventually, some of her friends and relatives were able to trace her, find her grave, and claim her body. A committee was organized in Puerto Rico, presided over by Dr. Margot Arce de Vázquez, to have her remains transferred to the island.  Burgos' remains arrived on September 6, 1953 and funeral services for her were held at the Puerto Rican Atheneum.  She was given a hero's burial at the Municipal Cemetery of Carolina.  A monument was later built at her burial site by the City of Carolina.
