[[.425 Westley Richards]]

CATEGORIES: Pistol and rifle cartridges

The .425 Westley Richards Magnum is one of the classic African big-game rounds. It is a cartridge invented by Leslie Taylor of Westley Richards, a gunmaking firm of Birmingham England in 1909 as a proprietary cartridge for their bolt action rifles.  Often referred to as the "Poor Man's Magnum" the round has the unusual characteristic of having a rebated rim, one that is smaller in diameter than the case body.  This allowed it to be used in converted Mauser 98 magazine rifles with a standard (.30-06 size) magazine length and bolt face.

The rebated rim also allowed Government Game Officers to use stripper clips for rapid reloads when culling rogue animals.
