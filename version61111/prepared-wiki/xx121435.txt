The district was originally part of Nakhon Luang Noi district (now named Bang Pahan), and was established as a separate district in 1895.
In 1903 the district office was moved into Nakhon Luang subdistrict, and therefore the district was renamed from Nakhon Klang to Nakhon Luang.[tpl]cite journal|journal=Royal Gazette|volume=20|issue=22|pages=352–353|title=แจ้งความกระทรวงมหาดไทย เรื่อง เปลี่ยนนามอำเภอนครกลาง เป็นอำเภอนครหลวง|url=http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2446/022/352_2.PDF|date=1903-08-30|language=Thai[/tpl]
