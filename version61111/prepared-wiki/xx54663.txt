==Biography==

Conway was born in Walnut Ridge, Arkansas. He graduated from Roosevelt High School in St. Louis, Missouri and then  attended Southeast Missouri State University, where he was a member of the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity, graduating in 1969 with a Bachelor of Science degree in psychology. He was commissioned as an infantry officer in 1970. His first assignment was command of a rifle platoon with 3rd Battalion 1st Marines, based at Camp Pendleton. He also served as the battalion's 106mm recoilless rifle platoon commander. Later, he served as Marine executive officer aboard the aircraft carrier [tpl]USS|Kitty Hawk|CV-63[/tpl] and as commanding officer of the Sea School at Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego.
After graduating with honors from the Army's Infantry Officers Advanced Course, Conway commanded two companies in the 2nd Marine Regiment's Operations and Security section. As a field grade officer, he commanded two companies of students and taught tactics at The Basic School. He then went on to serve as operations officer for the 31st Marine Amphibious Unit, with sea duty in the western Pacific and in contingency operations off Beirut, Lebanon.
Returning to the United States, Conway was assigned as Senior Aide to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff for two years. After graduating from Marine Corps Command and Staff College with honors, he took command of 3rd Battalion 2nd Marines through its eight-month deployment to Southwest Asia during the Gulf War.
After the war, he was promoted to colonel and assigned command of The Basic School. Promoted to brigadier general in December 1995, he again was assigned to the Joint Chiefs. After being promoted to major general, he served as commander of the 1st Marine Division and as Deputy Commanding General of Marine Forces Central. He was promoted to lieutenant general and assumed command of I Marine Expeditionary Force on November 16, 2002. He commanded I MEF during two combat tours in Iraq, with 60,000 troops under his command, including Marines, soldiers, sailors, and British forces. In the book The Iraq War, Conway was described as, "big, buff, well read and well educated.....he represented all that was best about the new United States Marine Corps, which General Al Gray as the commandant had set up."[tpl]cite book|last=Murray|first=Williamson|coauthors=Scales, Robert H.|title=The Iraq War: A Military History|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2003|pages=65|isbn=0-674-01280-1[/tpl]
In a press interview on May 30, 2003, Conway was questioned about the failure at that point to locate weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. He replied, in part:
[tpl]cquote|It was a surprise to me then, it remains a surprise to me now, that we have not uncovered weapons... It's not for lack of trying. We've been to virtually every ammunition supply point between the Kuwaiti border and Baghdad, but they're simply not there... What the regime was intending to do in terms of its use of the weapons, we thought we understood—or we certainly had our best guess, our most dangerous, our most likely courses of action that the intelligence folks were giving us. We were simply wrong. But whether or not we're wrong at the national level, I think, still very much remains to be seen.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl][/tpl]
US Marines of the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force under Conway's command constructed the military base "Camp Alpha" on top of ancient Babylonian ruins following the invasion. Though a US Military spokesman claimed that the project was discussed with the "head of the Babylon museum",[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/news/world/middleeast/articles/2005/01/16/damage_seen_to_ancient_babylon/ |title=Damage seen to ancient Babylon |publisher=The Boston Globe |date=January 16, 2005 | first1=Sue | last1=Leeman[/tpl] the construction of the base drew intense criticism from archaeologists, who contend that it caused irreparable damage to one of the most important sites in the world. Dr. John Curtis  of the British Museum's Near East department described how parts of the archaeological site were levelled and paved over to create a helipad as well as parking lots for heavy vehicles.[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4461755.stm | title=History lost in dust of war-torn Iraq | work=BBC News | date=2005-04-25 | accessdate=2013-06-07 | author=Bajjaly, Joanne Farchakh[/tpl] Donny George, head of the Iraqi State Board for Heritage and Antiquities, stated that the "mess will take decades to sort out".Heritage News from around the world, World Heritage Alert!.
