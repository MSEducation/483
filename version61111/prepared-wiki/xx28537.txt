Their home ground is Ibrox Stadium in the south-west of the city.

In 2012, The Rangers Football Club Plc became insolvent and entered administration, resulting in liquidation when an agreement could not be reached with its creditors. Its business and assets, including Rangers FC, were bought by a new company, to which the club's Scottish Football Association membership was transferred in time to enable Rangers to relaunch in the Scottish Football League's Third Division at the start of the 2012–13 season.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.scotprem.com/content/mediaassets/doc/SPL%20Commission%20reasons%20for%20decision%20of%2012%20September%202012.pdf|work=Independent Commission of Lord Nimmo Smith|date=12 September 2012|accessdate=9 February 2012|quote=purchased substantially all the business and assets of Oldco, including Rangers FC, by entering into an asset sale and purchase agreement|deadurl=no[/tpl]Euro ties fill Rangers void for Celtic – Neil Lennon www.bbc.co.uk, 21 September 2012Neil Lennon...on Rangers funding, Sean Connery, and a McGeady statue www.heraldscotland.com, 1 October 2012Interview: Gordon Durie, East Fife manager and former Rangers striker www.scotsman.com, 5 August 2012
In domestic football Rangers have won more league titles and trebles than any other club in the world, winning the league title 54 times, the Scottish Cup 33 times and the Scottish League Cup 27 times, and achieving the treble of all three in the same season seven times. In European football, Rangers were the first British club to reach a UEFA tournament final. They won the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1972 after being runner up twice in 1961 and 1967. A third runners up finish in Europe came in the 2008 UEFA Cup.
Rangers have a long-standing rivalry with Celtic, the two Glasgow clubs being collectively known as the Old Firm since the late 19th century.

==History==

===Formation and early years===

The four founders of Rangers – brothers Moses and Peter McNeil, Peter Campbell and William McBeath – met in March 1872 at West End Park, (now known as Kelvingrove Park). Rangers' first match, in May that year, was a 0–0 friendly draw with Callander on Glasgow Green under the name Glasgow Argyle F.C. In 1873, the club held its first annual meeting and staff were elected.[tpl]cite web|url=http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/blogs/world-of-sport/45-000-see-rangers-face-blokes-coming-off-153126585.html|title=45,000 to see Rangers face blokes coming off night shift|work=Eurosport|publisher=Yahoo!|date=17 August 2012|accessdate=18 August 2012|quote=Founded: 1872[tpl]break[/tpl]Biggest win: 10–0 v Hibernian 1898[tpl]break[/tpl]Most appearances: John Greig 755 (1960–1978)|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6A0mTcErH|archivedate=18 August 2012|deadurl=no[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-15307021|title=The on-field history of Rangers Football Club 1873–2012|publisher=BBC|work=BBC News|date=14 February 2012|accessdate=18 August 2012|quote=The club's origins date back to 1872 when Peter McNeil, his brother Moses, Peter Campbell and William McBeath formed their own team in Glasgow.[tpl]break[/tpl]The name Rangers was adopted from an English rugby club and the first game, against Callander FC, ended 0–0.

Taking over as manager from William Wilton in 1920, Bill Struth was Rangers' most successful manager, guiding the club to 14 league titles before the onset of the Second World War.

==Crest and colours==

===Crest===

Unusually for a football club, Rangers have two different official crests. Today the original scroll crest appears on the club's strips whereas the lion rampant club crest is used by the media, on club merchandise and on official club documents. Both crests have undergone minor variations since their introduction. It is believed that the scroll crest, representing the letters RFC overlapping, has been used since the club's formation in 1872, although the oldest remaining piece of memorabilia containing this crest is from the 1881–82 season. The scroll crest was replaced in 1959 with the lion rampant club crest which featured a lion rampant, an old-style football and the club's motto Ready, which was shortened from Aye Ready (meaning Always Ready in Scots), all surrounded by the team name, Rangers Football Club. The lion rampant club crest was modernised in 1968; the lion rampant, team name, club motto and old style football all remained. It was again updated ever so slightly in the early 1990s to the current version. The modern circular crest is regularly used on club merchandise and by the media; it has never featured prominently on the club strip. Since 1968 Rangers have had two crests, the scroll crest made a return appearing on the chest of the club shirt for the first time while the modernised club crest was still the club's official logo. The scroll crest first appeared on the teams shorts for the start of the 1978–79 season.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.danburymint.co.uk/index.php?act=product&product_id=4250&cat_id=&mediacode=&kiks_code=|title=The Badges of Rangers Football Club|publisher=Danbury Mint|accessdate=21 January 2013|quote=The earliest badge featured the celebrated RFC scroll crest believed to have been used since 1872. Then there’s the lion rampant and the club motto ‘READY’, which have appeared on Rangers’ badges since 1959. Finally, see the evolution into the current badge, with the famous blue, white and red colours.|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6A9zFHSQa|archivedate=21 January 2013|deadurl=no[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rangers.co.uk/club/history/crest|title=The Rangers Crest|publisher=Rangers FC|accessdate=21 January 2013|quote=Although the 'RFC' Scroll Crest was omitted in 1959 it made a welcome return in 1968 when it was placed on the club's home jersey for the very first time. It was later added to the shorts a decade later for the start of the 1978–79 season.[/tpl]
The way the scroll crest has appeared on the club shirt has varied slightly through the years. Between 1990 and 1994 'Rangers Football Club' and the 'Ready' motto appeared above and below the Crest respectively. Between 1997 and 1999 the scroll crest featured within a shield. After a successful end to the season in 2003, which delivered Rangers a Domestic Treble and their 50th league title; five stars were added to the top of the scroll crest, one for every ten titles won by the club. The team wore a special crest on 8 December 2012 in a home league match against Stirling Albion, to commemorate the 140th anniversary of their formation. '1872–2012' appeared above the scroll crest with the words '140 years' featuring below.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.therangersarchive.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=261&Itemid=326|title=The Rangers Crest|publisher=Gersnet Online|accessdate=21 January 2013|quote=From 1990 to 1994 'Rangers Football Club' and the 'Ready' motto were placed above and below the Crest respectively. In 1997–98 the Crest was placed in a shield but perhaps the most significant change was before the start of the 2003/04 campaign. Having clinched their 50th League Championship, a year in which Rangers secured a domestic Treble, the Club decided to add five stars above the Scoll Crest, one for every ten titles won.[/tpl]

===Colours===

The club colours of Rangers F.C. are royal blue, white and red. However, for the majority of the first forty-eight years of Rangers existence the club played in a plain lighter blue home shirt. The only deviation from this was a four season period from 1879 when the side wore the lighter shade of blue and white in a hooped style. Traditionally this is accompanied by white shorts (often with royal blue and/or red trim) and black socks with red turn-downs. Rangers moved from the lighter shade of blue to royal blue in 1921, and have had a royal blue home shirt every year since. Black socks were first included in 1883 for five seasons before disappearing for eight years but became a more permanent fixture from 1896 onwards. When the red turn-downs were added to the socks in 1904, the strip began to look more like the modern day Rangers home kit. Occasionally the home kit will be altered by the shorts and socks, sometimes replacing the black socks with white ones; or replacing the white shorts and black socks combination with royal blue shorts and socks.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Rangers/Rangers.htm|title=Rangers|publisher=Historical Football Kits|accessdate=17 August 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6A9yqRFgb|archivedate=24 August 2012|deadurl=no[/tpl]
The basic design of Rangers away strips has changed far more than the traditional home strip. Rangers original change strip, used between 1876 and 1879, was all white featuring blue and white hooped socks and a light blue six pointed star on the chest. White and red have been the most common colours for Rangers alternate strips, though dark and light blue have also featured highly. In 1994 Rangers introduced a third kit. This is usually worn if both the home and away kits clash with their opponents. The colours used in the third kits have included combinations of white, red, dark and light blue as well as black.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Rangers/Rangers-change-kits.html|title=Rangers Change Kits|publisher=Historical Football Kits|accessdate=24 August 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6A9ytIGuU|archivedate=24 August 2012|deadurl=no[/tpl]

===Sponsors and manufacturers===

Since 1978 when Rangers signed a deal with Umbro they have had a specific kit manufacturer and since 1984 have had a kit sponsor. When Rangers played French sides AJ Auxerre and RC Strasbourg in the 1996–97 Champions League and the UEFA Cup respectively, due to a French ban on alcohol advertising the team wore the logo of Center Parcs instead of McEwan's Lager.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.truecoloursfootballkits.com/articles/an-alternative-to-alcohol|title=An alternative to alcohol|publisher=True Colours|date=3 July 2009|author=Devlin, John|accessdate=18 August 2012|quote=Rangers have actually sported the Center Parcs logo during the course of two seasons.

Then in 97–98 a new style Center Parcs logo was worn in the UEFA Cup first round first leg game in Strasbourg where again the 'Gers lost 2–1 (also wearing their change blue shorts)|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6A0w8Q8nG|archivedate=18 August 2012|deadurl=no[/tpl] The following tables detail the shirt sponsors and kit suppliers of Rangers by year:

==Stadium and training facility==

The club used a variety of grounds in Glasgow as a venue for home matches in the years between 1872 and 1899. The first was Flesher's Haugh, situated on Glasgow Green, followed by Burnbank in the Kelvinbridge area of the city, and then Kinning Park for ten years from the mid-1870s to the mid-1880s. From February of the 1886–87 season, Cathkin Park was used until the first Ibrox Park, in the Ibrox area of south-west Glasgow, was inaugurated for the following season. Ibrox Stadium in its current incarnation was originally designed by the architect Archibald Leitch, a Rangers fan who also played a part in the design of, among others, Old Trafford in Manchester and Highbury in London. The stadium was inaugurated on 30 December 1899, and Rangers defeated Hearts 3–1 in the first match held there.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.friendsofscotland.gov.uk/culture/football.html|title=Scottish football|date=June 2006|work=Global Friends of Scotland|publisher=Scottish Government|accessdate=24 August 2012|quote=Scotland’s contributions to the development of the game were equally impressive in other areas. Glaswegian born architect Archibald Leitch was the pioneering football stadium designer of his day – by the 1920’s 16 out of 22 of England’s First Division stadiums were Leitch designs. The most famous example of his work still in existence is probably Ibrox. (This would undoubtedly please Leitch, who was a devout Rangers fan.)|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061004113451/http://www.friendsofscotland.gov.uk/culture/football.html|archivedate=4 October 2006|deadurl=yes[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/r/rangers/7173756.stm|title=Rangers consider Ibrox expansion|publisher=BBC|work=BBC Sport|date=6 January 2008|accessdate=24 August 2012|quote=The plans, one of three options being considered by the club, could see the stadium in Glasgow completely rebuilt with a new capacity of 70,000.

Rangers' training facility is located in Auchenhowie, Glasgow. The facility is known as Murray Park after former chairman and owner Sir David Murray. It was proposed by then-manager Dick Advocaat upon his arrival at the club in 1998. It was completed in 2001 at a cost of £14 million. Murray Park was the first purpose-built facility of its kind in Scotland, and incorporates features including nine football pitches, a state of the art gym, a hydrotherapy pool, and a video-editing suite. Rangers' youth teams are also accommodated at Murray Park, with around 140 players between under-10 and under-19 age groups using the training centre. Various first-team players have come through the ranks at Murray Park, including Alan Hutton, Chris Burke, Stevie Smith, John Fleck and Charlie Adam. International club teams playing in Scotland, as well as national sides, have previously used Murray Park for training, and Advocaat's South Korea team used it for training prior to the 2006 World Cup.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/football/working-with-kids-is-its-own-reward-for-the-man-in-charge-at-murray-park.17144559?_=343ae8e26ca054cfcc1f6cbfe5781dddc9059adc|title=Working with kids is its own reward for the man in charge at Murray Park|work=Herald Scotland|publisher=Newsquest|date=26 March 2012|accessdate=4 January 2013|author=MacDonald, Hugh|quote=Ally McCoist, the manager, normally leaves Sinclair and his staff to choose the youngsters but sometimes will stipulate who he and the first-team staff want.

===Rivalries===

The club's most distinct rivalry is with Glasgow neighbours Celtic F.C.; the two clubs are collectively known as the Old Firm, though they are not currently playing in the same league. Rangers' traditional support is largely drawn from the Protestant Unionist community, whilst Celtic's traditional support is largely drawn from the Catholic community. The first Old Firm match was won by Celtic and there have been nearly four hundred matches played to date. The Old Firm rivalry has fuelled many assaults, sometimes leading to deaths, on Old Firm derby days; an activist group that monitors sectarian activity in Glasgow has reported that on Old Firm weekends, admissions to hospital emergency rooms have increased over normal levels and journalist Franklin Foer noted that in the period from 1996 to 2003, eight deaths in Glasgow were directly linked to Old Firm matches, as well as hundreds of assaults.[tpl]cite book|title=101 Places Not to See Before You Die|publisher=Harper Collins|author=Price, Catherine|year=2010|isbn=9780061787768|url=http://books.google.com/?id=by3ZJt2TI2YC&printsec=frontcover&dq=101+Places+Not+to+See+Before+You+Die#v=onepage&q=101%20Places%20Not%20to%20See%20Before%20You%20Die&f=false|quote=On Old Firm weekends, admission rates for local hospitals increase ninefold, and the cumulative total for arrests at Old Firm games is the highest in the world.|accessdate=24 August 2012|pages=174, 175[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/old-firm-dont-need-a-messi-1089843|title=Old Firm don't need a Messi or Ronaldo to be biggest derby in world, says Ali Russell|work=Daily Record|publisher=Trinity Mirror|date=18 December 2011|accessdate=24 August 2012|author=Haggerty, Anthony|quote=RANGERS operations chief Ali Russell insists the Old Firm rivalry is the biggest in the world – because a billion fans tune in to watch two teams devoid of world stars.|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6A9yEwKNP|archivedate=24 August 2012|deadurl=no[/tpl]

===Greatest ever team===

The following team was voted the greatest ever Rangers team by supporters in 1999. When the vote was launched it was feared that younger voters would ignore the great service of many of the pre-war stars (notably the most successful captain and most successful manager the club has ever had, Davie Meiklejohn and Bill Struth respectively). When the ballot was launched Donald Findlay stated it would be limited to post Second World War players because "few can recall players of these earlier eras":Football: Greig is voted greatest ever Ranger!
