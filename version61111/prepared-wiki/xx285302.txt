MacDougall was the candidate for the National Party. McMillan obtained 61.96% of the votes and was successful.Norton 1988, p. 214.
McMillan became the first woman to represent Dunedin North and would represent the electorate until the 1975 election, when she was defeated against Richard Walls of the National Party.
