Henry C. Overstolz (July 4, 1821[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]November 29, 1887) was the twenty-fourth mayor of St. Louis, Missouri, serving from 1876 to 1881.
Overstolz was born in Munster, Germany[tpl]Disambiguation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl] and moved to St. Louis in 1846, where he entered the merchandising business.  He quickly involved himself in the city's government and, in 1847, was elected to membership in the City Council.  In 1853, Overstolz was elected as the city's comptroller, becoming the first native-born German to be elected to office in St. Louis. Overstolz is a direct descendant of the oldest patrician family of Cologne, Germany.History of Saint Louis City and County: From the Earliest Periods ..., Volume 1 Later, in 1871, he was elected president of the city council.[tpl]cite web |url=http://stlcin.missouri.org/history/peopledetail.cfm?Master_ID=973 |title=St. Louis Historic Preservation: Overstolz, Henry Clemens |publisher=City of St. Louis |accessdate=2008-06-30[/tpl]

Overstolz was a supporter of the Charter and Scheme that separated the city of St. Louis from St. Louis County in 1876.  As a result of the new city charter, Overstolz became the first mayor of St. Louis elected to a four-year term when he was reelected in 1877.
During the course of his mayorship, Overstolz worked to reorganize the city government and forge new relationships with the county and state resulting from the changes instituted by the new city charter.
Overstolz sought a third term as mayor, but was defeated by William Ewing in the 1881 mayoral election.[tpl]cite web |url=http://stlcin.missouri.org/history/peopledetail.cfm?Master_ID=974 |title=St. Louis Historic Preservation: Ewing, William L. |publisher=City of St. Louis |accessdate=2008-06-30[/tpl]
Overstolz died on November 29, 1887 and was buried in Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=23359 |title=Henry Clemens Overstolz (1821â€“1887) |publisher=Find A Grave |accessdate=2008-06-30[/tpl]
