[[Clifford–Klein form]]

CATEGORIES: Lie groups, Homogeneous spaces

In mathematics, a Clifford–Klein form is a double coset space 
where G is a reductive Lie group, H a closed subgroup of G, and Γ a discrete subgroup of G that acts properly discontinuously on the homogeneous space G/H.  A suitable discrete subgroup Γ may or may not exist, for a given G and H. If Γ exists, there is the question of whether Γ\G/H can be taken to be a compact space, called a compact Clifford–Klein form.  
When H is  itself compact, classical results show that a compact Clifford–Klein form exists. Otherwise it may not, and there are a number of negative results.
