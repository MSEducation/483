The Charles River Bike Path is a mixed-use path in the Boston, Massachusetts area.  It follows both shores of the Charles River from Boston, Massachusetts to Norumbega Park in Newton, passing through Watertown and Waltham.[tpl]cite web|last=Pazzanese |first=Christina |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2004/09/26/going_with_the_flow/?page=full |title=Going with the flow | work=Boston Globe | date=26 September 2004 |accessdate=18 October 2011[/tpl]  The path consists of several segments in the Charles River Reservation separated by road and bridge crossings and forms part of the planned East Coast Greenway.

==Charles River Reservation==

The Paul Dudley White Bicycle Path runs on both sides of the river within the Charles River Reservation.  From the Museum of Science, Boston on the Charles River Dam Bridge, they run on sidewalk or striped asphalt path to Watertown Square (Galen Street/Route 16 bridge), a loop of [tpl]convert|17.1|mi[/tpl].[tpl]cite web | url=http://web.mit.edu/track/indoor/bridges.html | title=Charles River Mileage Map/Table | work=web.mit.edu | accessdate=18 October 2011[/tpl]  The paths run along the edge of Cambridge and Watertown on the north; and the West End, Back Bay, and Allston-Brighton neighborhoods of Boston on the south side.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/charlesRiver/images/map_chasBasin.gif |title=DCR Charles River Basin map | work=Mass.gov | date= |accessdate=18 October 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bikexprt.com/massfacil/pdwhite.htm |title=Map of Paul Dudley White Bike Paths | work=Bikexprt.com |date= |accessdate=18 October 2011[/tpl]

==Upper Charles River Reservation==

In 2004, a $9M master plan to extend the path westward from Watertown Square to Norumbega Park in Newton was completed.
The path continues along the north side of the river from Watertown Square to Bridge Street, there crossing back from Watertown to Newton.  This segment was completed in 1997.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.massbike.org/bikeways/bikebos.htm | title=Boston Bikeways and Trails | work=MassBike.org | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080726183730/http://www.massbike.org/bikeways/bikebos.htm | archivedate=26 July 2008 | deadurl=yes | accessdate=18 October 2011[/tpl]
The riverwalk then continues along the south bank, crossing back to the north bank at the Blue Heron Bridge, built 2004 just for the path, and continuing to Moody Street in Waltham, near the Charles River Museum of Industry and Waltham Common. The route extends upstream with a combination of paths and streets, to Auburndale, the Newton neighborhood where Norumbega Park is located.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newtonconservators.org/longwalkcharlesnorth3.htm |title=Along the Charles River Path | publisher=Newton Conservators |date= |accessdate=18 October 2011[/tpl]
There are plans to extend the path upstream along the curving river to Needham, Dedham, and the West Roxbury neighborhood of Boston.

==Eastern connections==

Bike recreation opportunities continue to the east with North Point Park in Cambridge, and Nashua Street Park on the Boston side.  There are discontinuities near North Station and the Zakim Bridge before the Boston Harborwalk continues on both sides of the harbor.
The proposed extension of the Somerville Community Path would connect the Boston end of the Charles River Path to the network of mixed-use trails to the northwest.
