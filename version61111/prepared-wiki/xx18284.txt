Edward I (17 June 1239 – 7 July 1307), also known as Edward Longshanks and the Hammer of the Scots (Latin: Malleus Scotorum), was King of England from 1272 to 1307. The first son of Henry III, Edward was involved early in the political intrigues of his father's reign, which included an outright rebellion by the English barons. In 1259, he briefly sided with a baronial reform movement, supporting the Provisions of Oxford. After reconciliation with his father, however, he remained loyal throughout the subsequent armed conflict, known as the Second Barons' War. After the Battle of Lewes, Edward was hostage to the rebellious barons, but escaped after a few months and joined the fight against Simon de Montfort. Montfort was defeated at the Battle of Evesham in 1265, and within two years the rebellion was extinguished. With England pacified, Edward left on a crusade to the Holy Land. The crusade accomplished little, and Edward was on his way home in 1272 when he was informed that his father had died. Making a slow return, he reached England in 1274 and he was crowned king at Westminster on 19 August.
He spent much of his reign reforming royal administration and common law. Through an extensive legal inquiry, Edward investigated the tenure of various feudal liberties, while the law was reformed through a series of statutes regulating criminal and property law. Increasingly, however, Edward's attention was drawn towards military affairs. After suppressing a minor rebellion in Wales in 1276–77, Edward responded to a second rebellion in 1282–83 with a full-scale war of conquest. After a successful campaign, Edward subjected Wales to English rule, built a series of castles and towns in the countryside and settled them with Englishmen. Next, his efforts were directed towards Scotland. Initially invited to arbitrate a succession dispute, Edward claimed feudal suzerainty over the kingdom. In the war that followed, the Scots persevered, even though the English seemed victorious at several points. At the same time there were problems at home. In the mid-1290s, extensive military campaigns required high levels of taxation, and Edward met with both lay and ecclesiastical opposition. These crises were initially averted, but issues remained unsettled. When the king died in 1307, he left to his son, Edward II, an ongoing war with Scotland and many financial and political problems.
Edward I was a tall man for his era, hence the nickname "Longshanks". He was temperamental, and this, along with his height, made him an intimidating man, and he often instilled fear in his contemporaries. Nevertheless, he held the respect of his subjects for the way he embodied the medieval ideal of kingship, as a soldier, an administrator and a man of faith. Modern historians are divided on their assessment of the king: while some have praised him for his contribution to the law and administration, others have criticised him for his uncompromising attitude towards his nobility. Currently, Edward I is credited with many accomplishments during his reign, including restoring royal authority after the reign of Henry III, establishing Parliament as a permanent institution and thereby also a functional system for raising taxes, and reforming the law through statutes. At the same time, he is also often criticised for other actions, such as his brutal conduct towards the Scots, and issuing the Edict of Expulsion in 1290, by which the Jews were expelled from England. The Edict remained in effect for the rest of the Middle Ages, and it would be over 350 years until it was formally overturned under Oliver Cromwell in 1656.

==Early years==

===Childhood and marriage===

Edward was born at the Palace of Westminster on the night of 17–18 June 1239, to King Henry III and Eleanor of Provence, being named Edward of Westminster.As the sources give the time simply as the night between the 17 and 18 June, we can not know the exact date of Edward's birth: [tpl]Harvnb|Morris|2008|p=2[/tpl] Although the young prince was seriously ill on several occasions, in 1246, 1247, and 1251, he grew up to be strong and healthy.  Edward was in the care of Hugh Giffard – father of the future Chancellor Godfrey Giffard – until Bartholomew Pecche took over at Giffard's death in 1246.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=5–6[/tpl] Among his childhood friends was his cousin Henry of Almain, son of King Henry's brother Richard of Cornwall.Prestwich (2004). Henry of Almain would remain a close companion of the prince, both through the civil war that followed, and later during the crusade.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=46, 69[/tpl]
In 1254, English fears of a Castilian invasion of the English province of Gascony induced Edward's father to arrange a politically expedient marriage between his fourteen-year-old son and Eleanor, the half-sister of King Alfonso X of Castile.[tpl]Harvnb|Morris|2008|pp=14–8[/tpl] Eleanor and Edward were married on 1 November 1254 in the Abbey of Santa María la Real de Las Huelgas in Castile.[tpl]Harvnb|Morris|2008|p=20[/tpl] As part of the marriage agreement, the young prince received grants of land worth 15,000 marks a year.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=10[/tpl] Though the endowments King Henry made were sizeable, they offered Edward little independence. He had already received Gascony as early as 1249, but Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester, had been appointed as royal lieutenant the year before and, consequently, drew its income, so in practice Edward derived neither authority nor revenue from this province.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=7–8[/tpl] The grant he received in 1254 included most of Ireland, and much land in Wales and England, including the earldom of Chester, but the king retained much control over the land in question, particularly in Ireland, so Edward's power was limited there as well, and the king derived most of the income from those lands.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=11–4[/tpl] 
From 1254 to 1257, Edward was under the influence of his mother's relatives, known as the Savoyards,[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|2007 |p=96[/tpl] the most notable of whom was Peter of Savoy, the queen's uncle.[tpl]Harvnb|Morris|2008|p=7[/tpl] After 1257, Edward increasingly fell in with the Poitevin or Lusignan faction – the half-brothers of his father Henry III – led by such men as William de Valence.Henry III's mother Isabella of Angoulême married Hugh X of Lusignan after the death of King John; [tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|2005|p=94[/tpl]. This association was significant, because the two groups of privileged foreigners were resented by the established English aristocracy, and they would be at the centre of the ensuing years' baronial reform movement.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|2007|p=95[/tpl] There were tales of unruly and violent conduct by Edward and his Lusignan kinsmen, which raised questions about the royal heir's personal qualities. The next years would be formative on Edward's character.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=23[/tpl]

===Early ambitions===

Edward had shown independence in political matters as early as 1255, when he sided with the Soler family in Gascony, in the ongoing conflict between the Soler and Colomb families. This ran contrary to his father's policy of mediation between the local factions.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=15–6[/tpl] In May 1258, a group of magnates drew up a document for reform of the king’s government – the so-called Provisions of Oxford – largely directed against the Lusignans. Edward stood by his political allies and strongly opposed the Provisions. The reform movement succeeded in limiting the Lusignan influence, however, and gradually Edward’s attitude started to change. In March 1259, he entered into a formal alliance with one of the main reformers, Richard de Clare, Earl of Gloucester. Then, on 15 October 1259, he announced that he supported the barons' goals, and their leader, Simon de Montfort.[tpl]cite journal|last=Carpenter|first=David|year=1985|title=The Lord Edward's oath to aid and counsel Simon de Montfort, 15 October 1259|journal=Bulletin of the Institute of Historical Research|volume=58|pages=226–37|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2281.1985.tb01170.x[/tpl]
The motive behind Edward's change of heart could have been purely pragmatic; Montfort was in a good position to support his cause in Gascony.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=31–2[/tpl] When the king left for France in November, Edward's behaviour turned into pure insubordination. He made several appointments to advance the cause of the reformers, causing his father to believe that his son was considering a coup d'état.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=32–3[/tpl] When the king returned from France, he initially refused to see his son, but through the mediation of the Earl of Cornwall and the archbishop of Canterbury, the two were eventually reconciled.[tpl]Harvnb|Morris|2008|pp=44–5[/tpl] Edward was sent abroad, and in November 1260 he again united with the Lusignans, who had been exiled to France.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=34[/tpl]
Back in England, early in 1262, Edward fell out with some of his former Lusignan allies over financial matters. The next year, King Henry sent him on a campaign in Wales against Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, with only limited results.[tpl]Harvnb|Powicke|1962|pp=171–2[/tpl] Around the same time, Simon de Montfort, who had been out of the country since 1261, returned to England and reignited the baronial reform movement.[tpl]Harvnb|Maddicott|1994|p=225[/tpl] It was at this pivotal moment, as the king seemed ready to resign to the barons' demands, that Edward began to take control of the situation. Whereas he had so far been unpredictable and equivocating, from this point on he remained firmly devoted to protecting his father's royal rights.[tpl]Harvnb|Powicke|1962|pp=178[/tpl] He reunited with some of the men he had alienated the year before – among them his childhood friend, Henry of Almain, and John de Warenne, Earl of Surrey – and retook Windsor Castle from the rebels.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=41[/tpl] Through the arbitration of King Louis IX of France, an agreement was made between the two parties. This so-called Mise of Amiens was largely favourable to the royalist side, and laid the seeds for further conflict.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|2007|p=113[/tpl]

===Civil war===

The years 1264–1267 saw the conflict known as the Second Barons' War, in which baronial forces led by Simon de Montfort fought against those who remained loyal to the king.The First Barons' War[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]was in 1215–1217. The first scene of battle was the city of Gloucester, which Edward managed to retake from the enemy. When Robert de Ferrers, Earl of Derby, came to the assistance of the rebels, Edward negotiated a truce with the earl, the terms of which he later broke. Edward then captured Northampton from Montfort's son Simon, before embarking on a retaliatory campaign against Derby's lands.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=42–3[/tpl] The baronial and royalist forces finally met at the Battle of Lewes, on 14 May 1264. Edward, commanding the right wing, performed well, and soon defeated the London contingent of Montfort's forces. Unwisely, however, he followed the scattered enemy in pursuit, and on his return found the rest of the royal army defeated.[tpl]Harvnb|Sadler|2008|pp=55–69[/tpl] By the agreement known as the Mise of Lewes, Edward and his cousin Henry of Almain were given up as prisoners to Montfort.[tpl]cite journal|last=Maddicott|first=John|authorlink=John Maddicott|year=1983|title=The Mise of Lewes, 1264|journal=English Historical Review|volume=98|pages=588–603|jstor=569785|issue=388[/tpl]
Edward remained in captivity until March, and even after his release he was kept under strict surveillance.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=47–8[/tpl] Then, on 28 May, he managed to escape his custodians and joined up with the Earl of Gloucester, who had recently defected to the king's side.This was Gilbert de Clare, son of the aforementioned Richard de Clare; [tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=48–9[/tpl]. Montfort's support was now dwindling, and Edward retook Worcester and Gloucester with relatively little effort.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=49–50[/tpl] Meanwhile, Montfort had made an alliance with Llywelyn and started moving east to join forces with his son Simon. Edward managed to make a surprise attack at Kenilworth Castle, where the younger Montfort was quartered, before moving on to cut off the earl of Leicester.[tpl]Harvnb|Powicke|1962|pp=201–2[/tpl] The two forces then met at the second great encounter of the Barons' War, the Battle of Evesham, on 4 August 1265. Montfort stood little chance against the superior royal forces, and after his defeat he was killed and mutilated on the field.[tpl]Harvnb|Sadler|2008|pp=105–9[/tpl]
Through such episodes as the deception of Derby at Gloucester, Edward acquired a reputation as untrustworthy. During the summer campaign, though, he began to learn from his mistakes, and acted in a way that gained the respect and admiration of his contemporaries.[tpl]Harvnb|Morris|2008|pp=75–6[/tpl] The war did not end with Montfort's death, and Edward participated in the continued campaigning. At Christmas, he came to terms with the younger Simon de Montfort and his associates at the Isle of Axholme in Lincolnshire, and in March he led a successful assault on the Cinque Ports.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=55[/tpl] A contingent of rebels held out in the virtually impregnable Kenilworth Castle and did not surrender until the drafting of the conciliatory Dictum of Kenilworth.The Dictum restored land to the disinherited rebels, in exchange for a fine decided by their level of involvement in the wars; [tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|2007|p=117[/tpl] In April it seemed as if Gloucester would take up the cause of the reform movement, and civil war would resume, but after a renegotiation of the terms of the Dictum of Kenilworth, the parties came to an agreement.The essential concession was that the disinherited would now be allowed to take possession of their lands before paying the fines. [tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|2007|p=121[/tpl] Edward, however, was little involved in the settlement negotiations following the wars; at this point his main focus was on planning his upcoming crusade.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=63[/tpl]

===Crusade and accession===

Edward took the crusader's cross in an elaborate ceremony on 24 June 1268, with his brother Edmund and cousin Henry of Almain. Among others who committed themselves to the Ninth Crusade were Edward's former adversaries – like the Earl of Gloucester, though de Clare did not ultimately participate.[tpl]Harvnb|Morris|2008|pp=83, 90–2[/tpl] With the country pacified, the greatest impediment to the project was providing sufficient finances.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=71[/tpl] King Louis IX of France, who was the leader of the crusade, provided a loan of about £17,500.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=72[/tpl] This, however, was not enough; the rest had to be raised through a tax on the laity, which had not been levied since 1237. In May 1270, Parliament granted a tax of a twentieth,This meant a grant of 1/20 of all movable property. in exchange for which the king agreed to reconfirm Magna Carta, and to impose restrictions on Jewish money lending.[tpl]cite book|first=John|last=Maddicott|authorlink=John Maddicott|editor=P. R. Coss & S. D. Lloyd (eds.)|chapter=The Crusade Taxation of 1268–70 and the Development of Parliament|title=Thirteenth Century England II|pages=93–117|location=Woodbridge|publisher=Boydell Press|year=1989|isbn=0-85115-513-8[/tpl] On 20 August Edward sailed from Dover for France.[tpl]Harvnb|Morris|2008|p=92[/tpl] Historians have not determined the size of the force with any certainty, but Edward probably brought with him around 225 knights and all together less than 1000 men.
Originally, the Crusaders intended to relieve the beleaguered Christian stronghold of Acre, but Louis had been diverted to Tunis. The French king and his brother Charles of Anjou, who had made himself king of Sicily, decided to attack the emirate to establish a stronghold in North Africa.[tpl]Harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|p=210[/tpl] The plans failed when the French forces were struck by an epidemic which, on 25 August, took the life of King Louis himself.The disease in question was either dysentery or typhus; [tpl]Harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|pp=210–1[/tpl] By the time Edward arrived at Tunis, Charles had already signed a treaty with the emir, and there was little else to do but return to Sicily. The crusade was postponed until next spring, but a devastating storm off the coast of Sicily dissuaded Charles of Anjou and Louis's successor Philip III from any further campaigning.[tpl]Harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|p=211[/tpl] Edward decided to continue alone, and on 9 May 1271 he finally landed at Acre.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=75[/tpl]
By then, the situation in the Holy Land was a precarious one. Jerusalem had fallen in 1244, and Acre was now the centre of the Christian state.[tpl]Harvnb|Morris|2008|p=95[/tpl] The Muslim states were on the offensive under the Mamluk leadership of Baibars, and were now threatening Acre itself. Though Edward's men were an important addition to the garrison, they stood little chance against Baibars' superior forces, and an initial raid at nearby St Georges-de-Lebeyne in June was largely futile.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=76[/tpl] An embassy to the Ilkhan AbaqaAvner Falk - Franks and Saracens: Reality and Fantasy in the Crusades, Jul 2010 , p.192 (1234–1282) of the Mongols helped bring about an attack on Aleppo in the north, which helped to distract Baibar's forces.[tpl]Harvnb|Morris|2008|pp=97–8[/tpl] In November, Edward led a raid on Qaqun, which could have served as a bridgehead to Jerusalem, but both the Mongol invasion and the attack on Qaqun failed. Things now seemed increasingly desperate, and in May 1272 Hugh III of Cyprus, who was the nominal king of Jerusalem, signed a ten-year truce with Baibars.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=77[/tpl] Edward was initially defiant, but an attack by a Muslim assassin in June forced him to abandon any further campaigning. Although he managed to kill the assassin, he was struck in the arm by a dagger feared to be poisoned, and became severely weakened over the following months.The anecdote of Queen Eleanor saving Edward's life by sucking the poison out of his wound is almost certainly a later fabrication; [tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=78[/tpl]. Other accounts of the scene have Eleanor being led away weeping by John de Vescy, and suggest that it was another of Edward's close friends, Otto de Grandson, who attempted to sucking the poison from the wound; [tpl]Harvnb|Morris|2008|p=101[/tpl]
It was not until 24 September that Edward left Acre. Arriving in Sicily, he was met with the news that his father had died on 16 November.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=78, 82[/tpl] Edward was deeply saddened by this news, but rather than hurrying home at once, he made a leisurely journey northwards. This was partly due to his health still being poor, but also due to a lack of urgency.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=82[/tpl] The political situation in England was stable after the mid-century upheavals, and Edward was proclaimed king at his father's death, rather than at his own coronation, as had until then been customary.Though no written proof exists, it is assumed that this arrangement was agreed on before Edward's departure; [tpl]Harvnb|Morris|2008|p=104[/tpl] In Edward's absence, the country was governed by a royal council, led by Robert Burnell.[tpl]Harvnb|Carpenter|2003|p=466[/tpl] The new king embarked on an overland journey through Italy and France, where among other things he visited the pope in Rome and suppressed a rebellion in Gascony.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=82–5[/tpl] Only on 2 August 1274 did he return to England, and was crowned on 19 August.[tpl]Harvnb|Powicke|1962|p=226[/tpl]

==Reign==

===Administration and the law===

Upon returning home, Edward immediately embarked on the administrative business of the nation, and his major concern was restoring order and re-establishing royal authority after the disastrous reign of his father.[tpl]Harvnb|Morris|2008|pp=116–7[/tpl] To accomplish this, he immediately ordered an extensive change of administrative personnel. The most important of these was the appointment of Robert Burnell as chancellor, a man who would remain in the post until 1292 as one of the king's closest associates.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=92[/tpl] Edward then replaced most local officials, such as the escheators and sheriffs.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=93[/tpl] This last measure was done in preparation for an extensive inquest covering all of England, that would hear complaints about abuse of power by royal officers. The inquest produced the set of so-called Hundred Rolls, from the administrative subdivision of the hundred.The few surviving documents from the Hundred Rolls show the vast scope of the project. They are dealt with extensively in: [tpl]cite book|last=Helen Cam|authorlink=Helen Cam|title=The Hundred and the Hundred Rolls: An Outline of Local Government in Medieval England|publisher=Merlin Press|location=London|year=1963|edition=New[/tpl]
The second purpose of the inquest was to establish what land and rights the crown had lost during the reign of Henry III.[tpl]Harvnb|Morris|2008|p=115[/tpl]
The Hundred Rolls formed the basis for the later legal inquiries called the Quo warranto proceedings. The purpose of these inquiries was to establish by what warrant ([tpl]lang-la|Quo warranto[/tpl]) various liberties were held.Among those singled out in particular by the royal justices was the earl of Gloucester, who was seen to have encroached ruthlessly on royal rights over the preceding years; [tpl]Harvnb|Sutherland|1963|pp=146–7[/tpl] If the defendant could not produce a royal licence to prove the grant of the liberty, then it was the crown's opinion[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]based on the writings of the influential thirteenth-century legal scholar Bracton[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]that the liberty should revert to the king.
By enacting the Statute of Gloucester in 1278 the king challenged baronial rights through a revival of the system of general eyres (royal justices to go on tour throughout the land) and through a significant increase in the number of pleas of quo warranto to be heard by such eyres.
This caused great consternation among the aristocracy, who insisted that long use in itself constituted license.[tpl]Harvnb|Sutherland|1963|p=14[/tpl] A compromise was eventually reached in 1290, whereby a liberty was considered legitimate as long as it could be shown to have been exercised since the coronation of King Richard I, in 1189.[tpl]Harvnb|Powicke|1962|pp=378–9[/tpl] Royal gains from the Quo warranto proceedings were insignificant; few liberties were returned to the king.[tpl]Harvnb|Sutherland|1963|p=188[/tpl] Edward had nevertheless won a significant victory, in clearly establishing the principle that all liberties essentially emanated from the crown.[tpl]Harvnb|Sutherland|1963|p=149[/tpl]
The 1290 statute of Quo warranto was only one part of a wider legislative effort, which was one of the most important contributions of Edward I's reign. This era of legislative action had started already at the time of the baronial reform movement; the Statute of Marlborough (1267) contained elements both of the Provisions of Oxford and the Dictum of Kenilworth.[tpl]cite book|last=Brand|first=Paul|title=Kings, Barons and Justices: The Making and Enforcement of Legislation in Thirteenth-Century England|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|year=2003|isbn=0-521-37246-1[/tpl] The compilation of the Hundred Rolls was followed shortly after by the issue of Westminster I (1275), which asserted the royal prerogative and outlined restrictions on liberties.[tpl]Harvnb|Plucknett|1949|pp=29–30[/tpl] In the Mortmain (1279), the issue was grants of land to the church.[tpl]Harvnb|Plucknett|1949|pp=94–8[/tpl] The first clause of Westminster II (1285), known as De donis conditionalibus, dealt with family settlement of land, and entails.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=273[/tpl] Merchants (1285) established firm rules for the recovery of debts,[tpl]Harvnb|Plucknett|1949|pp=140–4[/tpl] while Winchester (1285) dealt with peacekeeping on a local level.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=280–1[/tpl] Quia emptores (1290)[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]issued along with Quo warranto[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]set out to remedy land ownership disputes resulting from alienation of land by subinfeudation.[tpl]Harvnb|Plucknett|1949|pp=45, 102–4[/tpl] The age of the great statutes largely ended with the death of Robert Burnell in 1292.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=293[/tpl]

===Welsh wars===

Llywelyn ap Gruffudd enjoyed an advantageous situation in the aftermath of the Barons' War. Through the 1267 Treaty of Montgomery, he officially obtained land he had conquered in the Four Cantrefs of Perfeddwlad and was recognised in his title of Prince of Wales.[tpl]Harvnb|Carpenter|2003|p=386[/tpl][tpl]Harvnb|Morris|2008|p=132[/tpl] Armed conflicts nevertheless continued, in particular with certain dissatisfied Marcher Lords, such as  Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, Roger Mortimer and Humphrey de Bohun, Earl of Hereford.[tpl]Harvnb|Davies|2000|pp=322–3[/tpl] Problems were exacerbated when Llywelyn's younger brother Dafydd and Gruffydd ap Gwenwynwyn of Powys, after failing in an assassination attempt against Llywelyn, defected to the English in 1274.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=175[/tpl] Citing ongoing hostilities and the English king's harbouring of his enemies, Llywelyn refused to do homage to Edward.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=174–5[/tpl] For Edward, a further provocation came from Llywelyn's planned marriage to Eleanor, daughter of Simon de Montfort.[tpl]Harvnb|Davies|2000|p=327[/tpl] In November 1276, war was declared.[tpl]Harvnb|Powicke|1962|p=409[/tpl] Initial operations were launched under the captaincy of Mortimer, Lancaster (Edward's brother Edmund) and William de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick.Lancaster's post was held by Payne de Chaworth until April; [tpl]Harvnb|Powicke|1962|p=409[/tpl]. Support for Llywelyn was weak among his own countrymen.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|2007|p=150[/tpl] In July 1277 Edward invaded with a force of 15,500, of whom 9,000 were Welshmen.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|2007|p=151[/tpl] The campaign never came to a major battle, and Llywelyn soon realised he had no choice but to surrender. By the Treaty of Aberconwy in November 1277, he was left only with the land of Gwynedd, though he was allowed to retain the title of Prince of Wales.[tpl]Harvnb|Powicke|1962|p=413[/tpl]
When war broke out again in 1282, it was an entirely different undertaking. For the Welsh, this war was over national identity, enjoying wide support, provoked particularly by attempts to impose English law on Welsh subjects.[tpl]cite book|first=Rees|last=Davies|authorlink=Rees Davies|editor=R.

In June, Gloucester was defeated at the Battle of Llandeilo Fawr.[tpl]Harvnb|Morris|2008|p=180[/tpl] On 6 November, while John Peckham, archbishop of Canterbury, was conducting peace negotiations, Edward's commander of Anglesey, Luke de Tany, decided to carry out a surprise attack. A pontoon bridge had been built to the mainland, but shortly after Tany and his men crossed over, they were ambushed by the Welsh and suffered heavy losses at the Battle of Moel-y-don.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=191–2[/tpl] The Welsh advances ended on 11 December, however, when Llywelyn was lured into a trap and killed at the Battle of Orewin Bridge.[tpl]Harvnb|Davies|2000|p=353[/tpl] The conquest of Gwynedd was complete with the capture in June 1283 of Dafydd, who was taken to Shrewsbury and executed as a traitor the following autumn.[tpl]Harvnb|Carpenter|2003|p=510[/tpl]
Further rebellions occurred in 1287–8 and, more seriously, in 1294, with five under Madog ap Llywelyn, a distant relative of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd. This last conflict demanded the king's own attention, but in both cases the rebellions were put down. By the 1284 Statute of Rhuddlan, the Principality of Wales was incorporated into England and was given an administrative system like the English, with counties policed by sheriffs.[tpl]Harvnb|Carpenter|2003|p=511[/tpl] English law was introduced in criminal cases, though the Welsh were allowed to maintain their own customary laws in some cases of property disputes.[tpl]Harvnb|Davies|2000|p=368[/tpl] After 1277, and increasingly after 1283, Edward embarked on a full-scale project of English settlement of Wales, creating new towns like Flint, Aberystwyth, and Rhuddlan.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=216[/tpl] An extensive project of castle-building was also initiated. The assignment was given to Master James of Saint George, a prestigious architect whom Edward had met in Savoy on his return from the crusade. Among the major buildings were the castles of Beaumaris, Caernarfon, Conwy and Harlech.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=160[/tpl] His programme of castle building in Wales heralded the introduction of the widespread use of arrowslits in castle walls across Europe, drawing on Eastern influences.[tpl]Harvnb|Cathcart King|1988|p=84[/tpl] Also a product of the Crusades was the introduction of the concentric castle, and four of the eight castles Edward founded in Wales followed this design.[tpl]Harvnb|Cathcart King|1988|p=83[/tpl][tpl]Harvnb|Friar|2003|p=77[/tpl] In 1284, King Edward's son Edward (later Edward II) was born at Caernarfon Castle. In 1301 at Lincoln, the young Edward became the first English prince to be invested with the title of Prince of Wales.[tpl]harvnb|Phillips|2004[/tpl]This title became the traditional title of the heir apparent to the English throne. Prince Edward was not born heir apparent, but became so when his older brother Alphonso died in 1284; [tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=126–7[/tpl].

===Diplomacy and war on the Continent===

Edward never again went on crusade after his return to England in 1274, but he maintained an intention to do so, and took the cross again in 1287.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=326–8[/tpl] This intention guided much of his foreign policy, until at least 1291. To stage a European-wide crusade, it was essential to prevent conflict between the greater princes on the continent. A major obstacle to this was represented by the conflict between the French House of Anjou ruling southern Italy, and the kingdom of Aragon in Spain. In 1282, the citizens of Palermo rose up against Charles of Anjou and turned for help to Peter of Aragon, in what has become known as the Sicilian Vespers. In the war that followed, Charles of Anjou's son, Charles of Salerno, was taken prisoner by the Aragonese.[tpl]Harvnb|Powicke|1962|pp=252–3[/tpl] The French began planning an attack on Aragon, raising the prospect of a large-scale European war. To Edward, it was imperative that such a war be avoided, and in Paris in 1286 he brokered a truce between France and Aragon that helped secure Charles' release.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=323–5[/tpl] As far as the crusades were concerned, however, Edward's efforts proved ineffective. A devastating blow to his plans came in 1291, when the Mamluks captured Acre, the last Christian stronghold in the Holy Land.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=329[/tpl]
After the fall of Acre, Edward's international role changed from that of a diplomat to an antagonist. He had long been deeply involved in the affairs of his own Duchy of Gascony. In 1278 he assigned an investigating commission to his trusted associates Otto de Grandson and the chancellor Robert Burnell, which caused the replacement of the seneschal Luke de Tany.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=304[/tpl] In 1286, Edward visited the region himself and stayed for almost three years.[tpl]Harvnb|Morris|2008|pp=204–17[/tpl] The perennial problem, however, was the status of Gascony within the kingdom of France, and Edward's role as the French king's vassal. On his diplomatic mission in 1286, Edward had paid homage to the new king, Philip IV, but in 1294 Philip declared Gascony forfeit when Edward refused to appear before him in Paris to discuss the recent conflict between English, Gascon, and French sailors (that had resulted in several French ships being captured, along with the sacking of the French port of La Rochelle).[tpl]Harvnb|Morris|2009|pp=265–70[/tpl]
In the war that followed, Edward planned for a two-pronged attack. While the English forces focused on Gascony, alliances were made with the princes of the Low Countries, Germany, and Burgundy, who would attack France from the north. The alliances proved volatile, however, and Edward was facing trouble at home at the time, both in Wales and Scotland. It was not until August 1297 that he was finally able to sail for Flanders, at which time his allies there had already suffered defeat.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=392[/tpl] The support from Germany never materialised, and Edward was forced to seek peace. His marriage to his first cousin once removed, Philip IV's half-sister Margaret, in 1299 ended the war, but the whole affair had proven both costly and fruitless for the English.Prestwich estimates the total cost to around £400,000; [tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1972|p=172[/tpl]

===The Great Cause===

The relationship between the nations of England and Scotland by the 1280s was one of relatively harmonious coexistence.[tpl]Harvnb|Carpenter|2003|p=518[/tpl] The issue of homage did not reach the same level of controversy as it did in Wales; in 1278 King Alexander III of Scotland paid homage to Edward I, but apparently only for the lands he held of Edward in England.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=357[/tpl] Problems arose only with the Scottish succession crisis of the early 1290s. In the years from 1281 to 1284, Alexander's two sons and one daughter died in quick succession. Then, in 1286, King Alexander died himself, leaving as heir to the throne of Scotland the three-year-old Margaret, the Maid of Norway, who was born in 1283 to Alexander's daughter Margaret and King Eric II of Norway.[tpl]Harvnb|Barrow|1965|pp=3–4[/tpl] By the Treaty of Birgham, it was agreed that Margaret should marry King Edward's then one-year-old son Edward of Carnarvon, though Scotland would remain free of English overlordship.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=361[/tpl][tpl]Harvnb|Morris|2009|p=235[/tpl]
Margaret, by now seven years of age, sailed from Norway for Scotland in the autumn of 1290, but fell ill on the way and died in Orkney.[tpl]Harvnb|Barrow|1965|p=42[/tpl][tpl]Harvnb|Morris|2009|p=237[/tpl] This left the country without an obvious heir, and led to the succession dispute known to history as the Great Cause.The term is an 18th-century invention; [tpl]Harvnb|Morris|2008|p=253[/tpl] Even though as many as fourteen claimants put forward their claims to the title, the real contest was between John Balliol and Robert de Brus.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|2007|p=231[/tpl] The Scottish magnates made a request to Edward to arbitrate in the dispute.[tpl]Harvnb|Powicke|1962|p=601[/tpl] At Birgham, with the prospect of a personal union between the two realms, the question of suzerainty had not been of great importance to Edward. Now he insisted that, if he were to settle the contest, he had to be fully recognised as Scotland's feudal overlord.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=361–3[/tpl] The Scots were reluctant to make such a concession, and replied that since the country had no king, no one had the authority to make this decision.[tpl]Harvnb|Barrow|1965|p=45[/tpl] This problem was circumvented when the competitors agreed that the realm would be handed over to Edward until a rightful heir had been found.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=365[/tpl] After a lengthy hearing, a decision was made in favour of John Balliol on 17 November 1292.Even though the principle of primogeniture did not necessarily apply to descent through female heirs, there is little doubt that Balliol's claim was the strongest one; [tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=358, 367[/tpl]
Even after Balliol's accession, Edward still continued to assert his authority over Scotland. Against the objections of the Scots, he agreed to hear appeals on cases ruled on by the court of guardians that had governed Scotland during the interregnum.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=370[/tpl] A further provocation came in a case brought by Macduff, son of Malcolm, Earl of Fife, in which Edward demanded that Balliol appear in person before the English Parliament to answer the charges.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=371[/tpl] This the Scottish king did, but the final straw was Edward's demand that the Scottish magnates provide military service in the war against France.[tpl]Harvnb|Barrow|1965|pp=86–8[/tpl] This was unacceptable; the Scots instead formed an alliance with France and launched an unsuccessful attack on Carlisle.[tpl]Harvnb|Barrow|1965|pp=88–91, 99[/tpl] Edward responded by invading Scotland in 1296 and taking the town of Berwick in a particularly bloody attack.[tpl]Harvnb|Barrow|1965|pp=99–100[/tpl] At the Battle of Dunbar, Scottish resistance was effectively crushed.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=471–3[/tpl] Edward confiscated the Stone of Destiny – the Scottish coronation stone[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]and brought it to Westminster, deposed Balliol and placed him in the Tower of London, and installed Englishmen to govern the country. The campaign had been very successful, but the English triumph would only be temporary.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=376[/tpl]

===Finances, Parliament and the Expulsion of Jews===

Edward I's frequent military campaigns put a great financial strain on the nation.[tpl]Harvnb|Harriss|1975|p=49[/tpl] There were several ways through which the king could raise money for war, including customs duties, money lending and lay subsidies. In 1275, Edward I negotiated an agreement with the domestic merchant community that secured a permanent duty on wool. In 1303, a similar agreement was reached with foreign merchants, in return for certain rights and privileges.[tpl]Harvnb|Brown|1989|pp=65–6[/tpl] The revenues from the customs duty were handled by the Riccardi, a group of bankers from Lucca in Italy.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=99–100[/tpl] This was in return for their service as money lenders to the crown, which helped finance the Welsh Wars. When the war with France broke out, the French king confiscated the Riccardi's assets, and the bank went bankrupt.[tpl]Harvnb|Brown|1989|pp=80–1[/tpl] After this, the Frescobaldi of Florence took over the role as money lenders to the English crown.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=403[/tpl]
