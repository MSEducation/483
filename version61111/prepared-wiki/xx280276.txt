In the United Kingdom, the term listed building refers to a building or other structure officially designated as being of special architectural, historical or cultural significance; Grade I structures are those considered to be "buildings of exceptional interest".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.manchester.gov.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?categoryID=514&documentID=1906|title=What is a listed building?|publisher=Manchester City Council|accessdate=2007-12-08[/tpl] Listing was begun by a provision in the Town and Country Planning Act 1947. Listing a building imposes severe restrictions on what the owner might wish to change or modify in the structure or its fittings. In England, the authority for listing under the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=2133903|title=Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (c. 9)|publisher=Ministry of Justice|accessdate=2007-12-17[/tpl] rests with English Heritage, a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, while local authorities have a responsibility to regulate and enforce the planning regulations.
