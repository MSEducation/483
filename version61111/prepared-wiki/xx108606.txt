Jerry Flynn was also infamous backstage as a ladies man. While his feud with Tank Abbott served in Tank's favor on screen, backstage was a different story. In their first backstage altercation (which ultimately led to Vince Russo's wanting to pursue the on-screen feud) Tank attempted to pummel Jerry to which he said "Thank you sir may I have another." On screen however Tank was seen as more marketable and was pushed as such.
