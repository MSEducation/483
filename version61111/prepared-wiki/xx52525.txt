Gluconeogenesis (abbreviated GNG) is a metabolic pathway that results in the generation of glucose from non-carbohydrate carbon substrates such as pyruvate, lactate, glycerol, glucogenic amino acids, and fatty acids (both even-chain[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bioline.org.br/request?np10002|author=Glew, Robert H|title=You Can Get There From Here: Acetone, Anionic Ketones and Even-Carbon Fatty Acids can Provide Substrates for Gluconeogenesis|accessdate=August 2013[/tpl] and odd-chain).
It is one of the two main mechanisms humans and many other animals use to keep blood glucose levels from dropping too low (hypoglycemia). The other means of maintaining blood glucose levels is through the degradation of glycogen (glycogenolysis).[tpl]cite web |last=Silva | first=Pedro  |title=The Chemical Logic Behind Gluconeogenesis | url=http://www2.ufp.pt/~pedros/bq/gng.htm | accessdate=September 8, 2009[/tpl]
Gluconeogenesis is a ubiquitous process, present in plants, animals, fungi, bacteria, and other microorganisms.[tpl]cite book |title=Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry |year=2000 |publisher=Worth Publishers |location=USA |isbn=1-57259-153-6 |pages=724 |author=David L Nelson and Michael M Cox [/tpl] In vertebrates, gluconeogenesis takes place mainly in the liver and, to a lesser extent, in the cortex of kidneys. In ruminants, this tends to be a continuous process.Young, J. W.  1977.  Gluconeogenesis in cattle: significance and methodology.  J. Dairy Sci. 60: 1-15.  In many other animals, the process occurs during periods of fasting, starvation, low-carbohydrate diets, or intense exercise.  The process is highly exergonic until ATP or GTP are utilized, effectively making the process endergonic. For example, the pathway leading from pyruvate to glucose-6-phosphate requires 4 molecules of ATP and 2 molecules of GTP. Gluconeogenesis is often associated with ketosis. Gluconeogenesis is also a target of therapy for type II diabetes, such as metformin, which inhibits glucose formation and stimulates glucose uptake by cells.[tpl]cite journal | author = Hundal R, Krssak M, Dufour S, Laurent D, Lebon V, Chandramouli V, Inzucchi S, Schumann W, Petersen K, Landau B, Shulman G | title = Mechanism by Which Metformin Reduces Glucose Production in Type 2 Diabetes | journal = Diabetes | volume = 49 | issue = 12 | pages = 2063–9 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11118008 | doi = 10.2337/diabetes.49.12.2063 | pmc = 2995498[/tpl] [tpl]PDFlink|Free full text|82 KiB[/tpl]  In ruminants, because metabolizable dietary carbohydrates tend to be metabolized by rumen organisms, gluconeogenesis occurs regardless of fasting, low-carbohydrate diets, exercise, etc.
