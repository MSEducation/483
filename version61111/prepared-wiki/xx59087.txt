Known to work in Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, Windows and Mac OS X/Darwin Operating Systems.
Its heyday was in the first half-decade of the 2000s, with reviews appearing in Softpedia,Mihai Marinof (12 September 2006), "Centericq Review", Softpedia. Czech online magazines ABC Linux[tpl]cs icon[/tpl] Matouš Jan Fialka (24 March 2005), CenterICQ - komunikační centrála, ABC Linux, ISSN 1214-1267 and Linux.cz.[tpl]cs icon[/tpl] Petr Šigut (8 October 2004), "Centericq", Linuz.cz, ISSN 1801-3805 It was recommended in a 2004 OSNews article on console applications,Scott Rippee (15 Jan 2004), "Throw That GUI Out the Door: Console Applications That Shine", OSNews, page 2 and in a similar article in the Russian magazine Computerra.[tpl]ru icon[/tpl] Андрей Крупин (9 September 2008), "Консоль Windows: секреты выживания". (Console Windows: the secrets of survival), Computerra Two tutorial articles appeared in the German magazine LinuxUser in 2001 and 2004;Christian Perle (January 2001) "Ich such' dich (I seek you)", LinuxUserFrederik Bijlsma (February 2004) "Kommunikationsszentrale (out of the box: Centericq)", LinuxUser the latter article appeared in the English version of Linux Magazine.Frederik Bijlsma (March 2004) "CenterICQ: Communications Center", Linux Magazine, pp. 78-79 It was included in a 2002 round-up of ICQ clients in the Russian XAKEP magazine,Zero Gravity (January 2002) "Icq под linux (Icq for Linux)", XAKEP, issue 37, pp. 42-43 and in a 2005 round-up review of IRC Clients in Free Software Magazine.Martin Brown (7 September 2005) "Free IRC clients, Choosing the best IRC client for your needs", Free Software Magazine issue 7, web pages 2-3 The FSM reviewer noted CenterICQ for its windows-like interface built on top of the usual curses library, which provides a lot of information, but can look cluttered on smaller terminal windows, including the standard 80 by 25 terminal. It found that IRC support was "excellent" due to support for multiple servers and channels and the ease of switching between them in the “windowed” interface. In September 2002, Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols found it "the greatest of all console IM clients" due to its "excellent interface and a huge number of features and configuration options" in a category review on Freshmeat.Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols (21 September 2002) Instant Messaging Clients, Freshmeat Category Reviews In 2005 it was reviewed in The Unofficial Apple Weblog; despite support for .mac accounts, the reviewer noted "annoying key combos" required to access the menus, because on Mac OS X the usual function key assignments of CenterICQ could not be used. Though he could not access the MSN network, he concluded: "All things considered, I've decided that Centericq is the most stable and intuitive terminal based chat client." Fabienne Serriere (22 Oct 2005) "Terminal Tips: Centericq open source chat aggregator on OS X", The Unofficial Apple Weblog
In August 2007, the project's (then) website stated that CenterICQ development was "dead", and that the website would be shut down in November 2007. The site referred users to the CenterIM fork of the project.[tpl]cite web|title=Welcome to CenterICQ.{de,com,net,org,nl}|publisher=CenterICQ.de|date=August 26, 2007 |url=http://centericq.de| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070826165554/http://centericq.de/ |archivedate=2007-08-26[/tpl] The developers of the CenterIM fork applied several security patches and updates. [tpl]Asof|2009[/tpl], CenterIM was still in development, with version 4.22.9 released on December 14. Neither CenterICQ nor CenterIM 4 support Unicode, but support for UTF-8 is planned for CenterIM 5."FAQ". CenterIM.org. Accessdate 2009.
