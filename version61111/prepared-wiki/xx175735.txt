</ref> was written at the height of [[judicial activism]]. Frankly admitting that he was a restrained judicial activist, Neely explained the practical and political limits to courts’ powers, making his book an important contribution to arguments for [[judicial restraint]]. The book remains in print.
Neely always maintained an active interest in teaching: He was one of the first American professors to teach law in China in 1984 when China opened up; he served as Atherton Lecturer at Harvard; and, for over a decade he was professor of economics at the University of Charleston. On April 15, 1995, Neely retired from the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals and returned to private practice, starting the firm of Neely & Hunter (now Neely & Callaghan) in Charleston, West Virginia.
