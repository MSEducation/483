Somery is a compilation album by the Los Angeles-based punk rock band the Descendents, released in 1991 through SST Records. It compiles songs from the Fat EP (1981) and the albums Milo Goes to College (1982), I Don't Want to Grow Up (1985), Enjoy! (1986), and All (1987).

==Background==

In 1987 SST Records had purchased the Descendents' previous label New Alliance Records, releasing their 1987 album All and re-releasing all of their previous material. Following the Descendents' final tours in Spring and Summer of 1987, singer Milo Aukerman had left the band to pursue a career in biochemistry.[tpl]cite AV media notes |title=All |titlelink=All (All album) |others=All |year=1998 |type=CD bookelt |chapter=All/Descendents Family Shrub |publisher=Owned & Operated Records |id=O&O 007-2 |location=Fort Collins, Colorado[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=All/Descendents Family Shrub |year=1996 |url=http://www.descendentsonline.com/archive/gnusletters/pages/1996fall-b-norb.htm |work=descendentsonline.com |publisher=Descendents |accessdate=2010-02-07[/tpl][tpl]cite AV media notes |title=Hallraker: Live! |titlelink=Hallraker: Live! |others=Descendents |year=1989 |first=Bill |last=Stevenson |authorlink=Bill Stevenson (musician) |type=CD liner |publisher=SST Records |id=SST CD 205 |location=Lawndale, California[/tpl] The remaining members, bassist Karl Alvarez, guitarist Stephen Egerton, and drummer Bill Stevenson, changed the band's name to All and released three albums on the SST subsidiary Cruz Records between 1988 and 1991 with singers Dave Smalley and Scott Reynolds. SST also released the live Descendents albums Liveage! (1987) and Hallraker: Live! (1989), both recorded during the final two Descendents tours. Somery was released in 1991, compiling tracks from the Descendents' past studio releases. Stevenson created the cover art for the compilation while Egerton did the graphics.[tpl]cite AV media notes |title=Somery |others=Descendents |year=1991 |type=CD liner |publisher=SST Records |id=SST CD 259 |location=Lawndale, California[/tpl] The Descendents would later reunite with Aukerman in 1995 to record Everything Sucks.

==Reception==

Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic gave Somery four and a half stars out of five, saying that although "a handful of great songs from their best albums are missing, Somery nevertheless selects the highlights from their occasionally uneven records, making it a useful and comprehensive retrospective."[tpl]cite web |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |title=Review: Somery |publisher=Allmusic |url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r5535|pure_url=yes[/tpl] |accessdate=2010-02-11[/tpl] Erlewine's colleague Mike DaRonco called it a felony that "Pep Talk" from All was not included on the compilation.[tpl]cite web |last=DaRonco |first=Mike |title=Review: All |publisher=Allmusic |url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r5539|pure_url=yes[/tpl] |accessdate=2010-02-11[/tpl] Jenny Eliscu of Rolling Stone called Somery "the only Descendents record to qualify as must-have. It's got virtually all of the winning songs, from the goofy hardcore tunes ... to the more commercial-sounding rockers".[tpl]cite web |last=Eliscu |first=Jenny |title=Descendents Biography |publisher=Rolling Stone |year = 2004 |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/descendents/biography |accessdate=2010-02-14[/tpl]
