==History==

Raised in the historic Dudley Square section of Roxbury, Fakts One grew up surrounded by highly influential local radio & DJs, most notably WILD 1090AM and local university stations WZBC, WMBR, WRBB, and Emerson College's WERS 88.9FM where he would spend his collegiate years (1995â€“1999) in Emerson's undergrad program.
Fakts One has been a key figure in Boston's music scene since the late '90's, DJing at area hip hop shows & WERS 88.9FM. He has performed internationally with his former group The Perceptionists and as the tour DJ for Boston hip hop icon Edo G. 
In 2005, Mr. Lif, Akrobatik, and DJ Fakts One made their constant collaborations official to form The Perceptionists, who released Black Dialogue (Definitive Jux, 2005). The Fakts One produced song "Let's Move" was featured in the EA video games Need For Speed: Most Wanted and NBA Live 06.  Also, a cover of "Five O'Clock" is Dance Dance Revolution Hottest Party 2. His tracks have also been featured in the television programs Cold Case and The Wire.
During the recording process of Black Dialogue, Fakts inked an album deal with Coup D'eTat to release Long Range Long Range, but CDT went under before the album could be released.  NY-based label Nature Sounds eventually released Long Range in 2008 to critical acclaim.
After disappearing for years, he's recently resurfaced with his 2011 instrumental project The Chop Shop, and his newest project Second Chances, a collab effort with Alias. Both albums were released on his own label imprint JWAYmedia
