Yacc is a computer program for the Unix operating system.  The name is an acronym for "Yet Another Compiler Compiler".   It is a LALR parser generator, generating a parser, the part of a compiler that tries to make syntactic sense of the source code, specifically a LALR parser, based on an analytic grammar written in a notation similar to BNF.[tpl]cite web|title=The A-Z of Programming Languages: YACC|url=http://www.techworld.com.au/article/252319/a-z_programming_languages_yacc/?|publisher=Computerworld|accessdate=30 November 2012[/tpl] It was developed in 1970 by Stephen C. Johnson at AT&T Corporation and originally written in the B programming language.[tpl]cite conference |url=http://plan9.bell-labs.com/who/dmr/chist.html |title=The Development of the C Language |last1=Ritchie |first1=Dennis M. |date=April 1993 |publisher=Association for Computing Machinery, Inc.[/tpl]
Yacc and similar programs (largely reimplementations) have been very popular. Yacc itself used to be available as the default parser generator on most Unix systems, though it has since been supplanted as the default by more recent, largely compatible, programs such as Berkeley Yacc, GNU bison, MKS Yacc and Abraxas PCYACC. An updated version of the original AT&T version is included as part of Sun's OpenSolaris project. Each offers slight improvements and additional features over the original Yacc, but the concept and syntax have remained the same. Yacc has also been rewritten for other languages, including OCaml,[tpl]cite web|title=OCaml User's Manual: Chapter 12 Lexer and parser generators (ocamllex, ocamlyacc)|url=http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.00/manual026.html|accessdate=25 Nov 2013[/tpl] Ratfor, ML, Ada, Pascal, Java, Python, Ruby, Go[tpl]cite web|title=Yacc.go: A version of Yacc for the Go Programming Language|url=http://golang.org/cmd/yacc/|accessdate=14 April 2013[/tpl]  and Common Lisp.
Yacc produces only a parser (phrase analyzer); for full syntactic analysis this requires an external lexical analyzer to perform the first tokenization stage (word analysis), which is then followed by the parsing stage proper.[tpl]cite web|title=Yacc: Yet Another Compiler-Compiler|url=http://dinosaur.compilertools.net/yacc/|accessdate=30 November 2012|author=Stephen C. Johnson|location=AT&T Bell Laboratories  Murray Hill, New Jersey 07974[/tpl] Lexical analyzer generators, such as Lex or Flex are widely available. The IEEE POSIX P1003.2 standard defines the functionality and requirements for both Lex and Yacc.
Some versions of AT&T Yacc have become open source. For example, source code (for different implementations) is available with the standard distributions of Plan 9 and OpenSolaris.
