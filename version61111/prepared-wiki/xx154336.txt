The 1956-57 British Home Championship was the final full championship before the Munich air disaster would kill senior members of all four squads mid-way through the following tournament. A close-fought competition between England and Scotland, the tournament also featured some very good performances from Wales and Northern Ireland. For tournaments of the day, this was considered a low scoring affair, although the performances were consistently high.
England won the championship in a close final match, but after the first round and tea could have taken the trophy, Ireland holding England to a draw and the Scots doing likewise with the Welsh. In the second games, Wales were well beaten by England, but Scotland were forced to struggle to a 1–0 win over Ireland. In the final matches, any team could still have taken the trophy, but Wales and Ireland outplayed each other in their match and as a result drew 0–0, leaving the final game to be the decider between the English and the Scots. England triumphed eventually in a tough 2–1 win.
