==Album information==

The lead vocals are mostly from Matt Di Angelo, Calvin Goldspink, Rachel Hyde-Harvey, Helen Kurup, Frankie Sandford, Lorna Want and George Wood. Many of S Club 8's fans believed this to be unfair to the other members of the group, as they had all, save Hannah, contributed vocals to songs during the course of the series.
The show's theme tune, "Dreaming" features on the album, and was the first single to be released off the album.
The songs "Welcome to Avalon Heights" and "Waste Your Time on Me" were also performed on various BBC shows as part of promoting the album. Released on 29 November 2004, it failed to make the top 100 albums chart in the UK managing to peak at 133.
