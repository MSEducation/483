These are reminiscent of the way in which the former [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet Union]] dealt with its dissidents.<ref name="Liberation-A">

[/ref]  Explorations of totalitarianism in the series are not confined to the Federation – totalitarian control through religion (Cygnus Alpha), genetics (The Web) and technology (Redemption) also appear throughout.  Such authoritarian dystopias are common in Terry Nation's work, such his Doctor Who story, Genesis of the Daleks.
Loyalty and trust are important themes of the series. Avon is presented with several opportunities to abandon Blake. Many of Blake's schemes require co-operation and expertise from others.  Characters are often betrayed by family and friends – especially Avon, whose former lover Anna Grant is eventually revealed to be a Federation agent.  The theme of loyalty and trust reaches its peak during Blake and Avon's final encounter in the last episode (Blake); Blake, by now deeply paranoid, has been masquerading as a bounty hunter collaborating with the Federation as a front for his activities in recruiting and testing potential allies in the struggle, and this causes Avon and the others to mistrust him when Tarrant accuses Blake of selling them out; an ironic miscommunication between Avon and Blake precipitates the disastrous events that conclude the episode. If Blake and his crew represent Robin Hood and his Merry Men, then the Federation forces, personified in the obsessive, psychopathic Space Commander Travis and his superior, the beautiful but ruthless Supreme Commander Servalan, represent Guy of Gisbourne and the Sheriff of Nottingham.
A common theme in Nation's science fiction is the depiction of post-apocalyptic societies, as in several of his Doctor Who serials, for example The Daleks, Death to the Daleks and The Android Invasion and in his series Survivors, which Nation created before Blake's 7. Post-apocalyptic societies feature in several Blake's 7 episodes including Duel, Deliverance, City at the Edge of the World and Terminal. Although not explicitly stated, some publicity material for the series refers to the Federation as having risen from the ashes of a nuclear holocaust on Earth.

==Plot summary==

===Series One===

Roj Blake, a worker of high social status classified as "alpha-grade", lives in a domed city. Similar domes house most of the Earth's population. Blake is approached by a group of political dissidents who take him outside the city to meet their leader, Bran Foster. According to Foster, Blake was once the leader of an influential group of political activists opposed to the Federation's Earth Administration. Blake was arrested,  brainwashed and coerced into making a confession denouncing the rebellion. His memory of those years was then blocked. Foster wants Blake to rejoin the dissidents. Suddenly, the meeting is interrupted by the arrival of Federation security forces, who fire on and kill the crowd of rebels. Blake, the only survivor,  returns to the city, where he begins to remember his past. He is arrested, tried on false charges of child molestation and sentenced to deportation to the prison planet Cygnus Alpha.Nation, Terry (writer) & Briant, Michael E. (director).

Political pressure grows on the Administration with planetary leaders threatening to leave the Federation because of its inability to protect them from Blake's  attacks. Rumours abound about Blake's heroism, and other rebel groups use Blake's name for their actions. Supreme Commander Servalan appoints Space Commander Travis, who has a personal vendetta against Blake, to eliminate Blake and capture Liberator. Servalan often co-opts Travis for her personal projects and uses Blake as a cover for her own activities.

Blake discovers Star One's location and finds that, with help from Travis, aliens from the Andromeda galaxy have infiltrated it. Vila discovers a fleet of alien spacecraft beyond the barrier. Travis partially disables the barrier. Blake and his crew overcome the aliens at Star One and kill Travis, but the gap in the barrier allows the aliens to invade. Jenna calls for help from the Federation, where Servalan has conducted a military coup, imposed martial law and declared herself President. Servalan dispatches the Federation's battle fleets to repel the invaders, who begin to breach the barrier.

The Scorpio crew gain the formula for an antidote to Pylene-50, but this cannot reverse the drug's effects. Avon finds a way to synthesise the antidote and the crew attempt to create an alliance between independent worlds to resist the Federation in order to obtain the resources and manpower to mass produce it. They plan large-scale manufacture of the Pylene 50 antidote.

==Production history==

Terry Nation had the idea for Blake's 7 in a moment of inspiration during a pitch meeting with Ronnie Marsh, a BBC drama executive. Marsh was intrigued and immediately commissioned a pilot script.  When he had seen the draft, Marsh approved Blake's 7 for full development.Pixley, Andrew (1995). Blake's 7 Summer Special. ISSN 1353-761X David Maloney, an experienced BBC director, was assigned to produce the series and Chris Boucher was engaged as script editor.  Nation was commissioned to write the thirteen episodes.  Boucher's task was to expand and develop Nation's first drafts into workable scripts, but this became increasingly difficult as Nation started running out of ideas.  Meanwhile Maloney was struggling with the limited budget available given the need for action and special effects.  Despite these challenges Blake's 7 was very popular, with some episodes exceeding ten million viewers.  A second series was quickly commissioned.
The BBC engaged new writers for the subsequent series.  It was decided that one of the regular characters should die, to demonstrate that Blake and his crew were not invincible.  The character of Gan, played by David Jackson, was chosen because Gan had been under-used and was the least popular character.  Although ratings declined compared to the first series, the BBC commissioned a third.  However the team faced a major challenge when Gareth Thomas and Sally Knyvette decided not to return.  New characters were required so that the story could continue without its titular character.  Suggestions for a replacement actor for Blake were rejected and Avon became more prominent in the storyline.  New characters Del Tarrant, portrayed by Steven Pacey, and Dayna Mellanby, portrayed by Josette Simon, were introduced.
Blake's 7 was not expected to be recommissioned after the third series.  Therefore there was surprise when in 1980 a further series was announced as the third series ended.  Bill Cotton, BBC Head of Television, had watched Terminal and greatly enjoyed it.  He telephoned the presentation department and ordered them to make the announcement.  As David Maloney was unavailable, Vere Lorrimer became the producer.  He introduced new characters and a new spacecraft Scorpio, and its computer Slave.  Jan Chappell (who played Cally) decided that she did not want to return, and was replaced by Glynis Barber as Soolin.
Gareth Thomas made a final appearance as Blake, and insisted that his character be killed off in a definitive manner.  Although the fourth series performed satisfactorily in the ratings, Blake's 7 was not renewed again and the final episode had an ambiguous finale.  Except for Blake, whose death was contractual, the characters were shown being attacked in such a way that their survival would have been possible had a fifth series been commissioned.  The final episode Blake was broadcast on 21 December 1981.

==Music and sound effects==

Blake's 7's signature music was written by Australian composer Dudley Simpson, who had composed music for Doctor Who for over ten years. The same recording of Simpson's theme was used for the opening titles of all four series of the programme.[tpl]cite web |url = http://www.dudleysimpson.com/discography.htm| title = Dudley Simpson Discography |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080229154350/http://www.dudleysimpson.com/discography.htm |archivedate = 26 January 2012 | publisher = | author = Chris Brimelow[/tpl] For the fourth series, a new recording was made for the closing credits that used an easy listening-style arrangement.Details largely taken from documentary included Blake's 7 series 4 DVD Simpson also provided the incidental music for all of the episodes except for the Series One episode "Duel" and the Series Two episode "Gambit". "Duel" was directed by Douglas Camfield, who bore a personal grudge against Simpson and refused to work with him, and so Camfield used library music.[tpl]cite web|title = Doctor Who Magazine issue 259 , 17 December 1997 in Dr. Who/Douglas Camfield |url = http://experts.about.com/q/Dr-1102/Douglas-Camfield.htm |publisher = The New York times Company |work = All Experts |date = 12 July 2005 |accessdate =17 January 2012 |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/64kbqzFFd |archivedate = 17 January 2012[/tpl] Elizabeth Parker provided the music and sound effects for "Gambit". Blake's 7 made considerable use of audio effects that are described in the credits as "special sound". Many electronically-generated sound effects were used, ranging from foley-style effects for props including handguns, teleport sounds, spacecraft engines, flight console buttons and background atmospheres. The special sounds for Blake's 7 were provided by the BBC Radiophonic Workshop composers Richard Yeoman-Clark and Elizabeth Parker.

==Critical reception==

Blake's 7 received both positive and negative reviews.  The fourth episode Time Squad review by Stanley Reynolds of The Times stated, " ... nice to hear the youngsters holding their breath in anticipation of a little terror."  Reynolds elaborated, "Television science fiction has got too self-consciously jokey lately.  It is also nice to have each episode complete within itself, while still carrying on the saga of Blake's struggle against the 1984-ish Federation. But is that dark-haired telepathic alien girl, the latest addition to Blake's outer-space merry men, going to spell love trouble for blonde Jenna?  Maid Marian never had that trouble in Sherwood Forest."[tpl]cite news|title=Blake's Seven — BBC1|publisher=The Times|first=Stanley|last=Reynolds|date=24 January 1978|page=7[/tpl]
In January 1998 Robert Hanks of The Independent compared the series' ethos to that of Star Trek.  He wrote "If you wanted to sum up the relative position of Britain and America in this century – the ebbing away of the pink areas of the map, the fading of national self-confidence as Uncle Sam proceeded to colonise the globe with fizzy drinks and Hollywood – you could do it like this: they had Star Trek, we had Blake's 7 ... No 'boldly going' here: instead, we got the boot stamping on a human face which George Orwell offered as a vision of humanity's future in Nineteen Eighty-Four."  Hanks concluded that "Blake's 7 has acquired a credibility and popularity Terry Nation can never have expected ... I think it's to do with the sheer crappiness of the series and the crappiness it attributes to the universe: it is science-fiction for the disillusioned and ironic – and that is what makes it so very British."[tpl]cite news|title=A Very British Space Crew|url = http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/a-very-british-space-crew-1138688.html |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/652M8LPLh|archivedate = 28 January 2012 |publisher = Independent Digital News and Media Limited |work=The Independent|location = London| first=Robert|last=Hanks|date=15 January 1998|accessdate=17 January 2007|page=3[/tpl]
Gavin Collinson of  the British Film Institute's website Screenonline wrote "The premise of Blake's 7 held nothing remotely original. The outlaw group resisting a powerful and corrupt regime is an idea familiar from Robin Hood and beyond.  He added "Blake's 7's triumph lay in its vivid characters, its tight, pacey plots and its satisfying realism...For arguably the first time since the 1950s Quatermass serials, the BBC had created a popular sci-fi/fantasy show along adult lines."  His review concludes "Ultimately, the one force the rebels could not overcome proved to be the BBC's long-standing apathy towards science fiction. However, the bloody finale, in which Avon murders Blake, exemplified the programme's strengths – fearless narratives, credible but surprising character development and an enormous sense of fun."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/537301/ |title=BFI Screenonline: Blake's 7 (1978-81) |author = Gavin Collinson| publisher=British Film Institute |accessdate=25 April 2009 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110629042906/http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/537301/ |archivedate=29 July 2011[/tpl]
On the negative side, broadcaster and critic Clive James called the series " ... classically awful British television SF ... no apostrophe in the title, no sense in the plot."  James continued "The depraved space queen Servalan ... could never quite bring herself to volatilize the dimly heroic Blake even when she had him square in the sights of her plasmatic spasm guns. The secret of Blake’s appeal, or Blakes appeal, for the otherwise infallibly fatale Servalan remained a mystery, like the actual wattage of light bulb on which the design of Blake’s spaceship, or Blakes spaceship, was plainly based."[tpl]cite web |author = James, Clive |url = http://tls.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,25338-1930109,00.html |title = Clive James's literary education in sludge fiction|publisher = Times Newspapers L:td. |work = Times Online |date = 14 December 2005 |accessdate =1 September 2008 |archiveurl = http://wayback.archive.org/web/*/http://tls.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,25338-1930109,00.html |archivedate = 10 February 2008[/tpl]

==Legacy==

Blake's 7's legacy to future television and film space opera was the use of moral ambiguity and dysfunctional main characters to create tension, and of long-term story arcs to aid cohesiveness.  These devices can be seen in Babylon 5, Lexx, Andromeda, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Farscape, Firefly and the reimagined Battlestar Galactica. These programmes contrast with the simple good-versus-evil dualism of Star Wars, or the 'feel-good' tone and unconnected episode structure of both early Star Trek and the series' main contemporary Doctor Who.  Blake's 7 also influenced Hyperdrive and Aeon Flux."Forever Avon" special feature on the Blakes 7 series 4 UK DVD
Television playwright Dennis Potter's final work Cold Lazarus was inspired by the show.
Blake's 7 remains highly regarded.  A poll of United States science-fiction writers, fans and critics for John Javna's 1987 book The Best of Science Fiction placed the series 25th in popularity, despite then only having recently begun to be broadcast in the US.  A similar poll in Britain conducted for SFX magazine in 1999 put Blake's 7 at 16th place, with the magazine commenting that "twenty years on, TV SF is still mapping the paths first explored by Terry Nation's baby".  In 2005 SFX surveyed readers' top 50 British telefantasy shows of all time, and Blake's 7 was placed at number four behind The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Red Dwarf and Doctor Who.  A similar poll conducted by TV Zone magazine in 2003 for the top 100 cult television programmes placed Blake's 7 11th.
Dutch musician Arjen Anthony Lucassen was inspired by Blake's 7 in naming his side-project Star One.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.arjenlucassen.com/starone/so_index.html |title=Arjen Lucassen website |publisher=Arjenlucassen.com |date=1 November 2010 |accessdate=15 December 2010 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20110723133432/http://www.arjenlucassen.com/content/arjens-projects/star-one/ |archivedate = 23 July 2011[/tpl]  Star One's album Space Metal features a song called "Intergalactic Space Crusaders" based on the series. The Orb's album The Orb's Adventures Beyond The Ultraworld features a song called "A Huge Ever Growing Pulsating Brain That Rules from the Centre of the Ultraworld", which is a reference to the episode Ultraworld.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]
In 2004 a 15-minute comedy film entitled Blake's Junction 7 debuted at several film festivals around the world.  It was directed by Ben Gregor, written by Tim Plester, and starred Mackenzie Crook, Martin Freeman, Johnny Vegas, Mark Heap and Peter Tuddenham.  This parody depicted the characters taking a break at the Newport Pagnell motorway service area.[ref]

==Revivals==

The revival of Blake's 7 has been mooted for some years. Terry Nation raised the possibility on a number of occasions and proposed that a new series would be set some years after the existing one. Avon, living in exile like Napoleon on Elba, would be persuaded by a new group of rebels to resume the fight against the Federation.[tpl]cite journal |author = Nazzaro, Joe |date = September 1992 |title = Terry Nation's Blake's 7 Part Two|publisher = TV Zone |issue = 34: |pages = 28–30.|id =  ISSN 0957-3844[/tpl]

===Radio and audio===

In 1998 Blake's 7 returned to the BBC on the radio.  The Sevenfold Crown was broadcast by BBC Radio 4 on 17 January 1998 as part of its Playhouse strand.  The play was produced by Brian Lighthill and written by Barry Letts.  Paul Darrow, Michael Keating, Steven Pacey, Peter Tuddenham and Jacqueline Pearce reprised their television roles, but Josette Simon and Glynis Barber were replaced by Angela Bruce as Dayna and Paula Wilcox as Soolin.  The story was set during the fourth series between the episodes Stardrive and Animals.  This was followed up by The Syndeton Experiment, which featured the same cast, producer and writer and was broadcast as The Saturday Play on 10 April 1999 by BBC Radio 4.Pixley, Andrew (2004).

===Television===

In April 2000 producer Andrew Mark Sewell announced that he had bought the rights to Blake's 7 from the estate of Terry Nation, and was planning to produce a TV movie set 20 years after the finale of the original series.[ref]
[tpl]cite news| title = Blake's 7 relaunch on film| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/705922.stm|publisher = British Broadcasting Corporation| work = BBC News| date = 7 April 2000| accessdate =8 November 2006 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/64kNr7HJk| archivedate = 17 January 2012[/tpl][/ref]  In July 2003, Sewell announced that he, Paul Darrow and Simon Moorhead had formed a consortium called 'B7 Enterprises' that had acquired the rights and was planning a TV miniseries budgeted at between five and six million US dollars.  Darrow would play Avon and the series was to be televised in early 2005, depending on " ... many factors, not least financing".  Paul Darrow subsequently left the project in December 2003, citing "artistic differences".
On 31 October 2005 B7 Enterprises announced it had appointed Drew Kaza as Non-Executive Chairman and that it was working on two Blake's 7 projects.  Blake's 7: Legacy would be a two part, three hour mini-series, which would be written by Ben Aaronovitch and D. Dominic Devine.  Blake's 7: The Animated Adventures would be a 26-part children's animated adventure series written by Aaronovitch, Andrew Cartmel, Marc Platt and James Swallow.  In an interview with Doctor Who Magazine, writer and producer Matthew Graham said that he had been involved in discussions to bring back Blake's 7.  Graham's concept was that a group of young rebels would rescue Avon, who had been kept cryogenically frozen by Servalan, and then roam the galaxy in a new ship named Liberator.
On 24 April 2008 television station Sky1 announced that it had commissioned two 60-minute scripts for a potential series, working alongside B7 Productions.  On 4 August 2010 the station said it had decided not to commission the series.  B7 Productions said the decision was " ... obviously disappointing", but that the development process has resulted in the " ... dynamic reinvention of this branded series". It said it was confident it would find another partner to bring a new version of Blake’s 7 to television.[tpl]cite web|author=Matthew Hemley |url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/29175/sky-1-drops-blakes-7-revival |title=Sky 1 drops Blake's 7 revival |publisher=The Stage Newspaper Limited |work = The Stage |date=4 August 2010 |accessdate=15 December 2010 | archiveurl =http://www.webcitation.org/64kM4ITEq |archivedate = 17 January 2012[/tpl]

==Merchandise==

Terry Nation had done well financially from commercial exploitation of the Doctor Who Daleks, and recognised the potential for merchandise related to Blake's 7.[tpl]cite book |author1=Bignell, Jonathan |author2= O'Day, Andrew|year= 2004|title= Biographical sketch, Terry Nation|location=Manchester |publisher=Manchester University Press|pages=9–24 |ISBN=978-0-7190-6547-7[/tpl] Nation and his agent Roger Hancock discussed this with Ray Williams of BBC Merchandising in December 1976.  By May 1977 twenty-seven items of merchandise had been proposed for release by companies including Palitoy, Letraset and Airfix.  However only a small quantity of these was ever made available.
A small number of toys and models were produced.  In 1978 Corgi Toys produced a two inch long die-cast model of Liberator with a transparent rear globe.  The following year this was re-released in silver with a model space shuttle, and in blue on its own.  Also in 1979 Blue Box Toys produced three space vehicle toys that carried the series logo; however these had never appeared in the TV programme.  In 1989 Comet Miniatures produced a nine-inch long injection moulded model kit of Liberator, which contained many parts.  They also produced a white metallic two-inch Liberator model, and a three-inch Federation trooper figure. A Scorpio clip gun, and Liberator and Scorpio teleport bracelets, were also produced.
The children's programme Blue Peter offered a cheaper home-made alternative to fans who wanted merchandise.  In its 23 February 1978 show, presenter Lesley Judd demonstrated how to create a replica Liberator teleport bracelet from common household objects.  This was followed up on 6 June 1983 when presenter Janet Ellis demonstrated a similar method of making a replica Scorpio bracelet.

===Music===

The sheet music of the Blake's 7 theme was published by Chappell & Co. Ltd in 1978 with a photograph of Liberator on the front cover.  Dudley Simpson's theme music was also released as a single, with The Federation March (a piece of incidental music from the episode Redemption) on the B-side. The Blake's 7 theme was also released on an album BBC Space Themes, and Liberator was featured on the album sleeve.  Another version of the theme, 'Blake's 7 Disco', was recorded by Federation and released in 1979 on Beeb Records with a B-side unconnected with the series.  Many of the sound effects from the series were released in 1981 on an album BBC Sound Effects No. 26 – Sci-Fi Sound Effects, and re-released later on CD as Essential Science Fiction Sound Effects Vol. 1.

===Books and magazines===

Blake's 7 books were produced by various authors and publishers. The first was entitled Blake's 7, written by Trevor Hoyle and Terry Nation, and published in 1978.  Its US title was Blake's 7 - Their First Adventure.  Hoyle wrote two more books in the series: Blake's 7: Project Avalon (1979, novelising the episodes Seek–Locate–Destroy, Duel, Project Avalon, Deliverance and Orac) and Blake's 7: Scorpio Attack (1981, novelising the episodes Rescue, Traitor and Stardrive).[tpl]cite journal | last = Pixley | first = Andrew |date=Winter 1994 | title = A Novel Approach | journal = Blake's 7 Winter Special | page = 51 | id = ISSN 1353-761X [/tpl] Publications continued to be issued after the series had ended.  Tony Attwood's Blake's 7: The Programme Guide, published by Target in 1982, is a factual overview of the series with a detailed episode guide, an encyclopedia, and interviews with the cast and writers. It was re-issued by Virgin Books in 1994. Attwood also wrote an original novel called Afterlife, which is set after the final episode and was published by Target in 1984. Another original novel Avon: A Terrible Aspect by Paul Darrow told the story of Avon's early years before he met Blake, and was published in 1989.
World Distributors produced Blake's 7 Annuals for 1979, 1980 and 1981.  These featured stories, games, artwork and articles about space.  In October 1981 Marvel UK began publishing Blake's 7 – A Marvel Monthly, which included a comic strip by Ian Kennedy as well as text stories, features and photographs.  Twenty-five issues including two 'specials' were published, until the magazine closed in August 1983.  Marvel produced two 'special' magazines in 1994 and 1995, with much of the content written by TV historian Andrew Pixley and about how the series was made.  Seven issues of Blake's 7 Poster Magazine were published between December 1994 and May 1995.
Several books offering insight and background information to Blake's 7 were produced, including Blake's 7: The Complete Guide by Adrian Rigelsford (Boxtree, 1995), Blake's 7: The Inside Story by Joe Nazzaro and Sheelagh Wells (Virgin, 1997), A History and Critical Analysis of Blake's 7 by John Kenneth Muir (McFarland and Company, 1999), and Liberation. The Unofficial and Unauthorised Guide to Blake's 7 by Alan Stevens and Fiona Moore (Telos, 2003).[ref]

===Video and DVD releases===

In 1985 BBC Video issued four compilation videocassettes containing highlights from the first three series edited into 90 minute features. The first released was The Beginning, containing excerpts from The Way Back, Spacefall, Cygnus Alpha and Time Squad.  Duel was released in 1986 with highlights of Seek–Locate–Destroy, Duel and Project Avalon.  In the same year Orac was released, containing excerpts from Deliverance, Orac and Redemption.  The first three tapes were available in both VHS and Betamax format.  The final tape The Aftermath was released in Australia in 1986, with extracts from Aftermath, Powerplay and Sarcophagus.  In 1990 all four tapes were re-released in the UK on VHS.[ref]

From 1991 BBC Video released Blake's 7 in episodic order on 26 VHS cassettes with two episodes per tape.  Canadian company BFS also released these in North America. In 1997 Fabulous Films re-released these tapes in different packaging.  The BBC and Fabulous Films planned to issue the series in four DVD box sets, but this was disrupted by conflicts with rights-holders B7 Enterprises.  These issues were resolved and one series per year was released on Region 2 DVD between 2003 and 2006. In 2007 Amazon sold a four-series box set, but a casualty of the difficulties with Blake's 7 Enterprises was The Making of Blake's 7, a four-part documentary directed by Kevin Davies, originally intended as an extra feature with each DVD release.  B7 Enterprises said they " ... did not feel documentary provided a proper tribute or fresh retrospective of the show". The discs contained extra features including bloopers, out-takes, alternative scenes, voiceover commentaries, interviews and behind the scenes footage.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dvdbits.com/reviews.asp?id=3034 |title=DVD and Blu-ray Reviews and News |publisher= John Zois |work = DVD Bits |author = Bruce Flynn |date = 23 October 2005 |accessdate=17 January 2012 |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/64kVbR3h6 |archivedate = 17 January 2012[/tpl]
