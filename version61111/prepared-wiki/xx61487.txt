The artistic design for the museum was led by Mr. Hessan, an Afghan artist living in Germany. The museum houses displays how a cobbler repairs worn out shoes, tandoori bread is baked, a carpet-maker ties knots for a large Afghan carpet with the famous Elephantfoot pattern. Exhibitions display a look inside a tea house and a Turkmen tent called yurt, or under an Afghan veil (chadri). Reproductions of the great fortress of Bost, Qala-e-Bost, in Lashkar Gah, the big Buddhas of Bamyan, and the minaret of Jam are represented.
The store offers green tea flavoured with cardamom, roasted chick peas, raisins, mulberries, Afghan jewellery and clothes are sold.
