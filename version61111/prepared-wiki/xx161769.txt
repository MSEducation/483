==History==

===B4 (2004-2008)===

B4 launched in June 2004 under the name of "B4". The channel used to play the latest pre release music videos from the biggest artists and groups around. It also had hours dedicated to playing the most recently requested music. The channel had advertised itself as both 'B4 It's A Hit' and 'B4 Everyone Else'.
The B4 logo was on screen in the bottom left-hand corner during music videos and the song information is shown in a white coloured bar at the start and near the end of each music video. The channels' identity was also seen before and after advert breaks when the B4 logo forms on screen in a white box shape on an orange background.
B4 was available 24 hours a day on Sky channel 357 and is part of a bouquet of music channels owned by CSC Media.

===B4 TV series===

B4 was an early morning music video programme broadcast from 2004 on weekdays on Channel 4 at 7am. It was normally broadcast as part of Channel 4's breakfast programming following children's programme The Hoobs and preceding a number of comedy programmes normally imported from America.
Produced by the firm behind ITV's The Chart Show, and spun off from their B4 music channel on satellite, the show featured around seven new upfront videos each day that were going to be released in the United Kingdom in the near future, normally within the next month.

===Flava rebrand (2008-2012)===

The B4 rebrand to Flava first came to light by the Ofcom licence for B4 being removed and replaced by one under the name of Flava, this also reflected the EPG references of the term "Flava" being used to describe the programmes being shown, in late February/early March 2008.

===Flava (2012 - present)===

On Monday 26 November 2012, Flava has used a new logo within a triangular icon on the gold colour has been abolished.

==Ofcom licences mix-up==

The problems started on Monday 18 February 2008, when the currently named "Flava" Ofcom Licence was renamed from its original name of Flaunt to Flava. This caused a major uproar about the fact that Flaunt, a 24/7 dance channel would be closed, in favour for Flava (a 24/7 Urban/R&B music channel, similar to Kiss & B4). This, however turned out to be an error on Ofcom's part and they accidentally changed Flaunt, when they were meant to change the B4 one. But, on the following Monday, Ofcom corrected the problem by removing the B4 licence, keeping the newly renamed Flava licence and adding a new Flaunt licence.
