SamuelSpelled thus in Fine, The Early Medieval Balkans; also Ostrogorsky, Treadgold, opp. cit., Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium. In French, compare Adontz, Nicholas. "Samuel l'Armenien, Roi des Bulgares", in Études Arméno-Byzantines. Lisbonne: Livraria Bertrand, 1965, pp. 347-407. (also Samuil, representing Bulgarian Самуил, pronounced [tpl]IPA-bg|samuˈil|[/tpl]) was the Tsar (Emperor) of the First Bulgarian Empire from 997 to 6 October 1014.A History of the Byzantine state and society, Warren Treadgold, Stanford University Press, 1997, ISBN 0804726302,  p. 871. From 977 to 997, he was a general under Roman I of Bulgaria, the second surviving son of Emperor Peter I of Bulgaria, and co-ruled with him, as Roman bestowed upon him the command of the army and the effective royal authority.One theory is that from 972/976 to 997 Samuel co-ruled with Roman I of Bulgaria, who was the official tsar until 997, when he died in Byzantine captivity. Roman is mentioned as tsar in several historical sources; for example the Annals by Yahya of Antioch call Roman "Tsar" and Samuel "Roman's loyal military chief". However, other historians dispute this theory, as Roman was castrated and so technically could not have claimed the crown. There was also a governor of Skopje called Roman who surrendered the city to the Byzantines in 1004, receiving the title of patrician from Basil II and becoming a Byzantine strategos in Abydus (Skylitzes-Cedr. II, 455, 13), but this could be a mere coincidence of names. As Samuel struggled to preserve his country's independence from the Byzantine Empire, his rule was characterized by constant warfare against the Byzantines and their equally ambitious ruler Basil II.
In his early years Samuel managed to inflict several major defeats on the Byzantines and to launch offensive campaigns into their territory.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cc.ece.ntua.gr/~conster/English/PageData/samuel.htm |title= Samuil of Bulgaria|accessdate=2008-05-23 |work= |publisher= |date= [/tpl] In the late 10th century, the Bulgarian armies conquered the Serb principality of Duklja[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9065243/Samuel |title=Britannica Online - Samuel of Bulgaria |accessdate=2008-05-23 |work= |publisher= |date= [/tpl] and led campaigns against the Kingdoms of Croatia and Hungary. But from 1001, he was forced mainly to defend the Empire against the superior Byzantine armies. Samuel died of a heart attack on 6 October 1014, two months after the catastrophic battle of Kleidion, and Bulgaria was fully subjugated by Basil II four years later, ending the five decades-long Byzantine–Bulgarian conflict.Whittow, Making of Orthodox Byzantium, pp. 387-388.
Samuel was considered "invincible in power and unsurpassable in strength".Stephenson, P., The legend of Basil the Bulgar-slayer, p. 16, ISBN 0-521-81530-4Sullivan. D. F., ed. and tr., The life of St Nikon, Brookline, 1987, pp. 140-142. Similar comments were made even in Constantinople, where John Kyriotes penned a poem offering a punning comparison between the Bulgarian Emperor and a comet which appeared in 989.Schlumberger, G, L'épopée byzantine á la fin de dixiéme siécle, 1. Jean Tzimisés; les jeunes années de Basile II, le tueur de Bulgares (969-989), Paris 1896, pp. 643-644.
During Samuel's reign, Bulgaria gained control of most of the Balkans (with the notable exception of Thrace) as far as southern Greece. He moved the capital from Skopje to Ohrid,  which had been the cultural and military centre of southwestern Bulgaria since Boris I's rule,[tpl]cite web |url= http://wwfow.chrysostompress.org/about-ochrid|title= About Ohrid|accessdate=2008-05-23 |work= |publisher= |date= [/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=July 2011[/tpl] and made the city the seat of the Bulgarian Patriarchate. Because of that, sometimes his realm is called Western Bulgarian Kingdom or Western Bulgarian Empire.The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Edward Gibbon, J. B.

Although Samuel's reign brought the end of the First Bulgarian Empire, he is regarded as a heroic ruler in Bulgaria.Andreev, J.

==The rise of the Cometopuli==

===The Cometopuli===

Samuel was the fourthStephen Runciman, A History of the First Bulgarian Empire, pp. 217-218. and youngest son of count (comita) Nikola, a Bulgarian noble, who might have been the Count of Sredets (Sofia),[tpl]cite book |last=Prokić |first=Božidar |title=Die Zusätze in der Handschrift des Johannes Scylitzes. Codex Vindobonensis hist. graec. LXXIV. |location=München |year=1906 |page=28 |language=German |oclc=11193528 [/tpl] although other sources suggest that he was a regional count somewhere in the region of today  Macedonia.Southeastern Europe in the early Middle Ages. Florin Curta. page 241 His mother was Ripsimia of Armenia.[tpl]cite journal |last=Adontz |first=Nicholas |title=Samuel l'Armenien, roi des Bulgares |journal=MAR Bclsmp |issue=39 |year=1938 |page=37 |language=French [/tpl] The actual name of the dynasty is not known. “Cometopuli” is the nickname which is used by Byzantine historians to address rulers from the dynasty as its founder. Samuel and the Cometopuli rose to power, out of the disorder that occurred the Bulgarian Empire from 966 to 971.

===Russian invasion and deposition of Boris===

During the reign of Peter I, Bulgaria prospered in a long-lasting peace with Byzantium. This was secured by the marriage of Peter with a Byzantine princess Maria Lakapina. However after Maria's death in 963, the truce had been shaken and Peter I sent his sons Boris and Roman in Constantinople, as honorary hostages, to honor the new terms of the peace treaty.According to Zlatarski (History of the Bulgarian state, I, 2, pp. 544, 562.) the sons of Peter I were sent in the Byzantine capital in 963 as one of the term to resettle the peace treaty of 927. According to other historians such as Andreev (Who is who in Medieval Bulgaria, p. 41.) the heirs to the Bulgarian throne became hostages per a Bulgarian-Byzantine agreement against the Kievan Rus' in 968. During these years the Byzantines and Bulgarians had entangled themselves in a war with Kievan Rus' prince Sviatoslav, who invaded Bulgaria several times. After a defeat from Sviatoslav, Peter I suffered a stroke and died shortly afterward in 969 (or 970). As both of his heirs were in the Byzantine capital the Bulgarian throne became empty. Boris was allowed back to Bulgaria to take his fathers throne, restore order and oppose Sviatoslav, but had little success. This was allegedly used by Samuil and his brothers, who were contemplating a revolt in 969.Skylitzes records:  He Peter himself died shortly afterwards, whereupon the sons were sent to Bulgaria to secure the ancestral throne and to restrain the 'children of the counts' from further t. David, Moses, Aaron and Samuel, children of one of the powerful counts in Bulgaria, were contemplating an uprising and were unsettling the Bulgars'
This forced Byzantine emperor John Tzimiskes to intervene. He quickly invaded Bulgaria, defeated the Rus, and conquered the Bulgarian capital Preslav in 970 (971). Boris II of Bulgaria was ritually divested of his imperial insignia in a public ceremony in Constantinople and he and his brother Roman of Bulgaria remained in captivity. Although the ceremony in 971 had been intended as a symbolic termination of the Bulgarian empire, the Byzantines were unable to assert their control over the western provinces of Bulgaria. Count Nikola, Samuil's father, who had close ties to the royal court in Preslav,Blagoeva, B. For the origins of Emperor Samuil (Za proizhoda na tsar Samuil, За произхода на цар Самуил), Исторически преглед, № 2, 1966, стр. 91-94 died in 970. In the same year”They (the Cometopuli) make their first appearance under the government of Kekaumenos, the strategos of Larissa ... (980-983)”: Adontz. "Samuel l'Armenien", 358. "the sons of the Count" Samuel, David, Moses and Aaron rebelled against John I Tzimiskes.Ioannes Scylitzes. Historia. 2, pp. 346–347 The series of events are not clear due to contradicting sources, but it is sure that after 971, Samuil and his brothers were the de facto rulers of the Western Bulgarian lands.
In 973, the Cometopuli sent envoys to the Holy Roman Emperor Otto I in Quedlinburg in an attempt to secure the protection of their lands.Delev, 12. The decline of the First Bulgarian Empire ( 12. Zalezat na Parvoto Balgarsko Tsarstvo 12. Залезът на Първото българско царство). The brothers ruled together in a tetrarchy.Bozhilov, Gyuzelev, 1999, pp. 314-315. David ruled the southernmost regions and led the defense of one of the most dangerous border areas, around Thessaloniki and Thessaly. The centres of his possessions were Prespa and Kastoria. Moses ruled from Strumitsa, which would be an outpost for attacks on the Aegean coast and Serres. Aaron ruled from Sredets, and was to defend the main road from Adrianople to Belgrade, and to attack Thrace. Samuel ruled northwestern Bulgaria from the strong fortress of Vidin. He was also to organize the liberation of the conquered areas to the east, including the old capital Preslav.[tpl]cite journal |last=Petrov |first=P |title=Rebellion of Peter and Boyan in 976 and struggle of the Cometopuli with Byzantium (Vosstanie Petra i Boyana v 976 i borba Komitopulov s Vizantiei, Восстание Петра и Бояна в 976 г. и борьба Комитопулов с Византией) |journal=Byzantinobulgarica |issue=1 |year=1962 |pages=130–132 |language=Russian [/tpl] Some records suggest that David played a major role in this tumultuous period of Bulgarian history.Zlatarski, p. 615.

===War with Byzantium===

After John I Tzimiskes died on 11 January 976, the Cometopuli launched an assault along the whole border. Within a few weeks, however, David was killed by Vlach vagrants and Moses was fatally injured by a stone during the siege of Serres.Skylitzes, pp. 334–335. The brothers' actions to the south detained many Byzantine troops and eased Samuel's liberation of northeastern Bulgaria; the Byzantine commander was defeated and retreated to Crimea.[tpl]cite book |last=Levchenko |first= М.

After suffering these defeats in the Balkans, the Byzantine Empire descended into civil war. The commander of the Asian army, Bardas Scleros, rebelled in Asia Minor and sent troops under his son Romanus in Thrace to besiege Constantinople. The new Emperor Basil II did not have enough manpower to fight both the Bulgarians and the rebels and resorted to treason, conspiracy and complicated diplomatic plots.Petrov, p. 133. Basil II made many promises to the Bulgarians and Scleros to divert them from allying against him.Petrov, pp. 133–134.  Aaron, the eldest living Cometopulus, was tempted by an alliance with the Byzantines and the opportunity to seize power in Bulgaria for himself. He held land in Thrace, a region potentially subject to the Byzantines threat. Basil reached an agreement with Aaron, who asked to marry Basil's sister to seal it. Basil instead sent the wife of one of his officials with the bishop of Sebaste. However, the deceit was uncovered and the bishop was killed.[tpl]cite book |title=General history of Stephan from Taron (Vseobshaya istoriya Stepanosa Taronskogo, Всеобщая история Степаноса Таронского |pages=175–176 |language=Russian [/tpl] Nonetheless, negotiations proceeded and concluded in a peace agreement. The historian Scylitzes wrote that Aaron wanted sole power and "sympathized with the Romans".Scylitzes, pp. 434–435. In this context, by "Romans" Skylitzes understands "Byzantines". Samuel learned of the conspiracy and the clash between the two brothers was inevitable. The quarrel broke out in the vicinity of Dupnitsa on 14 June 976 and ended with the annihilation of Aaron's family. Only his son, Ivan Vladislav, survived because Samuel's son Gavril Radomir pleaded on his behalf.[tpl]cite journal |last=Petrov |first=P |title=Formation and consolidation of the Western Bulgarian state (Obrazuvane i ukrepvane na Zapadnata Balgarska darzhava, Образуване и укрепване на Западната Българска държава) |journal=Гсуифф |volume=53 |issue=2 |year=1959 |pages=169–170 |language=Bulgarian[/tpl] From that moment on, practically all power and authority in the state was held by Samuel and the danger of an internal conflict was all but eliminated.
However, another theory suggests that Aaron participated in the battle of the Gates of Trajan which took place ten years later. According to that theory Aaron was killed on 14 June 987 or 988.Seibt, Untersuchungen, p. 90.[tpl]cite book |last=Rozen |first=V.

==Co-rule with Roman==

After the Byzantine plan to use Aaron to cause instability in Bulgaria failed, they tried to encourage the rightful heirs to the throne,Boris II and Roman were sons of Peter I whose dynasty had ruled Bulgaria since the reign of Khan Krum (803-814) Boris II and Roman, to oppose Samuel. Basil II hoped that they would win the support of the nobles and isolate Samuel or perhaps even start a Bulgarian civil war.Petrov, p. 134 Boris and Roman were sent back in 977Adontz. "Samuel l'Armenien", p. 353. but while they were passing through a forest near the border, Boris was killed by Bulgarian guards who were misled by his Byzantine clothing. Roman, who was walking some distance behind, managed to identify himself to the guards.Skylitzes, pp. 434–435.
Roman was taken to Vidin, where he was proclaimed Emperor of Bulgaria.Prokić, p. 28. Samuel became his first lieutenant and general and together they gathered an army and fought the Byzantines.[tpl]cite book |last=Rozen |first=V. R |title=Emperor Basil the Bulgar-slayer: extractions from Yuhia of Antioch's chronicles (Imperator Vasiliy Bolgaroboytsa: izvecheniya iz letopisi Yahi Antiohijskago, Император Василий Болгаробойца: извлечения из летописи Яхи Антиохийскаго) |publisher=Variorum Reprints |location=London |pages=20–21 |language=Russian |isbn=978-0-902089-39-6 |year=1972 [/tpl] During his captivity, Roman had been castrated on the orders of John I Tzimiskes so that he would not have heirs. Thus Samuel was certain to eventually succeed Roman. The new emperor entrusted Samuel with the state administration and became occupied with church and religious affairs.[tpl]cite journal |last=Petrov |first=P |title=On the question concerning the authenticity of the Virgin charter and the data it contains (Po vaprosa za awtentichnostta na Virginskata gramota i sadarzhastite se v neya danni, По въпроса за автентичността на Виргинската грамота и съдържащите се в нея данни) |journal=Гсуифф |issue=54 |volume=2 |year=1958 |pages=219–225 |language=Bulgarian [/tpl]
As the main effort of Basil II were concentrated against the rebel Skleros, Samuel's armies attacked the European possessions of the Byzantine Empire. Samuel invaded not only Thrace and the area of Thessaloniki, but also Thessaly, Hellas and Peloponnese. Many Byzantine fortresses fell under Bulgarian rule.Skylitzes, pp. 435–436. Samuel wanted to seize the important fortress of Larissa, which controlled the key routes in Thessaly, and from 977 to 983, the town was blockaded. After starvation forced the Byzantines to surrender,[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.bartleby.com/67/441.html|title= The Encyclopedia of World History. 2001.

With this victory, Bulgaria had gained influence over most of the southwestern Balkans, although it did not occupy these territories. From Larissa, Samuel took the relics of Saint Achilleios, which were laid in a specially built church of the same name on an island in Lake Prespa.Skylitzes, p. 436.Kekaumenos, Strategikon, eds. B.

The Bulgarian successes in the west raised fears in Constantinople, and after serious preparations, Basil II launched a campaign into the very centre of the Bulgarian EmpireOstrogorsky, G. History of the Byzantine state (Istorija Vizantije, Исторijа Византиje), pp. 391-393. to distract Samuel from southern Greece.Leo Diaconus, Historia, p. 171.W. Seibt, Untersuchungen zur Vor- und Frühgeschichte der bulgarischen Kometopulen, Handes Amsorya 89 (1975), pp. 65-98. The Byzantine army passed through the mountains around Ihtiman and besieged Sofia in 986. For 20 days, the Byzantines assaulted the city, but their attacks proved fruitless and costly: several times, the Bulgarians came out of the city, killed many enemy soldiers and captured draught animals and horses. Eventually, the Bulgarian troops burned the siege equipment of the Byzantine army, forcing Basil II to withdraw to Thrace, but on 17 August 986,Rozen, p. 21. while passing through the mountains, the Byzantine army was routed at the Trajan's Gates Pass. This was a significant blow for Basil,Stephen of Taron, pp. 185-186.[tpl]Clarify|pre-text=?|date=December 2009[/tpl]Dennis, Three Treatises, pp. 242-43. who was one of the few to return to Constantinople; his personal treasure was captured by the victors.Skylitzes, pp. 436–438.[tpl]cite book |last=Gilferding |first=А |title=Letters from the history of Serbians and Bulgarians (Pisma ob istorii serbov i bolgar, Письма об истории сербов и болгар) |location=Москва |year=1868 |oclc=79291155 |language=Russian |page=209 [/tpl]
After the defeat, the rebellion of Bardas Phocas diverted the efforts of the Byzantine Empire into another civil war.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.roman-emperors.org/basilii.htm|title= Roman Emperors - Basil II|accessdate=2008-03-23 |work= |publisher= |date= [/tpl]Al-Rudrawari, pp. 28-35.Ostrogorsky, G.

Manuscriptis Bibliothecae Regiae Parisiensis, J.A.Cramer (ed.), 4 Vols (Oxford, 1839-1841), Vol 4, pp. 271, 282.Rozen, p. 27. Basil II sent a large army to the town and appointed a new governor, Gregorios Taronites,Skylitzes, p. 446. but he was powerless to stop the Bulgarian advance. By 989, the Bulgarian troops had penetrated deep into Byzantine territory,John Geometres: Anecdota Graeca, E Codd. Manuscriptis Bibliothecae Regiae Parisiensis, J.A.Cramer (ed.), 4 Vols (Oxford, 1839-1841), Vol 4, pp. 271-273, 282-283. and seized many fortresses, including such important cities as Veria and Servia. In the south, the Bulgarians marched throughout Epirus and in the west they seized the area of modern Durrës (medieval Dyrrhachium or Drach) on the Adriatic Sea.Zlatarski, pp. 645–647.[tpl]cite book |last=Vasilyevskiy |first=V.

In 989, Phocas was killed and his followers surrendered, and the following year Basil II reached an agreement with Skleros.Ostrogorsky, Byzantine State, pp.303-308 The Byzantines focused their attention on Bulgaria,Zlatarski, pp. 651–652. and counter-attacked in 991.Yahya, PO 23 (1932), pp. 430-431.Stephen of Taron, p. 198.[tpl]Clarify|pre-text=?|date=December 2009[/tpl] The Bulgarian army was defeated and Roman was captured while Samuel managed to escape.Rozen, p. 34. The Byzantines conquered some areas; in 995, however, the Arabs invaded Asia Minor and Basil II was forced to move many of his troops to combat this new threat. Samuel quickly regained the lost lands and advanced south. In 996, he defeated the Byzantines in the battle of Thessaloniki. During the battle, Thessaloniki's governor, Gregorios, perished and his son Ashot was captured.Skylitzes, p. 449 Elated by this success, the Bulgarians continued south. They marched through Thessaly, overcame the defensive wall at Thermopylae and entered the Peloponnese, devastating everything on their way.Skylitzes, pp. 449–450
As a response, a Byzantine army under Nikephorus Uranos was sent after the Bulgarians, who returned north to meet it. The two armies met near the flooded river of Spercheios. The Byzantines found a place to ford, and on the night of 19 July 996 they surprised the unprepared Bulgarian army and routed it in the battle of Spercheios.Skylitzes, p. 450 Samuel's arm was wounded and he barely escaped captivity; he and his son allegedly feigned death.Stephenson, P., The legend of Basil the Bulgar-slayer, p. 17, ISBN 0-521-81530-4 After nightfall they headed for Bulgaria and walked [tpl]convert|400|km|mi|0[/tpl] home. Research of Samuel's grave suggests that the bone in his arm healed at an angle of 140° but remained crippled.Andreev, 1999, pp. 331-334.

==Emperor==

In 997, Roman died in captivity in Constantinople, ending the line of rulers started by Krum. Because of the war with Byzantium, it was dangerous to leave the throne vacant for long, and Samuel was chosen as the new Emperor of Bulgaria because he had the closest relations to the deceased emperor and was Roman's long-standing military commander.Rozen, p. 43. The presbyter of Duklja also marked the event: "By that time among the Bulgarian people rose one Samuel, who proclaimed himself Emperor. He led a long war against the Byzantines and expelled them from the whole territory of Bulgaria, so that the Byzantines did not dare to approach it."[tpl]cite book |last=Šišić |first=Ferdo |title=Chronicle of the Dukljean priest (Letopis popa Dukljanina, Летопис попа Дукљанина) |year=1928 |publisher=Serbian Royal Academy |location=Belgrade |page=330 |language=Serbian |oclc=4434344 [/tpl]

Constantinople would not recognize the new emperor, as for the Byzantines Boris II's abdication symbolized the official end of Bulgaria and Samuel was considered a mere rebel. Instead Samuel sought recognition from the Pope, which would be a serious blow to the position of the Byzantines in the Balkans and would weaken the influence of the Patriarch of Constantinople, thereby benefiting both the See of Rome and Bulgaria. Samuel possibly received his imperial crown from Pope Gregory V.[tpl]cite journal |last=Duichev |first=Iv. |title=Correspondence of Pope Innocent III with the Bulgarians (Prepiska na papa Inokentii III s balgarite, Преписка на папа Инокентий III с българите.) |journal=Гсуифф |issue=38 |year=1942 |pages=22–23 |language=Bulgarian [/tpl] There is no direct evidence for this recognition, but in his correspondence with Pope Innocent III two centuries later, the Bulgarian emperor Kaloyan pointed out that his predecessors Peter and Samuel had received imperial recognition by Rome.

===War against Serbs and Croats===

In 998, Samuel launched a major campaign against the Serbian principality of Duklja to prevent an alliance between Prince Jovan Vladimir and the Byzantines. When the Bulgarian troops reached Duklja, the Serbian prince and his people withdrew to the mountains. Samuel left part of the army at the foot of the mountains and led the remaining soldiers to besiege the coastal fortress of Ulcinj. In an effort to prevent bloodshed, he asked Jovan Vladimir to surrender. After the prince refused, some Serb nobles offered their services to the Bulgarians and, when it became clear that further resistance was fruitless, the Serbs surrendered. Jovan Vladimir was exiled to Samuel's palaces in Prespa.Šišić, p. 331.
The Bulgarian troops proceeded to pass through Dalmatia, taking control of Kotor and journeying to Dubrovnik. Although they failed to take Dubrovnik, they devastated the surrounding villages. The Bulgarian army then attacked Croatia in support of the rebel princes Krešimir III and Gojslav and advanced northwest as far as Split, Trogir and Zadar, then northeast through Bosnia and Raška and returned to Bulgaria. This Croato-Bulgarian War allowed Samuel to install vassal monarchs in Croatia.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2011[/tpl]
Samuel's daughter Theodora Kosara fell in love with the captive Jovan Vladimir. The couple married after gaining Samuel's approval, and Jovan returned to his lands as a Bulgarian official along with his uncle Dragomir, whom Samuel trusted.Šišić, p. 334. Meanwhile, Princess Miroslava fell in love with the Byzantine noble captive Ashot and threatened to commit suicide if she was not allowed to marry him. Samuel conceded and appointed Ashot governor of Dyrrhachium.Skylitzes, p. 451. Samuel also sealed an alliance with the Magyars when his eldest son and heir, Gavril Radomir, married the daughter of the Hungarian Grand Prince Géza.[tpl]cite book |last=Venedikov |first=Iv. |chapter=The first wedlock of Gavril Radomir (Parviyat brak na Gavril Radomir, Първият брак на Гаврил Радомир) |title=Collection in memory of Аl.

===Advance of the Byzantines===

The beginning of the new millennium saw a turn in the course of Byzantine-Bulgarian warfare.Holmes, Basil II and the government of the empire, vii, pp. 264-265. Basil II had amassed an army larger and stronger than that of the Bulgarians: determined to definitively conquer Bulgaria, he moved much of the battle-seasoned military forces from the eastern campaigns against the Arabs to the BalkansAntoljak, Samuel and his estate, pp. 78-80.R. V. Rozen, Emperor Basil the Bulgar-slayer (Imperator Vasiliy Bolgaroboytsa, Император Василий Болгаробойца), p. 34. and Samuel was forced to defend rather than attack.Аndreev, J. The Bulgarian Khans and Tsars (Balgarskite hanove i tsare, Българските ханове и царе), Veliko Tarnovo, 1996, p. 125. ISBN 954-427-216-X
In 1001, Basil II sent a large army under the patrician Theodorokanos and Nicephorus Xiphias to the north of the Balkan Mountains to seize the main Bulgarian fortresses in the area. The Byzantine troops recaptured Preslav and Pliska,Skylitzes, p. 452. putting north-eastern Bulgaria once again under Byzantine rule. The following year, they struck in the opposite direction, marching through Thessaloniki to tear off Thessaly and the southernmost parts of the Bulgarian Empire. Although the Bulgarian commander of the fortress of Veroia, Dobromir, was married to one of Samuel's nieces, he voluntarily surrendered the fort and joined the Byzantines.Ibidem. II, р. 452. The Byzantines also captured the fortress of Kolidron without a fight, but its commander Dimitar Tihon managed to retreat with his soldiers and join Samuel. The next town, Servia, did not fall so easily; its governor Nikulitsa organized the defenders well. They fought until the Byzantines penetrated the walls and forced them to surrender.Zonaras, ibid., IV, pp. 118–119. Nikulitsa was taken to Constantinople and given the high court title of patrician, but he soon escaped and rejoined the Bulgarians. He attempted to retake Servia, but the siege was unsuccessful and he was captured again and imprisoned.Skyl.—Cedr., ibid., II, pp. 452–453.
Meanwhile, Basil II's campaign reconquered many towns in Thessaly. He forced the Bulgarian population of the conquered areas to resettle in the Voleron area between the Mesta and Maritsa rivers. Edessa resisted for weeks but was conquered following a long siege. The population was moved to Voleron and its governor Dragshan was taken to Thessaloniki, where he was betrothed to the daughter of a local noble. Unwilling to be married to an enemy, Dragshan three times tried to flee to Bulgaria and was eventually executed.Skylitzes, pp. 452–454.

===War with Hungary===

The Byzantine-Bulgarian conflict reached its apex in 1003, when Hungary became involved. Since the beginning of the 9th century, the Bulgarian territory had stretched beyond the Carpathian Mountains as far as the Tisza River and the middle Danube. During the reign of Samuel, the governor of these northwestern parts was Duke Ahtum, the grandson of Duke Glad, who had been defeated by the Hungarians in 930s. Ahtum commanded a strong army and firmly defended the northwestern borders of the Empire. He also built many churches and monasteries through which he spread Christianity in Transylvania.Legenda Saneti Gerhardi episcopi, p. 489.Venedikov, p. 150.
Although Gavril Radomir's marriage to the daughter of the Hungarian ruler had established friendly relations between the two strongest states of the Danube area, the relationship deteriorated after Géza's death. The Bulgarians supported Gyula and Koppány as rulers instead of Géza's son Stephen I. As a result of this conflict, the marriage between Gavril Radomir and the Hungarian princess was dissolved. The Hungarians then attacked Ahtum, who had directly backed the pretenders for the Hungarian crown. Stephen I convinced Hanadin, Ahtum's right-hand man, to help in the attack. When the conspiracy was uncovered Hanadin fled and joined the Hungarian forces.Legenda Saneti Gerhardi episcopi, pp. 492–493. At the same time, a strong Byzantine army besieged Vidin, Ahtum's seat. Although many soldiers were required to participate in the defense of the town, Ahtum was occupied with the war to the north. After several months he died in battle when his troops were defeated by the Hungarians.Venedikov, pp. 151–152.  As a result of the war, Bulgarian influence to the northwest of the Danube diminished.

===Further Byzantine successes===

The Byzantines took advantage of the Bulgarian troubles in the north. In 1003, Basil II led a large army to Vidin, northwestern Bulgaria's most important town. After an eight-month siege, the Byzantines ultimately captured the fortress,Skylitzes, p. 454. allegedly due to betrayal by the local bishop.[tpl]cite book |last=Ivanov |first=Jordan |title=Bulgarian historical monuments in Macedonia (Balgarski starini iz Makedoniya, Български старини из Македония) |year=1970 |origyear=1931 |publisher=Nauka i izkustvo |location=Sofia |page=557 |language=Bulgarian |oclc=3736478 [/tpl] The commanders of the town had repulsed all previous attempts to break their defence, including the use of Greek fire.Prokić, p. 30. While Basil's forces were engaged there, Samuel struck in the opposite direction: on 15 August he attacked Adrianople and plundered the area.Skylitzes, pp. 454–455.
Basil II decided to return to Constantinople afterwards, but, fearing an encounter with the Bulgarian army on the main road to his capital, he used an alternate route.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2008[/tpl] The Byzantines marched south through the Morava valley and reached a key Bulgarian city, Skopje, in 1004. The Bulgarian army was camping on the opposite side of the Vardar River. After finding a ford and crossing the river, Basil II attacked and defeated Samuel's unsuspecting army, using the same tactics employed at Spercheios.Skylitzes, p. 455. The Byzantines continued east and besieged the fortress of Pernik. Its governor, Krakra, was not seduced by Basil's promises of a noble title and wealth, and successfully defended the fortress. The Byzantines withdrew to Thrace after suffering heavy losses.Zlatarski, pp. 685–687.
In the same year, Samuel undertook a march against Thessaloniki. His men ambushed and captured its governor, Ioannes Chaldus,Actes d'Iviron I. Des origines au milieu du XIe siècle, Archives de l'Athos XIV, eds. J.Lefort, N.Oikonomides, D.Papachryssanthou, H.Métrévéli (Paris, 1985), doc. 8 but this success could not compensate for the losses the Bulgarians had suffered in the past four years. The setbacks in the war demoralized some of Samuel's military commanders, especially the captured Byzantine nobles. Samuel's son-in-law Ashot, the governor of Dyrrhachium, made contact with the local Byzantines and the influential John Chryselios, Samuel's father-in-law. Ashot and his wife boarded one of the Byzantine ships that were beleaguering the town and fled to Constantinople. Meanwhile, Chryselios surrendered the city to the Byzantine commander Eustathios Daphnomeles in 1005, securing the title of patrician for his sons.Ostrogorsky, G. History of the Byzantine state (Istorija Vizantije, Исторijа Византиje), pp. 404-405.
In 1006[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]1007, Basil II penetrated deep into the Bulgarian-ruled landsGilferding, p. 250. and in 1009 Samuel's forces were defeated at Kreta, east of Thessaloniki.Златарски, pp. 689–690. During the next years, Basil launched annual campaigns into Bulgarian territory, devastating everything on his way.Skylitzes, p. 457. Although there was still no decisive battle, it was clear that the end of the Bulgarian resistance was drawing nearer; the evidence was the fierceness of the military engagements and the constant campaigns of both sides which devastated the Bulgarian and Byzantine realms.Daulaurier, p. 37.[tpl]Clarify|date=October 2008[/tpl]

===Disaster at Kleidion===

In 1014, Samuel resolved to stop Basil before he could invade Bulgarian territory. Since the Byzantines usually used the valley of the Strumitsa River for their invasions into Bulgaria, Samuel built a thick wooden wall in the gorges around the village of Klyuch (also Kleidion, "key") to bar the enemy's way.
When Basil II launched his next campaign in the summer of 1014, his army suffered heavy casualties during the assaults of the wall. Meanwhile, Samuel sent forces under his general Nestoritsa to attack Thessaloniki so as to distract Basil's forces away from this campaign. Nestoritsa was defeated near the citySelected sources for the Bulgarian history, Volume II: The Bulgarian states and the Bulgarians in the Middle Ages (Podbrani izvori za balgarskata istoriya, Tom II: Balgarskite darzhavi i balgarite prez srednovekovieto, Подбрани извори за българската история, Том II: Българските държави и българите през средновековието), p. 66. by its governor Botaniates, who later joined the main Byzantine army near Klyuch.Пириватрич, Самуиловата държава, p. 136. After several days of continuous attempts to break through the wall, one Byzantine commander, the governor of Plovdiv Nicephorus Xiphias, found a by-pass and, on 29 July, attacked the Bulgarians from the rear. Despite the desperate resistance the Byzantines overwhelmed the Bulgarian army and captured around 14,000 soldiers,[tpl]cite book |first=Al. |last=Fol |title=Short history of Bulgaria (Kratka istoriya na Balgariya, Кратка история на България) |location=Sofia |year=1983 |publisher=Nauka i izkustvo |page=71 |language=Bulgarian |oclc=8553856 |author-separator=, |author2=V.

After the Battle of Kleidion, on the order of Basil II the captured Bulgarian soldiers were blinded; one of every 100 men was left one-eyed so as to lead the rest home.[tpl]cite book |last=Duichev |first=Ivan |year=1943–1946 |publisher=Hemus |location=Sofia |title=In the old Bulgaria literature (Iz starata balgarska knijnina, Из старата българска книжнина) |volume=2 |page=102 |language=Bulgarian |oclc=80070403 [/tpl]Cecaumenes. Strategion, pp. 65-66. The blinded soldiers were sent back to Samuel who reportedly had a heart attack upon seeing them. He died two days later, on 15 October 1014. This savagery gave the Byzantine emperor his byname Boulgaroktonos ("Bulgar-slayer" in [tpl]Lang-el|Βουλγαροκτόνος[/tpl]). Some historians theorize it was the death of his favourite commander that infuriated Basil II to blind the captured soldiers.Zlatarski, p. 699.
The battle of Kleidion had major political consequences. Although Samuel's son and successor, Gavril Radomir, was a talented military leader, he was unable to restore the Bulgarian Empire's previous power. After Samuel's death, many of his subordinates, including Krakra, surrendered to the Byzantines. In the deep north-northwest, the duke of Syrmia, Sermon, was deceived and killed by the Byzantines.Zlatarski, pp. 742–744.

==Family, grave and legacy==

Samuel's wife was called Kosara. The name of his second wife was Agatha. Samuel had five children: the successor Gavril Radomir and four daughters: Theodora Kosara, Miroslava, Katun Anastasiya and Agatha. Gavril Radomir married twice, to Ilona of Hungary and Irina from Larissa; Kosara married the Prince of Duklja, Jovan Vladimir; Miroslava married the captured Byzantine noble Ashot and Katun Anastasiya married the Hungarian noble Vazul.
After the fall of Bulgaria, Samuel's descendants assumed important positions in the Byzantine court after they were resettled and given lands in Asia Minor and Armenia. Оne of his granddaughters, Catherine, became empress of Byzantium. Another grandchild, Peter II Delyan, led an attempt to restore the Bulgarian Empire after a major uprising in 1040[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]1041. Two other women of the dynasty became Byzantine empresses,[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.promacedonia.org/vz1b/vz1b_prit_15.html|title= V. Zlatarski - Istorija 1 B - Priturka 15|accessdate=2008-09-10 |work= |publisher= |date= [/tpl] while many nobles served in the army as strategos or became governors of various provinces.

There is also another version about Samuel's origin. The 11th-century historian Stepanos Asoghik wrote that Samuel had only one brother, stating they were both Armenians from the district of Derjan, an Armenian land incorporated into the Byzantine Empire. They were sent to fight the Bulgarians in Macedonia but ended up joining them.Asoghik (Stepanos de Taron). L'histoire universelle, Paris, 1859. Translation in German, Leipzig, 1907. This version is supported by the historian Nicholas Adontz, who analyzed the events and facts of the century and concluded that Samuel had only one brother, David.Adontz. "Samuel l'Armenien", pp. 347-407. Asoghik's version is also supported by the historian Jordan Ivanov;Иванов, Йордан (Jordan Ivanov). Произход на цар Самуиловия род (The origin of the family of the king Samuel). In: Сборник в чест на В. Н. Златарски, София, 1925. furthermore, only one brother is mentioned on Samuel's Inscription.
The Arab historian Yahya of Antioch claims that the son of Samuel, Gavril, was assassinated by the leader of the Bulgarians, son of Aaron, because Aaron belonged to the race that reigned over Bulgaria. Asoghik and Yahya clearly distinguish the race of Samuel from the one of Aaron or the race of the Cometopuli from the royal race. According to them, Moses and Aaron are not from the family of the Cometopuli. David and Samuel were of Armenian origin and Moses and Aaron were Armenian on their mother's side.Adontz. "Samuel l'Armenien", pp. 387-390.
Samuel's grave was found in 1965 by Greek professor Nikolaos Moutsopoulos in the Church of St Achillios on the eponymous island in Lake Prespa. Samuel had built the church for the relics of the saint of the same name. What is thought to have been the coat of arms of the House of Cometopuli,[ref]Edouard Selian.

Samuel's face was reconstructed to restore the appearance of the 70-year-old Bulgarian ruler. According to the reconstruction, he was a sharp-faced man, bald-headed, with a white beard and moustache.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.bnr.bg/RadioBulgaria/Emission_Bulgarian/Theme_IstoriaIReligia/Material/samuil_reconstrukica.htm |title=The appearance of Tsar Samuel is resurrected in Moscow |date=2007-03-05 |accessdate=2007-04-28 |language=Bulgarian |publisher=Radio Bulgaria [/tpl]
Samuel is among the most renowned Bulgarian rulers. His military struggle with the Byzantine Empire is marked as an epic period of Bulgarian history.

==Nomenclature==

Samuel's empire had its heartlands around Ohrid, west and southwest of this earlier cultural center of the First Bulgarian Empire. Thus, the Russian-born Yugoslavian historian George Ostrogorsky distinguished Samuel's Empire from the Bulgarian Empire, referring to it as a "Macedonian Empire", although he claims that it was politically and ecclesiastically a direct descendant of the empire of Simeon and Peter, and it was regarded by Samuel and the Byzantines as being the Bulgarian Empire, itself.History of the Byzantine State (Rutgers, 1969), p. 301-302. Some historians of the same school, such as the Serbian scholar Anastasijević, claimed even that Samuel ruled a separate Slavic Macedonian Empire founded as result of an anti-Bulgarian rebellion.Anastasiavić, D. N. Hypothesis on Western Bulgaria (Hipoteza o Zapadnoj Bugarskoj, Хипотеза о Западноj Бугарскоj), Glasnik Skopskog nauchnog drushtva, b. III, Skopie, 1928. 
After the breakup of Yugoslavia, these outdated theories have been rejected by authoritative Serbian historians from SANU.Istorijski časopis 2002, br. 49, str. 9-25, izvorni naučni članak, Pohod bugarskog cara Samuila na Dalmaciju. Živković Tibor D. SANU - Istorijski institut, Beograd.Pirivatrić, Samuilova država: obim i karakter, Самуилова држава: обим и карактер.Vizantološki institut (Srpska akademija nauka i umetnosti), Naučno delo, 1997, st. 253-256. They are still tenaciously held only in the Republic of Macedonia, where the official state doctrine refers to a "Macedonian Slavic", or even  to "Ethnic Macedonian" Empire.An outline of Macedonian history from ancient times to 1991. Macedonian Embassy London. Retrieved on 2007-04-28. However, this controversy is ahistorical, as it projects modern ethnic distinctions onto the past.The Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium, Vol 1, New York-Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1991 (p. 1838) Moreover, the Byzantine authors of this era that mention Macedonia, referred to the Theme of Macedonia, a province in what is now Thrace.The migrations during the early Byzantine centuries also changed the meaning of the geographical term Macedonia, which seems to have moved to the east together with some of the non-Slavic population of the old Roman province. In the early 9th century an administrative unit (theme) of Makedonikon was established in what is now Thrace (split among Bulgaria, Greece, and Turkey) with Adrianopleas its capital. It was the birthplace of Emperor Basil I (867–886), the founder of the so-called Macedonian dinasty in Byzantinum. Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Macedonia, Dimitar Bechev, Scarecrow Press, 2009, ISBN 0810862956, p. Iii Most of the modern region of Macedonia, was then a Bulgarian province known as Kutmichevitsa,The entry of the Slavs into Christendom: an introduction to the medieval history of the Slavs, A. P. Vlasto, CUP Archive, 1970, ISBN 0-521-07459-2, p. 169.  and partially corresponded to the Byzantine provinces of Thessalonica and Strymon.By the beginning of the 9th century the theme of Macedonia, with its capital at Adrianople consisted not of Macedonian but of Thracian territories. During the Byzantine period the Macedonia proper corresponded to the themes of Thessalonica and Strymon. Brill's Companion to Ancient Macedon: Studies in the Archaeology and History of Macedon, 650 BC - 300 AD, Robin J. Fox, Robin Lane Fox, BRILL, 2011, ISBN 9004206507, p. 35. The area was incorporated into the Byzantine Empire in 1018 as a new province called Bulgaria.When the barbarian invasions started in the fourth through seventh centuries AD in the Balkans, the remnants of the Hellenes who lived in Macedonia were pushed to eastern Thrace, the area between Adrianople (presently the Turkish city of Edirne) and Constantinople. This area would be called theme of Macedonia by the Byzantines... whereas the modern territory of Rep. of Macedonia was included in the theme of Bulgaria after the destrution of Samuels Bulgarian Empire in 1018.
