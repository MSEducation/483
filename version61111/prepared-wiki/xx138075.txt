Foxtrot is a benefit compilation which was released to raise funds for treating John Balance's alcohol addiction.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/dec/11/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries|title=Obituary: John Balance|last=Smith|first=Richard|date=11 December 2004|work=The Guardian|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6LGmlYoRB|archivedate=20 November 2013[/tpl] The album features tracks by Balance's close friends, including his group Coil and was released via their label Chalice.
For this release Coil were John Balance, Peter Christopherson, and Drew McDowall.
"In My Head A Crystal Sphere Of Heavy Fluid" is one of only two songs ever released by Peter Christopherson credited solely to himself, using his own name ("All Possible Numbers", on Autumn Blood (Constructions), is the other). "Blue Rats (Blue Cheese Mix)" is a remix of "Blue Rats" from the album A Thousand Lights In A Darkened Room. "Heartworms" appears in an altered form on the compilation Terra Serpentes. "Inflatable Sideshow" is Steven Stapleton. "Bone Frequency" is an altered version of the track from Nurse With Wound's The Swinging Reflective. Nurse With Wound's "Think Jazz, Think Punk Attitude" is the track "Cooloorta Moon" as played on BBC Radio 3's Mixing It program.
This album was produced in a CD and 2X10" vinyl version. The 2X10" release is limited to 1000 copies on "magnolia" coloured vinyl (off white with red & pink flecks - although some copies don't have the flecks) and 30 numbered copies on grey vinyl (most personally signed and given to friends of the bands).
