Kōwhai are small, woody legume trees in the genus Sophora native to New Zealand. There are eight species, Sophora microphylla and S. tetraptera being the most recognised as large trees. Their natural habitat is beside streams and on the edges of forest, in lowland or mountain open areas.[tpl]cite web|title=KOWHAI|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/kowhai/1|publisher=Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=8 September 2012[/tpl]  Kōwhai trees grow throughout the country and are a common feature in New Zealand gardens. Outside of New Zealand, kōwhai tend to be restricted to mild temperate maritime climates. 
The name kōwhai comes from the Māori word for yellow—a reference to the colour of the flower. It is also called kōhai in some areas.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.maoridictionary.co.nz/index.cfm?dictionaryKeywords=kowhai/|title= Māori names for Kōwhai[/tpl] Usually the name is spelled as kōwhai (frequently without the macron).
Despite having no official status as such,"Nationhood and identity", in Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand. the blooms of the kōwhai are widely regarded as being New Zealand's national flower."Kowhai" in New Zealand A to Z.

==Species==

The 8 species of the kōwhai are: 

==Description and ecology==

Most species of kōwhai grow to around 8 m high and have fairly smooth bark with small leaves. S. microphylla has smaller leaves (5–7 mm long by 3–4 mm wide) and flowers (2.5-3.5 cm long) than S. tetraptera which has leaves of 1–2 cm long and flowers that are 3 cm-5 cm long.
The very distinctive, almost segmented pods, which appear after flowering each contain six or more smooth, hard, yellow seeds. These seeds can be very numerous and the presence of many hundreds of these distinctively yellow seeds on the ground quickly identifies the presence of a nearby kōwhai tree. Many species of kōwhai are semi-deciduous and lose most of their leaves immediately after flowering in October or November, but quickly produce new leaves. Flowering of kōwhai is staggered from July through to November, meaning each tree will get attention from birds such as tui, wood pigeon and bellbird.[tpl]cite web|url=http://researcharchive.lincoln.ac.nz/dspace/bitstream/10182/347/7/campbell_msc.pdf.txt|author=Kirsten L.

The wood of kōwhai is dense and strong and has been used in the past for tools and machinery.[tpl]cite web|title=KOWHAI|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/kowhai/1|publisher=Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=31 August 2012[/tpl] 
Sophora is one of the four genera of native legumes in New Zealand; the other three are Carmichaelia, Clianthus, and Montigena.

==Cultivation==

Kōwhai can be grown from seed or tip cuttings in spring and autumn.[tpl]cite web|title=Native Plants at Piha|url=http://www.piha.co.nz/natives.htm#kowhai|accessdate=2009-01-17[/tpl] The hard, dark or bright yellow seeds germinate best after chitting and being soaked in water for several hours. They can also benefit from a several minute submersion in boiling water to soften the hard shell and then being kept in the same water, taken off boil, for several hours to soak up the water.http://www.hbrc.govt.nz/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=agysH%2BBO92c%3D&tabid=244&mid=1231 Raising Native Plants From Seed Young kōwhai are quite frost tender, so cuttings or seedlings should be planted in their second year when they are 30 cm or higher.[tpl]cite web|title=Trees for Survival|url=http://www.tfsnz.org.nz/resources.cfm#kowhai|accessdate=2009-01-17[/tpl]
If grown from seed kōwhai can take many years to flower, the number of years varies depending on the species.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gardenguides.com/84037-plant-kowhai.html|title= Years for kowhai to flower[/tpl]
S. prostrata, sometimes called "Little Baby", is used as a Bonsai tree. It grows up to two metres high, has zigzaging stems, and sparse smallish leaves.[tpl]cite web|title=Sophora—The Kowhais of New Zealand|url=http://www.ipps.org/Papers/NewZealand%5CHughes.PDF|accessdate=2008-11-05[/tpl]

==Dangers==

All parts of the kōwhai, but particularly the seeds, are poisonous to humans.[tpl]cite web|title=Poisonous Plants at the Royal New Zealand Institute of Horticulture|url=http://www.rnzih.org.nz/pages/poison.html|accessdate=2008-05-20[/tpl] There, however, do not appear to have been any confirmed cases in humans of severe poisoning following ingestion of kōwhai in New Zealand.[tpl]cite web|title=Poisonous plants in New Zealand: a review of those most commonly enquired about to the National Poisons Centre|first1=Robin|last1=Slaughter|first2=Michael|last2=Beasley|first2=Bruce|last3=Lambie|first4=Gerard|last4=Wilkins|first5=Leo |last5=Schep|url=http://journal.nzma.org.nz/journal/abstract.php?id=5483|accessdate=2013-03-27|year=2012|work=The New Zealand Medical Journal[/tpl]

==Traditional Māori use==

Traditionally the Māori used the flexible branches as a construction material in their houses and to snare birds. The kōwhai flowers were a source of yellow dye.[tpl]cite web|title=Sophora microphylla (Kowhai)|url=http://www.terrain.net.nz/friends-of-te-henui-group/table-1/kowhia.html|publisher=Taranaki Educational Resource: Research, Analysis and Information Network|accessdate=31 August 2012[/tpl] 
Māori would also use the kōwhai tree as medicine. The bark was heated in a calabash with hot stones, and made into a poultice to treat wounds or rubbed on a sore back[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/en/rongoa-medicinal-use-of-plants/4 |title=Rongoā – medicinal use of plants – Other medicinal plants |last1=Jones |first1=Rhys|date=2 March 2009 |work=Te Ara – the Encyclopedia of New Zealand |publisher= |accessdate=8 November 2010[/tpl] or made into an infusion to treat bruising or muscular pains.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Durie  |first1=Sir Mason |last2= |first2= |year=2010 |title=Te whakahaumanutanga me te oranga hinengaro o mua – Ka mātaia ngā huanga o te rongoā – Traditional healing and mental health: measuring the effectiveness of rongoā |journal=Best Practice Journal |publisher=Best Practice Advocacy Centre |volume=June |issue=28 |pages=5–7 |url=http://www.bpac.org.nz/magazine/2010/june/docs/BPJ_28_rongoa_pages5-7.pdf |doi= [/tpl] If someone was bitten by a seal, an infusion (wai kōwhai) was prepared from kōwhai and applied to the wounds and the patient was said to recover within days.
