In an exclusive interview with Nick Jr., Rosemary Wells, the author of the highly acclaimed children's books the show is based on, says: "We don't see Max and Ruby's parents because I believe that kids resolve their issues and conflicts differently when they're on their own. The television series gives kids a sense about how these two siblings resolve their conflicts in a humorous and entertaining way."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nickjr.com/max-ruby/about-max-ruby/meet-max-and-ruby-creator_ap.html |title=Meet the Creator of Max & Ruby |date= |work=nickjr.com |publisher=Nick Jr. |accessdate=February 18, 2013[/tpl] For the first season, Jamie Whitney was the director, and the first episodes were mostly written by Kate Barris and Patrick Granleese.

==Overview==

Each episode consists of three self-contained vignettes. Within each, Ruby is typically engaged in some sort of project or activity (which usually involves Max whether he's willing to participate or not), while Max has a particular interest of his own which either runs counter to his sister's or distracts her. Generally, Max's dialog within each story is usually limited to just one word or a two-word phrase, which he repeats periodically for the rest of the episode until the end, sometimes saying a different word (or on rare occasions a full sentence[tpl]citation needed|date= October 2011[/tpl]). Since he only uses the same word when communicating, what he is trying to say is often misinterpreted. By the end of the story, Max usually ends up helping Ruby in some way, to her benefit and delight, or outsmarts her when she is trying to restrict him. Their parents are never seen or mentioned although there is a family photo hanging in the entry room, however, their grandmother makes regular appearances.

==Characters==

===Main characters===

Max – A white rabbit who is Ruby's little brother. His typical role in every episode of the TV series is to come up with an idea or desire against Ruby's will. Ruby will try to talk him out of it, but Max would keep asking for what he wants, but Ruby would continue her will, making Max lose hope in getting what he desires and then find a way to outsmart Ruby and her friends. He usually says just one repeated word per episode to express his desire or idea, such as "faster", sometimes a phrase such as "bad egg", or even short sentences. This makes communicating with others difficult as they often misinterpret him. He wears blue overalls with a red-striped cream shirt, however, sometimes Max wears other outfits. His best friend is Louise's cousin, Morris who acts as if he was Max's sidekick. He often manages to be more clever than his older sister and her friends.[tpl]citation needed|date= October 2011[/tpl] But sometimes manages to help Ruby and her friends from his tricks. He often plays with his toys.
Ruby – A white rabbit and Max's older sister.[tpl]cite web|title=Max and Ruby|url=http://maxandruby.treehousetv.com/characters/14/max|accessdate=June 23, 2013[/tpl] Her role in the TV series to try to talk Max out of an idea or desire he has and she would continue her will when Max asks for what he wants, ending with Max completely losing hope in getting his desire, however he would always find a way to outsmart Ruby and her friends. Her appearance is virtually exactly the same as Max, except that she's taller and wears a yellow dress with flower patterns in seasons one and two, then switches to a pink dress in seasons three and four. She behaves in an over-protective and maternal manner to Max, for example persuading him to do something against his will because, according to her, "it's what's best for him". She likes to have tea parties, or regular parties with her dolls or friends as guests. She is often bossy or even rude to Max, often losing patience with him, however, she does love him. She is usually seen with at least one of her friends, often Louise, who is her best friend.[tpl]citation needed|date= October 2011[/tpl] It is revealed that Max is given some of her toys when she's outgrown them, and some toys they share, for example in an episode called "Max's Rabbit Racer", Max now owns Ruby's doll Pinocchio. She always refers to the toys by their entire brand names (for example, she will say "your Rescue Ranger Emergency Ambulance", instead of "your ambulance"). She and Louise have a crush on their classmate Roger Piazza who sometimes helps babysit Max in later episodes.[tpl]citation needed|date= October 2011[/tpl]

Grandma – Max and Ruby's grandmother. She likes to have fun and has an attic full of clothes and a treasure box that has a memory picture of herself and her husband (who has not made any appearances in the TV series) wearing some fancy clothes to a festival. She has gray fur, wears a blue dress and is frequently involved with her grandchildren. She loves her grandchildren equally but Max is often Grandma's confidant when she plans something special, since she knows Max can keep a secret. Even though Ruby believes that Grandma won't like Max's ideas she is always revealed to like both Max and Ruby's ideas equally, however she usually sides with Max when Max outsmarts Ruby and when Ruby assumes Grandma will love her ideas better than Max's. She once lived with their grandfather who went to an annual festival with her but since he has not appeared nor mentioned it is presumed that he has been deceased for a while. .[tpl]citation needed|date= December 2011[/tpl]
