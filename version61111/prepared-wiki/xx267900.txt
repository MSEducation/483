==History==

===2005–2010: As a Johnny's Jr===

In August 2005, two Johnny's Jr. units, Kis-My-Ft. and A.B.C.Jr., combined to form Kis-My-Ft2. The name came from the first letter of each of their family names: Hiromitsu Kitayama, Kyōhei Iida, Kento Senga, Toshiya Miyata, Wataru Yokō, Taisuke Fujigaya, Yūta Tamamori and Takashi Nikaidō ("ni" being the Japanese for the number two). They performed as an eight-member group until the end of March 2006 when Iida left Johnny's due to his studies, leaving Kis-My-Ft2 without its "I" (Kitayama's name would later fill this void).
In 2008, they held their first solo concerts (along with A.B.C-Z) at Yokohama Arena and Yoyogi Stadium and planned further ones for 2009.
In 2009, they got their own stage play for the first time, together with Uchi Hiroki and Yara Tomoyuki. They played the Playzone 2009, which until then had always been performed by Shōnentai.
In 2010 they once again held concerts, this time with the title Kis-My-Ftに010 逢えるdeShow. That year also marked their CM debut. They got to do CM for dwango.jp, where they also released two digital singles: "Fire Beat" and "Inori". In September they did a musical together with A.B.C-Z, Shōnen-tachi ~Kōshi Naki Rōgoku~. At the end of the year they once again held concerts, which lasted until early the next year.

===2011: Debut===

On February 12, 2011, during their concert they got a brown envelope to open during the MC. It announced that they were to have their debut in May under Avex. But due to the Touhoku earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan, the CD release got postponed until summer. 
During their concert on July 29 in Yokohama they got another brown envelope announcing that they would held their first concert in Tokyo Dome on August 28.

JUMP and Tackey & Tsubasa with Tokyo Dome concerts 38 days after their official debut.
