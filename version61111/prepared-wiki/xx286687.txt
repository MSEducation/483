==Route description==

The state route starts at the intersection of SR 60 near McConnelsville. SR 607 travels north for the majority of the length. Halfway through the route, SR 607 meets Township Road 696 in a T-intersection, where the route moves slightly westward. After that, there is an Ohio Army National Guard training site at Hawk Drive.[tpl]Google maps|url=https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Army+National+Guard,+Hawk+Drive,+McConnelsville,+OH&hl=en&ll=39.669708,-81.834004&spn=0.003262,0.006968&fb=1&gl=us&hq=Army+National+Guard,&hnear=0x884820441893abf9:0xbe29b8f33104c01f,Hawk+Dr,+McConnelsville,+OH+43756&cid=0,0,8882965442215858972&t=h&z=18&iwloc=A|title=Army National Guard, Hawk Drive, McConnelsville, OH|accessdate=August 13, 2013[/tpl] The route keeps moving north until it ends at SR 78 at another T-intersection.

==History==

===Planning===

Planning of Monastery Road (Township Road 209) improvements began in 2003.[tpl]cite news|last=Shawver|first=Sam|title=Morgan twp. road now a state route|url=http://www.mariettatimes.com/page/content.detail/id/553276/Morgan-twp--road-now-a-state-route.html?nav=5002|accessdate=August 13, 2013|newspaper=The Marietta Times|date=August 1, 2013[/tpl] At that time, $3.8 million in state funding was set aside for the project, but the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) did not receive the money until 2005. By 2007, most of the earmarked money was spent on preliminary engineering and planning. Without the money, Morgan Township officials could not afford to upgrade the road, and ODOT was barred from spending money on local roads. In 2011, deputy director Steve Williams devised a new plan that made the township road a state route, and Morgan Township officials were asked to give the road up.

===Realignment and reopening===

Monastery Road was closed in Spring 2012 for improvements and realignment, and was closed for 120 days.[tpl]cite web|title=Morgan Co.

On July 25, 2013, ODOT erected state route signs on the road. The next day, Williams announced the upgrade of Monastery Road to State Route 607 and reopened the road.
