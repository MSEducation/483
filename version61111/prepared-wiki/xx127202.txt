"Long Live Love" is a Chris Andrews composition which, in 1965, gained Sandie Shaw the second of her three UK number one hit singles.

==In the UK==

Shaw was sufficiently confident in the hit potential of the buoyant "Long Live Love" as to turn down the chance to record "It's Not Unusual", allowing the song to be given to Tom Jones and become his first hit. "Long Live Love" did spend three weeks at No 1 in the UK in June 1965, also giving Shaw a No 1 hit in both Ireland and New Zealand, with a No 2 peak attained in South Africa. A Top Ten hit in both the Netherlands (No 7) and Norway (No 8), "Long Live Love" was also a hit in Australia (No 12) and Belgium, reaching No 15 on the latter territory's Dutch language chart.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]

==International==

The original English-language version of "Long Live Love" was a substantial hit in Canada, peaking at No 6; and in Australia, where it hit No 12.  In the USA "Long Live Love" received enough regional attention to return Shaw to the Billboard Hot 100 for the third and last time, with a No 97 peak.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]
In France, Shaw reached No 5 with lyricist Georges Liferman's rendering of "Long Live Love" entitled "Pourvu Que Ça Dure"; at the same time the original "Long Live Love" reached No 32 on the French charts. Shaw also recorded "Long Live Love" for the market in Germany as "Du weißt nichts von deinem Glück"; both the German rendition and English original reached the German Top 30, respective peaks being No 25 ("Du weißt nichts...") and No 28 ("Long Live Love"). The German-language version charted higher in Austria (No 5). In 1966 Shaw made a belated Italian rendering of "Long Live Love" entitled "Viva l’amore con te". However the track was relegated to the B-side of "E ti avrò", a recording of the even older "Girl Don't Come", which reached No 11 in the Italian chart.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]
Also in 1966 Shaw rendered "Long Live Love" as "¡Viva el amor!" for an EP released in Spain which also featured renderings of Shaw's UK hits "Girl Don't Come", "Message Understood" and "Tomorrow".

==Also==

Besides Sandie Shaw's own non-English renderings of "Long Live Love", the song was recorded in 1965 as "Kiva, kiva rakkaus" by Marion Rung, "Leve kärleken"  by Lill-Babs and "Viva el amor" by Gelu.
In 1992 Nick Berry recorded "Long Live Love" to be the follow-up single to his hit version of the theme from the TV series Heartbeat; Berry's version of "Long Live Love", which was featured in the Heartbeat series, reached No 47 in the UK Singles Chart.
"Long Live Love"  has also been recorded by its composer Chris Andrews, as well as Jessica Andersson in 2009 [tpl]cite web|url=http://smdb.kb.se/catalog/id/002574687 |title=Wake up | Svensk mediedatabas |publisher=SMDB |date= |accessdate=2014-03-25[/tpl] and Tracey Ullman.
There is no connection between the Chris Andrews' composition and the same named song by Olivia Newton-John, which served as the 1974 Eurovision entry for the UK.
