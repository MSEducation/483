Antonín Švehla (15 April 1873 in Prague – 12 December 1933 in Prague) was a Czechoslovakian politician. He served three terms as the prime minister of Czechoslovakia. He is regarded as one of the most important political figures of the First Czechoslovak Republic; he was the leader of the Agrarian Party, which was dominant within the Pětka, which was largely his own invention. Švehla is also credited with the slogan of the Pětka: "We have agreed that we will agree."[tpl]cite web|last=Norsko|title=The ambassador's speech for the opening of the Antonín Švehla year|url=http://www.noramb.cz/Norsk/kultur/Samfunn-og-politikk/The-ambassadors-speech-for-the-opening-of-the-Antonin-vehla-year/#.UtZw4LT7RQY|accessdate=15 January 2014[/tpl]
