[[American Geophysical Union]]

CATEGORIES: Geophysics societies, Non-profit organizations based in Washington, D.C., Organizations established in 1919

The American Geophysical Union (AGU) is a nonprofit organization of geophysicists, consisting of over 62,000 members from 144 countries. AGU's activities are focused on the organization and dissemination of scientific information in the interdisciplinary and international field of geophysics. The geophysical sciences involve four fundamental areas: atmospheric and ocean sciences; solid-Earth sciences; hydrologic sciences; and space sciences.

==History==

The AGU was established in December 1919 by the National Research Council (NRC) to represent the United States in the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG), and its first chairman was William Bowie of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey (USCGS).[tpl]cite journal|last=Bauer|first=Louis A.|title=The organization and aims of the American Geophysical Union|journal=Bulletin of the National Research Council|date=January 1924|volume=7|issue=41|pages=7–18|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=GHQ-AQAAIAAJ&pg=RA1-PA10&lpg=RA1-PA10&dq=mareology+-horse&source=bl&ots=t67XseZ6sd&sig=XHOTHRXwExfv1x6gJr-OhM9SQq0&hl=en&sa=X&ei=z-WPUoijOdTVoATcxoGgDQ&ved=0CGAQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=mareology%20-horse&f=false|accessdate=22 November 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Cochrane|first=Rexmond C.|title=The National Academy of Sciences: The First Hundred Years, 1863-1963|year=1978|publisher=National Academies|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=WyErAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA328&lpg=PA328&dq=Origin+and+development+of+the+American+Geophysical+Union,+1919-1952&source=bl&ots=Q6TFnspTdv&sig=aOJtL4DgnIYN5k9F7uIJcSNR4tI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=3bqPUsfrEsGYiQKLv4BA&ved=0CEAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22American%20Geophysical%20Union%22&f=false |accessdate=25 November 2013[/tpl][tpl]rp|267[/tpl] For more than 50 years it operated as an unincorporated affiliate of the National Academy of Sciences. In 1972 AGU was incorporated in the District of Columbia and membership was opened to scientists and students worldwide.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.agu.org/about/history/|title=AGU History|work=American Geophysical Union|accessdate=July 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110606073614/http://www.agu.org/about/history/| archivedate= 6 June 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]cite encyclopedia |first=Ronald E. |last=Doel |title=American Geophysical Union |editor-last=Rothenberg |editor-first=Marc |year=2012 |encyclopedia=History of Science in the United States |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781135583187[/tpl] 
The AGU was intended to promote "pure" geophysics; exploration geophysics has its own society, the Society of Exploration Geophysicists. In a March 1919 report by a committee chaired by Robert S. Woodward of the Carnegie Institution, geophysics was defined as a collection of "borderlands" (closely related, mutually dependent subjects): astronomy, geodesy, geology, meteorology,  mareology (oceanography), seismology, terrestrial magnetism, terrestrial electricity, tides, and volcanology. The AGU was organized under seven sections: Geodesy, Seismology, Meteorology, Terrestrial magnetism and electricity, Oceanography, Volcanology, and Geophysical chemistry. Hydrology was added in 1930 and Tectonophysics in 1940. In suggesting the latter name, Norman Bowen evoked a familiar theme: to "designate this new borderline field between geophysics, physics and geology ... for the solution of problems of tectonics."
The first meeting of the AGU took place on April 23, 1920. In attendance were 25 members. Up to 1930, the number of members was restricted and members were elected. In 1932 the first annual dues [tpl]USD|2[/tpl] were imposed. The membership grew to 4600 in 1950; 13,000 in 1980; and 26,000 in 1990. As of 2013, it had 62,000 members from 144 countries.[tpl]cite news|last=Brennan|first=Charlie|title=Boulder scientists draw top honors from American Geophysical Union|url=http://www.dailycamera.com/science_environment/ci_23775527/boulder-scientists-draw-top-honors-from-american-geophysical|accessdate=22 November 2013|newspaper=Daily Camera|date=1 August 2013[/tpl]

==Publications==

AGU publishes the weekly Eos newspaper and nineteen peer-reviewed scientific journals:[tpl]cite web|url=http://publications.agu.org/journals/|title=Journals|work=Publications |publisher=American Geophysical Union|accessdate=25 November 2013[/tpl]
In addition, International Journal of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy is no longer published and AGU distributes Chinese Journal of Geophysics and Nonlinear Processes in Geophysics. Many of the journals have high impact factors, with Paleoceanography having the highest within paleontology and Reviews of Geophysics the second highest within geochemistry and geophysics as of 2010.[tpl]cite web|url=http://thomsonreuters.com/products_services/science/science_products/a-z/journal_citation_reports/|title=Journal Citation Reports|work=Thompson Reuters|accessdate=July 2011[/tpl] AGU has also been publishing books for more than 85 years.[tpl]cite web|title=geopress books|url=http://www.agu.org/pubs/books/|accessdate=29 May 2012[/tpl] It maintains a digital book library with 16 book series and over 550 book titles.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.agu.org/pubs/dlibrary/ |title=Digital library |accessdate=29 May 2012[/tpl]
AGU published its first electronic journal, Earth Interactions, in 1997 with the American Meteorological Society (AMS) and Association of American Geographers (AAG) as partners. It started its own electronic journal, Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems, in December 1999.[tpl]cite journal|last=Holoviak|first=Judy C.|title=Scientific e-Journals|journal=Geotimes|date=January 2001|url=http://www.geotimes.org/jan01/ejournals.html|accessdate=25 November 2013[/tpl] It made a full transition to electronic publishing in 2001. For all its journals, the electronic version became the publication of record. This was accompanied by a new identification scheme for articles that entirely did away with sequential page numbers. Instead, each article had a digital object identifier (DOI). As an example, 10.1029/2001GL014304 consists of the publisher identifier (AGU), the year (2001), the journal code (GL), and an article number (014304). This new system was met with complaints from libraries and scientists. The article numbers provided no clue for libraries to find an article in printed versions, and even scientific databases were not set up to handle DOIs. AGU officials claimed that the problems were a temporary cost of being a frontrunner, but did retroactively assign each article a four-digit article number.[tpl]cite journal|last=Renner|first=Rebecca|title=Online pioneer ends up lost in cyberspace|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/297/5586/1468.full.pdf?sid=78566c1b-cb35-470c-a873-ae6286151390|accessdate=24 November 2013|journal=Science|volume=297|pages=1468–1469 |date=39 August 2002[/tpl] 
In 2012 the journals and books, including over one and a half million pages of legacy content, were transferred to the Wiley Online Library. John Wiley & Sons were recognized for this work with the IT Project Team of the Year Award at the UK IT Industry Awards for 2013.[tpl]cite press release |last= |first= |date=18 July 2012 |title=American Geophysical Union and Wiley-Blackwell Announce Publishing Partnership |url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/PressRelease/pressReleaseId-104185.html |location= |publisher= Wiley |accessdate=2013-11-23[/tpl][tpl]cite press release |last= |first= |date=21 November 2013 |title=Wiley Wins IT Project Team of the Year at the UK IT Industry Awards 2013 |url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/PressRelease/pressReleaseId-109885.html |location= |publisher= Wiley |accessdate=2013-11-23[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Anonymous|title=AGU on the move|journal=Eos, Transactions American Geophysical Union|year=1994|volume=75|issue=24|pages=265|doi=10.1029/94EO00939[/tpl]

== Texaco copyright case == 
See ''American Geophysical Union v. Texaco'' 
AGU publications are copyrighted, but in the United States many exceptions to the exclusive rights of copyright are allowed under the fair use provision, part of the Copyright Act of 1976. Making copies of publications are allowed for such uses as teaching and research as long as a set of four criteria are met. However, when Texaco's corporate library made systematic copies of journal articles for its collection, AGU and five other publishers took Texaco to court. The judges found for AGU. Texaco was fined and agreed to retroactively purchase a license from the Copyright Clearance Center.[tpl]cite court |litigants=American Geophysical Union v.

==Executive==

===Presidents===

The presidents of the AGU have been:[tpl]cite web|title=AGU celebrates 80 years of leadership (1919–1999)|url=http://www.agu.org/about/pdf/AGU-80-Years-of-Leadership.pdf|publisher=American Geophysical Union|accessdate=22 November 2013[/tpl]

===Executive directors===

While 41 Presidents have provided scientific leadership for the AGU since 1919, operational leadership has been provided by a total of just four individuals. The first was John Adam Fleming, who was elected Secretary in 1925 and changed the name of his position to General Secretary. He served as a volunteer while working at the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism at the Carnegie Institution. By 1943, with the membership nearing 2,000, AGU recognized the need for a full-time professional administrator. The post was renamed Executive Secretary and Waldo E. Smith was hired. He served until 1970 and then Athelstan Spilhaus, Jr. was hired as Executive Director.[tpl]cite journal|last=Newell|first=H. E.|title=Waldo E. Smith: A quarter century of service|journal=History of geophysics|year=1984|volume=1|page=144|doi=10.1029/HG001p0144|url=http://www.agu.org/books/hg/v001/HG001p0144/HG001p0144.shtml|accessdate=23 November 2013[/tpl] Christine McEntee replaced him in 2010. Medals have been named after Fleming and Smith.

==Recognition==

===Medals===

The AGU offers several medals and awards.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.agu.org/awards/|title=Union Medals & Awards|work=American Geophysical Union|accessdate=July 2011[/tpl] Its highest honor is the William Bowie Medal, and its namesake was the first recipient in 1939. It is awarded at most annually for "outstanding contributions to fundamental geophysics and for unselfish cooperation in research". Other medals include:[tpl]cite web|title=Medals|url=http://honors.agu.org/awards-medals-prizes/award-search/?is_search=1&award_name=&award_keyword=&award_type=medals&x=54&y=20|work=Honors program|publisher=American Geophysical Union|accessdate=26 November 2013[/tpl] 

===Awards===

===Fellowships===

AGU nominates members for fellowship in the society.  According to the AGU website "To be elected a Fellow of AGU is a special tribute for those who have made exceptional scientific contributions. Nominated Fellows must have attained acknowledged eminence in the Earth and space sciences. This designation is conferred upon not more than 0.1% of all AGU members in any given year. New Fellows are chosen by a Committee of Fellows."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.agu.org/fellows/|title=AGU Fellows|work=American Geophysical Union|accessdate=July 2011[/tpl]

==Sections and focus groups==

The AGU is divided into 11 sections that provide the main structure for managing volunteers, developing leaders and honoring scientists. These sections also reflect the breadth of science within geophysics: atmospheric sciences; biogeosciences; geodesy; geomagnetism and paleomagnetism; hydrology; ocean sciences; planetary sciences; seismology; space physics, aeronomy, and heliophysics; tectonophysics; volcanology, geochemistry, and petrology.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.agu.org/about/governance/section_fg/|title=Sections and Focus Groups|work=American Geophysical Union|accessdate=July 2011[/tpl]
There are also 12 focus groups that organize research involving two or more sections. These are atmospheric and space electricity; cryosphere sciences; Earth and planetary surface processes; Earth and space science informatics; mineral and rock physics; global environmental change; natural hazards; near surface geophysics; nonlinear geophysics; paleoceanography and paleoclimatology; study of the Earth's deep interior; and societal impacts and policy sciences.

==Meetings==

AGU holds annual meetings in San Francisco every December (known as the Fall meeting) and every Spring (April through May) in locations around the world. The latter grew out of AGU's annual Spring meeting, which had been held for many years in Baltimore, until declining interest caused AGU to move the meeting to different locations, starting with Boston in 1998. With the 2003 meeting in Nice, France, it became known as the Joint Assembly because AGU co-sponsors it with other societies such as the Geochemical Society, the Mineralogical Society of America (MSA), the Canadian Geophysical Union (CGU), and the European Geosciences Union (EGU). The Fall Meeting had more than 20,000 attendees in 2012.[tpl]cite web|title=AGU Fall Meeting, San Francisco, 3-7 December 2012|url=http://fallmeeting.agu.org/2012/|publisher=American Geophysical Union |accessdate=August 8, 2013[/tpl] 
In addition to the two meetings that cover all areas of the geophysical sciences, AGU sponsors many specialized meetings that are intended to serve the needs of particular scientific disciplines or geographical areas, including the Ocean Sciences Meetings and Western Pacific Geophysical Meetings which are held in even numbered years. Small, highly focused meetings are offered through the Chapman Conferences.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.agu.org/meetings/|title=AGU Meetings|work=American Geophysical Union|accessdate=July 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110708110633/http://www.agu.org/meetings/| archivedate= 8 July 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
The large numbers and international participation in the Fall Meeting results in a large contribution to greenhouse gases. The 9500 participants in the 2002 meeting traveled an average of [tpl]Convert|8,000|km|mi[/tpl] to attend, producing 1.3 metric tons of carbon dioxide, or one-sixteenth of the average yearly emissions for Americans. The AGU has made some adjustments such as asking shuttle bus drivers to turn off their engines when they are not moving, but 95% of the emissions come from jet fuel. In an unpublished study, David Scott and Lawrence Plug of Dalhousie University estimated that the AGU could reduce emissions by 7.7% if it moved the Fall Meeting to Denver, Colorado.[tpl]cite journal|last=Mason|first=Betsy|title=Scientists contribute to greenhouse-gas emissions|journal=Nature News|date=11 December 2003|doi=10.1038/news031208-13|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2003/031211/full/news031208-13.html|accessdate=24 November 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Lester|first=B.|title=Greening the Meeting|journal=Science|date=5 October 2007|volume=318|issue=5847|pages=36–38|doi=10.1126/science.318.5847.36[/tpl]

==Science and policy==

On occasion the AGU Council issues position statements on matters affecting public policy that are related to geophysics. These include biological evolution, natural hazards, science education and funding, and climate change.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sciencepolicy.agu.org/agu-position-statements-and-letters/|title=AGU Position Statements and Letters |work=Science policy |publisher=American Geophysical Union|accessdate=23 November 2013[/tpl] The AGU issued a position statement on climate change  in December 2003, and revised and reaffirmed the statement in 2012.  The revised statement begins:
 [tpl]Quote|text=The Earth's climate is now clearly out of balance and is warming. Many components of the climate system&mdash;including the temperatures of the atmosphere, land and ocean, the extent of sea ice and mountain glaciers, the sea level, the distribution of precipitation, and the length of seasons&mdash;are now changing at rates and in patterns that are not natural and are best explained by the increased atmospheric abundances of greenhouse gases and aerosols generated by human activity during the 20th century.|sign=AGU Council|source=Human Impacts on Climate<ref>[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.agu.org/sci_pol/positions/climate_change2008.shtml|title=AGU Position Statement – Human Impacts on Climate|work=American Geophysical Union|accessdate=September 2011[/tpl]</ref>[/tpl]
In 2011, AGU created a Task Force on Scientific Ethics, " to review and update existing policies and procedures for dealing with scientific misconduct."[tpl]cite web|last=McPhaden|first=Mike|title=We must remain committed to scientific integrity|url=http://about.agu.org/president/presidents-message-archive/remain-committed-scientific-integrity/|work=President's message archive|publisher=American Geophysical Union|accessdate=25 November 2013[/tpl] This effort received a setback when its chairman, Peter Gleick, announced that he had lied to obtain internal documents from the Heartland Institute and then leaked them to the public.[tpl]cite news|last=Joyce|first=Christopher|title=Climate Scientist Admits To Lying, Leaking Documents|url=http://www.npr.org/2012/02/22/147263862/climate-scientist-admits-to-lying-leaking-documents|accessdate=25 November 2013|newspaper=npr|date=22 February 2012[/tpl] Gleick, a climate scientist and recipient of the MacArthur Fellowship, said he was motivated by frustration with the efforts of groups such as the Heartland Institute to attack climate science and scientist, but admitted that it was a serious lapse of judgement.[tpl]cite news|last=Gleick|first=P. H.|title=The Origin of the Heartland Documents|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/peter-h-gleick/-the-origin-of-the-heartl_b_1289669.html|accessdate=25 November 2013|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=20 February 2012[/tpl] He resigned from the task force on February 16, 2012, and was replaced by Linda Gundersen, director of the Office of Science Quality and Integrity at the United States Geological Survey (USGS).
Members of the AGU who work in politically-controversial fields have come under legal attack. For example, Michael Mann, a Fellow of the AGU and lead author of the original "hockey stick graph" study, faced a legal demand to turn over his private emails from Kenneth Cuccinelli II, at the time the attorney general of the state of Virginia, a conservative Republican who argues that there is no persuasive evidence that human activity is warming the planet. The court rejected Cuccinelli's demand.[tpl]cite news|last=Kaufman|first=Leslie|title=Virginia Court Rejects Climate Skeptic’s Demand for Records|accessdate=25 November 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 2, 2012  |url=http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/02/virginia-court-rejects-climate-skeptics-demand-for-records/?_r=0 |accessdate=25 November 2013[/tpl] However, such legal challenges continue, so in 2012 AGU entered in a partnership with the Climate Science Legal Defense Fund to offer legal counseling at the Fall Meeting.[tpl]cite news|last=Konkel|first=Lindsey|title=Climate science lawyers up|url=http://wwwp.dailyclimate.org/tdc-newsroom/2013/11/climate-science-lawyers-up|accessdate=25 November 2013|date=Nov 21, 2013[/tpl]
