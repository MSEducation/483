==Playoff seeds==

After the 1998-99 AHL regular season, 16 teams qualified for the playoffs. The top four teams from each division qualified for the playoffs. However, due to the uneven number of teams in the Western Conference, it was possible for the fifth-placed team in the Empire Division to crossover to the Mid-Atlantic Division. This could only happen if the fifth-placed team in the Empire Division earned more points than the fourth-placed team in the Mid-Atlantic Division. In this case, the fifth-placed team from the Empire Division would play in place of the fourth-placed team from the Mid-Atlantic Division in that part of the playoff bracket. The Providence Bruins were the Eastern Conference regular season champions as well as the Macgregor Kilpatrick Trophy winners with the best overall regular season record. The Rochester Americans were the Western Conference regular season champions.1998-99 AHL Standings The Internet Hockey Database. Retrieved on April 29, 2008.

In each round the team that earned more points during the regular season receives home ice advantage, meaning they receive the "extra" game on home-ice if the series reaches the maximum number of games. There is no set series format due to arena scheduling conflicts and travel considerations.Frequently asked questions theahl.com. Retrieved on May 12, 2008.
