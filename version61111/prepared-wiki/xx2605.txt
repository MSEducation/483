Under sharia law, dhimmi status was originally applied to Jews, Christians, and Sabians.

As an example of the distinctions between Muslims, dhimmis, and others, sharia law permits the consumption of pork and alcohol by non-Muslims living in Islamic countries, although they may not be openly displayed.Al-Misri, Reliance of the Traveler (edited and translated by Nuh Ha Mim Keller), p. 608.

==The "dhimma contract"==

Based on Quranic verses and Islamic traditions, classical sharia distinguishes between Muslims, followers of other Abrahamic religions, and pagans or people belonging to other polytheistic religions. As monotheists, Jews and Christians have traditionally been considered "People of the Book," and afforded a special status known as dhimmi derived from a theoretical contract - "dhimma" or "residence in return for taxes". There are parallels for this in Roman and Jewish law.Glenn, H. Patrick (2007). Legal Traditions of the World – Sustainable Diversity in Law (3rd edition). New York City; Oxford: Oxford University Press. ISBN 978-0-19-920541-7. pp. 217–219. Muslim governments in the Indus basin readily extended the dhimmi status to the Hindus and Buddhists of India.Marshall Hodgson, The Venture of Islam Conscience and History in a World Civilization Vol 2. University of Chicago, 1958, p. 278. Eventually, the largest school of Islamic scholarship applied this term to all non-Muslims living in Islamic lands outside the sacred area surrounding Mecca, Saudi Arabia.al-Misri, Ahmad ibn Naqib (edited and translated from Arabic (with commentary) by Nuh Ha Mim Keller) (1994 revised edition), p. 603.
Classical sharia incorporated the religious laws and courts of Christians, Jews and Hindus, as seen in the early caliphate, Al-Andalus, Indian subcontinent, and the Ottoman Millet system.[tpl]Harvnb|Weeramantry|1997|p=138[/tpl][tpl]Cite book|title=The Islamic Roots of Democratic Pluralism| author = Sachedina, Abdulaziz Abdulhussein |year=2001|publisher= Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-513991-7|ref=harv|postscript=.[/tpl] In medieval Islamic societies, the qadi (Islamic judges) usually could not interfere in the matters of non-Muslims unless the parties voluntarily chose to be judged according to Islamic law, thus the dhimmi communities living in Islamic states usually had their own laws independent from the sharia law, such as the Jews who would have their own Halakha courts.[tpl]Cite book|title=Under Crescent and Cross: The Jews in the Middle Ages|author= Cohen, Mark R. |publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1995|isbn=0-691-01082-X |page=74 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=fgbib5exskUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=cohen+Under+Crescent+and+Cross&q|accessdate=April 10, 2010 |ref=harv|postscript=.[/tpl] These courts did not cover cases that involved other religious groups, or capital offences or threats to public order. By the 18th century, however, dhimmis frequently attended the Ottoman Muslim courts, where cases were taken against them by Muslims, or they took cases against Muslims or other dhimmis. Oaths sworn by dhimmis in these courts were tailored to their beliefs.[tpl]Cite journal | author = al-Qattan, Najwa | title= Dhimmis in the Muslim Court: Legal Autonomy and Religious Discrimination | journal= International Journal of Middle East Studies | volume=31 | issue=3 | pages=429–444 | publisher= University of Cambridge |year=1999 | postscript=. | issn=00207438 | doi=10.1017/S0020743800055501 | ref=harv[/tpl]
Non-Muslims were allowed to engage in certain practices (such as the consumption of alcohol and pork) that were usually forbidden by Islamic law. Zoroastrian "self-marriages", that were considered incestuous under sharia, were also tolerated. Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya (1292–1350) opined that non-Muslims were entitled to such practices since they could not be presented to sharia courts and the religious minorities in question held it permissible. This ruling was based on the precedent that the Islamic prophet, Muhammad did not forbid such self-marriages among Zoroastrians despite coming into contact with Zoroastrians and knowing about this practice.Jackson, Sherman A. (2005). p. 144 (via Google Books). Retrieved September 19, 2011. Religious minorities were also free to do whatever they wished in their own homes, provided they did not publicly engage in illicit sexual activity in ways that could threaten public morals.Jackson, Sherman A. (2005). p. 145 (via Google Books). Retrieved September 19, 2011.
However, the classical dhimma contract is no longer enforced. Western influence has been instrumental in eliminating the restrictions and protections of the dhimma contract, thereby contributing to the current state of relations between Muslims and non-Muslims living in Islamic lands.[tpl]cite book|last= Lewis|first=Bernard|title=The Jews of Islam|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=W0EbKFRxrT4C|year=1984|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-00807-3 | page= 184[/tpl]
According to law professor H. Patrick Glenn of McGill University, "today it is said that the dhimmi are 'excluded from the specifically Muslim privileges, but on the other hand they are excluded from the specifically Muslim duties' while (and here there are clear parallels with western public and private law treatment of aliens – Fremdenrecht, la condition de estrangers), 'for the rest, the Muslim and the dhimmi are equal in practically the whole of the law of property and of contracts and obligations'."Glenn, H.

===The dhimma contract and sharia law===

The dhimma contract is an integral part of traditional Islamic sharia law. From the 9th century AD, the power to interpret and refine law in traditional Islamic societies was in the hands of the scholars (ulama). This separation of powers served to limit the range of actions available to the ruler, who could not easily decree or reinterpret law independently and expect the continued support of the community.Basim Musallam, The Cambridge Illustrated History of the Islamic World edited by Francis Robinson. Cambridge University Press, 1996, p. 176. Through succeeding centuries and empires, the balance between the ulema and the rulers shifted and reformed, but the balance of power was never decisively changed.Hodgson, The Venture of Islam Vol 3, 1961, pp. 105–108. At the beginning of the 19th century, the Industrial Revolution and the French Revolution introduced an era of European world hegemony that included the domination of most of the lands of Islam.Hodgson, The Venture of Islam Vol 3, 1961, pp. 176–177.Sarah Ansari, The Cambridge Illustrated History of the Islamic World edited by Francis Robinson. Cambridge University Press, 1996, p. 90. At the end of the Second World War, the European powers found themselves too weakened to maintain their empires.Hodgson, The Venture of Islam Vol 3, 1961, pp. 366–367. The wide variety of forms of government, systems of law, attitudes toward modernity and interpretations of sharia are a result of the ensuing drives for independence and modernity in the Muslim world.Sarah Ansari, The Cambridge Illustrated History of the Islamic World edited by Francis Robinson. Cambridge University Press, 1996, pp. 103–111.Marshall Hodgson, The Venture of Islam Conscience and History in a World Civilization Vol 3. The University of Chicago, 1961, pp. 384–386.
Muslim states, sects, schools of thought and individuals differ as to exactly what sharia law entails.Otto, Jan Michiel. Sharia and National Law in Muslim Countries: Tensions and Opportunities for Dutch and EU Foreign Policy . Amsterdam University Press, 2008, p. 7. In addition, Muslim states today utilize a spectrum of legal systems. Most states have a mixed system implementing certain aspects of sharia while acknowledging constitutional supremacy. A few, such as Turkey, have declared themselves secular.Otto, Sharia and National Law in Muslim Countries, 2008, pp. 8–9. Local and customary laws may take precedence in certain matters, as well.Otto, Sharia and National Law in Muslim Countries, 2008, p. 29. Islamic law is therefore polynormative,Otto, Sharia and National Law in Muslim Countries, 2008, p. 10. and despite several cases of regression in recent years, the trend is towards modernization and liberalization.Otto, Sharia and National Law in Muslim Countries, 2008, p. 18. Questions of human rights and the status of minorities cannot be generalized with regards to the Muslim world. They must instead be examined on a case-by-case basis, within specific political and cultural contexts, using perspectives drawn from the historical framework.Otto, Sharia and National Law in Muslim Countries, 2008, pp. 37–39.

===The end of the dhimma contract===

The status of the dhimmi "was for long accepted with resignation by the Christians and with gratitude by the Jews" but the rising power of Christendom and the radical ideas of the French Revolution caused a wave of discontent among Christian dhimmis.[tpl]cite book|last= Lewis|first=Bernard|title=The Jews of Islam |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=W0EbKFRxrT4C|year=1984|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-00807-3[/tpl] p. 62 The continuing and growing pressure from the European powers combined with pressure from Muslim reformers gradually relaxed the inequalities between Muslims and non-Muslims.[tpl]cite book|last= Lewis|first=Bernard|title=The Jews of Islam|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=W0EbKFRxrT4C|year=1984|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-00807-3[/tpl] summary of pp. 62–66. See p. 62 (second paragraph), p. 65 (third paragraph)
The collection of the jizya tax from non-Muslims was widespread throughout the history of Islam. In the mid-19th century, the Ottoman Empire significantly relaxed the restrictions and taxes placed on its non-Muslim residents under Ottomanism. These relaxations occurred gradually as part of the Tanzimat reform movement, which began in 1839 with the accession of the Ottoman Sultan, Abdülmecid I.
On November 3, 1839, the Edict of Gülhane (Hatt-i Sharif of Gulhane) edict was put forth by the Sultan, in part proclaiming the principle of equality among all subjects regardless of religion. Part of the motivation for this was a desire to gain support from the British Empire, whose help was needed in a conflict with Egypt.
On February 18, 1856, the Ottoman Reform Edict of 1856 (Hatt-i Humayan) was issued, building upon the 1839 edict. It came about partly as a result of pressure from and the efforts of the ambassadors of Great Britain, France, and Austria, whose respective countries were needed as allies in the Crimean War. It again proclaimed the principle of equality between Muslims and non-Muslims, and produced many specific reforms to this end. For example, the jizya tax was abolished and non-Muslims were allowed to join the army.Lapidus (1988), p. 599Lapidus (2002), p. 495

===Views of contemporary Islamic scholars on the status of dhimmis in an Islamic society===

==Dhimmi communities==

Jews and Christians living under early Muslim rule were considered dhimmis, a status that was later also extended to other non-Muslims like Hindus. They were allowed to "practise their religion, subject to certain conditions, and to enjoy a measure of communal autonomy" and guaranteed their personal safety and security of property, in return for paying tribute and acknowledging Muslim rule.Lewis (1984), pp. 10, 20. Islamic law and custom prohibited the enslavement of free dhimmis within lands under Islamic rule.Lewis (2002), p.92 Taxation from the perspective of dhimmis who came under the Muslim rule, was "a concrete continuation of the taxes paid to earlier regimes"Cl. Cahen in Encyclopedia of Islam, Jizya article (but lower under the Muslim ruleLewis 1984 p.18). They were also exempted from the zakat tax paid by Muslims. The dhimmi communities living in Islamic states had their own laws independent from the Sharia law, such as the Jews who had their own Halakha courts.[tpl]Cite book|title=Under Crescent and Cross: The Jews in the Middle Ages|author=Mark R. Cohen|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1995|isbn=0-691-01082-X|page=74|url=http://books.google.com/?id=fgbib5exskUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=cohen+Under+Crescent+and+Cross&q|accessdate=2010-04-10|postscript=[/tpl]
The dhimmi communities had their own chiefs and judges, with their own family, personal and religious laws,Lewis (1984), p. 27 and "generally speaking, Muslim tolerance of unbelievers was far better than anything available in Christendom, until the rise of secularism in the 17th century".Bernard Lewis and Buntzie Ellis Churchill, Islam: The Religion and the People, Wharton School Publishing, 2008, p. 146. "Muslims guaranteed freedom of worship and livelihood, provided that they remained loyal to the Muslim state and paid a poll tax". "Muslim governments appointed Christian and Jewish professionals to their bureaucracies", and thus, Christians and Jews "contributed to the making of the Islamic civilization".
However, dhimmis faced social and symbolic restrictions,Lewis (1984), p. 26 and a pattern of stricter, then more lax, enforcement developed over time.Lewis (1984) pp. 49–51. Marshall Hodgson, a historian of Islam, writes that during the era of the High Caliphate (7th–13th Centuries), zealous Shariah-minded Muslims gladly elaborated their code of symbolic restrictions on the dhimmis.[tpl]Cite book|title=The Venture of Islam: The classical age of Islam|author=Marshall G.S. Hodgson|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1977|isbn=0226346838|page=448|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=18b-K9AMLlwC&printsec=frontcover|accessdate=2012-07-07|postscript=[/tpl]
From an Islamic legal perspective, the pledge of protection granted dhimmis the freedom to practice their religion and spared them forced conversions. The dhimmis also served a variety of useful purposes, mostly economic, which was another point of concern to jurists.Lewis (1984) Religious minorities were free to do whatever they wished in their own homes, but could not "publically engage in illicit sex in ways that threaten public morals".[tpl]Cite book|title=Islam and the Blackamerican: looking toward the third resurrection|author=Sherman A. Jackson|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=0-19-518081-X|page=145|url=http://books.google.com/?id=nprKYM8sleYC&pg=PA144&dq=ankiha+fasida#v=onepage&q|accessdate=2010-04-10|postscript=[/tpl] In some cases, religious practices that Muslims found repugnant were allowed. One example was the Zoroastrian practice of incestuous "self-marriage" where a man could marry his mother, sister or daughter. According to the famous Islamic legal scholar Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya (1292–1350), non-Muslims had the right to engage in such religious practices even if it offended Muslims, under the conditions that such cases not be presented to Islamic Sharia courts and that these religious minorities believed that the practice in question is permissible according to their religion. This ruling was based on the precedent that Muhammad did not forbid such self-marriages among Zoroastrians despite coming in contact with them and having knowledge of their practices.[tpl]Cite book|title=Islam and the Blackamerican: looking toward the third resurrection|author=Sherman A. Jackson|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=0-19-518081-X|page=144|url=http://books.google.com/?id=nprKYM8sleYC&pg=PA144&dq=ankiha+fasida#v=onepage&q|accessdate=2010-04-10|postscript=[/tpl]
The Arabs generally established garrisons outside towns in the conquered territories, and had little interaction with the local dhimmi populations for purposes other than the collection of taxes. The conquered Christian, Jewish, Mazdean and Buddhist communities were otherwise left to lead their lives as before.Hodgson, The Venture of Islam Vol 1, 1958, pp. 227–229.

===Christians===

The Arab conquerors included Christian as well as Muslim tribes. The Christian Arabs were regarded as fellow Arabs rather than dhimmis.
Local Christians in Syria, Iraq, and Egypt were non-Chalcedonians and many may have felt better off under early Muslim rule than under that of the orthodox Greeks of Constantinople.Lewis (1984), pp. 17–18; Stillman (1979), p. 27.
In 1095, Pope Urban II urged western European Christians to come to the aid of the Christians of Palestine. The subsequent Crusades brought Roman Catholic Christians into contact with Orthodox Christians whose beliefs they discovered to differ from their own perhaps more than they had realised, and whose position under the rule of the Muslim Fatimid Caliphate was less uncomfortable than had been supposed. Consequently, the Eastern Christians provided perhaps less support to the Crusaders than had been expected.Courbage and Fargues (1995), pp. 44–46. When the Arab East came under Ottoman rule in the 16th century, Christian populations and fortunes rebounded significantly. The Ottomans had long experience dealing with Christian and Jewish minorities, and were more tolerant towards religious minorities than the former Muslim rulers, the Mamluks of Egypt.Courbage and Fargues (1995), pp. 57–58. By the 19th century, European pressure on the Ottomans had forced them to remove all dhimma restrictions on their religious minorities.

===Jews===

Accustomed to survival in adverse circumstances after many centuries of discrimination and persecution within the Roman Empire, both pre-Christian and Christian, Jews saw the Islamic conquests as just another change of rulers.
María Rosa Menocal, argues that the Jewish dhimmis living under the caliphate, while allowed fewer rights than Muslims, were still better off than in the Christian parts of Europe. Jews from other parts of Europe made their way to al-Andalus, where in parallel to Christian sects regarded as heretical by Catholic Europe, they were not just tolerated, but where opportunities to practise faith and trade were open without restriction save for the prohibitions on proselytisation.The Ornament of the World by María Rosa Menocal
Bernard Lewis states:
Professor of Jewish medieval history at Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Hayim Hillel Ben-Sasson, notes:
[tpl]Quote|The legal and security situation of the Jews in the Muslim world was generally better than in Christendom, because in the former, Jews were not the sole "infidels", because in comparison to the Christians, Jews were less dangerous and more loyal to the Muslim regime, and because the rapidity and the territorial scope of the Muslim conquests imposed upon them a reduction in persecution and a granting of better possibility for the survival of members of other faiths in their lands.[tpl]cite book |title=On Jewish History in the Middle Ages|last=Ben-Sasson |first=Haim Hillel |year=1969 |location=Tel Aviv |page=36[/tpl] Quoted in Mark R.

Comparing the treatment of Jews in the medieval Islamic world and medieval Christian Europe, Mark R. Cohen notes that, in contrast to Jews in Christian Europe, the "Jews in Islam were well integrated into the economic life of the larger society",[tpl]Cite book| first=Mark | last=Cohen | title=Under Crescent and Cross: The Jews in the Middle Ages| publisher=Princeton University Press| year=1995| isbn=0-691-01082-X[/tpl] and that they were allowed to practice their religion more freely than they could do in Christian Europe.
According to the scholar Mordechai Zaken, tribal chieftains (also known as aghas) in tribal Muslim societies such as the Kurdish society in Kurdistan would tax their Jewish subjects. The Jews were in fact civilians protected by their chieftains in and around their communities; in return they paid part of their harvest as dues, and contributed their skills and services to their patron chieftain.Mordechai Zaken,"Jewish Subjects and their tribal chieftains in Kurdistan: A Study in Survival", Brill: Leiden and Boston, 2007.

===Hindus and Buddhists===

By the 10th century, the Turks of Central Asia had brought Islam to the mountains north of the Indic plains.Hodgson, The Venture of Islam Vol 2, 1961, p. 275. It was not long before they swept south across the Punjab. The Indus basin held a substantial Buddhist population in addition to the ruling Hindu castes, and most converted to Islam over the next two centuries.[tpl]citation needed|date = October 2012[/tpl] At the end of the 12th century, the Muslims advanced quickly into the Ganges Plain.Hodgson, The Venture of Islam Vol 2, 1961, p. 276. In one decade, a Muslim army led by Turkic slaves consolidated resistance around Lahore and brought northern India, as far as Bengal, under Muslim rule.Hodgson, The Venture of Islam Vol 2, 1961, p. 278. From these Turkic slaves would come sultans, including the founder of the sultanate of Delhi. Muslims and dhimmis alike participated in urbanization and urban prosperity.Hodgson, The Venture of Islam Vol 2, 1961, p. 279.
By the 15th century, Islamic and Hindu civilization had evolved in a complementary manner, with the Muslims taking the role of a ruling caste in Hindu society. Nevertheless, the Muslims retained their Islamic identities, and were in some ways regarded by Hindus in much the same light as their own lowest castes.Hodgson, The Venture of Islam Vol 2, 1961, pp. 555–556.
In the 16th century, India came under the influence of the Mughals (Mongols). Babur, a ruler of the Mongol Timuri empire, established a foothold in the north which paved the way for further expansion by his successors.MHodgson, The Venture of Islam Vol 3, 1961, pp. 24–25. Until it was eclipsed by European hegemony in the 18th century, the Timuri Moghul emperors oversaw a period of coexistence and tolerance between Hindus and Muslims. The emperor Akbar has been described as a universalist. He sought to establish tolerance and equality between all communities and religions, and instituted far reaching social and religious reforms.Hodgson, The Venture of Islam Vol 3, 1961, pp. 65–67. Not all the Mughal emperors endorsed the ideals espoused by Akbar, indeed Aurangzeb was inclined towards a more fundamentalist approach.Hodgson, The Venture of Islam Vol 3, 1961, p. 60.
The entire subcontinent fell under European colonial rule during the 18th century.Hodgson, The Venture of Islam Vol 3, 1958, p. 333. Independence from their former European colonial rulers, and the subsequent struggles for political power, have brought ethnic and religious strife to this area of the world in modern times.Hodgson, The Venture of Islam Vol 3, 1958, pp. 352–356.

==Restrictions==

There were a number of restrictions on dhimmis. In modern sense the dhimmis would be described as second-class citizens.[tpl]cite book |first=Majid |last=Khadduri |authorlink=Majid Khadduri |year=2010 |title=War and Peace in the Law of Islam |isbn=9781616190484 |pages=196–198[/tpl]
Although dhimmis were allowed to perform their religious rituals, they were obliged to do so in a manner not conspicuous to Muslims. Display of non-Muslim religious symbols, such as crosses or icons, was prohibited on buildings and on clothing (unless mandated as part of distinctive clothing). Loud prayers were forbidden, as were the ringing of church bells or the trumpeting of shofars.Karsh 29. They were also were not allowed to build or repair churches without Muslim consent. Moreover dhimmis were not allowed to seek converts among Muslims.[tpl]cite book | title=The Church in the Shadow of the Mosque: Christians and Muslims in the World of Islam | publisher=Princeton University Press | author=Sidney H. Griffith | year=2010 | isbn=0691146284[/tpl] In the Mamluk Egypt, where non-Mamluk Muslims were not allowed to ride horses and camels, dhimmis were prohibited even from riding donkeys inside cities.Stillman (1979), p. 471 Sometimes, Muslim rulers issued regulations requiring dhimmis to attach distinctive signs to their houses.Al-Tabari, Ta'rikh al-Rusul wa 'l-Muluk, translated in Stillman (1979), p. 167.
Most of the restrictions were social and symbolic in nature,Lewis (1984), p. 26 and a pattern of stricter, then more lax, enforcement developed over time. The major financial disabilities of the dhimmi were the jizya poll tax and the fact dhimmis and Muslims could not inherit from each other. That would create incentive to convert if someone from the family was already converted.[tpl]cite book | title=Introducing World Christianity | publisher=Wiley-Blackwell | author=Heather J. Sharkey | year=2012 | isbn=978-1-4443-4454-7 |page = 10[/tpl] The jurists and scholars of Islamic sharia law called for humane treatment of the dhimmis.Lewis (1984), p. 16.

===Jizya tax===

Payment of the jizya obligated Muslim authorities to protect dhimmis in civil and military matters. Sura 9 (At-Tawba), verse 29 stipulates that jizya be exacted from non-Muslims as a condition required for jihad to cease. Failure to pay the jizya could result in the pledge of protection of a dhimmi's life and property becoming void, with the dhimmi facing the alternatives of conversion, enslavement, death or imprisonment, as advocated by Abu Yusuf, the chief qadi, or religious judge, of Abbasid caliph Harun al-Rashid who ruled over much of modern day Iraq.Lewis (1984), pp. 14–15.
Lewis notes there are varying opinions among scholars as to how much of a burden jizya was. According to Norman Stillman: "jizya and kharaj were a crushing burden for the non-Muslim peasantry who eked out a bare living in a subsistence economy."Stillman (1979), p. 28 Both agree that ultimately, the additional taxation on non-Muslims was a critical factor that drove many dhimmis to leave their religion and accept Islam.Lewis (1984), p. 17–18; Stillman (1979), p. 18 However, in some regions the jizya on populations was significantly lower than the zakat, meaning dhimmi populations maintained an economic advantage.Klorman (2007), p. 94  According to Cohen, taxation, from the perspective of dhimmis who came under Muslim rule, was "a concrete continuation of the taxes paid to earlier regimes". Lewis observes that the change from Byzantine to Arab rule was welcomed by many among the dhimmis who found the new yoke far lighter than the old, both in taxation and in other matters, and that some even among the Christians of Syria and Egypt preferred the rule of Islam to that of Byzantines.Lewis (2002) p.57 In some places, for example Egypt, the obligations of the jizya tax created tax incentives for Christians to convert to Islam.
The importance of dhimmis as a source of revenue for the Muslim community is illuminated in a letter ascribed to Umar I and cited by Abu Yusuf: "if we take dhimmis and share them out, what will be left for the Muslims who come after us? By God, Muslims would not find a man to talk to and profit from his labors."Lewis (1984), pp. 30–31.
Most Islamic scholars agree that jizya must be levied only upon adult males. In an important early account, Malik ibn Anas' Muwatta Imam Malik reports that the jizya was collected from non-Muslim men only, and additional taxes were to be levied against dhimmis who travelled on business:
[tpl]Quote|"The sunnah is that there is no jizya due from women or children of people of the Book, and that jizya is only taken from men who have reached puberty. The people of dhimma ... do not have to pay any zakat ... This is because zakat is imposed on the Muslims to purify them and to be given back to their poor, whereas jizya is imposed on the people of the Book to humble them."|Malik ibn Anas|Muwatta Imam Malik[tpl]Hadith-usc|muwatta|usc=yes|17|24|46|[/tpl][/tpl]
The early Islamic scholars took a relatively humane and practical attitude towards the collection of jizya, compared to the 11th century commentators writing when Islam was under threat both at home and abroad.Lewis (1984), p. 15.
The jurist Abu Yusuf, the chief judge of the caliph Harun Al-Rashid, rules as follows regarding the manner of collecting the jizya 
In the border provinces, dhimmis were sometimes recruited for military operations. In such cases, they were exempted from jizya for the year of service."Djizya (i)", Encyclopaedia of Islam Online

===Administration of law===

Religious pluralism existed in medieval Islamic law and ethics. The religious laws and courts of other religions, including Christianity, Judaism and Hinduism, were usually accommodated within the Islamic legal framework, as exemplified in the Caliphate, Al-Andalus, Ottoman Empire and Indian subcontinent.[tpl]Cite book|last=Weeramantry|first=Judge Christopher G.|title=Justice Without Frontiers: Furthering Human Rights|year=1997|publisher=Brill Publishers|isbn=90-411-0241-8|page=138|postscript=[/tpl][tpl]Cite book|title=The Islamic Roots of Democratic Pluralism|first=Abdulaziz Abdulhussein|last=Sachedina|year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-513991-7|postscript=[/tpl] In medieval Islamic societies, the qadi (Islamic judges) usually could not interfere in the matters of non-Muslims unless the parties voluntarily chose to be judged according to Islamic law. The dhimmi communities living in Islamic states usually had their own laws independent from the Sharia law, such as the Jews who had their own Halakha courts.[tpl]Cite book|title=Under Crescent and Cross: The Jews in the Middle Ages|author=Mark R. Cohen|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1995|isbn=0-691-01082-X|page=74|url=http://books.google.com/?id=fgbib5exskUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=cohen+Under+Crescent+and+Cross&q|accessdate=2010-04-10|postscript=[/tpl]
Dhimmis were allowed to operate their own courts following their own legal systems. However, dhimmis frequently attended the Muslim courts in order to record property and business transactions within their own communities. Cases were taken out against Muslims, against other dhimmis and even against members of the dhimmi's own family. Dhimmis often took cases relating to marriage, divorce or inheritance to the Muslim courts so these cases would be decided under sharia law. Oaths sworn by dhimmis in the Muslim courts were sometimes the same as the oaths taken by Muslims, sometimes tailored to the dhimmis' beliefs.al-Qattan (1999)
Muslim men could generally marry dhimmi women who are considered People of the Book, however Islamic jurists rejected the possibility any non-Muslim man might marry a Muslim woman.Al-Mawardi (2000), p. 161; Friedmann (2003), p. 161; Lewis (1984), p. 27. Bernard Lewis notes that "similar position existed under the laws of Byzantine Empire, according to which a Christian could marry a Jewish woman, but a Jew could not marry a Christian woman under pain of death".

===Quranic verses as a basis for Islamic policies toward dhimmis===

Lewis states

===Hadith===

A hadith by Muhammad, "Whoever killed a Mu'ahid (a person who is granted the pledge of protection by the Muslims) shall not smell the fragrance of Paradise though its fragrance can be smelt at a distance of forty years (of traveling).",[tpl]Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|9|83|49[/tpl] is considered to be a foundation for the protection of the People of the Book in Muslim ruled countries.Rights of Non-Muslims Under Islamic Governance
Majid Khadduri cites a similar hadith in regard to the status of the dhimmis: "Whoever wrongs one with whom a compact (treaty) has been made a dhimmi and lays on him a burden beyond his strength, I will be his accuser."Majid Khadduri: War and Peace in the Law of Islam, p.175

===Constitution of Medina===

A precedent for the dhimma contract was established with the agreement between Muhammad and the Jews after the Battle of Khaybar, an oasis near Medina. Khaybar was the first territory attacked and conquered by Muslims. When the Jews of Khaybar surrendered to Muhammad after a siege, Muhammad allowed them to remain in Khaybar in return for handing over to the Muslims one half their annual produce.Lewis (1984), pp. 10-11
After Mecca was brought under Islamic rule, deputations from tribes across Arabia came to make terms with Muhammad and the Muslims. The Constitution of Medina, a formal agreement between Muhammad and all of the significant tribes and families of Medina (including Muslims, Jews and pagans), declared that non-Muslims in the Ummah had the following rights:Ahmed (1979), pp. 46–7.

===Pact of Umar===

The Pact of Umar,also in some texts, Omar traditionally believed to be between caliph Umar and the conquered Jerusalem Christians in the seventh century, was another source of regulations pertaining to dhimmis. However, Western orientalists doubt the authenticity of the pact, arguing it is usually the victors and not the vanquished who impose rather than propose, the terms of peace, and that it is highly unlikely that the people who spoke no Arabic and knew nothing of Islam could draft such a document. Academic historians believe the Pact of Umar in the form it is known today was a product of later jurists who attributed it to Umar in order to lend greater authority to their own opinions. The similarities between the Pact of Umar and the Theodosian and Justinian Codes of the Eastern Roman Empire suggest that perhaps much of the Pact of Umar was borrowed from these earlier codes by later Islamic jurists. At least some of the clauses of the pact mirror the measures first introduced by the Umayyad caliph Umar II or by the early Abbasid caliphs.Lewis (1984), pp. 24–25.

==Cultural interactions and cultural differences==

During the Middle Ages, local associations known as futuwwa clubs developed across the Islamic lands. There were usually several futuwwah in each town. These clubs catered to varying interests, primarily sports, and might involve distinctive manners of dress and custom. They were known for their hospitality, idealism and loyalty to the group. They often had a militaristic aspect, purportedly for the mutual protection of the membership. These clubs commonly crossed social strata, including among their membership local notables, dhimmi and slaves – to the exclusion of those associated with the local ruler, or amir.Marshall Hodgson, The Venture of Islam Conscience and History in a World Civilization Vol 2. The University of Chicago, 1961, pp. 126–127.
Muslims and Jews were sometimes partners in trade, with the Muslim taking days off on Fridays and Jews taking off on Saturdays.Marshall Hodgson, The Venture of Islam Conscience and History in a World Civilization Vol. 1. The University of Chicago, 1961, p. 302.
Andrew Wheatcroft describes how some social customs such as different conceptions of dirt and cleanliness made it difficult for the religious communities to live close to each other, either under Muslim or under Christian rule.Wheatcroft (2003) p. 73.
