Its political position is centre-left. The PSOE is the former ruling party of Spain, until beaten in the elections of November 2011 and the second oldest, exceeded only by the Carlist Party, founded in 1833.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl]
The party, under Felipe González, formed a majority government after its victory in the 1982 election which lasted until 1993, after which it formed a minority government until 1996. The PSOE has had strong ties with the General Union of Workers (UGT), a Spanish trade union. For decades, UGT membership was a requirement for PSOE membership. During the 1980s, though, UGT criticised the economic policies of the PSOE, even calling for a general strike on 14 December 1988.
The PSOE was last in government between 2004 and 2011 under José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero. The party is a full member of the Party of European Socialists and the Socialist International.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.psoe.es/ambito/historiapsoe/docs/index.do?action=View&id=992 |title=History of PSOE|publisher=PSOE own site |accessdate=11 July 2007|language=Spanish[/tpl] In the European Parliament, the PSOE's 23 MEPs sit in the Socialists and Democrats European parliamentary group.

==Ideology==

The PSOE was founded with the purpose of representing and defending the interests of the working class formed during the Industrial Revolution in the 19th Century.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]  In its beginnings, the PSOE's main objective was the defence of worker’s rights and the achievement of the ideals of socialism, emerging from contemporary philosophy and Marxist politics, by securing political power for the class and socialising the means of production in order to establish a dictatorship of the proletariat in the transition to socialist society.
The ideology of the Spanish Socialist Worker's Party has evolved throughout the 20th Century according to relevant historical events and the evolution of Spanish society.
In 1979 the party abandoned its definitive Marxist theses at the hands of its then secretary general Felipe González, not before overcoming great tensions and two Congresses, the first of which preferred to maintain Marxism.  Before this situation, notable internal leaders like Pablo Castellano or Luis Gómez Llorente founded the internal faction of Left Socialists, which included the militants who would not renounce Marxism.  This allowed for the consolidation of the leftist forces in the PSOE.  From this moment, the diverse events both outside and within the party led to projects that resembled those of other European social democratic parties and acceptance of the defence of the market economy.
Presently the PSOE is a political party that defines itself as "social democratic, centre-left and progressive."  It is grouped with other self-styled socialists, social democrats and labour parties in the Party of European Socialists.

==Early history (1879–1974)==

The PSOE was founded on 2 May 1879 in the Casa Labra Pub (city of Madrid) by the historical Spanish workers' leader Pablo Iglesias. The first program of the new political party was passed in an assembly of 40 people, on 20 July of that same year. Although the PSOE was rather weak during the late 19th century, its active participation in strikes from 1899 to 1902 and especially its electoral coalition with the main Republican parties led in 1910 to the election of Pablo Iglesias as the first Socialist representative in the Spanish Cortes.
The party was a member of the Labour and Socialist International between 1923 and 1940.Kowalski, Werner. Geschichte der sozialistischen arbeiter-internationale: 1923 - 19. Berlin: Dt. Verl. d. Wissenschaften, 1985. p. 325
PSOE formed part of the Spanish Government during the Second Spanish Republic and as part of the Spanish Popular Front, elected to government in February 1936. During the civil war years, PSOE was divided into three wings: a leftist revolutionary Marxist wing, led by Francisco Largo Caballero that advocated dictatorship of the proletariat, nationalization of every industry, and total redistribution of land; a moderate, social-democratic faction, led by Indalecio Prieto; and a reformist one, led by Julian Besteiro.Helen Graham, "The Spanish Socialist Party in Power and the Government of Juan Negrín, 1937-9," European History Quarterly (1988) 18#2 pp 175-206. online
The dictator Francisco Franco banned the PSOE in 1939, and the party was legalised again in 1977. During Franco's rule members of the PSOE were persecuted, with many leaders, members and supporters being imprisoned or exiled and even executed.

==Modern history (1974–present)==

Its 25th Congress was held in Toulouse in August 1972. In 1974 at its 26th Congress in Suresnes, Felipe González was elected Secretary General, replacing Rodolfo Llopis Ferrándiz. González was from the "reform" wing of the party, and his victory signaled a defeat for the historic and veteran wing of the Party. The direction of the party shifted from the exiles to the young people in Spain who hadn't fought the war.
Llopis led a schism to form the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (historic) González showed intentions to move the party away from its Marxist and socialist background, turning the PSOE into a social-democratic party, similar to those of the rest of western Europe. In 1977 PSOE became the official opposition party with 29.2% of the vote and 118 seats in the Parliament. Their standing was further boosted in 1978 when the 6 deputies of the Popular Socialist Party agreed to merge with the party.
In their 27th congress in May 1979 González resigned because the party would not abandon its Marxist character. In September the extraordinary 28th congress was called in which González was re-elected when the party agreed to move away from Marxism. European social-democratic parties supported González's stand, and the Social Democratic Party of Germany granted them money. The PSOE party symbol was changed from the anvil with the book to the social-democratic rose in the fist, as used by the French Socialist Party. In the referendum of 1978, PSOE supported the Spanish Constitution, which was approved. In the 1979 Spanish general election the PSOE gained 30.5% of the vote and 121 seats, remaining the main opposition party.
At the 28 October 1982 Spanish general election, the PSOE was victorious, with 48.1% of the vote (10,127,392 total). Felipe González became Prime Minister of Spain on 2 December, a position he held until May 1996.
Though the party had previously opposed NATO, after reaching the government most party leaders supported keeping Spain inside the organisation. The González administration organised a referendum on the question in 1986, calling for a favourable vote, and won. The administration was criticised for avoiding the official names of North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and NATO, using the unofficial Atlantic Alliance terms. A symbol of this U-turn is Javier Solana who campaigned against NATO but ended up years later as its Secretary General.
PSOE Supported the United States in the Gulf War (1991). The PSOE won the 1986, 1989 and 1993 general elections. Under the Gonzalez Administration, public expenditure on education, health, and pensions rose in total by 4.1 points of the country’s GDP between 1982 and 1992.[tpl]cite web|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qd7enfJ_PMUC&pg=PA183&dq=mauroy+government+pensions&hl=en&sa=X&ei=JzljUZm6HsWY1AXlioDAAQ&ved=0CFwQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=mauroy%20government%20pensions&f=false |title=Regimes, Politics, and Markets: Democratization and Economic Change in ... - José María Maravall - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |accessdate=9 February 2014[/tpl]
Economic crisis and state terrorism (GAL) against the violent separatist group ETA eroded the popularity of Felipe González, and in 1996, the PSOE lost the elections to the conservative People's Party (PP). Between 1996 and 2001 the PSOE weathered a crisis, with Gonzalez resigning in 1997. The PSOE suffered a heavy defeat in 2000 (34.7%).
The PSOE remained as the ruling party in the autonomous communities of Andalusia, Extremadura, Castilla-La Mancha and Asturias.
In 2000, a new general secretary, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero (also known as ZP), was elected, renewing the party. Later, the PSOE won the municipal elections of 2003.
PSOE strongly opposed to the Iraq War, which was supported by the PP.
On 13 November 2003 the PSOE (Socialist Party of Catalonia, PSC) increased its vote total but scored second in the regional election in Catalonia, after Convergence and Union. After a period of negotiations, the party formed a pact with Republican Left of Catalonia, Initiative for Catalonia Greens and the United and Alternative Left, and have governed in Catalonia since then.
On 14 March 2004, the PSOE won the 2004 Spanish general election with almost 43% of the votes, following the 11-M terrorist (March 11) attacks, and maintained their lead in the elections to the European Parliament.
In 2005, PSOE called for a Yes vote on the European Constitution. PSOE also favoured the negotiations between the government and ETA during the 2006 cease-fire, which had a de facto end with the Barajas Airport terrorist attack.
On 9 March 2008 the PSOE won the 2008 Spanish general elections again with José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero remaining Prime Minister of Spain. The Socialists increased their share of seats in the Congress of Deputies from 164 to 169 after the latest election.
However, after waning popularity throughout their second term, mainly due to their handling of the worsening economic climate in Spain in the aftermath of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, the PSOE were defeated in the general elections of November 2011.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2012[/tpl]
