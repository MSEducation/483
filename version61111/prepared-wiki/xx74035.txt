Iowa Public Television (IPTV) is a network of Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) member stations in the state of Iowa.  IPTV is owned by the Iowa Public Broadcasting Board, an agency of the state education department which holds the licenses for all the PBS member stations in the state.  IPTV's studios are located in Johnston, Iowa; a suburb of Des Moines.

==History==

Iowa is a pioneer in educational broadcasting; it is home to two of the oldest educational radio broadcast stations in the world, the University of Iowa's WSUI and Iowa State's WOI.  
 The electrical engineering department at the State University of Iowa (SUI) in Iowa City demonstrated television at an exhibit at the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines on August 28, 1931.  J. L. Potter supervised the project.  At the conclusion of the Iowa State Fair, the television experiment is set up in the communications laboratory of the electrical engineering building at The University of Iowa in Iowa City.
 By 1933, The University of Iowa received an FCC license for experimental TV station W9XK, later W9XUI providing twice a week video programming, with WSUI AM providing the audio channel.  By 1939, the FCC allocated TV channels 1 and 12 for the W9XUI television station.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.earlytelevision.org/prewar_stations.html |title=Television stations authorized by the FCC, January 1, 1941  |publisher=RCA Radio Travel-Log |year=1941 |accessdate=August 12, 2012 [/tpl]  This early attempt at educational broadcasting ended with US entrance into World War II.[tpl]cite web |url=http://transition.fcc.gov/omd/history/tv/documents/76years_tv.pdf |publisher=FCC |date=Summer 2003 |accessdate=14 July 2012 |title=The FCC: Seventy-Six Years of Watching TV [/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.earlytelevision.org/w9xk_history.html |title=A Short History of Television Station W9XK/W9XU |publisher=Early Television Museum |author=Rick Plummer |accessdate=14 July 2012 [/tpl] The concept of pure educational television, which Dr. E.B. Kurtz and his Iowa colleagues pioneered, was buried by the commercial television system which dominated development of the electronic media in Iowa after World War II.[tpl] cite web |url=http://www.wartburg.edu/broadcast/Chapter7/Chapter7.html |title=The Untold Story, W9XK - Iowa City |publisher=Wartburg College |accessdate=14 July 2012[/tpl]
WOI-TV in Ames began broadcast operations in 1950, as a sister station to WOI radio,[tpl]cite web |url=http://dailyiowan.lib.uiowa.edu/DI/1951/di1951-01-25.pdf |title=ISC paid for TV with Federal Funds |publisher=The Daily Iowan |page=1 |date=25 January 1951 |accessdate=22 August 2013[/tpl] and had carried some National Educational Television programming until Des Moines Public Schools signed on KDPS-TV as the educational station for central Iowa in 1959.  However, in the 1960s the only other areas of the state with a clear signal from an educational station were the southwest (from Nebraska ETV's KYNE-TV in Omaha), the northwest (from South Dakota ETV's KUSD-TV in Vermillion), and in eastern Iowa from The University of Iowa's WSUI-TV in Iowa City.
In 1969, the state of Iowa bought KDPS-TV from the Des Moines Public Schools and changed its calls to KDIN-TV, intending it to be the linchpin of a statewide educational television network.  As part of the state's ambition, it rebranded KDIN as the Iowa Educational Broadcasting Network.
The network's second station, KIIN-TV in Iowa City[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.earlytelevision.org/prewar_stations.html |title=Early Television Stations in U.S. |publisher=Early Television |accessdate=29 November 2012[/tpl] had resumed broadcast operations in 1950 from Iowa City as WSUI-TV on channel 12.[tpl]cite web |url=http://dailyiowan.lib.uiowa.edu/DI/1950/di1950-02-19.pdf |publisher=The Daily Iowan |title=When will SUI Get TV?  Answer Rests with FCC |page=6 |date=19 February 1950 |accessdate=22 August 2013[/tpl]  WSUI-TV joined IEBN in 1970 to expand state-wide educational programming to eastern Iowa and northwestern Illinois.  Soon afterward, IEBN became a charter member of PBS. By 1977 the newly renamed Iowa Public Broadcasting Network had eight full-power stations.  The Iowa Public Television name was adopted in 1982.  In 2003, it purchased KQCT-TV in Davenport, which repeated the programming of Quad Cities PBS station WQPT-TV in the Iowa side of the Quad Cities.  The calls were changed to KQIN.
IPTV was originally run by the state's General Services Department before Governor Terry Branstad signed a bill creating the Iowa Public Broadcasting Board on May 16, 1983. In 1986 IPTV became part of the state's Cultural Affairs Department, and on July 1, 1992, IPTV became part of the Iowa Department of Education.
Combined, the nine IPTV stations reach almost all of Iowa and portions of the surrounding states of Illinois, Minnesota, Nebraska, South Dakota, Missouri, and Wisconsin.

==Stations==

Nine full-power TV stations make up the network, all stations have callsigns beginning with a K, as licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), & ending in IN "IN" stands for Iowa Network.

===Notes===

The network also has eight low-power repeater signals, located in Ottumwa (channel 18 K18GU-D), Keosauqua (channel 24 K24IM-D), Fort Madison (channel 28 K28JD-D), Decorah (channel 28 K28KK-D), Sibley (channel 33 K33AB), Lansing (channel 39 K39LW-D), Rock Rapids (channel 43 K43LX-D), and Keokuk (channel 44 K44AB-D).
Some of the transmitters are located a fair distance from their cities of license:

===Digital programming===

The stations broadcast a multiplexed digital signal:

===Late night programming===

Since August 31, 2013, IPTV has gone off-the-air nightly from midnight to 5 a.m. over-the-air due to budget concerns, reduced from a 24-hour schedule. Mediacom continues to carry the network in their markets with 24-hour programming due to their direct fiber connection from IPTV in Johnston to their Des Moines headend, which distributes the three IPTV channels statewide; the national satellite services carry the network's over-the-air signal, thus also going off the air from midnight to 5 a.m. The network hopes to restore over-the-air 24-hour service in the near future; late night programming mainly consists of the national PBS schedule.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.iptv.org/schedule.cfm |title=IPTV Schedule |publisher=IPTV |accessdate=31 August 2013[/tpl]

==Programming==

Although IPTV provides PBS programming and also coordinates several political debates during the Iowa Caucuses, it also produces original programs such as Iowa Press, a panel discussion show; and  Market to Market, a nationally distributed show about agribusiness. Dan Wardell is the Host of the Children's Television block, featuring programs such as "The Big Comfy Couch" and "Sesame Street".

==Friends of Iowa Public Television==

In 1969, Friends of Iowa Public Television (Iowa Public Television Foundation Board) was created for the development, growth and support of IPTV through the building of a strong statewide membership base. Its 65,000 member households across Iowa and bordering states contribute nearly 90% of the out-of-pocket costs for acquiring and producing general audience programming. The envy of many PBS stations and state educational TV / radio networks, these 65,000 households continue their support of IPTV's mission to educate, enlighten and entertain.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.iptv.org/friends/ |title=Friends of Iowa Public Television Foundation |accessdate=30 August 2013 |publisher=IPTV[/tpl]
