==Writing style==

Byurat is considered a late-romantic writer. The theme adopted in much of his writings are largely centered around the persecution of the Armenian race by the government, heroic tales, and dramatic depiction of Armenian revolutionary life. The settings of some of his novels were set in his native land of Zeytun. His striking depiction of the revolutionary movement drew large attention for Armenian readers making him a very popular writer in the early 20th century.
