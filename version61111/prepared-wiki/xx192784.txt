==History==

Taking its name from the Native American word meaning "beautiful view," Wasena was annexed into the city in 1919 and began its development as an early suburb of Roanoke in the 1920s. Nearly all of the structures within Wasena date from between the 1920s and 1950s. The architecture of the area is varied with the largest numbers representing both the American Craftsman Bungalow and American Foursquare design for residential construction. Formed in 1983, the Wasena Neighborhood Forum has been a member of the Roanoke Neighborhood Partnership since 1984, serving as a citizen advocacy group for the neighborhood.
Today, Wasena is the location of the [tpl]convert|41|acre|m2|sing=on[/tpl] Wasena Park, Smith Park, Triangle Park, Valley Avenue Park and a portion of the Roanoke River Greenway. Wasena Elementary School is the lone public school located within the neighborhood.
