Caffeine is a bitter, white crystalline xanthine alkaloid and a stimulant drug.  Caffeine is found in varying quantities in the seeds, leaves, and fruit of some plants, where it acts as a natural pesticide that paralyzes and kills certain insects feeding on the plants, as well as enhancing the reward memory of pollinators.  It is most commonly consumed by humans in infusions extracted from the seed of the coffee plant and the leaves of the tea bush, as well as from various foods and drinks containing products derived from the kola nut. Other sources include yerba maté, guarana berries, guayusa, and the yaupon holly.
In humans, caffeine acts as a central nervous system stimulant, temporarily warding off drowsiness and restoring alertness. It is the world's most widely consumed psychoactive drug, but unlike many other psychoactive substances, it is legal and unregulated in nearly all parts of the world. Beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee, tea, soft drinks, and energy drinks, enjoy great popularity. In North America, 90% of adults consume caffeine daily.[tpl]cite journal|author=Lovett R |title=Coffee: The demon drink? |journal=New Scientist |issue=2518 |date=24 September 2005 |url=http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=mg18725181.700 |accessdate=3 August 2009 |subscription=yes[/tpl]
Part of the reason caffeine is classified by the Food and Drug Administration as generally recognized as safe is that toxic doses (over 10 grams for an average adult) are much higher than typically used doses (less than 500 milligrams). Ordinary consumption has low health risks, even when carried on for years – there may be a modest protective effect against some diseases, including Parkinson's disease,[tpl]cite journal|author=Cano-Marquina A, Tarín JJ, Cano A |title=The impact of coffee on health |journal=Maturitas |date=May 2013 |volume=75 |issue=1 |pages=7–21 |doi=10.1016/j.maturitas.2013.02.002 |pmid=23465359 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378-5122(13)00047-9 |accessdate=15 January 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|title=Dose-response meta-analysis on coffee, tea and caffeine consumption with risk of Parkinson's disease |journal=Geriatr Gerontol Int |date=23 July 2003 |doi=10.1111/ggi.12123 |pmid=23879665 |author=Qi H, Li S[/tpl] heart disease,[tpl]cite journal|last=Ding|first=M|coauthors=Bhupathiraju, SN; Satija, A; van Dam, RM; Hu, FB|title=Long-term coffee consumption and risk of cardiovascular disease: a systematic review and a dose-response meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies.|journal=Circulation|date=11 February 2014|volume=129|issue=6|pages=643–59|pmid=24201300|doi=10.1161/circulationaha.113.005925[/tpl] and certain types of cancer. Some people experience sleep disruption if they consume caffeine, especially during the evening hours, but others show little disturbance and the effect of caffeine on sleep is highly variable.
Evidence of a risk to pregnancy is equivocal, with some authorities concluding that it is wise for pregnant women to limit consumption to the equivalent of two cups of coffee per day or less.[tpl]cite web|author=Mayo Clinic staff |title=Pregnancy Nutrition: Foods to avoid during pregnancy |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/pregnancy-nutrition/PR00109/NSECTIONGROUP=2 |publisher=Mayo Clinic |accessdate=15 April 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|author=American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists |title=ACOG CommitteeOpinion No. 462: Moderate caffeine consumption during pregnancy |journal=Obstet Gynecol |volume=116 |issue=2 Pt 1 |pages=467–8 |date=August 2010 |pmid=20664420 |doi=10.1097/AOG.0b013e3181eeb2a1[/tpl] Caffeine has pressor and mild diuretic effects when administered to people who are not used to it, but regular users develop a tolerance to this effect, and studies have generally failed to support the common notion that ordinary consumption contributes significantly to dehydration. With heavy use, tolerance develops rapidly to autonomic effects such as elevated heart rate and muscle twitching, but not to the cognitive or arousal effects of caffeine. The degree to which caffeine can produce significant dependency and caffeine addiction remains a subject of controversy in the medical literature.

==Health effects==

===Stimulant effects===

Caffeine is a central nervous system and metabolic stimulant,[tpl]cite journal|author=Nehlig A, Daval JL, Debry G |title=Caffeine and the central nervous system: mechanisms of action, biochemical, metabolic and psychostimulant effects |journal=Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=139–70 |year=1992 |pmid=1356551 |doi=10.1016/0165-0173(92)90012-B[/tpl] and is used both recreationally and medically to reduce physical fatigue and to restore alertness when drowsiness occurs. It produces increased wakefulness, faster and clearer flow of thought, increased focus, and better general body coordination. The amount of caffeine needed to produce effects varies from person to person, depending on body size and degree of tolerance. Effects begin less than an hour after consumption, and a moderate dose usually wears off in about five hours.
Caffeine has a number of effects on sleep, but does not affect all people in the same way. It improves performance during sleep deprivation but may lead to subsequent insomnia.[tpl]cite journal|author=Snel J, Lorist MM |title=Effects of caffeine on sleep and cognition |journal=Prog.

Although the evidence that caffeine may be harmful during pregnancy is equivocal, there is some evidence that the hormonal changes associated with pregnancy slow the metabolic clearance of caffeine from the system, causing a given dose to have longer-lasting effects (as long as 15 hours in the third trimester).
Caffeine is a weak bronchodilator. In clinical tests on adults with athsma, at fairly low doses (5mg/kg of body weight), caffeine has been shown to provide a small improvement in lung function, such that it needs to be controlled for in diagnostic tests.[tpl]Cite journal  | last1 = Welsh | first1 = EJ. | last2 = Bara | first2 = A. | last3 = Barley | first3 = E. | last4 = Cates | first4 = CJ. | editor1-last = Welsh  | editor1-first = Emma J | title = Caffeine for asthma | journal = Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume =  | issue = 1 | pages = CD001112 | year = 2010 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD001112.pub2 | pmid = 20091514 [/tpl]  Caffeine is the primary treatment of the breathing disorders apnea of prematurity[tpl]cite journal|author=Mathew OP |title=Apnea of prematurity: pathogenesis and management strategies |journal=J Perinatol |volume=31 |issue=5 |pages=302–10 |year=2011 |pmid=21127467 |doi=10.1038/jp.2010.126[/tpl] and may also be effective in preventing bronchopulmonary dysplasia in premature infants.[tpl]cite journal|author=Kugelman A, Durand M |title=A comprehensive approach to the prevention of bronchopulmonary dysplasia |journal=Pediatr Pulmonol |volume=46 |issue=12 |pages=1153–65 |year=2011 |pmid=21815280 |doi=10.1002/ppul.21508[/tpl] The only short-term risk associated with caffeine citrate treatment is a temporary reduction in weight gain during the therapy,[tpl]cite journal|author=Schmidt B, Roberts RS, Davis P, Doyle LW, Barrington KJ, Ohlsson A, Solimano A, Tin W |title=Caffeine therapy for apnea of prematurity |journal=N.

===Psychological effects===

The US National Institutes of Health states: "Too much caffeine can make you restless, anxious, and irritable. It may also keep you from sleeping well and cause headaches, abnormal heart rhythms, or other problems. If you stop using caffeine, you could get withdrawal symptoms. Some people are more sensitive to the effects of caffeine than others. They should limit their use of caffeine. So should pregnant and nursing women.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/caffeine.html |title=Caffeine |publisher=MedlinePlus: U.S. National Library of Medicine|accessdate=27 October 2012[/tpl]"
Four caffeine-induced disorders are recognized by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) including: caffeine intoxication, caffeine-induced sleep disorder, caffeine-induced anxiety disorder and caffeine-related disorder not otherwise specified (NOS). The DSM-IV defines a person with caffeine-induced sleep disorder as an individual who regularly ingests high doses of caffeine sufficient to induce a significant disturbance in his or her sleep, sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention. As of 2010 the effect of caffeine on people with ADHD is not known. Some studies have however found a modest protective effect against Alzheimer disease, but the evidence is inconclusive.[tpl]cite journal|author=Santos C, Costa J, Santos J, Vaz-Carneiro A, Lunet N |title=Caffeine intake and dementia: systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=J.

===Caffeine toxicity===

Caffeine overdose can result in a state of central nervous system over-stimulation called caffeine intoxication (DSM-IV 305.90).[tpl]cite book|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders |edition=4th |publisher=American Psychiatric Association |year=1994 |isbn=0-89042-062-9 |author=American Psychiatric Association.[/tpl] This syndrome typically occurs only after ingestion of large amounts of caffeine, well over the amounts found in typical caffeinated beverages and caffeine tablets (e.g., more than 400–500 mg at a time). The symptoms of caffeine intoxication are comparable to the symptoms of overdoses of other stimulants: they may include restlessness, fidgeting, anxiety, excitement, insomnia, flushing of the face, increased urination, gastrointestinal disturbance, muscle twitching, a rambling flow of thought and speech, irritability, irregular or rapid heart beat, and psychomotor agitation.[tpl]cite web|title=Caffeine (Systemic) |publisher=MedlinePlus |date=25 May 2000 |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/uspdi/202105.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223063601/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/uspdi/202105.html |archivedate=23 February 2007 |accessdate=3 August 2009[/tpl] In cases of much larger overdoses, mania, depression, lapses in judgment, disorientation, disinhibition, delusions, hallucinations, or psychosis may occur, and rhabdomyolysis (breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue) can be provoked.[tpl]cite web|title=Caffeine overdose |publisher=MedlinePlus |date=4 April 2006 |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002579.htm |accessdate=3 August 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|author=Verkhratsky A |title=Physiology and pathophysiology of the calcium store in the endoplasmic reticulum of neurons |journal=Physiol.

Treatment of severe caffeine intoxication is generally supportive, providing treatment of the immediate symptoms, but if the patient has very high serum levels of caffeine then peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis, or hemofiltration may be required.

===Addiction and tolerance===

With repetitive use, physical dependence or addiction may occur. Also, some effects of caffeine, particularly the autonomic effects, decrease over time, a phenomenon known as a tolerance. Tolerance develops quickly to some (but not all) effects of caffeine, especially among heavy coffee and energy drink consumers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.caffeinedependence.org/caffeine_dependence.html |title=Information about caffeine dependence |website=Caffeinedependence.org |accessdate=25 May 2012[/tpl] Some coffee drinkers develop tolerance to its sleep-disrupting effects, but others apparently do not.[tpl]cite journal|author=Fredholm BB, Bättig K, Holmén J, Nehlig A, Zvartau EE |title=Actions of caffeine in the brain with special reference to factors that contribute to its widespread use |journal=Pharmacol.

===Withdrawal===

Withdrawal symptoms – including headaches, irritability, inability to concentrate, drowsiness, insomnia, and pain in the stomach, upper body, and joints – may appear within 12 to 24 hours after discontinuation of caffeine intake, peak at roughly 48 hours, and usually last from 2 to 9 days.[tpl]cite journal|author=Juliano LM, Griffiths RR |title=A critical review of caffeine withdrawal: empirical validation of symptoms and signs, incidence, severity, and associated features |journal=Psychopharmacology (Berl.) |volume=176 |issue=1 |pages=1–29 |year=2004 |url=http://neuroscience.jhu.edu/griffiths%20papers/CaffwdReview.2004.pdf |archiveurl=http://webcitation.org/6533BsxXt |archivedate=29 January 2012 |pmid=15448977 |doi=10.1007/s00213-004-2000-x[/tpl] Withdrawal headaches are experienced by 52% of people who stopped consuming caffeine for two days after an average of 235 mg caffeine per day prior to that.[tpl]cite journal|author=Silverman K, Evans SM, Strain EC, Griffiths RR |title=Withdrawal syndrome after the double-blind cessation of caffeine consumption |journal=N.

Peer knowledge, support and interaction may aid withdrawal.
Caffeine withdrawal is categorized as a mental disorder in the DSM-5 (the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual published by the American Psychiatric Association).[tpl]cite news|url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/05/31/caffeine-withdrawal-is-now-a-mental-disorder/#ixzz2VGUqUg1D |title=Caffeine Withdrawal Is Now a Mental Disorder |author=Matt Peckham |newspaper=Time |date=31 May 2013[/tpl]  Previous versions of the manual included "caffeine intoxication" but not caffeine withdrawal.

==Sources and consumption==

Global consumption of caffeine has been estimated at 120,000 tonnes per year, making it the world's most popular psychoactive substance. This amounts to one serving of a caffeinated beverage for every person every day.[tpl]cite news|title=What's your poison: caffeine |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |year=1997 |url=http://www.abc.net.au/quantum/poison/caffeine/caffeine.htm |accessdate=15 January 2014 |author=Geoffrey Burchfield |editor=Meredith Hopes[/tpl]

The disparity in experience and effects between the various natural caffeine sources could be because plant sources of caffeine also contain widely varying mixtures of other xanthine alkaloids, including the cardiac stimulants theophylline and theobromine, and other substances such as polyphenols that can form insoluble complexes with caffeine.[tpl]cite book|author=Balentine D.

One of the world's primary sources of caffeine is the coffee "bean" (which is the seed of the coffee plant), from which coffee is brewed. Caffeine content in coffee varies widely depending on the type of coffee bean and the method of preparation used;[tpl]cite web|title=Caffeine |publisher=International Coffee Organization |url=http://www.ico.org/caffeine.asp |accessdate=1 August 2009[/tpl] even beans within a given bush can show variations in concentration. In general, one serving of coffee ranges from 80 to 100 milligrams, for a single shot (30 milliliters) of arabica-variety espresso, to approximately 100–125 milligrams for a cup (120 milliliters) of drip coffee.[tpl]cite web|title=Coffee and Caffeine FAQ: Does dark roast coffee have less caffeine than light roast? |url=http://coffeefaq.com/site/node/15 |accessdate=2 August 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=All About Coffee: Caffeine Level |publisher=Jeremiah's Pick Coffee Co |url=http://www.jeremiahspick.com/caffeine-e-13.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080318102343/http://www.jeremiahspick.com/caffeine-e-13.html |archivedate=18 March 2008 |accessdate=3 August 2009[/tpl] Arabica coffee typically contains half the caffeine of the robusta variety.
In general, dark-roast coffee has very slightly less caffeine than lighter roasts because the roasting process reduces a small amount of the bean's caffeine content.
Tea contains more caffeine than coffee by dry weight. A typical serving, however, contains much less, since tea is normally brewed much weaker. Also contributing to caffeine content are growing conditions, processing techniques, and other variables. Thus, certain types of tea may contain somewhat more caffeine than other teas.[tpl]cite journal|author=Hicks MB, Hsieh Y-H P, Bell LN |title=Tea preparation and its influence on methylxanthine concentration |journal=Food Research International |year=1996 |volume=29 |pages=325–330 |doi=10.1016/0963-9969(96)00038-5 |issue=3–4[/tpl]
Tea contains small amounts of theobromine and slightly higher levels of theophylline than coffee. Preparation and many other factors have a significant impact on tea, and color is a very poor indicator of caffeine content. Teas like the pale Japanese green tea, gyokuro, for example, contain far more caffeine than much darker teas like lapsang souchong, which has very little.
Caffeine is also a common ingredient of soft drinks, such as cola, originally prepared from kola nuts. Soft drinks typically contain about 10 to 50 milligrams of caffeine per serving. By contrast, energy drinks, such as Red Bull, can start at 80 milligrams of caffeine per serving. The caffeine in these drinks either originates from the ingredients used or is an additive derived from the product of decaffeination or from chemical synthesis. Guarana, a prime ingredient of energy drinks, contains large amounts of caffeine with small amounts of theobromine and theophylline in a naturally occurring slow-release excipient.[tpl]cite journal|author=Bempong DK, Houghton PJ, Steadman K |year=1993 |title=The xanthine content of guarana and its preparations |journal=Int J Pharmacog |issn=0925-1618 |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=175–181 |doi=10.3109/13880209309082937[/tpl]
Chocolate derived from cocoa beans contains a small amount of caffeine. The weak stimulant effect of chocolate may be due to a combination of theobromine and theophylline, as well as caffeine.[tpl]cite journal|author=Smit HJ, Gaffan EA, Rogers PJ |title=Methylxanthines are the psycho-pharmacologically active constituents of chocolate |journal=Psychopharmacology (Berl.) |volume=176 |issue=3–4 |pages=412–9 |date=November 2004 |pmid=15549276 |doi=10.1007/s00213-004-1898-3[/tpl] A typical 28-gram serving of a milk chocolate bar has about as much caffeine as a cup of decaffeinated coffee, although dark chocolate has about the same caffeine as coffee by weight. Some dark chocolate currently in production contains as much as 160 mg per 100 g – which is double the caffeine content of the highest caffeinated drip coffee by weight.
Various manufacturers market caffeine tablets, claiming that using caffeine of pharmaceutical quality improves mental alertness. These effects have been borne out by research that shows caffeine use (whether in tablet form or not) results in decreased fatigue and increased attentiveness.[tpl]cite journal|author=Bolton S |title=Caffeine: Psychological Effects, Use and Abuse |journal=Orthomolecular Psychiatry |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=202–211 |year=1981 |url=http://intraspec.ca/1981-v10n03-p202.pdf[/tpl]

==Chemical properties and biosynthesis==

Pure anhydrous caffeine is a white colorless powder with a melting point of 227–228 °C. Caffeine is moderately soluble in water at room temperature (2 g/100 mL), but very soluble in boiling water (66 g/100 mL). It is also moderately soluble in ethanol (1.5 g/100 mL).[tpl]cite book|title=The Merck Index |edition=12th |editor=Susan Budavari |publisher=Merck & Co., Inc. |place=Whitehouse Station, NJ |year=1996 |page=1674[/tpl] It is weakly basic (pKa = ~0.6) requiring strong acid to protonate it.This is the pKa for protonated caffeine, given as a range of values included in [tpl]cite book|title=Profiles of Drug Substances, Excipients and Related Methodology, volume 33: Critical Compilation of pKa Values for Pharmaceutical Substances |author=Harry G.

The xanthine core of caffeine contains two fused rings, a pyrimidinedione and imidazole.  The pyrimidinedione in turn contains two amide functional groups that exist predominately in a zwitterionic resonance form where the nitrogen atoms are double bonded to their adjacent amide carbons atoms. Hence all six of the atoms within the pyrimidinedione ring system are sp2 hybridized and planar. Therefore the fused 5,6 ring core of caffeine contains a total of ten pi electrons and hence according to Hückel's rule is aromatic.[tpl]cite web|url=http://quantum.esu.edu/~scady/Chem495/keskineva.pdf |title=Chemistry of Caffeine |author=Keskineva N |format=PDF |work= |publisher=Chemistry Department, East Stroudsburg University |accessdate=2 January 2014[/tpl]

==Pharmacology==

Inside the body caffeine acts through several mechanisms, but its most important effect is to counteract a substance called adenosine that naturally circulates at high levels throughout the body, and especially in the nervous system. In the brain, adenosine plays a generally protective role, part of which is to reduce neural activity levels – for example, there is some evidence that adenosine helps to induce torpor in animals that seasonally hibernate.[tpl]cite journal|author=Jinka TR, Tøien Ø, Drew KL |title=Season primes the brain in an arctic hibernator to facilitate entrance into torpor mediated by adenosine A(1) receptors |journal=J. Neurosci. |volume=31 |issue=30 |pages=10752–8 |year=2011 |pmid=21795527 |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1240-11.2011 |pmc=3325781[/tpl]

===Mechanism of action===

thumb|250px|Caffeine's primary mechanism of action is as an antagonist of adenosine receptors in the brain|alt=Two skeletal formulas: left – caffeine, right – adenosine. Adenosine acts as an inhibitory neurotransmitter that suppresses activity in the central nervous system. "Largely as a consequence of its blockade of adenosine receptors, caffeine also has profound effects on most of the other major neurotransmitters, including dopamine, acetylcholine, serotonin, and, in high doses, on norepinephrine",[tpl]cite web|url=http://worldofcaffeine.com/caffeine-and-neurotransmitters/ |title=World of Caffeine |publisher=World of Caffeine |date=15 June 2013 |accessdate=19 December 2013[/tpl] and to a small extent epinephrine, glutamate, and cortisol.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]  At high doses, exceeding 500 milligrams, caffeine inhibits GABA neurotransmission.  GABA reduction explains why caffeine increases anxiety, insomnia, rapid heart and respiration rate.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]
Because caffeine is both water- and lipid-soluble, it readily crosses the blood–brain barrier that separates the bloodstream from the interior of the brain. Once in the brain, the principal mode of action is as a nonselective antagonist of adenosine receptors (in other words, an agent that reduces the effects of adenosine). The caffeine molecule is structurally similar to adenosine, and is capable of binding to adenosine receptors on the surface of cells without activating them, thereby acting as a competitive inhibitor.[tpl]cite journal|author=Fisone G, Borgkvist A, Usiello A |title=Caffeine as a psychomotor stimulant: mechanism of action |journal=Cell.

Adenosine is found in every part of the body, because it plays a role in the fundamental adenosine triphosphate (ATP) related energy producing mechanism and is also needed for RNA synthesis, but it has additional functions in the brain. The evidence indicates that brain adenosine acts to protect the brain by suppressing neural activity and by increasing blood flow via receptors located on vascular smooth muscle. Brain adenosine levels are increased by various types of metabolic stress, including lack of oxygen and interruption of blood flow. There is evidence that adenosine functions as a synaptically released neurotransmitter in some parts of the brain; however, stress-related adenosine increases appear to be produced mainly by extracellular metabolism of ATP. Unlike most neurotransmitters, adenosine does not seem to be packaged into vesicles that are released in a voltage-controlled manner, but the possibility of such a mechanism has not been fully ruled out.[tpl]cite journal|author=Latini S, Pedata F |title=Adenosine in the central nervous system: release mechanisms and extracellular concentrations |journal=J.

Several classes of adenosine receptors have been described, with different anatomical distributions. A1 receptors are widely distributed, and act to inhibit calcium uptake. A2A receptors are heavily concentrated in the basal ganglia, an area that plays a critical role in behavior control, but can be found in other parts of the brain as well, in lower densities. There is evidence that A2A receptors interact with the dopamine system, which is involved in reward and arousal. (A2A receptors can also be found on arterial walls and blood cell membranes.)
Beyond its general neuroprotective effects, there are reasons to believe that adenosine may be more specifically involved in control of the sleep–wake cycle. Robert McCarley and his colleagues have argued that accumulation of adenosine may be a primary cause of the sensation of sleepiness that follows prolonged mental activity, and that the effects may be mediated both by inhibition of wake-promoting neurons via A1 receptors, and activation of sleep-promoting neurons via indirect effects on A2A receptors.[tpl]cite journal|author=Basheer R, Strecker RE, Thakkar MM, McCarley RW |title=Adenosine and sleep-wake regulation |journal=Prog.

A number of potential mechanisms have been proposed for the athletic performance-enhancing effects of caffeine.[tpl]cite journal|author=Davis JK, Green JM |title=Caffeine and anaerobic performance: ergogenic value and mechanisms of action |journal=Sports Med |volume=39 |issue=10 |pages=813–32 |year=2009 |pmid=19757860 |doi=10.2165/11317770-000000000-00000[/tpl] In the classic, or metabolic theory, caffeine may increase fat utilization and decrease glycogen utilization. Caffeine mobilizes free fatty acids from fat and/or intramuscular triglycerides by increasing circulating epinephrine levels. The increased availability of free fatty acids increases fat oxidation and spares muscle glycogen, thereby enhancing endurance performance. In the nervous system, caffeine may reduce the perception of effort by lowering the neuron activation threshold, making it easier to recruit the muscles for exercise.[tpl]cite book|author=McArdle W |title=Exercise Physiology |edition=7th |year=2010 |publisher=Lippincott Williams and Wilkins |location=Baltimore, MD |isbn=978-0-7817-9781-8 |page=559[/tpl]

====Caffeine metabolites====

Metabolites of caffeine also contribute to caffeine's effects. Paraxanthine is responsible for an increase in the lipolysis process, which releases glycerol and fatty acids into the blood to be used as a source of fuel by the muscles. Theobromine is a vasodilator that increases the amount of oxygen and nutrient flow to the brain and muscles. Theophylline acts as a smooth muscle relaxant that chiefly affects bronchioles and acts as a chronotrope and inotrope that increases heart rate and force of contraction.[tpl]cite book|author=Dews PB |title=Caffeine: Perspectives from Recent Research |publisher=Berlin: Springer-Valerag |year=1984 |isbn=978-0-387-13532-8[/tpl]
