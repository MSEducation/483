A singing telegram is a message that is delivered by an artist in a musical form.  Singing telegrams are historically linked to normal telegrams, but tend to be humorous. Sometimes the artist is in costume or formal clothing.  Singing telegrams are often given as a gift.
Western Union, the  American telegraph company began offering singing telegram services in 1933. On July 28, 1933, a fan sent Hollywood singing star Rudy Vallee a birthday greeting by telegram. George P. Oslin (1899â€“1996), the Western Union public relations director, decided this would be a good opportunity to make telegrams, which had been associated with deaths and other tragic news, into something more popular.  He asked a Western Union operator, Lucille Lipps, to sing the message over the telephone, and this became the first singing telegram.[tpl]Citation | url = http://www.jrn.columbia.edu/studentwork/cns/2002-07-07/168.asp | title = Special delivery: The singing telegram endures | newspaper = Columbia News Service | date = July 7, 2002[/tpl]. While Oslin created the singing telegram because he thought "that messages should be fun," he recalled that he "was angrily informed I was making a laughingstock of the company."[tpl]Citation | title = George Oslin, 97, creator of the singing telegram | newspaper = Chicago Tribune | date = October 31, 1996 | page = 11[/tpl].
As relatively few telegram recipients had telephones, most telegrams, including singing telegrams, were first delivered in person. The popularization of the telephone in the 1960s reduced telegrams in general. By 1972, Western Union was receiving a small number of requests for singing telegrams and was seeking regulatory approval on a state-by-state basis to eliminate the offering.[tpl]Citation | title = Western Union Tuning Out Singing Telegram | newspaper = The New York Times | date = July 29, 1972 | page = 27[/tpl].  Western Union suspended its singing telegram service in 1974, but independent singing telegram companies, specializing in often costumed personal delivery of gift messages, have kept up the tradition.
The first singing telegram in the UK is said to have been performed by Mike Collins aka The wandering Minstrel who is still performing fully personalised songs to this day. In 2011, The Wandering Minstrel began giving away full band production audio CDs and DVD music videos of the specially written songs. http://www.minstrelgreetings.com/aboutus.htm

A Strip-O-Gram is a form of message delivery in which a woman or man will perform a striptease while singing or dancing.  The word is a combination of telegram and striptease.  This type of entertainment became popular in the 1970s in the US and spread to the UK and Europe during the 1980s.[tpl]cn|date=January 2012[/tpl] Typically a Strip-O-Gram is most often a form of gift given for a birthday, anniversary or bachelor party.  A common practice is for the strippergram to be dressed in an outfit of one kind or another and to act out some form of charade connected with this, before commencing their act - for example a police officer 'arresting' somebody, a lawyer pretending to serve papers, a jilted bride and so on (sometimes this charade will be relevant to something the intended 'victim' has experienced, such as a divorce, or brush with the law).
