Love (Is All We Need) is a song recorded by British DJ Adam J, and features Sugababes' Amelle Berrabah and production team The Nightcrashers. It was released on 19 August 2013, Berrabah's first solo release since her collaboration with Tinchy Stryder on his single Never Leave You back in 2009. The song itself will be released as Adam J's single, but the song itself features Amelle's vocals only, and is believed to be featured on her upcoming debut solo album which is expected to be released after another two singles. However, the song failed to chart
