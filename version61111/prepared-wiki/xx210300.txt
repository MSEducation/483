Leonard Cohen is a Canadian singer-songwriter and poet active in music since 1967. Cohen has released 12 studio albums and 6 live albums during the course of a recording career lasting over 45 years, throughout which he has remained an active poet. His entire catalogue is available on Columbia Records. His 1967 debut Songs of Leonard Cohen earned an RIAA gold record; he followed up with three more highly acclaimed albums: Songs From A Room (1969), Songs Of Love And Hate (1971) and New Skin For The Old Ceremony (1974), before allowing Phil Spector to produce Death of a Ladies' Man for Warner Bros. Records in 1977. Cohen returned to Columbia in 1979 for Recent Songs, but the label declined to release his next album, Various Positions (1984) in the US, leaving it to American shops to import it from CBS Canada. In 1988, Columbia got behind Cohen again and gave full support to I'm Your Man, which brought his career to new heights, and Cohen followed it with 1992's The Future. Cohen then took a nine-year hiatus, and returned with Ten New Songs in (2001). His newest album, Old Ideas (2012), peaked at #3 on the Billboard 200 Album Chart, the highest ranking ever for a Leonard Cohen album. His five live albums include Live Songs (1973), Cohen Live: Leonard Cohen in Concert (1994), Live in London (2009) and Songs from the Road, (2010) from his 2008â€“2009 world tour, and Live at the Isle of Wight 1970 (2009).
