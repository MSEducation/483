Rakaposhi (Räkapoşi) (Urdu: راکاپوشی), is a mountain in the Karakoram mountain range in Pakistan. It is situated in the Nagar Valley approximately 100 km north of the city of Gilgit in the Gilgit District of the Gilgit–Baltistan province of Pakistan. Rakaposhi means "Snow Covered" in the local language. Rakaposhi is also known as Dumani ("Mother of Mist"). It is ranked 27th highest in the world and 12th highest in Pakistan, but it is more popular for its beauty than its rank might suggest. In a colloquial sense, i.e. measured from base to summit, Rakaposhi with its uninterrupted ~6000 m vertical rise,http://www.summitpost.org/rakaposhi/173510 according to Rakaposhi's page on summitpost.org is the tallest mountain on Earth.
Rakaposhi was first climbed in 1958 by Mike Banks and Tom Patey, members of a British-Pakistani expedition, via the Southwest Spur/Ridge route.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.summitpost.org/rakaposhi/173510|title=Climbing details|publisher=summitpost.org|accessdate=25 September 2011[/tpl] Both of them suffered minor frostbite during the ascent. Another climber slipped and fell on the descent and died during the night.

==Park==

The people of Nagar have dedicated the Rakaposhi range mountain area as a community park. The Minister for Northern Areas inaugurated the park.

Rakaposhi is notable for its exceptional rise over local terrain.  On the north, it rises [tpl]convert|5800|m|ft|0[/tpl] in only an 11.5 km (7.1 mi) horizontal distance from the Hunza River. There are magnificent views of Rakaposhi from the Karakoram Highway on the route through Hunza. A tourist spot in the town of Ghulmat (located in the Nagar Valley) called "Zero Point of Rakaposhi" is the closest convenient view point of the mountain.
