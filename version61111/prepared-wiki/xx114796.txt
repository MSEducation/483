Rowley was born in England, started his career within insurance and moved to Prague in the early 1990s to assist a local subsidiary.
It was in Prague that he first experienced both Czech beer and absinth, and he launched several alcoholic drinks ventures when he moved back to England.[tpl]cite web|title=CLASS magazine: The Brand Perspective, May 2012|url=http://www.diffordsguide.com/class-magazine/read-online/en/2012-05-15/page-11/the-brand-perspective?seen=1[/tpl]  In 1996, he founded Bohemia Beer House Ltd.
