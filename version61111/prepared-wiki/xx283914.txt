==All-star game==

The FCBL's second annual All-Star game was hosted by the Pittsfield Suns at Wahconah Park in Pittsfield, Massachusetts on July 25, 2013.  The format for this year's game had members from the league's 5 Massachusetts teams pitted against players from the league's 4 remaining New England teams.  The Massachusetts All-Stars defeated the New England All-Stars 2-0.

==Postseason==

The postseason expanded again for the 2013 season to include a one-game Play-In round.  The playoff field expanded to six teams as well, where the two teams with the best records would get a bye for the first round. The Play-In game would be played at the home field of the higher seeded team that had the bye, and the 2 series would be a doubleheader.  For example: seed #4 played seed #5 at seed #1's home field, where the winner of the game would then face seed #1.  This game would begin the 3-game series
