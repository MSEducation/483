My Darling Clementine is a 1946 Western filmVariety film review; October 9, 1946, page 14.Harrison's Reports film review; October 12, 1946, page 163. directed by John Ford and starring Henry Fonda as Wyatt Earp during the Gunfight at the OK Corral. The ensemble cast also features Linda Darnell, Victor Mature, Walter Brennan, Tim Holt and Ward Bond.
The title derives from the folk song "Oh My Darling, Clementine", which is the theme song of the movie (sung in parts over the opening and closing credits). The screenplay by Samuel G. Engel and Winston Miller is based on the biography of Wyatt Earp written by Stuart Lake, as were 1934 and 1939 films titled Frontier Marshal. The film incorporated elements from Sam Hellman's screenplay for the 1939 film, which was directed by Alan Dwan. Ford reshot some scenes from the earlier film for My Darling Clementine.

==Plot==

In 1882 (the wrong year is marked on the tombstone of James, since Oct 26th, 1881 was the date of the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral), the Earp brothers (Wyatt, Morgan, Virgil and James) are driving cattle to California when they cross Old Man Clanton, played by Walter Brennan). Told of a nearby town, Tombstone, the older brothers ride in, leaving the youngest brother James to watch over the cattle. The Earps quickly find Tombstone a lawless town. Wyatt is the only man in the town who will face the drunkard Indian shooting at the townspeople. When they return to their camp, they find the cattle rustled and James dead.
Seeking to avenge his brother's murder, Wyatt returns to Tombstone. In order to seek out the perpetrator, he takes the vacant job of town marshal and has several meetings with Doc Holliday and the Clanton gang. During this time, a young woman from Boston named Clementine Carter arrives in town, and is given a room at the same hotel where both Wyatt and Doc Holliday are residing.

==Plot devices==

The final script of the movie varies considerably from historical fact to create additional dramatic conflict and character. Clementine Carter is not a historical person, and in this script appears to be an amalgam of Big Nose Kate and Josephine Earp. Unlike the movie characters, the Earps were never cowboys, drovers, or cattle owners. Important plot devices in the film and personal details about the main characters were all liberally adapted for the movie.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]
Old Man Clanton actually died prior to the gunfight and probably never met any of the Earps. Doc was a dentist, not a surgeon, and survived the shoot out. James Earp, who was the first to die in the story, actually lived until 1926. The key women in Wyatt's and Doc's lives—Wyatt's common law wife Josephine and Doc's common-law wife Big Nose Kate—were not present in Lake's original story and were kept out of the movie as well. The film gives the date of the gunfight as 1882 when it actually occurred in 1881.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]

==Origins==

In 1931, Stuart Lake published the first biography two years after Earp's death.[tpl]cite book |title=Wyatt Earp |first=Michael |last=Goodman| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=E4Bq2Uoi6MgC | page=95 |date= July 30, 2005 |isbn=9781583413395 |publisher=The Creative Company[/tpl] Lake retold the story in the 1946 book My Darling Clementine that Ford bought the rights to. The two books have since been determined to be largely fictionalized stories about the Earp brothers and the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral and their conflict with the outlaw Cowboys Billy Clanton,  Tom McLaury and his brother Frank McLaury. The gunfight was relatively unknown to the American public until Lake published the two books and after the movie was made.[tpl]cite book |title=Wyatt Earp |first=Michael |last=Goodman |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=E4Bq2Uoi6MgC | page=95 |date= July 30, 2005 |accessdate=17 April 2013[/tpl]
Director John Ford said that when he was a prop boy in the early days of silent pictures, Earp would visit pals he knew from his Tombstone days on the sets."I used to give him a chair and a cup of coffee, and he told me about the fight at the O.K. Corral. So in My Darling Clementine, we did it exactly the way it had been.”[tpl]cite web|last=Andrew|first=Paul|title=Wyatt Earp's Last Film|url=http://www.truewestmagazine.com/jcontent/history/history/history-features/4585-wyatt-earps-first-film|publisher=True West Magazine|accessdate=3 May 2013[/tpl][tpl]Cite book  | last1 = Gallagher | first1 = Tag | title = John Ford: the Man and His Films | year = 1986 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=aSzmWVnKc-QC&pg=PA225 | publisher = University of California Press | location = Berkeley  | isbn = 978-0-520-06334-1 | page = 600 |page=234 |deadurl=no |accessdate=27 January 2014[/tpl] Ford was working on his last silent feature Hangman's House in 1928, which included the first credited screen appearances by John Wayne.

In their later years Wyatt and Josephine Earp worked hard to eliminate any mention of Josephine's previous relationship with Johnny Behan or Wyatt's previous common law marriage to Matty Blaylock.  They successfully kept Josephine's name out of Lake's biography of Wyatt and after he died, Josephine threatened to sue the movie producers to keep it that way.[tpl]cite book|last=Rosa|first=Joseph G.|title=The Gunfighter: Man or Myth?|year=1980|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|location=Norman|isbn=978-0-8061-1561-0|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Um4KRtIutecC&lpg=PA156 |page=156|edition=[/tpl][tpl]rp|p101[/tpl] Lake corresponded with Josephine, and he claimed she attempted to influence what he wrote and hamper him in every way possible, including consulting lawyers.

After the movie Gunfight at the O.K. Corral was released in 1957, the shootout came to be known by that name. Since then, the conflict has been portrayed with varying degrees of accuracy in numerous Western films and books.

==Production notes==

Much of the film was shot in Monument Valley, a scenic desert region straddling the Arizona-Utah border used in other John Ford movies.
After seeing a preview screening of the film, 20th Century Fox studio boss Darryl F. Zanuck felt Ford's original cut was too long and had some weak spots, so he had Lloyd Bacon shoot new footage and heavily edited the film. Zanuck had Bacon cut 30 minutes from the film. While Ford's original cut of the film has not survived, a "pre-release" cut – dating from a few months after the preview screening – was discovered in the UCLA film archives; this version preserves some additional footage as well as alternative scoring and editing. UCLA film preservationist Robert Gitt edited a version of the film that incorporates some of the earlier version.[tpl]cite news |title= Unearthing Hollywood Treasures : Movies: The annual extravaganza from UCLA's Film and Television Archive offers a cornucopia of treats.|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-04-05/entertainment/ca-51011_1_film-history |date=April 5, 1995 |last=Turan |first=Kenneth |authorlink=Kenneth Turan |work=The Los Angeles Times[/tpl] Perhaps the most significant change is the film's ending; in Ford's original version, Earp awkwardly shakes hands with Clementine Carter. In the version released in 1946, Earp kisses her on the cheek.[tpl]cite web |last1=Arnold |first1=Jeremy |last2=Steiner |first2=Richard |title=My Darling Clementine(1946) - Home Video Reviews |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/84301/My-Darling-Clementine/home-video-reviews.html |publisher=Turner Classic Movies |deadurl=no |accessdate=27 January 2014[/tpl]

==Critical reception==

At the time of its release, Bosley Crowther lauded the film and wrote, "The eminent director, John Ford, is a man who has a way with a Western like nobody in the picture trade. Seven years ago his classic Stagecoach snuggled very close to fine art in this genre. And now, by George, he's almost matched it with My Darling Clementine...But even with standard Western fiction—and that's what the script has enjoined—Mr. Ford can evoke fine sensations and curiously-captivating moods. From the moment that Wyatt and his brothers are discovered on the wide and dusty range, trailing a herd of cattle to a far-off promised land, a tone of pictorial authority is struck—and it is held. Every scene, every shot is the product of a keen and sensitive eye—an eye which has deep comprehension of the beauty of rugged people and a rugged world".[tpl] cite news |last=Crowther |first=Bosley |publisher=The New York Times Film Review |title=Darling Clementine With Henry Fonda as Marshal of Tombstone, a Stirring Film of West |date=December 4, 1946 |url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E06E4DF173BE033A05757C0A9649D946793D6CF |accessdate=28 January 2008[/tpl]
Variety magazine wrote, "Trademark of John Ford's direction is clearly stamped on the film with its shadowy lights, softly contrasted moods and measured pace, but a tendency is discernible towards stylization for the sake of stylization. At several points, the pic comes to a dead stop to let Ford go gunning for some arty effect".Variety. Film review, 1946. Retrieved 27 January 2014.

In 1991, the film was deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry; the film is among the first 75 films entered into the registry. 50 years after its release, Roger Ebert reviewed the film and included it in his list of "Great Movies".[tpl]cite web |last=Ebert |first=Roger |title=My Darling Clementine |date=October 26, 1997 |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-my-darling-clementine-1946[/tpl]
In 2004, Matt Bailey summarized the film and its significance, writing "If there is one film that deserves every word of praise ever uttered or written about it, it is John Ford’s My Darling Clementine. Perhaps the greatest film in a career full of great films, arguably the finest achievement in a rich and magnificent genre, and undoubtedly the best version of one of America’s most enduring myths, the film is an undeniable and genuine classic."[tpl]cite web |title=My Darling Clementine |last=Bailey |first=Matt |work=Not Coming to a Theater Near You |date=July 11, 2004 |url=http://www.notcoming.com/reviews/mydarlingclementine/[/tpl]
