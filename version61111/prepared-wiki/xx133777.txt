Production activity has been generally concentrated in two regions, South and Central Florida (Orlando and Tampa).  The South Florida region is famous for large projects like Jerry Bruckheimer's Bad Boys film series and Neal Moritz' 2 Fast 2 Furious. The Central Florida area has recently been featured in The Punisher starring John Travolta and Adam Sandler's The Waterboy.
The State of Florida has a long film history thanks to its year-round sunshine and moderate climate.  Film classics were filmed throughout the state, such as Moon Over Miami (1941) and Esther Williams' Easy to Love (1953).

==Orlando==

In the early 1990s Orlando experienced a great boom in film production. The construction of the Disney-MGM Studios and Universal Studios production facilities attracted many filmmakers to the area. Films like Ron Howard's Parenthood and syndicated television shows like The Adventures of Superboy lead the pack. Soon, the Steven Spielberg series seaQuest DSV and Tom Hank's From the Earth to the Moon called Florida home. During this period Orlando acquired the nickname "Hollywood East" because of its surging film industry.
Just as film production appeared to be on the decline in Florida, the phenomenal success of 1998's The Blair Witch Project has led to another boom. While Blair Witch was filmed in Maryland, its entire film crew and director were University of Central Florida film school graduates. This cult independent film has led to a new wave of film production for the area.
