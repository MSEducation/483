The Loren L. Chadwick Cottages are two cottages in Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States, in the Linden Hills neighborhood situated roughly south of Lake Calhoun and northwest of Lake Harriet.  This area of Minneapolis was platted in 1882-83 as "Cottage City" by a local real estate developer, Louis Menage.  He platted small lots of [tpl]convert|25|ft[/tpl] wide, as opposed to the normal lot width of [tpl]convert|40|ft[/tpl], in an effort to attract people who wanted to build summer lake cottages.[tpl]cite book |last=Millett |first=Larry |authorlink=Larry Millett |title=AIA Guide to the Twin Cities: The Essential Source on the Architecture of Minneapolis and St. Paul |year=2007 |publisher=Minnesota Historical Society Press |location= |isbn=0-87351-540-4 |pages=p. 244[/tpl]
Loren L. Chadwick built these two cottages in 1902 at a cost of $300 each.  They were small, measuring [tpl]convert|16|ft[/tpl] by [tpl]convert|30|ft[/tpl], and had screened porches to take advantage of summer breezes from the nearby lakes.  The two cottages were rented out as summer homes for more than a decade before they were bought by individual owners.  In 1972, a new owner joined the two cottages with an addition on the rear.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ci.minneapolis.mn.us/hpc/landmarks/40th_St_W_2617_Chadwick_Cottages.asp|title=Chadwick Cottages|publisher=Minneapolis Heritage Preservation Commission|accessdate=2008-05-20[/tpl]  The cottages were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.  They are significant because although their design is simple, their survival demonstrates a good example of cottage architecture in Minneapolis. Despite their simplicity, the cottages have Carpenter Gothic detailing on the vergeboards of their gable and porch roofs.
