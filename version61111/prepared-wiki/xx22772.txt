In 1994, Keys met long-term manager Jeff Robinson after she enrolled in his brother's after-school program.[tpl]cite web |url=http://mycrains.crainsnewyork.com/40under40/profiles/2003/32 |title=New York's Rising Stars |publisher= Crain's New York Business|year= 2003 |accessdate=November 15, 2010[/tpl] The following year Robinson introduced Keys to her future A&R at Arista Records, Peter Edge, who later described his first impressions to HitQuarters: "I had never met a young R&B artist with that level of musicianship. So many people were just singing on top of loops and tracks, but she had the ability, not only to be part of hip-hop, but also to go way beyond that."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Peter_Edge_Inter.html |title=Interview with Peter Edge |publisher=HitQuarters|date=October 13, 2004 |accessdate=November 15, 2010[/tpl] Edge helped Robinson create a showcase for Keys and also got involved in developing her demo material. He was keen to sign Keys himself but was unable to do so at that time due to being on the verge of leaving his present record company. Keys signed to Columbia Records soon after. At the same time as signing a recording contract with Columbia Records, Keys was accepted into Columbia University. At first, Keys attempted to manage both, but after a month, she dropped out of college to pursue her musical career full-time.[tpl]cite journal|year=2004|title=New Singer Alicia Keys Sitting Pretty with Smash Debut Album 'Songs In A Minor'|journal=Jet|volume=100|issue=9|pages=60–61|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|url=http://books.google.com/?id=IbUDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA58&dq=alicia+keys+songs+in+a+minor#PPA60,M1|accessdate=April 30, 2009[/tpl]
Keys signed a demo deal with Jermaine Dupri and So So Def Recordings, where she appeared on the label's Christmas album performing "The Little Drummer Girl". She also co-wrote and recorded a song titled "Dah Dee Dah (Sexy Thing)", which appeared on the soundtrack to the 1997 film, Men in Black. The song was Keys' first professional recording; however, it was never released as a single and her record contract with Columbia ended after a dispute with the label. Keys was unhappy with the label because her career had stalled during her two years under contract at Columbia due to executive indecision over her direction and major changes within the company. Keys called Clive Davis, who sensed a "special, unique" artist from her performance and signed her to Arista Records, which later disbanded. Keys almost chose Wilde as her stage name until her manager suggested the name Keys after a dream he had. Keys felt that name represented her both as a performer and person.[tpl]cite web|last=Vineyard|first=Chloe|date=January 18, 2006|title=Alicia Keys Nearly Spills Secrets To Jane|work=MTV News|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1521106/20060118/keys_alicia.jhtml|accessdate=March 7, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080311171739/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1521106/20060118/keys_alicia.jhtml?| archivedate= March 11, 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Following Davis to his newly formed J Records label, she worked with Kerry "Krucial" Brothers and recorded the songs "Rock wit U" and "Rear View Mirror", which were featured on the soundtracks to the films Shaft (2000) and Dr. Dolittle 2 (2001), respectively.[tpl]cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fm20011003a2.html|title=Alicia Keys: 'Songs in A Minor'|last=Brasor|first=Philip|date=October 3, 2001|work=The Japan Times|accessdate=February 26, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r536187|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|title=Dr. Dolittle 2 – Overview|last=Birchmeier|first=Jason |work=Allmusic|accessdate=November 2, 2010[/tpl]
