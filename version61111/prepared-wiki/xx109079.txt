In archaeology Vorbasse is well known for its large scale excavations of a settlement that had existed from the 1st century BC to the 11th century AD. The settlement consisted of a number of identical farms spread along a central street. The farm buildings, each set within its own large enclosure, contained a long house  with generally sloping stone walls built without mortar and several smaller surrounding annexes. The roof of the long house tended to be curved with the centre being higher than the ends.Neveux, Francois.  The Normans, p.11.  Constable & Robinson Ltd.
