Chernivtsi ([tpl]lang-uk|Чернівці́[/tpl], [tpl]IPA|/t͡ʃerniu̯ˈt͡sʲi/[/tpl]; see also other names) is a city in western Ukraine, situated on the upper course of the River Prut. Chernivtsi is the administrative center of Chernivtsi Oblast (province) - the northern, Ukrainian part of the historical Moldavian region of Bukovina. At the time of the 2001 Ukrainian Census, the population of the city was 240,600.[tpl]Wayback |date=20051226110246 |url=http://ukrcensus.gov.ua/eng/results/general/estimate/Chernivtsi/ |title=About number and composition population of CHERNIVTSI REGION by data All-Ukrainian Population Census '2001[/tpl]
Together with the city of Lviv, Chernivtsi is viewed at present to be a cultural center of western Ukraine. The city is also considered one of modern Ukraine's greatest cultural, educational and architectural centers. Historically in that role, Chernivtsi was even dubbed "Little Vienna,"[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.day.kiev.ua/126685/|title=Bukovyna Week in Austria|accessdate=2007-09-26|author=|date=Zhytariuk, Natalia|work=Den[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ukrcognita.com.ua/eng/western/170/?ch=595e8574c|title=Bukovina.

The city is also a major point of railway and highway crossings in the region, and houses an international airport.

==Name==

Aside from Ukrainian, Chernivtsi is also known by many different names, which were used during times of rule by different countries throughout the city's history, or by the respective population groups at the time: [tpl]lang-ro|Cernăuți[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-de|Czernowitz[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-pl|Czerniowce[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-hu|Csernovic[/tpl], [tpl]lang-ru|Черновцы́[/tpl], translit. Chernovtsy (until 1944: Чернови́цы, translit. Chernovitsy). In the times of Halych-Volyn Principality the city's name was Chern.

==History==

Archeological evidence discovered in the area surrounding Chernivtsi indicates that a population inhabited it since the Neolithic era. Later settlements included those of the Cucuteni-Trypillian culture,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wumag.kiev.ua/index2.php?param=pgs20043/34|title=Trypillya — a culture that was contemporaneous with Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia|accessdate=2007-09-27|work=Welcome to Ukraine[/tpl] the Corded Ware culture; artifacts from the Bronze and Iron Ages were also found in the city.
A fortified settlement located on the left (north-eastern) shore of Prut dates back to the time of the Principality of Halych and is thought to have been built by Grand Prince Yaroslav Osmomysl.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.komkon.org/~sher/chern/hist.html|title=City of Chernivtsi – History|accessdate=2007-09-25|work=The Komkon Site[/tpl] Legendary accounts refer to this fortress-city as Chern’, or Black city; it is said to owe its name to the black color of the city walls, built from dark oak layered with local black-colored soil.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.city.cv.ua/English/History/|title=History|accessdate=2007-09-25|work=Chernivtsi City Official Site[/tpl] This early stronghold was destroyed during the Mongol invasion of Europe by the Burundai in 1259. However, the remaining ramparts of the fortress were still used for defense purposes; in the 17th century they were augmented with several bastions, one of which is still extant.
Following the destruction of the fortress, later settlements in the area centered on the right (south-western) shore of the Prut River, at a more strategically advantageous, elevated location. In 1325, when Kingdom of Poland seized control of Galicia, and came into contact with the early Vlach (Romanian) feudal formations, a fort was mentioned under the name Țețina; it was defending the ford and crossing point on the Prut River. It was part of a group of three fortifications, the other two being the fortress of Hotin on the Dniester to the east, and a fort on the Kolachin River, an upriver tributary of Prut.
Between 1359 and 1775, the city and its surroundings were part of the Principality of Moldavia; the city being the administrative center of the homonymous ţinut (county).[tpl]ro[/tpl] Cetatea Ţeţina – Cernăuţi, Astra, 3 (13), 1998 The name Cernăuţi/Chernivtsi is first attested in a document by Alexander the Good on October 8, 1408.[tpl]ro[/tpl]Cernăuţi-600 de ani de atestare documentară internă, Astra, 4 (54), 2008, p.3 In Ottoman sources, the city was mentioned as "Çernovi".
In 1775, the northwestern part of the territory of Moldavia was annexed by the Habsburg Empire; this region became known as Bukovina. The city became the region's capital, which in 1849 was raised in status and became known as the Duchy of Bukovina, a crownland of the Austrian Empire. The city received Magdeburg rights.[tpl]cite web |url=http://heraldry.com.ua/index.php3?lang=E&context=info&id=1155 |title=Chernivtsi|accessdate=2007-09-25|work=Ukrainian heraldy[/tpl] The city began to flourish in 1778 when Knight Karl von Enzenberg was appointed the chief of the Military Administration. He invited many merchants, craftsmen and entrepreneurs to help develop trade and other businesses. Saint Peter's Fairs (July 1–15) had given a new vibrant impulse to the market development from 1786. In the late 19th century the German language—due to the Habsburgian and the very important Jewish influence—became the lingua franca and more and more newspapers were edited in German, also a remarkable literary production in German began in this period, featuring most prominently Karl Emil Franzos.Ion Lihaciu, Czernowitz 1848-1948.

During the 19th and early 20th century, Chernivtsi became a center of both Romanian and Ukrainian national movements. In 1908, it was the site of the first Yiddish language conference, the Czernowitz Conference, coordinated by Nathan Birnbaum. When Austria-Hungary dissolved in 1918, the city and its surrounding area became part of the Kingdom of Romania.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9017989/Bukovina |title=Bukovina|accessdate=2007-09-26|work=Encyclopædia Britannica[/tpl] In 1930, the city reached a population of 112,400: 26.8% Jews, 23.2% Romanians, 20.8% Germans, 18.6% Ukrainians, the remainder Poles and others. It was one of the five university centers of interwar Romania.
In 1940, the Red Army occupied the area; the area around the city became known as Chernivtsi Oblast, and was allotted to the Ukrainian SSR by the Soviet Union. The city's large Romanian intelligentsia found refuge in Romania; while the Bukovina Germans were repatriated according to a Soviet-Nazi agreement. This prompted Romania to switch from an ally of France and Britain to one of Nazi Germany; in July 1941, the Romanian Army retook the city as part of the Axis attack on the Soviet Union during World War II. In August 1941, Romanian military dictator Ion Antonescu ordered the creation of a ghetto in the lowland part of the city, where 50,000 Bukovina Jews were crammed, two-thirds of whom would be deported to Transnistria in October 1941 and partly in early 1942, where the majority perished. Romanian mayor of the city Traian Popovici managed to persuade Antonescu to raise the number of Jews exempted from deportation from 200 to 20,000.
In 1944, when Axis forces were driven out by the Red Army, the city was reincorporated into the Ukrainian SSR. Over the following years, most of the Jews left for Israel; the city was an important node in the Berihah network. Bukovina Poles were also repatriated by the Soviets after World War II. The city became a predominantly Ukrainian one.
Since 1991, Chernitvtsi has been a part of independent Ukraine. In May 1999, Romania opened a consulate general in the city. Contemporary Chernivtsi is an important regional center, which is situated on the picturesque banks of the Prut River and occupies an area of about [tpl]convert|150|km2|sqmi[/tpl].

==Demographics==

According to the latest All-Ukrainian population census in 2001, the population of Chernivtsi was approximately 240,600 people of 65 nationalities.  Among them, 189,000 (79.8%) are Ukrainians; 26,700 (11.3%) Russians; 10,500 (4.4%) Romanians; 3,800 (1.6%) Moldovans; 1,400 (0.6%) Polish; 1,300 (0.6%) Jews; 2,900 (1.2%) other nationalities.
Based on the last available Soviet data, the population of the city, as of January 1, 1989, was approximately 295,000 residents. Among these, there are some 172,000 Ukrainians, 46,000 Russians, 16,000 Romanians, 13,000 Moldovans, 7,000 Poles and others.
The Romanian population in Chernivtsi started decreasing rapidly after 1950. Many Romanians fled to Romania or were deported to Siberia (where most of them died), and the remaining Romanian population quickly became a minority and assimilated with the majority. Nowadays, the Romanian minority in Chernivtsi is still decreasing as a result of cultural assimilation and emigration to Romania.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]
Chernivtsi once had a Jewish community of over 50,000, less than a third of whom survived World War II. Romanian lawyer and reserve officer Theodor Criveanu, as well as the then city mayor Traian Popovici, supported by General Vasile Ionescu saved 19,689 Jewish people. Initially, Governor of Bukovina Corneliu Calotescu allowed only 190 Jewish people to stay, but Traian Popovici, after an incredible effort, obtained from the then dictator of Romania Marshal Ion Antonescu an allowance of 20,000.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www1.yadvashem.org/about_yad/press_room/press_releases/07.08.07.html|title=Righteous Among the Nations Ceremony from Romania Tomorrow |accessdate=2009-04-21|work=Yad Vashem[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] After World War II, the city was a key node in the Berihah network, which helped Jews to emigrate to the then Mandate Palestine from the difficult conditions after the War. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the majority of the remaining Jewish population emigrated to Israel and the United States. A famous member of this latter emigration is the actress Mila Kunis.Міла Куніс зіграє у трилері "Чорний лебідь", Gazeta.ua (August 13, 2009) [tpl]uk icon[/tpl]
Chernivtsi was inhabited by Ukrainians, Romanians, Poles, Ruthenians, Jews, Roma, and Germans. During its affiliation with the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, Chernivtsi enjoyed prosperity and culture as the capital of the Bukovina crown land. After the World War II, the Shoah and Porajmos, and the resettlement and expulsion of the whole ethnic groups, including Germans and Romanians, this status was diminished. Today, the Ukrainians are the dominant population group.
Chernivtsi's change in demographic diversity is demonstrated by the following population statistics. Once, Romanians and Ukrainians formed the majority of the population. However, after 1870, Yiddish- or German-speaking Jews surpassed the Romanians as the largest population group of the town. After 1880, the Ukrainians surpassed the Romanians as the second largest population group.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]
