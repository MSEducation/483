No Heavy Petting is the fifth studio album by the British rock band UFO, released in 1976. It is the first UFO album to feature a full-time keyboard player as a member of the band, making this their first record as a five-piece band. While keyboardist Danny Peyronel only stayed in the band for this one album, he did co-write several tracks on the record. 
In 1994, a CD including this album and Lights Out was released by BGO Records. Like many CDs in the UFO catalogue, it was remastered and reissued with bonus tracks in 2007.
