Ghettotech (also known as Detroit club music or Chicago club music) is a form of electronic music originating from Detroit and Chicago. It combines elements of Chicago's ghetto house with electro, glitch, hip hop and techno. It is usually faster than most other dance music genres, at roughly 145 to 170 bpm, and sometimes features pornographic lyrics. As DJ Godfather puts it, "the beats are really gritty, really raw, nothing polished."XLR8R TV Episode 13: Detroit Ghettotech. 14 Aug. 2007. .
Ghettotech was born as a DJing style, inspired by the eclecticism of The Electrifying Mojo and the fast-paced mixing and turntablism of The Wizard, with DJs mixing genres including grime, ghetto house, electro, glitch, hip hop and Detroit techno. The general BPM of the music's mixing style increased over time. Moving into 2011, ghettotech is finding a strong resurgence, tech house being an influence.
Ghettotech is an integral part of the Detroit Electronic Music Festival, an annual event. A Detroit ghettotech style of dancing is called the jit. It is an improvisational dance that mainly centers around the fast movement of the feet. Chicago's equivalent dance style is Juke, where the focus is on the footwork dating back to the late 1980s.XLR8R TV Episode 13: Detroit Ghettotech. 14 Aug. 2007. .
