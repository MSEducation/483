Under the Canadian constitution, the power to establish criminal law and rules of investigation and trying crimes is vested in the federal government. The provinces are responsible for law enforcement (although provincial policing in many jurisdictions is contracted to the federal and national Royal Canadian Mounted Police), and while the power to prosecute offences belongs to the federal government, responsibility for prosecutions is delegated to the provinces for most types of criminal offences. Laws and sentencing guidelines are uniform throughout the country, but provinces vary in their level of enforcement.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2009[/tpl]

==Statistics Canada data==

There were 2,452,787 crimes reported in 2006; 48% were property related crimes and 12.6% were violent crimes.  At a rate of 7,518 reported incidents per 100,000 people, the crime rate in 2006, the latest year for which there is statistics, was the lowest crime rate in twenty-five years.85-002-XIE2007005.indd The crime rate has been in general decline since 1991.
The province with the lowest crime rate in 2006 was for the third straight year Ontario with 5,689 per 100,000, followed by Quebec with 5,909 per 100,000.  The province with the highest crime rate for the 9th straight year was Saskatchewan with 13,711 per 100,000.   Regina is the city with the highest crime rate followed by its provincial counterpart Saskatoon.  Quebec City, Trois-Rivi√®res, and Saguenay have the lowest crime rates of any city and are all located in Quebec.Statistics Canada Daily Winnipeg has had the highest violent crime rate since 2009 and still holds it in 2012. The three northern territories have higher per capita crime rates than any province.  As evidenced by the crime map above right, Saskatchewan has a higher crime rate than the other Canadian provinces, but lower than the territories.
The number of murders dropped to 594 in 2007, 12 fewer than the previous year. One-third of the 2007 murders were stabbings and another third were by firearm. In 2007, there were 190 stabbings and 188 shootings. Handguns were used in two-thirds of all firearm murders. Seventy-four youths were accused of murder, down 11 from the previous year. About eighty-four percent of murders were done by someone known to the victim. Male victims of homicide were most likely to be killed by an acquaintance, someone known to them through a criminal relationship, or a stranger. Female victims of homicide were most frequently killed by a current or former intimate partner, or another family member. The province with the highest crime rate was Manitoba while the lowest crime rates occurred in Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador.
Police reported criminal violence is thought to be an undercount of actual violence rates.  Thus approximately every five years statistics Canada conducts a survey of victimization in Canada.  The last General Social Survey conducted was in 2004, where 24,000 people were contacted by telephone: 106 reported incidents of violence per 1,000 polled, which is slightly lower than in 1999 when it was 111 per 1,000 polled.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/89-630-x/2008001/article/10643-eng.pdf|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/66DcS2CgG|archivedate=2012-03-16|deadurl=no|format=PDF|title=Violent victimization in Canada|first1=Robyn|last1=Brazeau|first2=Jodi-Anne|last2=Brzozowski|page=1|publisher=Statistics Canada[/tpl]

Of the provinces, Saskatchewan has the highest violent crime rate.  The chart below also shows that Saskatchewan has the highest murder rate and sexual assault rate of any Canadian province.
2006 crime statistics for the provinces and territories are given below, as reported by Statistics Canada.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/legal04a.htm |title= Canadian Crime Data 2006| publisher= Statistics Canada| accessdate=2008-03-25 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080307034240/http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/legal04a.htm |archivedate = March 7, 2008[/tpl]  last updated: 28 February 2007

==Guns==

Gun ownership rates in Canada are approximately the average for the developed countries (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)), and far below those of the United States. Approximately 15.5% of Canadian households owned firearms in 2004-2005, including 2.9% that owned handguns; these rates are similar to the averages for the OECD (14.2% and 3.4%, respectively), whereas nearly three times as many American households (42.8%) own firearms, and nearly six times as many (17.6%) own handguns.[tpl]cite book|last=van Dijk|first=Jan|title=Criminal Victimisation in International Perspective: Key findings from the 2004-2005 ICVS and EU ICS|year=2007|publisher=Wetenschappelijk Onderzoeken Documentatiecentrum|location=Den Haag, The Netherlands|isbn=978 90 5454 965 9|pages=279|url=http://www.unicri.it/documentation_centre/publications/icvs/_pdf_files/ICVS2004_05report.pdf|coauthors=John van Kesteren Paul Smit|accessdate=20 December 2012[/tpl]   Typically, the firearm ownership rate in rural areas is much higher than in urban areas, and higher in western Canada than in the east. The majority of Canadian firearms include rifles, shotguns, and pistols. Firearms are readily available to licensed Canadian citizens, with restrictions on handguns. Fully automatic firearms are an exception and are generally prohibited from private ownership.
It is effectively illegal to carry concealed handguns in Canada. There is a permithttp://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cfp-pcaf/form-formulaire/pdfs/680-eng.pdf that allows people to carry if they can prove they need to protect their lives under specific circumstances, but the permit is very rarely issued to civilians. The topic of Authorization To Carry (ATC) permits has been a long standing topic of issue among legal firearm owners in Canada. The Canadian Association for Self Defensehttp://www.casd.ca and the National Firearms Associationhttp://www.nfa.ca are lobbying for an amendment to the Canadian Firearms Act to enable law abiding citizens to more easily attain ATC permits.http://www.canadacarry.org/subdream/index.php?categoryid=74.
