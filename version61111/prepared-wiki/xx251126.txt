[[Artelon]]

CATEGORIES: Biomedical engineering

Artelon is a biomaterial developed and sold by the Swedish company Artimplant. Artelon is a porous polyurethaneurea and acts as a scaffold which promotes ingrowth of native human tissue. Artelon degrades over a period of around 5â€“7 years during which time most of the material is replaced by native human tissue. Artelon's intended use includes resurfacing of joint surfaces (e.g. osteoarthritis, Hallux rigidus) and reinforcement and augmentation of tissue repair ( e.g. ligaments, tendons, general soft tissues).
