[[Achsah]]

CATEGORIES: Hebrew Bible people

Achsah ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|k|s|ə[/tpl]; Hebrew: עַכְסָה) - "anklet", was Caleb ben Yefune's only daughter (1 Chr. 2:49). She was offered in marriage to the man who would lead an attack on the city of Debir, also called Kirjath-sepher/Kirjath-sannah. This was done by Othniel, Caleb's brother's son, who accordingly obtained her as his wife (Joshua 15:16-19; Judges 1:9-15). 
Achsah later requested, and was given, upper and lower springs of water (presumably in the Negev) from her father. (Judges 1:14-15)
