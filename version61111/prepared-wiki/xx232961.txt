Hays selected scientists who were members of the ABA. The purpose of the commission was "to investigate  all proper means" of influencing heredity to "better the race". It aimed to increase "families of good blood" and to discourage the "vicious elements in the cross-bred American civilization."[tpl]cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9F06E7D6113EE733A25753C2A9639C946797D6CF |author=The New York Times |title=The "Heredity Commission." |date=May 20, 1906 |work=The New York Times[/tpl] The commission was also asked to study if "a new species of human being could be consciously evolved."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bookbrowse.com/author_interviews/full/index.cfm?author_number=1262|title=Author Interview |author=Harry Bruinius |accessdate=October 7, 2008 [/tpl]
