The Te Huka Geothermal Power Station, also known as Tauhara One, is a 23Â MW binary cycle geothermal power station situated near Taupo, New Zealand. The power station is operated by Contact Energy.
In July 2008, Contact Energy announced that the contract for supply and construction of the binary cycle equipment was awarded to Ormat Technologies.[tpl]cite press release|url=http://www.contactenergy.co.nz/web/view?page=/contentiw/pages/mediaandpublications/pressreleases/2007/2007-11-19-contactconfirmsbinarygeothermalplant&vert=mp|title=Contact confirms geothermal binary plant|publisher=Contact Energy|date=19 November 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite press release|url=http://www.contactenergy.co.nz/web/view?page=/contentiw/pages/mediaandpublications/pressreleases/2008/2008-07-01-centennialdrivebinaryupdate&vert=mp|title=Centennial Drive binary update|publisher=Contact Energy|date=1 July 2008[/tpl]
The plant is powered with steam and fluid from the Tauhara steamfield, and all used geothermal fluid is reinjected back into the edge of the steamfield. A 33,000-volt line connects the power station to Transpower's Wairakei substation, injecting the station's electricity into bothUnison's Taupo distribution network and the national grid.
The Tauhara One plant was opened in May 2010, three weeks ahead of schedule.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&objectid=10647323|title=Geothermal power station opens early|date=25 May 2010|publisher=NZ Herald[/tpl]
