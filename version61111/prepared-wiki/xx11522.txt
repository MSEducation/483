[tpl]hobby-mag-stub[/tpl][tpl]rpg-stub[/tpl]Valkyrie was a UK role-playing magazine published by Partisan Press and edited originally by Dave Renton (original editor of Role Player Independent) and then taken over by Jay Forster.
Some claimed that it was the successor to White Dwarf amongst the UK role-playing community with numerous contributors from across the hobby, including Phil Masters and Marcus Rowland.  
It was resurrected as a quarterly with issue 19 and ran for several years before ceasing publication with issue 28.
