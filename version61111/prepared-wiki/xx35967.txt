Nichelle Nichols (née Grace Dell Nichols on December 28, 1932) is an American actress, singer and voice artist. She sang with Duke Ellington and Lionel Hampton before turning to acting. Nichols' most famous role is that of communications officer Lieutenant Uhura aboard the USS Enterprise in the popular Star Trek television series (1966-1969), as well as the succeeding motion pictures, where her character was eventually promoted in Starfleet to the rank of commander. Her Star Trek character was groundbreaking in U.S society at the time, and civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. personally praised her work on the show and asked her to remain when she was considering leaving the series.

==Early life==

Nichols was born in Robbins, Illinois, near Chicago, to Samuel Earl Nichols, a factory worker who was both the town mayor of Robbins and its chief magistrate, and his wife Lishia (Parks) Nichols.Nichelle Nichols Biography (1933-) Later, the family moved into an apartment in Chicago.
She studied in Chicago as well as New York and Los Angeles. Her break came in an appearance in Kicks and Co., Oscar Brown's highly touted, but ill-fated 1961 musical.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/shows/cast.php?showid=8651#content|title=Kicks and Co.

Although the play closed after its brief try-out in Chicago, in an ironic twist, she attracted the attention of Hugh Hefner, the publisher of Playboy, who was so impressed with her appearance that he booked her immediately at his Chicago Playboy Club.[tpl]cite journal |editor1-first=John H. |editor1-last=Johnson |date=January 1962 |title=Satirical flop brings star success |journal=Ebony |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=41–42, 44, 46–47 |publisher=Johnson Publishing Company, Inc. |location=Chicago, Illinois [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last=Still |first=Larry |editor1-first=John H. |editor1-last=Johnson |editor1-link= |date=October 12, 1961 |title=Oscar Brown musical gets warm reception in windy city |journal=Jet |volume=20 |issue=25 |pages=58–61 |publisher=Johnson Publishing Company, Inc. |location=Chicago, Illinois [/tpl] While still in Chicago, she performed at the "Blue Angel", and in New York, Nichols appeared at that city's Blue Angel as a dancer and singer.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl] She also appeared in the role of Carmen for a Chicago stock company production of Carmen Jones and performed in a New York production of Porgy and Bess.

Prior to being cast as Lieutenant Uhura in Star Trek, Nichols was a guest actress on television producer Gene Roddenberry's first series The Lieutenant (1964) in an episode, "To Set It Right," which dealt with racial prejudice.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.paleycenter.org/collection/item/?q=john&p=423&item=T78:0377|title=LIEUTENANT, THE: TO SET IT RIGHT (TV)|publisher=The Paley Center for Media|accessdate=1 September 2013[/tpl]

==Star Trek==

On Star Trek, Nichols gained popular recognition by being one of the first black women featured in a major television series not portraying a servant; her prominent supporting role as a bridge officer was unprecedented. During the first year of the series, Nichols was tempted to leave the show, as she wanted to pursue a Broadway career; however, a conversation with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., changed her mind. She has said that King personally encouraged her to stay on the show, telling her that he was a big fan of the series. He said she "could not give up" because she was playing a vital role model for black children and young women across the country, as well as for other children who would see blacks appearing as equals.

Former NASA astronaut Mae Jemison has cited Nichols' role of Lieutenant Uhura as her inspiration for wanting to become an astronaut and Whoopi Goldberg has also spoken of Nichols' influence.http://transporting.to/CyberWoman/whoopi.html Whoopi Goldberg interview on Star Trek DVD Goldberg asked for a role on Star Trek: The Next Generation,[tpl]cite interview |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/st/interviews/nichols/printpage.html |last=Nichols |first=Nichelle |interviewer=BBC Cult Television |callsign=BBC |date=April 7, 2002 |accessdate=April 1, 2007[/tpl] and the character of Guinan was specially created, while Jemison appeared in an episode of the series.
In her role as Lieutenant Uhura, Nichols famously kissed white actor William Shatner as Captain James T. Kirk in the November 22, 1968, Star Trek episode "Plato's Stepchildren".  The episode is popularly cited as the first example of an inter-racial kiss on United States television.http://www.tvguide.com/news/shattered-tv-taboos-1005496.aspxhttp://www.space.com/entertainment/060907_star_trek.htmlhttp://www.trektoday.com/news/050901_05.shtml  The Shatner-Nichols kiss was seen as groundbreaking, even though the kiss was portrayed as having been forced by alien telekinesis. There was some praise and some protest. In her 1994 autobiography, Beyond Uhura, Star Trek and Other Memories, on page 197 Nichols cites a letter from one white Southerner who wrote: "I am totally opposed to the mixing of the races. However, any time a red-blooded American boy like Captain Kirk gets a beautiful dame in his arms that looks like Uhura, he ain't gonna fight it." During the Comedy Central Roast of Shatner on August 20, 2006, Nichols jokingly referred to the groundbreaking moment and said, "Let's make TV history again ... and you can kiss my black ass!"
Despite the cancellation of the series in 1969, Star Trek lived on in other ways, and continued to play a part in Nichols' life. She again provided the voice of Uhura in Star Trek: The Animated Series; in one episode, "The Lorelei Signal", Uhura assumes command of the Enterprise. Nichols noted in her autobiography her frustration over this never occurring in the original series. Nichols has co-starred in six Star Trek motion pictures, the last one being Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country.
