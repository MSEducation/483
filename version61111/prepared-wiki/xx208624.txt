</ref> In 1953 his experimental confirmation of the existence of the transition radiation, which was predicted by [[Vitaly Ginzburg|Ginzburg]] and [[Ilya Frank]] in 1945, and the effect of decreasing ionization losses for narrow electron-positron pairs, known as the  ''Chudakov Effect'', are among Chudakov's famous works. Phenomena similar to Chudakov Effect have been observed in [[quantum chromodynamics]] also.<br>Chudakov was the author of series of experiments carried out in the 1950s, which focused on investigation of the [[cosmic rays]] outside of the [[atmosphere]] with rockets and first [[satellites]]. As a result, during the [[Sputnik 3|third Soviet sputnik]], he discovered the [[Van Allen radiation belt|Earth's radiation belts]] in collaboration with S. N. Vernov.<ref name="imt">

In 1961 Chudakov and G. T. Zatsepin suggested the air Chernkov method for the gamma-ray astronomy and carried out a pioneering experiment at Katsively, Crimea. 
From the mid-1960s Chudakov headed the design and construction of the Baksan Underground Scintillation Telescope, which was put into operation in 1978 and considered to be one of the first large multipurpose facilities for underground physics. In astroparticle physics the first class results have been obtained with this telescope which is still in operation.[ref]
