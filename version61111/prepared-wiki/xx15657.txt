The Himalayas, or Himalaya, ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˌ|h|ɪ|m|ə|ˈ|l|eɪ|.|ə[/tpl] or [tpl]IPAc-en|h|ɪ|ˈ|m|ɑː|l|ə|j|ə[/tpl]; Sanskrit, hima (snow) + ālaya (dwelling), literally, "abode of the snow"[tpl]cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/view/entry/m_en_gb0378930#m_en_gb0378930|title=Definition of Himalayas|work=Oxford Dictionaries Online|accessdate=9 May 2011[/tpl]) is a mountain range in Asia separating the plains of the Indian subcontinent from the Tibetan Plateau.
The Himalayan range is home to the planet's highest peaks, including the highest, Mount Everest.  The Himalayas include over a hundred mountains exceeding [tpl]Convert|7200|m|ft[/tpl] in elevation.  By contrast, the highest peak outside Asia – Aconcagua, in the Andes – is [tpl]Convert|6961|m|ft[/tpl] tall. The Himalayas have profoundly shaped the cultures of South Asia. Many Himalayan peaks are sacred in both Buddhism and Hinduism.
Besides the Greater Himalayas of these high peaks there are parallel lower ranges.  The first foothills, reaching about a thousand meters along the northern edge of the plains, are called the Sivalik Hills or Sub-Himalayan Range. Further north is a higher range reaching two to three thousand meters known as the Lower Himalayan or Himachal or Mahabharat Range.
The Himalayas abut or cross six countries: Bhutan, India, Nepal, China, Afghanistan and Pakistan, with the first three countries having sovereignty over most of the range.[tpl]cite web|last=Bishop|first=Barry|authorlink=Barry Bishop (mountaineer)|title=Himalayas (mountains, Asia)|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/266037/Himalayas|accessdate=1 October 2012[/tpl] The Himalayas are bordered on the northwest by the Karakoram and Hindu Kush ranges, on the north by the Tibetan Plateau, and on the south by the Indo-Gangetic Plain.
Three of the world's major rivers, the Indus, the Ganges and the Tsangpo-Brahmaputra, all rise near Mount Kailash and cross and encircle the Himalayas.  Their combined drainage basin is home to some 600 million people.
Lifted by the collision of the Indian tectonic plate with the Eurasian Plate, the Himalayan range runs, west-northwest to east-southeast, in an arc [tpl]Convert|2400|km|mi[/tpl] long.  Its western anchor, Nanga Parbat, lies just south of the northernmost bend of Indus river, its eastern anchor, Namcha Barwa, just west of the great bend of the Tsangpo river.  The range varies in width from [tpl]Convert|400|km|mi[/tpl] in the west to   [tpl]Convert|150|km|mi[/tpl] in the east.

==Ecology==

The flora and fauna of the Himalayas vary with climate, rainfall, altitude, and soils. The climate ranges from tropical at the base of the mountains to permanent ice and snow at the highest elevations. The amount of yearly rainfall increases from west to east along the southern front of the range. This diversity of altitude, rainfall and soil conditions combined with the very high snow line supports a variety of distinct plant and animal communities. For example the extremes of high altitude (low atmospheric pressure) combined with extreme cold allow extremophile organisms to survive.[tpl]cite web|first=C. Michael|last=Hogan|year=2010|url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Archaea?topic=49496|title=Archaea|editor1-first=E.|editor1-last=Monosson|editor2-first=C.|editor2-last=Cleveland|work=Encyclopedia of Earth|publisher=National Council for Science and the Environment|location=Washington DC[/tpl]
The unique floral and faunal wealth of the Himalayas is undergoing structural and compositional changes due to climate change. The increase in temperature may shift various species to higher elevations. The oak forest is being invaded by pine forests in the Garhwal Himalayan region. There are reports of early flowering and fruiting in some tree species, especially rhododendron, apple and Myrica esculenta. The highest known tree species in the Himalayas is Juniperus tibetica located at [tpl]convert|4900|m|ft|-1[/tpl] in Southeastern Tibet.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.uni-marburg.de/fb19/personal/professoren/miehe/pdfs/20074.pdf|title=Highest Treeline in the Northern Hemisphere Found in Southern Tibet|first1=Georg|last1=Miehe|first2=Sabine|last2=Miehe|first3=Jonas|last3=Vogel|first4=Sonam|last4=Co|first5=La|last5=Duo|year=2004|journal=Mountain Research and Development|volume=27|issue=2|date=May 2007|pages=169–173|doi=10.1659/mrd.0792|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606103046/http://www.uni-marburg.de/fb19/personal/professoren/miehe/pdfs/20074.pdf|archivedate=6 June 2013[/tpl]

==Geology==

The Himalaya are among the youngest mountain ranges on the planet and consist mostly of uplifted sedimentary and metamorphic rock. According to the modern theory of plate tectonics, their formation is a result of a continental collision or orogeny along the convergent boundary between the Indo-Australian Plate and the Eurasian Plate. The Arakan Yoma highlands in Myanmar and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal were also formed as a result of this collision.
During the Upper Cretaceous, about 70 million years ago, the north-moving Indo-Australian Plate was moving at about 15 cm per year.  About 50 million years ago, this fast moving Indo-Australian plate had completely closed the Tethys Ocean, the existence of which has been determined by sedimentary rocks settled on the ocean floor, and the volcanoes that fringed its edges. Since both plates were composed of low density continental crust, they were thrust faulted and folded into mountain ranges rather than subducting into the mantle along an oceanic trench.The Himalayas: Two continents collide, USGS An often-cited fact used to illustrate this process is that the summit of Mount Everest is made of marine limestone from this ancient ocean.A site which uses this dramatic fact first used in illustration of "deep time" in John McPhee's book Basin and Range
Today, the Indo-Australian plate continues to be driven horizontally below the Tibetan plateau, which forces the plateau to continue to move upwards. The Indo-Australian plate is still moving at 67 mm per year, and over the next 10 million years it will travel about 1,500 km into Asia. About 20 mm per year of the India-Asia convergence is absorbed by thrusting along the Himalaya southern front. This leads to the Himalayas rising by about 5 mm per year, making them geologically active. The movement of the Indian plate into the Asian plate also makes this region seismically active, leading to earthquakes from time to time.
During the last ice age, there was a connected ice stream of glaciers between Kangchenjunga in the east and Nanga Parbat in the west.[tpl]cite book|last=Kuhle|first=M.|year=2011|chapter=The High Glacial (Last Ice Age and Last Glacial Maximum) Ice Cover of High and Central Asia, with a Critical Review of Some Recent OSL and TCN Dates|editor1-last=Ehlers|editor1-first=J.|editor2-last=Gibbard|editor2-first=P.L.|editor3-last=Hughes|editor3-first=P.D.|title=Quaternary Glaciation – Extent and Chronology, A Closer Look|location=Amsterdam|publisher=Elsevier BV|pages=943–965[/tpl] (glacier maps downloadable) In the west, the glaciers joined with the ice stream network in the Karakoram, and in the north, joined with the former Tibetan inland ice.

==Hydrology==

thumb|The Himalayan range at Yumesongdong in Sikkim, in the Yumthang River valleyThe Himalayas have the third largest deposit of ice and snow in the world, after Antarctica and the Arctic.[tpl]cite web|title=The Himalayas|url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/episodes/the-himalayas/himalayas-facts/6341/|work=Nature on PBS|accessdate=21 January 2014[/tpl] The Himalayan range encompasses about 15,000 glaciers, which store about 12,000 km3 (3000 cubic miles) of fresh water. Its glaciers include the Gangotri and Yamunotri (Uttarakhand) and Khumbu glaciers (Mount Everest region), and Zemu (Sikkim).
Owing to the mountains' latitude near the Tropic of Cancer, the permanent snow line is among the highest in the world at typically around [tpl]convert|5500|m|ft|-2[/tpl].[tpl]cite journal|last1=Shi|first1=Yafeng|last2=Xie|first2=Zizhu|last3=Zheng|first3=Benxing|last4=Li|first4=Qichun|url=http://itia.ntua.gr/hsj/redbooks/126/iahs_126_0111.pdf|title=Distribution, Feature and Variations of Glaciers in China|journal=World Glacier Inventory|year=1978|publisher=Riederalp Workshop[/tpl] In contrast, equatorial mountains in New Guinea, the Rwenzoris and Colombia have a snow line some [tpl]convert|900|m|ft|-1[/tpl] lower.[tpl]cite book|last1=Henderson-Sellers|first1=Ann|last2=McGuffie|first2=Kendal|title=The Future of the World's Climate: A Modelling Perspective|pages=199–201|isbn=9780123869173[/tpl] The higher regions of the Himalayas are snowbound throughout the year, in spite of their proximity to the tropics, and they form the sources of several large perennial rivers, most of which combine into two large river systems:
The easternmost Himalayan rivers feed the Ayeyarwady River, which originates in eastern Tibet and flows south through Myanmar to drain into the Andaman Sea.
The Salween, Mekong, Yangtze and Huang He (Yellow River) all originate from parts of the Tibetan plateau that are geologically distinct from the Himalaya mountains, and are therefore not considered true Himalayan rivers. Some geologists refer to all the rivers collectively as the circum-Himalayan rivers.
In recent years, scientists have monitored a notable increase in the rate of glacier retreat across the region as a result of global climate change.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.planetark.com/dailynewsstory.cfm/newsid/42387/story.htm|title=Vanishing Himalayan Glaciers Threaten a Billion|date=5 June 2007|publisher=Planet Ark|accessdate=17 April 2009[/tpl] For example, Glacial lakes have been forming rapidly on the surface of the debris-covered glaciers in the Bhutan Himalaya during the last few decades. Although the effect of this will not be known for many years, it potentially could mean disaster for the hundreds of millions of people who rely on the glaciers to feed the rivers of northern India during the dry seasons.[tpl]cite web|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90781/90879/6222327.html|title=Glaciers melting at alarming speed|date=24 July 2007|publisher=People's Daily Online|accessdate=17 April 2009[/tpl] Some of the lakes present a danger of a glacial lake outburst flood.

===Lakes===

The Himalayan region is dotted with hundreds of lakes. Most lakes are found at altitudes of less than 5,000 m, with the size of the lakes diminishing with altitude.  Tilicho Lake in Nepal in the Annapurna massif is one of the highest lakes in the world. Pangong Tso, which is spread across the border between India and China, and Yamdrok Tso, located in central Tibet, are amongst the largest with surface areas of 700 km², and 638 km², respectively. Other notable lakes include Gurudongmar Lake, in North Sikkim, and Lake Tsongmo, near the Indo-China border in Sikkim.
The mountain lakes are known to geographers as tarns if they are caused by glacial activity. Tarns are found mostly in the upper reaches of the Himalaya, above 5,500 metres.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.highestlake.com/highest-lake-world.html|title=Highest Lake in the World|first=Carl|last=Drews|accessdate=14 November 2010[/tpl]

==Impact on climate==

The Himalayas have a profound effect on the climate of the Indian subcontinent and the Tibetan plateau. They prevent frigid, dry Arctic winds blowing south into the subcontinent, which keeps South Asia much warmer than corresponding temperate regions in the other continents. It also forms a barrier for the monsoon winds, keeping them from traveling northwards, and causing heavy rainfall in the Terai region. The Himalayas are also believed to play an important part in the formation of Central Asian deserts, such as the Taklamakan and Gobi.[tpl]cite news | last = Devitt | first = Terry | title = Climate shift linked to rise of Himalayas, Tibetan Plateau | newspaper = University of Wisconsin–Madison News | date = 3 May 2001 | url = http://www.news.wisc.edu/6138| accessdate = 1 November 2011[/tpl]

==Religion==

In Hinduism, the Himalayas have been personified as the god Himavat, father of Ganga  and Parvati.[tpl]cite book|title=Dictionary of Hindu Lore and Legend|isbn=0-500-51088-1|first=Anna|last=Dallapiccola|year=2002[/tpl]
Several places in the Himalayas are of religious significance in Hinduism, Jainism, Sikhism, and Buddhism. A notable example of a religious site is Paro Taktsang, where Padmasambhava is said to have founded Buddhism in Bhutan.[tpl]cite book|author=Pommaret, Francoise|title=Bhutan Himlayan Mountains Kingdom|edition=5th|publisher=Odyssey Books and Guides|year=2006|pages=136–7|isbn=978-9622178106[/tpl]
A number of Tibetan Buddhist sites are situated in the Himalayas, including the residence of the Dalai Lama. There were over 6,000 monasteries in Tibet.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7307495.stm|title=Tibetan monks: A controlled life|publisher=BBC News|date=20 March 2008[/tpl] The Tibetan Muslims had their own mosques in Lhasa and Shigatse.[tpl]cite news|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200510/27/eng20051027_217176.html|title=Mosques in Lhasa, Tibet|newspaper=People's Daily Online|date=27 October 2005[/tpl]
