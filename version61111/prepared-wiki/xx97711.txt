Gwinnett County Airport [tpl]Airport codes|LZU|KLZU|LZU[/tpl] at Briscoe Field is a municipal airport located about two miles (3 km) northeast of Lawrenceville, Georgia, in the United States. It is owned and operated by the  Gwinnett County, in the northeastern part of metro Atlanta.
It has a [tpl]convert|6000|ft|m|sing=on[/tpl] runway, and is [tpl]convert|1061|ft|m[/tpl] above mean sea level (AMSL). Student training is conducted at the airport by several different flight schools, including ATP Flight School. Two fixed-base operators (FBOs), Landmark (north ramp) and Aircraft Specialists (south ramp), serve the field with facilities, passenger lounges, and fuel. ImagineAir, an air taxi company, is based at the airport and is currently the airport's largest air carrier by passenger volume. Medway Air Ambulance and Critical Care Medflight operate medical transport services. Its Airport Minimum Standards for Operation were rewritten in 2006.

==Privatization==

In May 2010 the FAA gave preliminary approval to a plan to privatize the airport. This allowed Gwinnett County to further study plans on a possible sale of the airport to private investors.[tpl]cite news|last=Fox|first=Pat|title=Airline Flights from Gwinnett?

Atlanta's dominant airline, Delta, lobbied against the proposal due to its reluctance to split operations between Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport and Briscoe Field, even though three low-cost carriers, Allegiant, JetBlue, and Virgin America, do not yet offer service to Atlanta.[tpl]cite news|last=Poole|first=Robert|title=Atlanta Needs Another Airport|url=http://reason.org/news/show/briscoe-ruling-good-for-gwinnett-ba|newspaper=Atlanta Journal-Constitution|date=June 28, 2012[/tpl]
In June 2012, the County's Board of Commissioners canceled the privatization plan, amid local opposition to initiating commercial passenger service from the airport.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.ajc.com/news/gwinnett/gwinnett-rejects-commercial-flights-1452770.html | title = Gwinnett rejects commercial flights at Briscoe | date = June 5, 2012 | work = The Atlanta Journal-Constitution[/tpl] The Board claims that it would not have been a suitable location for an airport due the already widespread development around Briscoe, which would also have limited future expansion plans. They also raised the issue of distance, claiming that it was "too far away from metro Atlanta’s main population base", citing industry experts who said "most travelers would continue to utilize Hartsfield-Jackson over Briscoe because it would offer more flights, more destinations, and better ticket pricing". They also characterized Propeller Investments as a startup company without airport operations experience.[tpl]cite news|last=Regan|first=Jim|url=http://blogs.ajc.com/atlanta-forward/2012/06/25/atlantas-second-airport/|newspaper=Atlanta Journal-Constitution|date=June 28, 2012[/tpl]
