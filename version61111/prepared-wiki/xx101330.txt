Konrad Grob (September 3, 1828 – January 9, 1904) was a Swiss painter. He was born in Andelfingen in the Canton of Zurich and learned lithography in the 1840s in Winterthur. He travelled to Italy, where he worked in Verona and Naples. He later studied painting at the Academy of Arts in Munich, where he opened his own atelier and where he died in 1904.
He had quite some commercial success with romantic paintings of rural life. His best known painting is Pestalozzi bei den Waisen von Stans, shown today in the Öffentliche Kunstsammlung (the Museum of Art) of Basel.
