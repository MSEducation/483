CATEGORIES: Quantum field theory, Lie algebras

Current algebra is a mathematical framework in quantum field theory where the fields form a Lie algebra under their commutation relations.
For instance, in a non-Abelian Yang–Mills symmetry, where ρ is the charge density,
where f are the structure constants of the Lie algebra. If space is a one-dimensional circle, there may exist central extensions.
