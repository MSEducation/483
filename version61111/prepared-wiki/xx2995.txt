Extraterrestrial life (from the Latin words: extra or "not of" and terrestris or belonging to Earth") is defined as life that does not originate from Earth. It is often also referred to as alien life, or simply aliens (or space aliens, to differentiate from other definitions of alien or aliens). These hypothetical forms of life range from simple bacteria-like organisms to beings far more complex than humans. The possibility that viruses might also exist extraterrestrially has been proposed.[tpl]cite journal |last=Griffin |first=Dale Warren |title=The Quest for Extraterrestrial Life: What About the Viruses? |url=http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/ast.2012.0959 |date=14 August 2013 |journal=Astrobiology (journal) |volume=13 |issue=8 |pages=774–783 |doi=10.1089/ast.2012.0959 |accessdate=6 September 2013 |bibcode = 2013AsBio..13..774G [/tpl]
The development and testing of hypotheses on extraterrestrial life is known as exobiology or astrobiology; the term astrobiology, however, includes the study of life on Earth viewed in its astronomical context. Scientists at the National Institutes of Health reported studies that life in the universe may have begun "[tpl]val|9.7|2.5[/tpl] billion years ago", billions of years before the Earth was formed, based on extrapolating the "genetic complexity of organisms" "major phylogenetic lineages" to earlier times.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Sharov|first1=Alexei A. |last2=Gordon|first2=Richard |title=Life Before Earth|url=http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1304/1304.3381.pdf |date=28 March 2013|journal=arXiv|arxiv=1304.3381v1 |accessdate=16 April 2013 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Sharov |first=Alexei A. |title=Genome increase as a clock for the origin and evolution of life|journal=Biology Direct |volume=1 |pages=1–17 |date=12 June 2006 |issue=  |doi=10.1186/1745-6150-1-17|pmc=1526419[/tpl]  Many scientists consider extraterrestrial life to be plausible, but there is no direct evidence of its existence.[tpl]cite news |last=Davies |authorlink=Paul Davies |first=Paul |title=Are We Alone in the Universe? |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/19/opinion/are-we-alone-in-the-universe.html |date=18 November 2013 |work=New York Times |accessdate=20 November 2013 [/tpl] Since the mid-20th century, there has been an ongoing search for signs of extraterrestrial life, from radios used to detect possible extraterrestrial signals, to telescopes used to search for potentially habitable extrasolar planets. It has also played a major role in works of science fiction.

==Background==

Alien life, such as bacteria, has been hypothesized to exist in the Solar System and throughout the universe. This hypothesis relies on the vast size and consistent physical laws of the observable universe. According to this argument, made by scientists such as Carl Sagan and Stephen Hawking, it would be improbable for life not to exist somewhere other than Earth.[tpl]cite book | page=3 | title=Other Worlds, Other Universes | editors=Brad Steiger, John White | publisher=Health Research Books | year=1986 | isbn=0-7873-1291-6 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vgQj5D524PYC&pg=PA3 [/tpl][tpl]cite book | first1=David | last1=Filkin | first2=Stephen W. | last2=Hawking | title=Stephen Hawking's universe: the cosmos explained | page=194 | series=Art of Mentoring Series | publisher=Basic Books | year=1998 | isbn=0-465-08198-3 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=95Kog5v4ZxkC&pg=PA194 [/tpl] This argument is embodied in the Copernican principle, which states that the Earth does not occupy a unique position in the Universe, and the mediocrity principle, which holds that there is nothing special about life on Earth.[tpl]Cite book | first=Horst | last=Rauchfuss | year=2008 | title=Chemical Evolution and the Origin of Life | publisher=Springer | isbn=3-540-78822-0 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=aRkvNoDYtvEC&pg=PA300 | others=T.
