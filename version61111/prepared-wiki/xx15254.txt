"Womyn" is one of several alternative spellings of the word "women" used by some feminists.D. Hatton. "Womyn and the 'L': A Study of the Relationship between Communication Apprehension, Gender, and Bulletin Boards" (abstract), Education Resources Information Center, 1995. There are many alternative spellings, including "womban" and "womon" (singular), and "wimmin" (plural).  Writers who use  alternative spellings see them as an expression of female independence and a repudiation of traditions that define females by reference to a male norm.Neeru Tandon (2008) Feminism: A Paradigm Shift

==Background==

In Old English sources, the word "man" was gender-neutral, with a meaning similar to the modern English usage of "one" as an indefinite pronoun. The words wer and wyf were used to specify a man or woman where necessary, respectively. Combining them into wer-man or wyf-man expressed the concept of "any man" or "any woman".Spender, Dale. Man-Made Language.Miller, Casey, and Kate Swift. The Handbook of Non-Sexist Language. Feminist writers have suggested that the less prejudicial usage of the Old English sources reflects more egalitarian notions of gender at the time.

===Womon/wimmin===

"Wimmin" appeared in 19th century renderings of Black American English, without any feminist significance. Z. Budapest promoted the use of "wimmin" (singular "womon") in the 1970s as part of her Dianic Wicca movement, which claims that present-day patriarchy represents a fall from a matriarchal golden age.Eugene V. Gallagher, W. Michael Ashcraft (2006) Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America
