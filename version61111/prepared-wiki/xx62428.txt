The name of the village had "under Needwood" added in 1327 {see a History of Barton under Needwood - Under the Needwood Tree 1995}  to distinguish it from the other Bartons in England. In 1995 a written history of Barton under Needwood was produced, named "Under the Needwood Tree", by Steve Gardner, with the assistance of a book committee. In 2001 Steve published a sequel, "Life and Times in Barton", and in 2007 a further volume: "Memories of Old Barton".
Dunstall Hall is a stately home about a mile outside Barton in the hamlet of Dunstall. It is used as a conference centre and a venue for weddings.
The UK's first Travelodge was opened in 1985 on the A38 just outside the village.
Between the 2005 and 2010 General Elections, the Needwood ward of East Staffordshire Borough Council(in which Barton-under-Needwood is the main settlement) was transferred from the Burton Parliamentary constituency to Lichfield.
