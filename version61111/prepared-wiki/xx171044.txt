==Gobots==

Turbo was Leader-1's right hand Gobot, and one of the toughest Guardians.The Great Robot Book by Texe W. Marrs, Wanda J. Marrs - 1985, ISBN 978-0-671-60243-7Going, Going, Gobots by Matt Carara, Toyfare Magazine #123, November 2007, page 80-82 His car mode is shown to be one of the fastest of the Gobots, and he is both strong and powerful.Model kits, Playthings; January 1, 1985; by Doyle, Joe Turbo is also one of the bravest Guardians, though he is sometimes rather stupid and headstrong, occasionally ending up badly injured on account of his heroics. He is one of Leader-1's most loyal troops, has a friendly "brawn versus brains" rivalry with comrade Scooter. He also has an ongoing rivalry with the Renegade Crasher – as a fellow sports car, she is usually his target of choice in battles. Like most Gobots, he could fly in robot mode, and fire energy bolts from his fists.[tpl]Cite book | title=Totally Tubular '80s | last=Bellomo | first=Mark | year=2010 | publisher=Krause Publications| ISBN=1-4402-1282-1 | pages= 90–93[/tpl]
