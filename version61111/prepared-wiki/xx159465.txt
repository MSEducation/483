On January 27, 1870, as a policy of the Meiji Restoration, it was adopted as the national flag.Osaka University Knowledge archive Japan’s National Flag and Anthem: Historical Significance and Legal Position http://ir.library.osaka-u.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/11094/10124/1/25-6_n.pdf  The naval ensign and a modified version of the war flag continue to be used by the Japan Self-Defense Forces, and the design is also incorporated into many commercial products and advertisements. However, as the flag was used by the Japanese in the conquest and occupation of East Asia and during the war in the Pacific, it is considered offensive in South Korea[tpl]cite web | url=http://japandailypress.com/courting-controversy-olympic-uniform-resembled-rising-sun-flag-149097 | title=Courting Controversy: Olympic Uniform resembled rising sun flag! | work=Japan Daily Press | date=August 14, 2012 | accessdate=September 18, 2012 | author=Radhika Seth[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://view.koreaherald.com/kh/view.php?ud=20120829001376&cpv=0 | title=Korean lawmakers adopt resolution calling on Japan not to use rising sun flag | work=Korea Herald | date=August 29, 2012 | accessdate=September 18, 2012[/tpl] and China,[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2008/08/08/us-olympics-japan-flag-idUST35118820080808| author=Naoto Okamura| title=Japan fans warned not to fly naval flag| publisher=Reuters| date=August 8, 2008[/tpl] where it is considered to be associated with Japanese militarism and imperialism.

==Design==

The design is similar to the flag of Japan in that it has a red circle close to the middle signifying the sun, the difference being the addition of extra sun rays (16 for the ensign) exemplifying the name of Japan as "The Land of the Rising Sun". The Imperial Japanese Army first adopted the Rising Sun Flag in 1870.[tpl]cite web|title=海軍旗の由来|url=http://www.kwn.ne.jp/kokki/column2.htm|publisher=kwn.ne.jp|accessdate=6 October 2011[/tpl] The Imperial Japanese Army and the Imperial Japanese Navy both had a version of the flag; the naval ensign was off-set, with the red sun closer to the lanyard side, while the army's version (which was part of the regimental colors) was centered. It was adopted in 1889. The flag was used in overseas actions from the Meiji period to World War II. When Japan was defeated in August 1945 and the Imperial Army and Navy were dissolved, the flag fell into disuse. However with the re-establishment of a Self-Defense Force the flag was re-adopted in 1954. The flag with 16 rays is today the ensign of the Maritime Self-Defense Force while the Ground Self-Defense Force uses an 8-ray version.

==Present-day perception==

The flag is considered offensive in countries with a strong anti-Japanese sentiment, specifically in China and South Korea,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.columbiatribune.com/news/2012/apr/19/soccer-teams-use-of-rising-sun-flag-causes-stir/|title=Soccer team’s use of Rising Sun flag causes stir|work=Columbia Daily Tribune|date=April 19, 2012|accessdate=September 18, 2012|author=Janese Silvey[/tpl] where it is considered to be associated with Japanese militarism and imperialism.
