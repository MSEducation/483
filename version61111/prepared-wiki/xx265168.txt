Watch the Throne is a collaborative studio album by American rappers Jay-Z and Kanye West, released on August 8, 2011, by Roc-A-Fella Records, Roc Nation, and Def Jam Recordings. Before the album, Jay-Z and West had collaborated on their respective singles and with West as a producer on Jay-Z's work. As longtime friends, they originally sought out to record a five-song EP together, but the project eventually evolved into a full length album. Recording sessions took place at various locations and began in November 2010. The album was produced by West, 88 Keys, RZA, Swizz Beatz, Jeff Bhasker, and Mike Dean, among others. 
Expanding on the dense production style of West's 2010 album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, Watch the Throne incorporates orchestral and progressive rock influences, unconventional samples, and dramatic melodies in its sound. Jay-Z and West's braggadocio lyrics exhibit themes of opulence, fame, materialism, power, and the burdens of success, as well as political and socioeconomic context. The album expresses other topics such as Jay-Z's thoughts on fatherhood, West's reflection on being deemed a social villain, and their legacy as performers. Music writers interpreted the subject matter to concern the rappers' plight as African Americans struggling with financial success in America.
The album produced seven singles, including the international hits "Otis", "Niggas in Paris", and "No Church in the Wild", which all received music videos. "H•A•M" and "Gotta Have It" were successful Billboard singles, with "Why I Love You" and "Lift Off" attaining success internationally. Jay-Z and West promoted the album with the Watch the Throne Tour that spanned October 2011 to June 2012 and became the highest grossing hip-hop concert tour in history. 
Watch the Throne debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 436,000 copies its first week. It received generally positive reviews from music critics, who commended its production and the rappers' performances, although some criticized its subject matter and cohesiveness. It was also one of the top-ranked albums in year-end lists by critics and publications and earned Jay-Z and West seven Grammy Award nominations. The album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and, as of June 2012, has sold 1,573,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan.

==Background==

Jay-Z and Kanye West first worked together on the former's 2000 song "This Can't Be Life", produced by West,Pendergast (2006), p. 174. then on Jay-Z's 2001 album The Blueprint, which showcased West's distinctive style of hip hop production at the time.[tpl]cite web|last=Birchmeier|first=Jason|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/kanye-west-p353484/biography|title=Kanye West|work=Allmusic|at=Biography|year=2010|accessdate=August 11, 2011[/tpl] West's early production work on Jay-Z's music helped raise his profile in the music industry. While originally only viewed as a producer, West eventually was seen as both a viable rapper and producer thanks to the success of his debut album The College Dropout and its singles.Pareles, Jon.

Also according to the rapper, the track "Monster" was intended for the EP, though that failed to surface. It was later revealed by West that the project had been expanded into a full-length album in an October 2010 interview for MTV.[tpl]cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/40504-kanye-west-and-jay-z-planning-joint-album/|title=Kanye West and Jay-Z Planning Joint Album|date=October 25, 2010|first=Ryan|last=Dombal|publisher=Pitchfork Media|accessdate=October 26, 2010[/tpl] He said in the interview that they planned to record in the south of France.

==Recording==

Recording sessions for the album took place at Avex Recording Studio in Honolulu, Hawaii; Barford Estate in Sydney, Australia; Electric Lady Studios; the Mercer Hotel; MSR Studios; and Tribeca Grand Hotel in New York, New York; Le Meurice in Paris, France; and Real World Studios in Wiltshire, England.[tpl]cite AV media notes |title=Watch the Throne |others=Jay-Z and Kanye West |year=2011 |type=PDF digital booklet |publisher=Universal Music Group [/tpl] Production began in November 2010 in England and continued during available times in Jay-Z's and West's schedules at locations in Australia, Paris, Abu Dhabi, New York City, and Los Angeles.[tpl]cite web|last=Vozick-Levinson |first=Simon |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/jay-z-previews-watch-the-throne-in-new-york-20110708|title=Jay-Z Previews 'Watch the Throne' in New York|work=Rolling Stone|publisher=Wenner Media|date=July 8, 2011|accessdate=July 17, 2011[/tpl] In an interview for Billboard, Jay-Z said that they often recorded in hotel rooms and that the album went through three iterations, as he and West had scaled back from their original musical direction.[tpl]cite web|last=Meadows-Ingram|first=Benjamin|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/469319/watch-the-throne-inside-jay-zs-private-listening-session|title='Watch The Throne': Inside Jay-Z's Private Listening Session|work=Billboard|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|date=July 8, 2011|accessdate=July 21, 2011[/tpl] He noted difficulties in the recording process, including arguments with West regarding their direction. 
Following the release of lead single "H•A•M" in January 2011, Jay-Z stated that the less-than-stellar reception caused a change in the production of the album. Jay-Z announced that it was unlikely that the track would ultimately make the album. The issues at the beginning of production had caused a delay in the release. In an interview for Rolling Stone, Jay-Z discussed their insistence on recording in person and attributed it to the delay in releasing the album, stating "If we were gonna do it, we were gonna do it together. No mailing it in." The album's earlier sessions produced little material that made the final cut.[tpl]cite web|author=Golianopoulos, Thomas |url=http://www.complex.com/music/2012/02/interview-no-id-talks-def-jam-kanye-west-how-he-affected-watch-the-throne/page/3|title=How Jay-Z and Kanye West finally made 'Watch the Throne'|work=New York Post |publisher=News Corporation|date=February 6, 2012|accessdate=August 8, 2011[/tpl]
West had brought a majority of his usual production crew onto the project, the same crew that had assisted in the creation of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. One of the main exceptions was producer No I.D., who felt that the two artists weren't pushing forward enough with the music. In an interview with Complex, No I.D. commented about the project that "you’re going to sell, because you’re already big. But you guys are important to push this forward. Push intelligence and decadence and all of the above forward in a creative manner.” While his advice was acknowledged to a degree, he ultimately had very little part in the finished project.[tpl]cite web|last=Kim|first=Soo-Young |url=http://www.complex.com/music/2012/02/interview-no-id-talks-def-jam-kanye-west-how-he-affected-watch-the-throne/page/3|title=Interview: No I.D.

In January 2011, they regrouped and rented a block of rooms at the Mercer Hotel in New York City and invited a select group of producers and recording artists. Chauncey "Hit-Boy" Hollis, who produced the track "Niggas in Paris", said of recording at the hotel, "There was music going on in every room. I had a room where I was cranking out beats, and then I’d go into the main room with Jay and Kanye and play beats for them. Kanye is really hands-on. I would come in with a beat and he’d be like, ‘Take this out, slow it down.’ It would make it sound 100 times better. Jay would then mumble different flows to the beat."

 “I rarely do collabs, so that’s just one of the ones you absolutely do. It’s like a no-brainer. I didn’t really think about any of it. The last thing on my mind was working with artists who I’ve held in high esteem for years. ... I worked with Jay on his solo album before I did the Watch the Throne sessions.

Swizz Beatz, who produced "Welcome to the Jungle", also provided background vocals to the track, and Kid Cudi contributed additional vocals to "The Joy" and "Illest Motherfucker Alive," bonus tracks on the album's deluxe edition. One of the tracks that was recorded but didn't make the cut for the album was "Living So Italian." It apparently sampled Andrea Bocelli's "Con te partirò" and was described as catchy but for unknown reasons, the song never made it onto the album.

==Music==

Julian Benbow of The Boston Globe writes that the album's music is as "massive, dour, and relentlessly unconventional" as that of West's previous 2010 album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. Music writer Robert Christgau describes West's production as "a funkier and less ornate variant of the prog-rap of 2010's acclaimed My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy".[tpl]cite web|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|url=http://bnreview.barnesandnoble.com/t5/Rock-Roll/Brag-Like-That/ba-p/5743|title=Brag Like That - The Barnes & Noble Review|publisher=Barnes & Noble|date=August 19, 2011|accessdate=September 20, 2011[/tpl] Music journalist Jody Rosen characterizes the music as "vast, dark and booming," commenting that West "continues in the sonic vein he introduced in My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, lacing the songs with rock dynamics, layering his beats with eerie vocal chorales, piling on proggy flourishes." Conversely, Matthew Cole of Slant Magazine finds West's "knack for dramatic, melodically sophisticated tracks ... channeled away from the Olympian scale" of his previous album "and toward the more commercial vein of Jay-Z's recent work," which he attributes to West splitting production work with several other producers. On the songs' structure, Cole states, "every track eschews the standard verse-hook-repeat format in favor of more dynamic material." 
Music journalist Alexis Petridis comments that the album incorporates "unlikely samples." Jon Caramanica of The New York Times writes that its production "can be roughly segmented into three categories," noting "Southern-inflected tracks" such as "Niggas in Paris" and "H•A•M", "moody and harsh numbers" like "Who Gon Stop Me" and "Why I Love You", and "the nostalgia that creeps over much of this album, giving it a sonic through-line and mission statement." Pitchfork Media's Tom Breihan perceives "pure orchestral excess" on some of its songs and describes the album's musical scope as "a tribute to West's distinctive taste and sense of style." An interlude that appears after "No Church in the Wild", "New Day" and "Welcome to the Jungle", as well as before "Illest Motherfucker Alive" on the deluxe edition, samples the 1979 song "Tristessa" by Italian jazz-rock fusion band Orchestra Njervudarov.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.whosampled.com/sampled/Orchestra%20Njervudarov/|title=Orchestra Njervudarov Music Sampled By Others - WhoSampled|accessdate=September 2, 2012[/tpl]

Ross Green of Tiny Mix Tapes describes it as "luxury rap", noting Jay-Z's and West's "whimsy and braggadocio."[tpl]cite web|last=Green|first=Ross|url=http://www.tinymixtapes.com/music-review/jay-z-and-kanye-west-watch-throne|title=Jay-Z and Kanye West - Watch the Throne|publisher=Tiny Mix Tapes|date=August 18, 2011|accessdate=August 19, 2011[/tpl] Rob Harvilla of Spin views that their lyrics express elitism, narcissism, "relentless capitalism," and "smug yet undeniable greatness." 
Music critic Greg Kot views that the album is about "mutual admiration" and writes of the rappers' respective personas, "Jay-Z is about imperious flow, bridging his gritty past life on the streets with his current status as a cultural tastemaker and business mogul. ... West is more desperate, transparent, awkward, vulnerable." Music critic Nathan Rabin states that Jay-Z and West "are a study in contrasts: the businessman and the bohemian, the faithful husband and the drugged-up playboy, the walking press release and the loose cannon. Jay-Z is tidy. Kanye is nothing but rough edges." Jon Caramanica writes similarly, "breaking ... old barriers is a means to acceptance and stability" for Jay-Z, while "West sounds lonely" with his fame, adding that "For Mr. West every flash of Dionysian extreme is tempered by the realization of its hollowness." In his article "Brag Like That" for Barnes & Noble, Robert Christgau comments that "Jay-Z is a grown man and Kanye West is not" on the album and elaborates on their lyrics, stating:
Their lyrics also exhibit political and socioeconomic context,[tpl]cite web|author=Staff|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/50-best-albums-of-2011-20111207/jay-z-and-kanye-west-watch-the-throne-19691231|title=50 Best Albums of 2011: Jay-Z and Kanye West, 'Watch the Throne'|work=Rolling Stone|publisher=Wenner Media|date=December 7, 2011|accessdate=December 9, 2011[/tpl] which Jody Rosen denotes as "serious, sober, weighty." Nitsuh Abebe of New York views that the album is "about the relationship of black American men to wealth, power, and success. ... a portrait of two black men thinking through the idea of success in America." He compares it to Yinka Shonibare's 1998 piece Diary of a Victorian Dandy, "in which the artist luxuriates in all the genteel pleasures of the time." Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times notes "musings on the spoils of riches and the chaos that accompanies it," adding that "the tension between worshiping the spirit and celebrating the bounty drives Watch the Throne ... The record questions faith while clinging to heritage and family, places this moment in an historical context, wonders on the mystery, power and confusion of the gilded life — while rolling around in amulets." Writer Kitty Empire interprets it to be about "black power ... conceived as a swaggering taunt of achievement, in line with both men's previous works, which routinely double as shopping guides. ... They need to humanise all the conspicuous consumption." Claire Suddath of Time views the rappers' "bacchanal celebration of the finer things in life" as secondary to the theme of "two men grappling with what it means to be successful and black in a nation that still thinks of them as second class."

==Songs==

The opening track "No Church in the Wild" features a cinematic production style. Singers Frank Ocean and The-Dream lend their voices to the album's grim opener, which sets the mood with a gnarled guitar sample.[tpl]cite web|author=Perpetua, Matthew|title=Kanye West and Jay-Z's 'Watch the Throne': A Track-by-Track Breakdown|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/kanye-west-and-jay-zs-watch-the-throne-a-track-by-track-breakdown-20110809|work=Rolling Stone|publisher=Wenner Media|date=August 9, 2011|accessdate=December 27, 2011[/tpl] Over the rock-centric, rolling production, both rappers muse over familiar themes of loyalty, sexuality and maternal solidarity.

The track features an unusual sampling of dialogue from the 2007 film Blades of Glory, notably the "we're gonna skate to one song and one song only" line. West and Jay-Z's lyrics frame their rags to riches story on the song. 
"Otis" samples Otis Redding's 1966 song "Try a Little Tenderness", manipulating it into a rhythm track with Redding's vocals and grunts. The sample is used in a way that is reminiscent to past Kanye productions, like the tracks found on his album The College Dropout. Redding's vocals are chopped up so thoroughly that his voice serves as a mere melodic riff on the track, with both rappers promptly rapping over it in a braggadocio fashion. "Gotta Have It", produced by The Neptunes, incorporates chopped-up James Brown vocal samples and Eastern flute melodies. The song contains haunting backing vocals and an accompanying tambourine with the two rappers trading verses with the vocal riff playing over them. Much like "Otis", the track features sliced-up vocal snippets and an aggressive bass backing, with the two rappings trading lines and making references to the Yung Chris song "Racks" and other contemporary rap trends.[tpl]cite web|author=Exton, Emily|url=http://popdust.com/2011/11/14/rihanna-talk-that-talk-birthday-cake-leak-new/|title=Gotta Have It by Kanye and Jay-Z Review|publisher=Popdust|date=November 14, 2011|accessdate=October 7, 2012[/tpl] 
On "New Day", they address future sons about fame. It references the line "me and the RZA connect" from Raekwon's 1995 song "Incarcerated Scarfaces", which was also produced by RZA. The track incorporates a sample of Nina Simone's 1965 song "Feeling Good" through an Auto-Tune voice processor. Both rappers discuss their futures as fathers on the track, flowing smoothly over mellow, lightly psychedelic synthesizer tones. Both Justin Vernon and La Roux appear on "That's My Bitch", spitting off hooks over a quick, melodic beat, with West at his most abrasive lyrically. On "Welcome to the Jungle", Jay-Z laments personal losses and overcoming struggles. Sharing the name with a Guns N' Roses track, Jay describes himself as the "black Axl Rose" over a jittery, treble-heavy Swizz Beatz production.
"Who Gon Stop Me" features bombastic production and samples Flux Pavilion's 2011 song "I Can't Stop", reinforced with heavy synthesizer and tone shifts. The song utilizes an often experimental, bass-driven and dub-step influenced style of composition, with West forcefully rapping lines like "this is something like the Holocaust". "Murder to Excellence" addresses black-on-black crime and limited social mobility for African Americans. Midway through the song the beat switches up, with Kanye musing over the horrors of black-on-black violence in the first half, and Jay-Z delivering equally meditated comments on black excellence on the more choir heavy second half.
