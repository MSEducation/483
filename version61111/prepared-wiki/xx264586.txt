Smoking in South Korea is similar to other developed countries in the OECD, with a daily smoking rate of 22.90% in 2012 compared to the OECD average of 21.13%. However, male smoking is among the highest at 40.80% while female smoking among the lowest at 5.20%.http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/factbook-2013-en/12/02/01/index.html?itemId=/content/chapter/factbook-2013-98-en
South Korea enforced strict smoking bans in public places from July 2013, with fines of 100,000 won on any spotted smoker and up to 5 million won on shop owners not following the law. From December 2012, smoking has been completely banned in bars and restaurants larger than 150 square meters (extended to 100 square meters from 2014), cafes, internet cafes, government buildings, kindergartens, schools, universities, hospitals, youth facilities, libraries, children's playgrounds, private academies, subway or train stations and their platforms and underground pathways, large buildings, theaters, department stores or shopping malls, large hotels and highway rest areas. More places now offer smoking areas separated by glass walls. 
The law has extended to bars and restaurants larger than 100 square meters since January 2014. South Korea will completely ban smoking on all bars, restaurants and cafes regardless of size from January 2015. Cafes which are currently permitted to have smoking rooms must remove any smoking rooms by this date.

==Prevalence and effects==

Reports suggest that persistently high rates of smoking in the military contribute to the high incidence of male smoking, and negate the efficacy of anti-smoking measures, as many men start smoking during their mandatory 2-year military service. The Public Health Graduate School of Yonsei University completed a 13-year medical study on 1.2 million patients and found that about 73% of male smokers and 18% of female smokers contracted lung cancer.[tpl]Citation needed|reason=Very unlikely; unable to find a study supporting those numbers|date=March 2014[/tpl] There is rising awareness of the health effects of tobacco. The economy of South Korea loses more than 10 trillion won a year in terms of health-care expenses and lost man-hours due to smoking-related illness.

==Korean smoking etiquette==

Local smoking etiquette is influenced by Confucianism. For instance, smokers generally refrain from, or seek permission before lighting up in the presence of social superiors; a social superior could be a boss, professor, parents, grandparents, or teacher.

==Gender role==

In a 2007 Korean Gallup Study, around 84% of Koreans believed females should not smoke. Females were considered of lesser class than males in older days and it was disturbing to see females openly smoke in public. While it was more socially acceptable for men to smoke, females had to smoke in secret including public washrooms and bars. However, as the Korean society is becoming more open, the perception towards female smokers has altered.
