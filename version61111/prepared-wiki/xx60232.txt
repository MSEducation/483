Ogopogo or Naitaka ([tpl]lang-sal|n'ha-a-itk[/tpl], "lake demon") is the name given to a cryptid lake monster reported to live in Okanagan Lake, in British Columbia, Canada. Ogopogo has been allegedly seen by First Nations people since the 19th century. The most common description of Ogopogo is a 40 to 50-foot-long ([tpl]convert|40|to|50|ft|disp=output only[/tpl]) sea serpent.
British cryptozoologist Karl Shuker has categorized the Ogopogo as a 'many hump' variety of lake monster, and suggested it may be a kind of primitive serpentine whale such as Basilosaurus. However, because the physical evidence for the beast is limited to unclear photographs and film, it has also been suggested that the sightings are misidentifications of common animals, such as otters, and inanimate objects, such as floating logs.Nickell, 2006

==Alleged sightings==

In 1926 a sighting is claimed to have occurred at an Okanagan Mission beach. This event was supposedly witnessed by about thirty cars of people who all claimed to have seen the same thing.[tpl]cite web|author=ogopogoquest.com |url=http://www.ogopogoquest.com/sightings.html |title=Ogopogo Quest, The Search for the elusive lake monster known as Ogopogo continues - Have you seen him in Okanagan Lake in British Columbia Canada? |publisher=Ogopogoquest.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-03[/tpl] In 1968 Art Folden filmed what is claimed to be footage of the alleged creature, showing a large wake moving across the water. A computer analysis of the footage concluded it was a solid, three-dimensional object.[tpl]cite book|last=Gaal|first=Arlene|title=In Search of Ogopogo: Sacred Creature of the Okanagan|year=2001|publisher=Hancock House|isbn=0-88839-482-9[/tpl] In 2011, a cell phone video captured two dark shapes in the water. A suggested explanation is that the video shows two logs.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2011/11/14/canadas-loch-ness-monster-captured-on-video/ | title=Canada's Loch Ness Monster Captured on Video? | date=November 14, 2011 | agency=Discovery News | accessdate=November 15, 2011[/tpl]
