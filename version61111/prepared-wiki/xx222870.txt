==Colorado Rockies affiliations==

On September 2, 1992, Jerry McMorris welcomed Charlie Monfort and Oren Benton to join him in buying controlling interest in the Rockies.  This came after founding owner Mickey Monus was ensnared in a massive accounting scandal surrounding his Phar-Mor discount drugstores.
Dick Monfort later replaced Benton in the ownership group, and became vice chairman of the Rockies on December 8, 1997. On March 31, 2003, Charlie was named CEO of the Colorado Rockies, succeeding president Keli McGregor who had taken the role from McMorris in 2001.
In 2005, Dick and Charlie Monfort purchased Jerry McMorris’ financial interest in the team, becoming the primary owners.  Charlie remained as chairman and CEO until 2011, when he handed both roles to Dick.
