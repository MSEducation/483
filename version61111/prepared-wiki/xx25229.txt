</ref> Molecular markers are generally accepted as better predictors than morphological markers of ([[agronomy|agronomic]] traits) due to their insensitivity to variation in environmental conditions.
A useful molecular marker known as a simple sequence repeat (SSR) is used in breeding with respect to selection.  SSRs are segments of a genome composed of tandem repeats of a short sequence of nucleotides, usually two to six base pairs.  They are popular tools in genetics and breeding because of their relative abundance compared to other marker types, a high degree of polymorphism (number of variants), and easy assaying by polymerase chain reaction.  However, they are expensive to identify and develop.  Comparative genome mapping has revealed a high degree of similarity in terms of sequence colinearity between closely related crop species. This allows the exchange of such markers within a group of related species, such as wheat, rye and triticale. One study established a 58% and 39% transferability rate to triticale from wheat and rye, respectively.[ref]
