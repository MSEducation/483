The 1934 Masters Tournament was the first Masters Tournament, held March 22–25 at Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia. It was officially known as the "Augusta National Invitation Tournament" for its first five editions, but informally as the Masters from the start. Horton Smith won the event with a [tpl]convert|20|ft|0|sing=on[/tpl] birdie putt at the 17th hole (now the 8th hole), and finished at 284 (−4), one stroke ahead of runner-up Craig Wood. (The current nines were reversed in 1934, switched to the current configuration prior to the 1935 event.) Tournament co-founder and host Bobby Jones finished ten strokes back at 294, tied for thirteenth place. The total purse was $5,000 and the winner's share was $1,500.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BbkoAAAAIBAJ&sjid=PWkDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3834%2C2235750 |newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |agency=Associated Press |title=Horton Smith wins; Jones far behind |date=March 26, 1934 |page=13[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PhhWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=YOMDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6691%2C6414928 |newspaper=Spokesman-Review |last=Rice |first=Grantland |authorlink=Grantland Rice |title=Horton Smith captures masters' tourney, Jones outside money |date=March 26, 1934 |page=9[/tpl]
