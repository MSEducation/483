[[Evergreen Game]]

The Evergreen Game is a famous chess game played in Berlin in 1852 between Adolf Anderssen and Jean Dufresne.
Adolf Anderssen was one of the strongest players of his time, and was considered by many to be the world champion after winning the London 1851 tournament. Jean Dufresne, a popular author of chess books, was considered a master of lesser but still considerable skill.Fadul, Jose A.  Lessons in Chess, Lessons in Life.  Lulu Press.  2008. page 59. This was an informal game, like the Immortal Game.
Wilhelm Steinitz later described the game as the "evergreen in Anderssen's laurel wreath", thus giving this game its name. The German word Immergr√ºn (Evergreen), used by Steinitz, refers to a specific evergreen plant, called Periwinkle (Vinca) in English. The symbolic meaning is expressed in the French translation, the "Forever Young Game" (La Toujours Jeune).
