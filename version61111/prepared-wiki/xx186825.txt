"Farther Along" is a Southern Gospel song published by the Stamps-Baxter Music Company. 

==History==

The lyrics to the song were written in 1911 by Rev. W. A. Fletcher, an itinerant preacher, while he was traveling to the Indian Territories by train.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl]  Fletcher was feeling depressed because his wife, Catherine Louise Emmett Fletcher of Cleburne, Texas, was expecting their first-born child in a few weeks and he wouldn't be present for the occasion.  He felt that his priorities were with his ministry in the Indian Territories and wrote the lyrics to reflect his frame of mind at the time.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2008[/tpl]  Sitting next to him on the train was J. R. Baxter, a gospel music promoter who was quite taken with the lyrics that Fletcher was writing and offered him $2.00 for them.  Mr. Baxter subsequently had them put to music and the song has been quite popular in the gospel music arena ever since.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2008[/tpl]

The song deals with a Christian's dismay at the apparent prosperity of the wicked, when contrasted with the suffering of the righteous. The repeated theme is that, "farther along" (in Heaven, perhaps), the truth will be revealed.
The song was copyrighted in 1937, as part of the Starlit Crown collection,[tpl]cite book|title=Teaching the Bible|author=Mark Roncace, Patrick Gray|isbn=1-58983-171-3|page=231|publisher=Society of Biblical Literature|year=2005[/tpl] and was renewed in 1965. It is often erroneously thought of as a folk hymn or as being in the Public Domain.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2008[/tpl]
