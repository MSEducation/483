==British Leyland==

Between 1965 and 1982 Seneffe was the location of a car plant belonging to British Leyland, which in its later years assembled models including the Mini and the Austin Allegro from crated kits shipped from the company's Cowley facility.[tpl]cite journal| authorlink = | title = Deeper into Europe| journal = Autocar | volume =  136 (nbr 3975)| pages = pages 2–3 |date = 22 June 1972[/tpl]  A significant milestone was reached in June 1977 when the plant produced its 500,000th vehicle, an Austin Allegro 1300 Special.[tpl]cite journal| journal = Autocar |volume = 146 (nbr 4205) | authorlink = Ray Hutton (Ed)|title =News:Belgians build ½ -millionth Leyland| pages =  19| date = 11 June 1977[/tpl]  The Seneffe plant was closed in 1982 as the company's aging model range lost market share across Europe, with further loss of demand resulting from the depressed state of the UK economy at the time.   With alternative employment opportunities limited, the plant closure triggered considerable bitterness locally.
