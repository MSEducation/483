Skeleton Skeletron is the 1999 album release by Swedish band Tiamat.
Following A Deeper Kind of Slumber, the band took a less ambiguous direction to their style, utilizing a Gothic metal-based sound but with various atmospheric soundscapes/effects and female background vocals added in.
"Church of Tiamat" (Track #1) is also the name of the band's official website.
The end of the songs "As Long as You Are Mine" and "Lucy" include quotes of French poet Jean de La Fontaine's entire fable Le Loup et lâ€™Agneau (The Wolf and the Lamb)
