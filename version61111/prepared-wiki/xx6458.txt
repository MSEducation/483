Logarithmic scales are useful for quantifying the relative change of a value as opposed to its absolute difference. Moreover, because the logarithmic function log(x) grows very slowly for large x, logarithmic scales are used to compress large-scale scientific data. Logarithms also occur in numerous scientific formulas, such as the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation, the Fenske equation, or the Nernst equation.

===Logarithmic scale===

Scientific quantities are often expressed as logarithms of other quantities, using a logarithmic scale. For example, the decibel is a logarithmic unit of measurement. It is based on the common logarithm of ratios—10 times the common logarithm of a power ratio or 20 times the common logarithm of a voltage ratio. It is used to quantify the loss of voltage levels in transmitting electrical signals,[tpl]Citation|last1=Bakshi|first1=U.

The strength of an earthquake is measured by taking the common logarithm of the energy emitted at the quake. This is used in the moment magnitude scale or the Richter scale.

Semilog (log-linear) graphs use the logarithmic scale concept for visualization: one axis, typically the vertical one, is scaled logarithmically. For example, the chart at the right compresses the steep increase from 1 million to 1 trillion to the same space (on the vertical axis) as the increase from 1 to 1 million. In such graphs, exponential functions of the form [tpl]nowrap begin[/tpl]f(x) = a · bx[tpl]nowrap end[/tpl] appear as straight lines with slope equal to the logarithm of b.
Log-log graphs scale both axes logarithmically, which causes functions of the form [tpl]nowrap begin[/tpl]f(x) = a · xk[tpl]nowrap end[/tpl] to be depicted as straight lines with slope equal to the exponent k.

Psychological studies found that individuals with little mathematics education tend to estimate quantities logarithmically, that is, they position a number on an unmarked line according to its logarithm, so that 10 is positioned as close to 100 as 100 is to 1000. Increasing education shifts this to a linear estimate (positioning 1000 10x as far away) in some circumstances, while logarithms are used when the numbers to be plotted are difficult to plot linearly.[tpl]Citation|last1=Dehaene| first1=Stanislas|last2=Izard|first2=Véronique |last3=Spelke| first3=Elizabeth|last4=Pica| first4=Pierre| title=Log or Linear?

===Probability theory and statistics===

Logarithms arise in probability theory: the law of large numbers dictates that, for a fair coin,  as the number of coin-tosses increases to infinity, the observed proportion of heads approaches one-half. The fluctuations of this proportion about one-half are described by the law of the iterated logarithm.[tpl]Citation | last1=Breiman | first1=Leo | title=Probability | publisher=Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics | location=Philadelphia | series=Classics in applied mathematics | isbn=978-0-89871-296-4 | year=1992[/tpl], section 12.9
Logarithms also occur in log-normal distributions.

C.|title=The lognormal distribution|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-04011-2 |oclc=301100935|year=1969[/tpl] Log-normal distributions are encountered in many fields, wherever a variable is formed as the product of many independent positive random variables, for example in the study of turbulence.[ref]

Logarithms are used for maximum-likelihood estimation of parametric statistical models. For such a model, the likelihood function depends on at least one parameter that must be estimated.  A maximum of the likelihood function occurs at the same parameter-value as a maximum of the logarithm of the likelihood (the "log likelihood"), because the logarithm is an increasing function. The log-likelihood is easier to maximize, especially for the multiplied likelihoods for independent random variables.[tpl]Citation|last1=Rose|first1=Colin|last2=Smith|first2=Murray D.|title=Mathematical statistics with Mathematica|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=Berlin, New York|series=Springer texts in statistics|isbn=978-0-387-95234-5|year=2002[/tpl], section 11.3
Benford's law describes the occurrence of digits in many data sets, such as heights of buildings.

For example, to find a number in a sorted list, the binary search algorithm checks the middle entry and proceeds with the half before or after the middle entry if the number is still not found.

Merge sort algorithms typically require a time approximately proportional to [tpl]nowrap|N · log(N)[/tpl].[tpl]Harvard citations|last = Knuth  | first = Donald|year=1998|loc=section 5.2.4, pp. 158–168|nb=yes[/tpl] The base of the logarithm is not specified here, because the result only changes by a constant factor when another base is used.

A function f(x) is said to grow logarithmically if f(x) is (exactly or approximately) proportional to the logarithm of x. (Biological descriptions of organism growth, however, use this term for an exponential function.[tpl]Citation |last1=Mohr|first1=Hans|last2=Schopfer|first2=Peter|title=Plant physiology|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=Berlin, New York|isbn=978-3-540-58016-4|year=1995[/tpl], chapter 19, p. 298) For example, any natural number N can be represented in binary form in no more than [tpl]nowrap|log2(N) + 1[/tpl] bits. In other words, the amount of memory needed to store N grows logarithmically with N.

===Entropy and chaos===

Entropy is broadly a measure of the disorder of some system. In statistical thermodynamics, the entropy S of some physical system is defined as
The sum is over all possible states i of the system in question, such as the positions of gas particles in a container. Moreover, pi is the probability that the state i is attained and k is the Boltzmann constant. Similarly, entropy in information theory measures the quantity of information. If a message recipient may expect any one of N possible messages with equal likelihood, then the amount of information conveyed by any one such message is quantified as log2(N) bits.[tpl]Citation|last1=Eco|first1=Umberto|author1-link=Umberto Eco|title=The open work  |publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-63976-8|year=1989[/tpl], section III.I
Lyapunov exponents use logarithms to gauge the degree of chaoticity of a dynamical system. For example, for a particle moving on an oval billiard table, even small changes of the initial conditions result in very different paths of the particle. Such systems are chaotic in a deterministic way, because small measurement errors of the initial state predictably lead to largely different final states.[tpl]Citation | last1=Sprott | first1=Julien Clinton | title=Elegant Chaos: Algebraically Simple Chaotic Flows | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=buILBDre9S4C | publisher=World Scientific |location=New Jersey|isbn=978-981-283-881-0| year=2010[/tpl], section 1.9 At least one Lyapunov exponent of a deterministically chaotic system is positive.

===Fractals===

Logarithms occur in definitions of the dimension of fractals.[tpl]Citation|last1=Helmberg|first1=Gilbert|title=Getting acquainted with fractals|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|series=De Gruyter Textbook|location=Berlin, New York|isbn=978-3-11-019092-2|year=2007[/tpl] Fractals are geometric objects that are self-similar: small parts reproduce, at least roughly, the entire global structure. The Sierpinski triangle (pictured) can be covered by three copies of itself, each having sides half the original length. This makes the Hausdorff dimension of this structure [tpl]nowrap begin[/tpl]log(3)/log(2) ≈ 1.58[tpl]nowrap end[/tpl]. Another logarithm-based notion of dimension is obtained by counting the number of boxes needed to cover the fractal in question.

===Music===

Logarithms are related to musical tones and intervals. In equal temperament, the frequency ratio depends only on the interval between two tones, not on the specific frequency, or pitch, of the individual tones. For example, the note A has a frequency of 440 Hz and B-flat has a frequency of 466 Hz. The interval between A and B-flat is a semitone, as is the one between B-flat and B (frequency 493 Hz). Accordingly, the frequency ratios agree:
Therefore, logarithms can be used to describe the intervals: an interval is measured in semitones by taking the [tpl]nowrap|base-21/12[/tpl] logarithm of the frequency ratio, while the [tpl]nowrap|base-21/1200[/tpl] logarithm of the frequency ratio expresses the interval in cents, hundredths of a semitone. The latter is used for finer encoding, as it is needed for non-equal temperaments.[tpl]Citation|last1=Wright|first1=David|title=Mathematics and music|location=Providence, RI|publisher=AMS Bookstore|isbn=978-0-8218-4873-9|year=2009[/tpl], chapter 5

===Number theory===

Natural logarithms are closely linked to counting prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...), an important topic in number theory. For any integer x, the quantity of prime numbers less than or equal to x is denoted π(x). The prime number theorem asserts that π(x) is approximately given by
in the sense that the ratio of π(x) and that fraction approaches 1 when x tends to infinity.[tpl]Citation|last1=Bateman|first1=P.

A far better estimate of π(x) is given by the
offset logarithmic integral function Li(x), defined by
The Riemann hypothesis, one of the oldest open mathematical conjectures, can be stated in terms of comparing π(x) and Li(x).[tpl]Harvard citations|last1=Bateman|first1=P.

==Generalizations==

===Complex logarithm===

The complex numbers a solving the equation
are called complex logarithms. Here, z is a complex number. A complex number is commonly represented as [tpl]nowrap begin[/tpl]z = x + iy[tpl]nowrap end[/tpl], where x and y are real numbers and i is the imaginary unit. Such a number can be visualized by a point in the complex plane, as shown at the right. The polar form encodes a non-zero complex number z by its absolute value, that is, the distance r to the origin, and an angle between the x axis and the line passing through the origin and z. This angle is called the argument of z. The absolute value r of z is
The argument is not uniquely specified by z: both φ and φ' = φ + 2π are arguments of z because adding 2π radians or 360 degrees[tpl]#tag:ref|See radian for the conversion between 2π and 360 degrees.|group=nb[/tpl] to φ corresponds to "winding" around the origin counter-clock-wise by a turn. The resulting complex number is again z, as illustrated at the right. However, exactly one argument φ satisfies {{nowrap|−π Using trigonometric functions sine and cosine, or the complex exponential, respectively, r and φ are such that the following identities hold:[tpl]Citation|last1=Moore|first1=Theral Orvis|last2=Hadlock|first2=Edwin H.|title=Complex analysis|publisher=World Scientific|location=Singapore|isbn=978-981-02-0246-0|year=1991[/tpl], section 1.2
This implies that the [tpl]nowrap|a-th[/tpl] power of e equals z, where
φ is the principal argument Arg(z) and n is an arbitrary integer. Any such a is called a complex logarithm of z. There are infinitely many of them, in contrast to the uniquely defined real logarithm. If [tpl]nowrap begin[/tpl]n = 0[tpl]nowrap end[/tpl], a is called the principal value of the logarithm, denoted Log(z). The principal argument of any positive real number x is 0; hence Log(x) is a real number and equals the real (natural) logarithm. However, the above formulas for logarithms of products and powers do not generalize to the principal value of the complex logarithm.[tpl]Citation | last1=Wilde | first1=Ivan Francis | title=Lecture notes on complex analysis | publisher=Imperial College Press | location=London | isbn=978-1-86094-642-4 | year=2006|url=http://books.google.com/?id=vrWES2W6vG0C&pg=PA97&dq=complex+logarithm#v=onepage&q=complex%20logarithm&f=false[/tpl], theorem 6.1.
The illustration at the right depicts Log(z). The discontinuity, that is, the jump in the hue at the negative part of the x- or real axis, is caused by the jump of the principal argument there. This locus is called a branch cut. This behavior can only be circumvented by dropping the range restriction on φ. Then the argument of z and, consequently, its logarithm become multi-valued functions.

===Inverses of other exponential functions===

Exponentiation occurs in many areas of mathematics and its inverse function is often referred to as the logarithm. For example, the logarithm of a matrix is the (multi-valued) inverse function of the matrix exponential.[tpl]Citation|last1=Higham|first1=Nicholas|author1-link=Nicholas Higham|title=Functions of Matrices. Theory and Computation|location=Philadelphia, PA|publisher=SIAM|isbn=978-0-89871-646-7|year=2008[/tpl], chapter 11. Another example is the p-adic logarithm, the inverse function of the p-adic exponential. Both are defined via Taylor series analogous to the real case.[tpl]Neukirch ANT[/tpl], section II.5. In the context of differential geometry, the exponential map maps the tangent space at a point of a manifold to a neighborhood of that point. Its inverse is also called the logarithmic (or log) map.[tpl]Citation|last1=Hancock|first1=Edwin R.|last2=Martin|first2=Ralph R.|last3=Sabin|first3=Malcolm A.|title=Mathematics of Surfaces XIII: 13th IMA International Conference York, UK, September 7–9, 2009 Proceedings|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0cqCy9x7V_QC&pg=PA379|publisher=Springer|year=2009|page=379|isbn=978-3-642-03595-1[/tpl]
In the context of finite groups exponentiation is given by repeatedly multiplying one group element b with itself. The discrete logarithm is the integer n solving the equation
where x is an element of the group. Carrying out the exponentiation can be done efficiently, but the discrete logarithm is believed to be very hard to calculate in some groups.
