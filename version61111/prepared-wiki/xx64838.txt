The Celtic Catholic Church is a church in the United States. It claims Apostolic Succession from the Archbishop of Canterbury William Sancroft's associates, the non-jurors, specifically those who fled to Wales in the 17th century. It also traces its tradition back to Celtic Christianity and the mission that, according to medieval legend, Saint Joseph of Arimathea took to Glastonbury and the Celts in 36 AD.  The modern church using this name, however, is unable to demonstrate any existence before the 1960s and was incorporated in 1974.  As of 2006, it claims to be "tiny", with one bishop and five congregations (in southern California, Washington state, and Hawai ªi).
The Celtic Catholic Church emphasizes the Nicene and Apostles' Creeds, omitting the filioque clause from the Nicene Creed. Mass is celebrated in English. The canons provide for the ordination of women to the diaconate and priesthood.
