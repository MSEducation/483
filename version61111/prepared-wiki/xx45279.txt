==History==

This area was notorious for highwaymen. In 1736, Stephen Phillips, a robber tried and convicted at the Old Bailey, admitted to the Newgate chaplain to having stolen 150 guineas in gold on the road towards London. In 1786, three men were convicted of the murder of an unknown sailor on his way from London to rejoin his ship, a deed commemorated by several memorials in the area. The perpetrators were hung in chains to warn others on Gibbet Hill, a short walk away on top of the Devil's Punch Bowl. With an increase in traffic and opening of the London to Portsmouth railway line removing much of the road transport of freight, such incidents reduced during the 19th century.Proceedings of the Old Bailey.

Hindhead became a substantial settlement in the late 19th century. In 1904 a temporary mission church was built to serve the new community. An architectural competition to design a permanent church, that of St Albans in Beacon Hill, was held in 1906, and John Duke Coleridge (1879-1934) was chosen as the architect. The first phase, comprising the chancel, north chapel, transept and the lower stage of a projected bell tower, was completed by 1907, and the church gained its own parish in the same year. A series of windows by the Arts and Crafts designers Karl Parsons and Christopher Whall were installed in the unfinished church between 1908 and 1912. The three eastern bays of the nave were consecrated in 1915, but the two western bays were not built until 1929-31; the bell-tower was never completed and became in effect a south transept. There followed two additional stained glass windows: by Christopher Webb in 1945 and by Francis Skeat in 1950. A large vestry extension was added in 1964. A fire in 1999 destroyed the original high altar and reredos paintings.[tpl]cite book|last=Cormack|first=Peter|title=Karl Parsons, 1884-1934: Stained Glass Artist - Exhibition Catalogue|year=1987|publisher=William Morris Gallery|location=London|isbn=9780901974259|pages=24[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Pevsner|first=Sir Nikolaus|title=The Buildings of England: Surrey|year=1982|publisher=Penguin Books|location=Harmondsworth[/tpl]

==Transport==

Until 2011, Hindhead village was situated on the main A3 road between London and Portsmouth. In that year, a £371 million bypass was completed, reducing the amount of traffic passing through the village. This bypass includes the [tpl]convert|1.9|mi|km|adj=on[/tpl] twin-bore tunnel, which is the longest non-estuarial tunnel in the UK.A3 Hindhead Tunnel - Mott MacDonald Project Page
The village is still served by the A287, between Hook and Haslemere, and the A333, a stretch of the former A3 that links the village south to the new bypass. The section of the old A3 north of Hindhead and alongside the Devil's Punch Bowl has since been dug up and the area returned to heathland.
Rail access to Hindhead is through Haslemere railway station, [tpl]convert|3|km[/tpl] away in the town of Haslemere and on the Portsmouth Direct Line between London Waterloo and Portsmouth Harbour stations. Hindhead is served by two hourly bus routes, Stagecoach South 18 and 19, that link Haslemere and Aldershot.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.surreycc.gov.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/173529/Haslemere-Hindhead-Map.pdf | title = Haslemere & Hindhead bus map | publisher = Surrey County Council | accessdate = 2013-08-16[/tpl]
