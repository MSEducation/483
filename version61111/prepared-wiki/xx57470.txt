Dorothy Day, Obl.O.S.B. (November 8, 1897 – November 29, 1980) was an American journalist, social activist, and devout Catholic convert. She advocated the Catholic economic theory of distributism. In the 1930s, Day worked closely with fellow activist Peter Maurin to establish the Catholic Worker Movement, a pacifist movement that continues to combine direct aid for the poor and homeless with nonviolent direct action on their behalf. She served as editor of the Catholic Worker newspaper from 1933 until her death in 1980.
The Catholic Church has opened the cause for Day's canonization and therefore refers to her with the title Servant of God.

==Biography==

===Early years===

Dorothy Day was born on November 8, 1897, in the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. She was born into a family described by one biographer as "solid, patriotic, and middle class".[tpl]cite book|last=Coles |first=Robert |title=Dorothy Day: A Radical Devotion|location=Reading, MA|publisher=Addison-Wesley|year=1987[/tpl] Her father, John Day, was a Tennessee native of Scots-Irish heritage, while her mother, Grace Satterlee, a native of upstate New York, was of English ancestry. Her parents were married in an Episcopal church in Greenwich Village.[tpl]cite book|last=Miller|first=William D.|title=Dorothy Day: A Biography|year=1982|publisher=Harper & Row|location=NY|pages=1–7[/tpl] In 1904, her father, who was a sports writer devoted to horse racing, took a position with a newspaper in San Francisco. The family lived in Oakland, California, until the San Francisco Earthquake of 1906 destroyed the newspaper's facilities and her father lost his job. From the spontaneous response to the earthquake's devastation, the self-sacrifice of neighbors in a time of crisis, Day drew a lesson about individual action and Christian community. The family then relocated to Chicago.[tpl]cite book|last=Miller|first=William D.|title=Dorothy Day: A Biography|year=1982|publisher=Harper & Row |location=NY |pages=9–10, 13–4[/tpl]
Day's parents were nominal Christians who rarely attended church. As a young child, she showed a marked religious streak, reading the Bible frequently. When she was ten she started to attend an Episcopal church, after its rector convinced her mother to let Day's brothers join the church choir. She was taken with the liturgy and its music. She studied the catechism and was baptized and confirmed in that church.[tpl]cite book|last=Forest|first=Jim|title=All is Grace: A Biography of Dorothy Day|year=2011 |publisher=Orbis Books|location=Maryknoll, NY|pages=14–5[/tpl] Day was an avid reader in her teens, particularly fond of Upton Sinclair's The Jungle. She worked from one book to another, noting Jack London's mention of Herbert Spencer in Martin Eden, and then from Spencer to Darwin and Huxley. She learned about anarchy and extreme poverty from Peter Kropotkin, who promoted a belief in cooperation in contrast to Darwin's competition for survival.[tpl]cite book|last=Miller|first=William D.|title=Dorothy Day: A Biography|year=1982|publisher=Harper & Row|location=NY|pages=27–8[/tpl]
In 1914, Day attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign on a scholarship. She was a reluctant scholar. Her reading was chiefly in a Christian radical social direction. She avoided campus social life and supported herself rather than rely on money from her father, buying all her clothing and shoes from discount stores.[tpl]cite news | title = Dorothy Day dead at 83 | url =http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1243&dat=19801201&id=s9ZYAAAAIBAJ&sjid=yPYDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4367,6238981 | work = The Bulletin| page = 61 | date = November 29, 1980[/tpl] She left the university after two years and moved to New York City.Coles (1987), p. 2.

===Social activism===

She settled on the Lower East Side and worked on the staff of several Socialist publications, including The Liberator,[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.catholicworker.org/historytext.cfm?Number=4 | first = Tom | last = Cornell | title = A Brief Introduction to the Catholic Worker Movement | publisher = catholicworker.org | accessdate = February 21, 2009[/tpl] The Masses, and The Call. She "smilingly explained to impatient socialists that she was 'a pacifist even in the class war.'"Vance, Laurence (December 4, 2006) Bill Kauffman: American Anarchist, LewRockwell.com Years later, Day described how she was pulled in different directions: "I was only eighteen, so I wavered between my allegiance to Socialism, Syndicalism (the I.W.W.'s) and Anarchism. When I read Tolstoi I was an Anarchist. My allegiance to The Call kept me a Socialist, although a left-wing one, and my Americanism inclined me to the I.W.W. movement."[tpl]cite book|last=Forest|first=Jim|title=All is Grace: A Biography of Dorothy Day|year=2011 |publisher=Orbis Books|location=Maryknoll, NY|page=30[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Day|first=Dorothy|title=Chapter 6 - New York|url=http://dorothyday.catholicworker.org/articles/206.html|work=From Union Square to Rome|publisher=Dorothy Day Collection|accessdate=January 27, 2014[/tpl] She wrote passionately in support of women's rights, free love, and birth control.
She celebrated the bloodless February Revolution in Russia in 1917, the overthrow of the monarchy and establishment of a reformist government.[tpl]cite book|last=Forest|first=Jim|title=All is Grace: A Biography of Dorothy Day|year=2011 |publisher=Orbis Books|location=Maryknoll, NY|pages=32–3[/tpl] In November 1917, she was arrested for picketing at the White House on behalf of women's suffrage as part of a campaign called the Silent Sentinels organized by Alice Paul and the National Women's Party. Sentenced to 30 days in jail, she served 15 days before being released from prison, ten of them on a hunger strike.[tpl]cite news|title=Suffrage Pickets Freed from Prison |accessdate=January 26, 2014 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F50A1FF73A5E11738DDDA10A94D9415B878DF1D3 |newspaper=New York Times |date=November 28, 1917[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Cat-and-Mouse Remedy for Hunger-Striking |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F60914FE355E11738DDDA00A94D9415B878DF1D3 |accessdate=January 26, 2014|newspaper=New York Times |date=November 29, 1917[/tpl]
She spent several months in Greenwich Village, where she became close to Eugene O'Neill, whom she later credited with having produced "an intensification of the religious sense that was in me".[tpl]cite book|last=Forest|first=Jim|title=All is Grace: A Biography of Dorothy Day|year=2011 |publisher=Orbis Books|location=Maryknoll, NY|pages=44–7[/tpl] She had a love affair of several years with Mike Gold, a radical writer who later became a prominent Communist. She maintained friendships with such prominent American Communists as Anna Louise Strong, and Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, who became the head of the Communist Party USA.
Initially Day lived a bohemian life. In 1920 or 1921, just after ending an unhappy love affair with Lionel Moise and having an abortion, she married Berkeley Tobey in a civil ceremony. She spent a year with him in Europe removed from politics, focused on art and literature, and writing an semi-autobiographical novel, The Eleventh Virgin (1924), based on her affair with Moise. In its "Epilogue", she tried to draw lessons about the status of women from her experience: "I thought I was a free and emancipated young woman and found out I wasn't at all ... Freedom is just a modernity gown, a new trapping that we women affect to capture the man we want."[tpl]cite book|last=Forest|first=Jim |title=All is Grace: A Biography of Dorothy Day|year=2011 |publisher=Orbis Books |location=Maryknoll, NY|pages=56–7[/tpl] Tobey later founded the Literary Guild. She later called it a "very bad book".[tpl]cite book |last=Forest|first=Jim |title=All is Grace: A Biography of Dorothy Day|year=2011 |publisher=Orbis Books |location=Maryknoll, NY|page=65[/tpl] The sale of the movie rights to the novel gave her $2,500, and she bought a beach cottage as a writing retreat in Staten Island, New York.[tpl]cite book|last=Forest|first=Jim |title=All is Grace: A Biography of Dorothy Day|year=2011 |publisher=Orbis Books |location=Maryknoll, NY|pages=65–6[/tpl] Soon she found a new lover, Forster Batterham, an activist and biologist, who joined her there on weekends. She lived there from 1925 to 1929, entertaining friends and enjoying a romantic relationship that foundered when she took passionately to motherhood and religion.[tpl]cite book|last=Forest|first=Jim |title=All is Grace: A Biography of Dorothy Day|year=2011 |publisher=Orbis Books |location=Maryknoll, NY|page=67ff.[/tpl]
Day, who had thought herself sterile following her abortion, was elated to find she was pregnant in mid-1925, while Batterham dreaded fatherhood. While she visited her mother in Florida and separated from Batterham for several months, she intensified her exploration of Catholicism. When she returned to Staten Island, Batterham found her increasing devotion, attendance at Mass, and religious reading incomprehensible. Soon after the birth of their daughter Tamar Teresa, on March 4, 1926, Day encountered a local Catholic nun, Sister Aloysia, and with her help educated herself in the Catholic faith and had her baby baptized in July 1927. Batterham refused to attend the ceremony, and his relationship with Day became increasingly unbearable, as her desire for marriage in the Church confronted his antipathy for organized religion, Catholicism most of all. After one last fight in late December, Day refused to allow him to return. On December 28 she had herself baptized with Sister Aloysia as her godparent.[tpl]cite book|last=Forest|first=Jim|title=All is Grace: A Biography of Dorothy Day|year=2011|publisher=Orbis Books|location=Maryknoll, NY|pages=74–86[/tpl] Her baptism was conditional, because she had already been baptized in the Episcopal Church.A Russian neighbor's sister had named her daughter Tamar, and Day was impressed by St. Teresa of Avila, whose biography she had recently read. [tpl]cite book|last=Miller|first=William D.|title=Dorothy Day: A Biography|publisher=Harper & Row|location=NY|year=1982|page=184[/tpl]
In the summer of 1929, to put the situation with Batterham behind her, Day accepted a job writing film dialogue for Pathé Motion Pictures and moved to Los Angeles with Tamar. A few months later, following the 1929 stock market crash, her contract was not renewed. She returned to New York via a sojourn in Mexico and a family visit in Florida. Day supported herself as a journalist, writing a gardening column for the local paper, the Staten Island Advance and features articles and book reviews for several Catholic publications, like Commonweal.[tpl]cite book|last=Forest |first=Jim|title=All is Grace: A Biography of Dorothy Day|year=2011 |publisher=Orbis Books|location=Maryknoll, NY|pages=90–95 [/tpl]Patrick Jordan, ed., Dorothy Day: Writings from Commonweal 1929-1973 (Liturgical Press, 2002), 1-55

===The Catholic Worker movement===

In 1932, Day met Peter Maurin, the man she always credited as the founder of the movement with which she is identified. Maurin, a French immigrant and something of a vagabond, had entered the Brothers of the Christian Schools in his native France, before emigrating, first to Canada, then to the United States. Despite his lack of formal education, Maurin was a man of deep intellect and decidedly strong views. He had a vision of social justice and its connection with the poor which was partly inspired by St. Francis of Assisi. He had a vision of action based on a sharing of ideas and subsequent action by the poor themselves. Maurin was deeply versed in the writings of the Church Fathers and the papal documents on social matters that had been issued by Pope Leo XIII and his successors. Maurin provided Day with the grounding in Catholic theology of the need for social action they both felt. Years later Day described how Maurin also broadened her knowledge by bringing "a digest of the writings of Kropotkin one day, calling my attention especially to Fields, Factories, and Workshops. Day observed: "I was familiar with Kropotkin only through his Memoirs of a Revolutionist, which had originally run serially in the Atlantic Monthly. She wrote: Oh, far day of American freedom, when Karl Marx could write for the morning Tribune in New York, and Kropotkin could not only be published in the Atlantic, but be received as a guest into the homes of New England Unitarians, and in Jane Addams' Hull House in Chicago!"Loaves and Fishes, 1983 reprint, pp. 13-14.
The Catholic Worker movement started when the first issue of the Catholic Worker appeared on May 1, 1933, priced at one cent, and published continuously since then. It was aimed at those suffering the most in the depths of the Great Depression, "those who think there is no hope for the future", and announced to them that "the Catholic Church has a social program...there are men of God who are working not only for their spiritual but for their material welfare." It accepted no advertising and did not pay its staff. Like many newspapers of the day, including those for which Day had been writing, it an unapologetic example of advocacy journalism. It provided coverage of strikes, explored the working conditions especially of women and blacks, and explicated papal teaching on social issues.Sheila Webb, "Dorothy Day and the Early Years of the Catholic Worker: Social Action through the Pages of the Press", in U.S. Catholic Historian, Vol. 21, No. 3, Summer, 2003, 71-80, JSTOR, accessed January 30, 2014 Its viewpoint was partisan and stories were designed to move its readers to take action locally, for example, by patronizing laundries recommended by the Laundry Workers' Union. Its advocacy of federal child labor laws put it at odds with the American Church hierarchy from its first issue, but Day censored some of Maurin's attacks on the Church hierarchy and tried to have a collection of the paper's issues presented to Pope Pius XI in 1935.Sheila Webb, "Dorothy Day and the Early Years of the Catholic Worker: Social Action through the Pages of the Press", in U.S. Catholic Historian, Vol. 21, No. 3, Summer, 2003, 80-84, JSTOR, accessed January 30, 2014 The paper's principal competitor both in distribution and ideology was the Communist Daily Worker. Day opposed its atheism, its advocacy of "class hatred" and violent revolution, and its opposition to private property. The first issue of the Catholic Worker asked: "Is it not possible to be radical and not atheist?" and celebrated its distribution in Union Square on May Day as a direct challenge to the Communists. Day defended government relief programs like the Civilian Conservation Corps that the Communists ridiculed. The Daily Worker responded by mocking the Catholic Worker for its charity work and for expressing sympathy for landlords when calling evictions morally wrong. In this fight, the Church hierarchy backed Day's movement and Commonweal, a Catholic journal that expressed a wide range of viewpoints, said that Day's background positioned her well for her mission: "There are few laymen in this country who are so completely conversant with Communist propaganda and its exponents."Sheila Webb, "Dorothy Day and the Early Years of the Catholic Worker: Social Action through the Pages of the Press", in U.S. Catholic Historian, Vol. 21, No. 3, Summer, 2003, 84-8, JSTOR, accessed January 30, 2014
Over several decades, the Catholic Worker attracted such writers and editors as Michael Harrington, Ammon Hennacy, Thomas Merton, and Daniel Berrigan. From the publishing enterprise came a "house of hospitality", a shelter that provided food and clothing to the poor of the Lower East Side and then a series of farms for communal living.Coles (1987), pp. 14–15. The movement quickly spread to other cities in the United States and to Canada and the United Kingdom. More than 30 independent but affiliated Catholic Worker communities had been founded by 1941.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.catholicworker.org/communities/commlistall.cfm | title = List of Catholic Worker Communities | publisher = catholicworker.org | accessdate = November 30, 2008[/tpl]
Beginning in 1935, the Catholic Worker began publishing articles that articulated a rigorous and uncompromising pacifist position, breaking with the traditional Catholic doctrine of just war theory. The next year, the two sides that fought the Spanish Civil War roughly approximated two of Day's allegiances, with the Church allied with Franco fighting radicals of many stripes, the Catholic and the worker at war with one another. Day refused to follow the Catholic hierarchy in support of Franco against the Republican forces, which were atheist and anticlerical in spirit, led by anarchists and Communists.[tpl]cite book|last=Forest|first=Jim|title=All is Grace: A Biography of Dorothy Day|year=2011 |publisher=Orbis Books|location=Maryknoll, NY|pages=152–6[/tpl] She acknowledged the martyrdom of priests and nuns in Spain and said she expected the age of revolution she was living in to require more martyrs:[tpl]cite news|last=Day|first=Dorothy |title=Explains CW Stand on Use of Force|url=http://dorothyday.catholicworker.org/articles/216.html|accessdate=January 31, 2014|newspaper=Dorothy Day Collection|date=September 1938[/tpl] 
The paper's circulation fell as many Catholic churches, schools, and hospitals that had previously served as its distribution points withdrew support. Circulation fell from 150,000 to 30,000.Sheila Webb, "Dorothy Day and the Early Years of the Catholic Worker: Social Action through the Pages of the Press", in U.S. Catholic Historian, Vol. 21, No. 3, Summer, 2003, 84, JSTOR, accessed January 30, 2014
In 1939, she published an account of the transformation of her political activism into religiously motivated activism in From Union Square to Rome. She recounted her life story selectively, without providing the details of her early years of "grievous mortal sin" when her life was "pathetic little and mean".[tpl]cite book|last=Day|first=Dorothy|title=From Union Square to Rome: Chapter 1|year=1939|url=http://dorothyday.catholicworker.org/articles/201.html[/tpl] She presented it as an answer to Communist relatives and friends who have asked: "How could you become a Catholic?":

===Activism===

In the early 1940s she became a Benedictine oblate, which gave her a spiritual practice and connection that sustained her throughout the rest of her life. She left the Benedictines for a time to consider joining the Fraternity of Jesus Caritas, which was inspired by the example of Charles de Foucauld. Day felt unwelcome there and disagreed with how meetings were run. When she decided to return to the Benedictines and withdraw as a candidate for the Fraternity, she wrote to a friend: "I just wanted to let you know that I feel even closer to it all, tho it is not possible for me to be a recognized 'Little Sister,' or formally a part of it".All the Way to Heaven: The Selected Letters of Dorothy Day, Robert Ellsberg, ed., Milwaukee: Marquette University Press, p. 301
Day reaffirmed her pacifism following the U.S. declaration of war in 1941 and urged noncooperation in a speech that day:December 8, 1941 speech to the Liberal-Socialist Alliance, New York City, quoted in Sandra J. Sarkela, Susan Mallon Ross, Margaret A. Lowe, From Megaphones to Microphones: Speeches of American Women, 1920-1960, 2003, pp. 191-192 "We must make a start. We must renounce war as an instrument of policy. . . . Even as I speak to you I may be guilty of what some men call treason. But we must reject war. . . . You young men should refuse to take up arms. Young women tear down the patriotic posters. And all of you--young and old--put away your flags." Her January 1942 column was headlined "We Continue Our Christian Pacifist Stand". She wrote:[tpl]cite news|last=Day|first=Dorothy|title=Our Country Passes from Undeclared War to Declared War; We Continue Our Christian Pacifist Stand|url=http://dorothyday.catholicworker.org/articles/868.html|accessdate=January 28, 2014|newspaper=Dorothy Day Collection|date=January 1942[/tpl]  

The circulation of the Catholic Worker, following its loses during the Spanish Civil War, had risen to 75,000, but now plummeted again. The closing of many of the movement's houses around the country, as staff left to join the war effort, showed that Day's pacifism had limited appeal even within the Catholic Worker community.[tpl]cite book |last=Forest|first=Jim|title=All is Grace: A Biography of Dorothy Day|year=2011 |publisher=Orbis Books |location=Maryknoll, NY |pages=161–2[/tpl]
On January 13, 1949, unions representing workers at cemeteries managed by the Archdiocese of New York went on strike. After several weeks, Cardinal Francis Spellman used brothers from the local Maryknoll seminary and then diocesan seminarians under his own supervision to break the strike by digging graves. He called the union action "Communist-inspired". Employees of the Catholic Worker joined the strikers' picket line, and Day wrote Spellman, telling him he was "misinformed" about the workers and their demands, defending their right to unionize and their "dignity as men", which she deemed far more important than any dispute about wages. She begged him to take the first steps to resolve the dispute: "Go to them, conciliate them. It is easier for the great to give in than the poor." Spellman stood fast until the strike ended on March 11 when the union members accepted the Archdiocese's original offer of a 48-hour 6-day work week. Day wrote in the Catholic Worker in April: "A Cardinal, ill-advised, exercised so overwhelming a show of force against the union of poor working men. There is a temptation of the devil to that most awful of all wars, the war between the clergy and the laity." Years later she explained her stance vis-à-vis Spellman: "He is our chief priest and confessor; he is our spiritual leader–of all of us who live here in New York. But he is not our ruler." On March 3, 1951, the Archdiocese ordered Day to cease publication or remove the word Catholic from the name of her publication. She replied with a respectful letter that asserted as much right to publish the Catholic Worker as the Catholic War Veterans had to their name and their own opinions independent of those of the Archdiocese. The Archdiocese took no action, and later Day speculated that perhaps church officials did not want members of the Catholic Worker movement holding prayer vigils for him to relent: "We were ready to go to St. Patrick's, fill up the Church, stand outside it in prayerful meditation. We were ready to take advantage of America's freedoms so that we could say what we thought and do what we believed to be the right thing to do."David L. Gregory, "Dorothy Day, Workers' Rights,and Catholic Authenticity", Fordham Urban Law Journal, Vol 26 Issue 5, 1998, 1371-92, available online

On June 15, 1955, Day joined a group of pacifists in refusing to participate in civil defense drills scheduled that day. Some of them challenged the constitutionality of the law under which they were charged, but Day and six others took the position that their refusal was not a legal dispute but one of philosophy. Day said she was doing "public penance" for the United States' first use of an atom bomb.

Several months later, Day traveled to Cuba and reported her experiences in a four-part series in the Catholic Worker. In the first of these, she wrote: "I am most of all interested in the religious life of the people and so must not be on the side of a regime that favors the extirpation of religion. On the other hand, when that regime is bending all its efforts to make a good life for the people, a naturally good life (on which grace can build) one cannot help but be in favor of the measures taken."[tpl]cite news|last=Day|first=Dorothy|title=Pilgrimage to Cuba--Part I |url=http://dorothyday.catholicworker.org/articles/793.html |accessdate=January 26, 2014|newspaper=Dorothy Day Collection |date=September 1962[/tpl]

Day's account of the Catholic Worker movement, Loaves and Fishes, was published in 1963.
Despite her anti-establishment sympathies, her judgment of the 60s counterculture was nuanced. She enjoyed it when Abbie Hoffman told her she was the original hippie, accepting it as a form of tribute to her detachment from materialism. At the same time she disapproved of many who called themselves hippies. She described some she encountered in 1969 in Minnesota: "They are marrying young–17 and 18, and taking to the woods up by the Canadian border and building houses for themselves–becoming pioneers again." But she recognized in them the self-indulgence of middle-class affluence, people who had "not known suffering" and lived without principles. She imagined how soldiers returning from Vietnam would want to kill them, but thought what the "flower-people" deserved was "prayer and penance".Miller, William D. Dorothy Day: A Biography. San Francisco: Harper & Rowe, 1982, p. 491 Day struggled as a leader with influence but without direct authority over the Catholic Worker houses, even the Tivoli Catholic Worker Farm that she visited regularly. She recorded her frustration in her diary: "I have no power to control smoking of pot, for instance, or sexual promiscuity, or solitary sins."Duty of Delight, 2011, p. 447.
In 1966, Cardinal Spellman visited U.S. troops in Vietnam at Christmas, where he was reported as saying: "This war in Vietnam is ... a war for civilization." Day authored a response in the January 1967 issue of the Catholic Worker that avoided direct criticism but cataloged all the war zones Spellman had visited over the years: "It is not just Vietnam, it is South Africa, it is Nigeria, the Congo, Indonesia, all of Latin America." Visiting was "a brave thing to do", she wrote, and asked: "But oh, God, what are all these Americans doing all over the world so far from our own shores?"[tpl]cite book|last=Roberts |first=Nancy L.|title=Dorothy Day and the Catholic Worker|year=1984|publisher=State Univ of New York Press|page=164 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Wx5A4UE05QYC&pg=PA164&[/tpl]
In 1970, at the height of American participation in the Vietnam War, she described Ho Chi Minh as "a man of vision, as a patriot, a rebel against foreign invaders" while telling a story of a holiday gathering with relatives where one needs "to find points of agreement and concordance, if possible, rather than the painful differences, religious and political."[tpl]cite news|last=Day|first=January|title=On Pilgrimage; Perkinsville|url=http://dorothyday.catholicworker.org/articles/498.html|accessdate=January 28, 2014|newspaper=Dorothy Day Collection|date=January 1970[/tpl]

Despite suffering from poor health, Day visited India, where she met Mother Teresa and saw her work. In 1971, Day visited Poland, the Soviet Union, Hungary, and Romania as part of a group of peace activists,with the financial support of Corliss Lamont, whom she described as a "'pinko' millionaire who lived modestly and helped the Communist Party USA." The Duty of Delight, 2011, pp. 587-588. She met with three members of the Writers' Union and defended Alexander Solzhenitsyn against charges that he had betrayed his country.

Day visited the Kremlin, and she reported: "I was moved to see the names of the Americans, Ruthenberg and Bill Haywood, on the Kremlin Wall in Roman letters, and the name of Jack Reed (with whom I worked on the old Masses), in Cyrillac characters in a flower-covered grave". Ruthenberg was C. E. Ruthenberg, founder of the Communist Party USA. Bill Haywood was a key figure in the IWW.

In 1972, the Jesuit magazine America marked her 75th birthday by devoting an entire issue to Day and the Catholic Worker movement. The editors wrote: "By now, if one had to choose a single individual to symbolize the best in the aspiration and action of the American Catholic community during the last forty years, that one person would certainly be Dorothy Day."[tpl]cite news|last=Krupa|first=Stephen J.|title=Celebrating Dorothy Day|url=http://americamagazine.org/node/145405|accessdate=January 26, 2014|newspaper=America|date=August 27, 2001|quote= Dorothy Day remains, at the dawn of the new millennium, the radical conscience of American Catholicism.[/tpl]

Day made her last public appearance at the Eucharistic Congress held on August 6, 1976, in Philadelphia at a service honoring the U.S. Armed Forces on the Bicentennial of the United States. She spoke about reconciliation and penance, and castigated the organizers for failing to recognize that for peace activists August 6 is the day the first atomic atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, an inappropriate day to honor the military.Eileen Egan, "Dorothy Day: Pilgrim of Peace", in Patrick G.

==Beliefs==

Discussing term anarchism, she wrote: "We ourselves have never hesitated to use the word. Some prefer personalism. But Peter Maurin came to me with Kropotkin in one pocket and St. Francis in the other!"[tpl]cite news|last=Day|first=Dorothy|title=On Pilgrimage; Small is Beautiful|url=http://dorothyday.catholicworker.org/articles/538.html|accessdate=January 28, 2014|newspaper=Dorothy Day Collection|date=February 1974[/tpl]
Day described that anarchists accepted her as someone who shared the values of their movement "because I have been behind bars in police stations, houses of detention, jails and prison farms, ... eleven times, and have refused to pay Federal income taxes and have never voted", but were puzzled by what they saw as her "Faith in the monolithic, authoritarian Church". She reversed the viewpoint and ignored their professions of atheism. She wrote: "I in turn, can see Christ in them even though they deny Him, because they are giving themselves to working for a better social order for the wretched of the earth."[tpl]cite news|last=Day|first=Dorothy|title=On Pilgrimage; A Hard Job|url=http://dorothyday.catholicworker.org/articles/540.html|accessdate=January 28, 2014|newspaper=Dorothy Day Collection|date=May 1974[/tpl]
In the first years of the Catholic Worker, Day provided a clear statement of how her individualism contrasted with Communism:[tpl]cite news|last=Day|first=Dorothy|title=A Restatement of C. W.

[tpl]quote|We believe in widespread private property, the de-proletarianizing of our American people. We believe in the individual owning the means of production, the land and his tools. We are opposed to the "finance capitalism" so justly criticized and condemned by Karl Marx but we believe there can be a Christian capitalism as there can be a Christian Communism.[/tpl] She also stated: "To labor is to pray -- that is the central point of the Christian doctrine of work. Hence, it is that while both Communism and Christianity are moved by 'compassion for the multitude,' the object of communism is to make the poor richer but the object of Christianity is to make the rich poor and the poor holy."(September 1946) "The Church and Work," Catholic Worker.

I can say with warmth that I loved the communist people I worked with and learned much from them.

Others she added with qualifications: "the communal aspect of property as stressed by the early Christians". And she identified differences: "we disagree over and over again with the means chosen to reach their ends". She agreed that "Class war is a fact and one does not need to advocate it", but posed the question of how to respond:

In regard to Fidel Castro's Cuba, she explained: "We are on the side of the revolution. We believe there must be new concepts of property, which is proper to man, and that the new concept is not so new. There is a Christian communism and a Christian capitalism.... We believe in farming communes and cooperatives and will be happy to see how they work out in Cuba.... God bless Castro and all those who are seeing Christ in the poor. God bless all those who are seeking the brotherhood of man because in loving their brothers they love God even though they deny Him."[tpl]cite news|last=Day|first=Dorothy|title=About Cuba |url=http://dorothyday.catholicworker.org/articles/246.html |accessdate=March 30, 2014|newspaper=Dorothy Day Collection |date=July 1961[/tpl]
In the Catholic Worker in May 1951, Day wrote that Marx, Lenin, and  Mao Tse-Tung "were animated by the love of brother and this we must believe though their ends meant the seizure of power, and the building of mighty armies, the compulsion of concentration camps, the forced labor and torture and killing of tens of thousands, even millions." She used them as examples because she insisted that the belief that "all men are brothers" required the Catholic to find the humanity in everyone without exception. She explained that she understood the jarring impact of such an assertion:[tpl]cite news|last=Day|first=Dorothy|title=The Incompatibility of Love and Violence|url=http://dorothyday.catholicworker.org/articles/232.htmlaccessdate=January 31, 2014|newspaper=Dorothy Day Collection|date=May 1951[/tpl] 
In 1970, she emulated Maurin by quoting Che Guevara: "'Let me say, at the risk of seeming ridiculous, that the true revolutionary is guided by great feelings of love.' Che Guevara wrote this, and he is quoted by Chicano youth in El Grito Del Norte."  "On Pilgrimage--Our Spring Appeal," Catholic Worker, May 1970
In the January 1970 Catholic Worker, she wrote that "Neither of the Johnsons thought of our work as charity, in its bad sense, but as a work of justice. In other words we were a revolutionary headquarters rather than a Bowery mission, as most newspapers like to picture us."[tpl]cite news|last=Day|first=Dorothy|title=On Pilgrimage: Mary Johnson|url=http://dorothyday.catholicworker.org/articles/498.html|accessdate=January 31, 2014|newspaper=Dorothy Day Collection|date=January 1970[/tpl]
Bill Kauffman of The American Conservative wrote of Day: "The Little Way. That is what we seek. That—contrary to the ethic of personal parking spaces, of the dollar-sign god—is the American way. Dorothy Day kept to that little way, and that is why we honor her. She understood that if small is not always beautiful, at least it is always human."Dreher, Rod (June 5, 2006) All-American Anarchists, The American Conservative
Day's belief in smallness also applied to the property of others, including the Catholic Church, as when she wrote: "Fortunately, the Papal States were wrested from the Church in the last century, but there is still the problem of investment of papal funds. It is always a cheering thought to me that if we have good will and are still unable to find remedies for the economic abuses of our time, in our family, our parish, and the mighty church as a whole, God will take matters in hand and do the job for us. When I saw the Garibaldi mountains in British Columbia . . . I said a prayer for his soul and blessed him for being the instrument of so mighty a work of God. May God use us!""Hutterite Communities," Catholic Worker (July–August 1969)
Jesuit Daniel Lyons "called Day 'an apostle of pious oversimplification.' He said that the Catholic Worker 'often distorted beyond recognition' the position of the Popes".[tpl]cite book|last=Roberts |first=Nancy L.|title=Dorothy Day and the Catholic Worker|year=1984|publisher=State Univ of New York Press|page=161 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Wx5A4UE05QYC&pg=PA161&[/tpl]
She wrote in one of her memoirs: "I had a conversation with John Spivak, the Communist writer, a few years ago, and he said to me, "How can you believe? How can you believe in the Immaculate Conception, in the Virgin birth, in the Resurrection?" I could only say that I believe in the Roman Catholic Church and all she teaches. I have accepted Her authority with my whole heart. At the same time I want to point out to you that we are taught to pray for final perseverance. We are taught that faith is a gift, and sometimes I wonder why some have it and some do not. I feel my own unworthiness and can never be grateful enough to God for His gift of faith."From Union Square to Rome (1938), pp. 144-45; John Spivak was a leftist and journalist.
In response to press coverage in 1964 of an ongoing dispute between Cardinal James McIntyre of Los Angeles and some of his priests, who criticized him for a lack of leadership on civil rights,[tpl]cite news|title=Story Priest Disputes Coast Cardinal|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=FB0D16FB3F5F107A93CBAB1789D95F408685F9|accessdate=January 31, 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=December 29, 1964[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Priest Who Assailed Cardinal McIntyre Talks at Chancery|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F2081FF63A5415738DDDAE0994DE405B848AF1D3 |accessdate=January 31, 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=June 17, 1964[/tpl]  Day authored an essay on the laity's responsibility to act independently of the church hierarchy. When the Catholic Worker during World War II, she wrote, took a pacifist stance, "Bishop McIntyre merely commented ... 'We never studied these things much in the seminary' ... adding doubtfully, 'There is the necessity of course to inform one's conscience.' " For that attitude, Day added, "our shepherds are to be reproached, that they have not fed their sheep these strong meats ... capable of overcoming all obstacles in their advance to that kind of society where it easier to be good." She instructed her readers: "Let Catholics form their associations, hold their meetings in their own homes, or in a hired hall, or any place else. Nothing should stop them. Let the controversy come out into the open in this way."[tpl]cite news|last=Day|first=Dorothy|title=The Case of Cardinal McIntyre|url=http://dorothyday.catholicworker.org/articles/196.html|accessdate=January 31, 2014|newspaper=Dorothy Day Collection|date=July–August 1964[/tpl]
In September 1963, Day discussed pre-marital sex in her column, warning against those who portrayed it a form of freedom: "The wisdom of the flesh is treacherous indeed." She described herself as "a woman who must think in terms of the family, the need of the child to have both mother and father, who believes strongly that the home is the unit of society" and wrote that:[tpl]cite news|last=Day|first=Dorothy|title=On Pilgrimage: Cuba and Sex|url=http://dorothyday.catholicworker.org/articles/806.html|accessdate=February 2, 2014|newspaper=Dorothy Day Collection|date=September 1963[/tpl] 
In 1968, Day wrote again about sex, responding to the criticisms of Stanley Vishnewski (and other coworkers at the Tivoli farm), "I have no power to control smoking of pot, for instance, or sexual promiscuity, or solitary sins." The situation continued to remain a problem, as Day also documented in her diary:Duty of Delight (2011) pp. 522-523.
For some weeks now my problem is this: What to do about the open immorality (and of course I mean sexual morality) in our midst. It is like the last times—there is nothing hidden that shall not be revealed.But when things become a matter for open discussion, what about example set, that most powerful of all teachers. We have with us now a beautiful woman with children whose husband has taken up with a seventeen-year-old, is divorcing her and starting on a new marriage. She comes to us as to a refuge where by working for others in our community of fifty or more, she can forget once in a while her human misery. . . . 
We have one young one, drunken, promiscuous, pretty as a picture, college educated, mischievous, able to talk her way out of any situation—so far. She comes to us when she is drunk and beaten and hungry and cold and when she is taken in, she is liable to crawl into the bed of any man on the place. We do not know how many she has slept with on the farm. What to do? What to do?"

==Cause for sainthood==

A proposal for Day's canonization was put forth publicly by the Claretian Missionaries in 1983. At the request of Cardinal John J. O'Connor, head of the diocese in which she lived, in March 2000 Pope John Paul II granted the Archdiocese of New York permission to open her cause, allowing her to be called a "Servant of God" in the eyes of the Catholic Church. As canon law requires, the Archdiocese of New York submitted this cause for the endorsement of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, which it received in November 2012.[tpl]cite web|work=Catholic New Service |url=http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/1204800.htm|title=US bishops endorse sainthood cause of Catholic Worker's Dorothy Day|date=November 13, 2012 |accessdate=December 1, 2012[/tpl] Some members of the Catholic Worker Movement objected to the canonization process as a contradiction of Day's own values and concerns.[tpl]cite news | title = Some followers question Day sainthood |url =http://catholic-sf.org/ns.php?newsid=16&id=60819 | work = Catholic San Francisco | date = December 5, 2012 |accessdate=January 27, 2014[/tpl] Pope Benedict XVI, on February 13, 2013, in the closing days of his papacy, cited Day as an example of conversion.

In the Episcopal Church, Day is listed as a person "worthy of commemoration" in the liturgical calendar. The Church's guidelines require waiting until the fiftieth anniversary of a person's death before establishing an official commemoration in the calendar. "Local and regional commemorations" are encouraged.Holy Women, Holy Men: Celebrating the Saints, 2010, appendix, p. 708; Guidelines and Procedures for Continuing Alteration of the Calendar of the Episcopal Church, ibid., pp. 741-746.
