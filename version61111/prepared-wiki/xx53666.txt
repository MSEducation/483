Schwäbisch Hall is a district (Kreis) in the north-east of Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Neighboring districts are (from north clockwise) Main-Tauber, the Bavarian district Ansbach, Ostalbkreis, Rems-Murr and Hohenlohe.

==History==

The district dates back to the Oberamt Schwäbisch Hall, which was created in 1803, when the previously free imperial city Schwäbisch Hall became part of Württemberg. After several minor changes it was converted into a district in 1938. In 1973 it was merged with the district Crailsheim and the area around Gaildorf, which was part of the also dissolved district Backnang.

==Geography==

The two rivers Jagst and Kocher, tributaries to the Neckar, flow through the district. The landscapes covered by the district are the Hohenlohe plain (Hohenloher Ebene), the Swabian-Franconian forest hills (Schwäbisch-Fränkischen Waldberge) and the Frankenhöhe.

==Partnerships==

The district maintains partnerships with the district Delitzsch in the Free State of Saxony and the Polish commune of Zamość.
