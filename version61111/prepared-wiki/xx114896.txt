Heratemita is a genus of the spider family Salticidae (jumping spiders).

==Description==

Females are about 8 mm long, males 5 to 7 mm. The black carapace is wider than long, very rugose and covered with sparse violet squamose hairs. There are four large white patches near the posterior eyes. The abdomen is elongate and also sparsely covered with violet hairs, with three white longitudinal stripes. The legs are slender and black with yellow-gold marks, except for the very robust frontal pair, which are black with yellow tarsi and metatarsi. The large male chelicerae run parallel and then suddenly diverge at right angles.Murphy & Murphy 2000: 284
