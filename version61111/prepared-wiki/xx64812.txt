Hurricane Floyd was a very powerful Cape Verde-type hurricane which struck the east coast of the United States. It was the sixth named storm, fourth hurricane, and third major hurricane in the 1999 Atlantic hurricane season. Floyd triggered the third largest evacuation in US history (behind Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Rita, respectively) when 2.6 million coastal residents of five states were ordered from their homes as it approached. The Cape Verde-type hurricane formed off the coast of Africa and lasted from September 7 to September 19, peaking in strength as a very strong Category 4 hurricane—just 2 mph short of the highest possible rating on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. It was among the largest Atlantic hurricanes of its strength ever recorded.
Floyd was once forecast to strike Florida, but turned away. Instead, Floyd struck The Bahamas at peak strength, causing heavy damage. It then paralleled the East Coast of the United States, causing massive evacuations and costly preparations from Florida through the Mid-Atlantic states. The storm weakened significantly, however, before striking Cape Fear, North Carolina as a very strong Category 2 hurricane, and caused further damage as it traveled up the Mid-Atlantic region and into New England.
The hurricane produced torrential rainfall in Eastern North Carolina, adding more rain to an area hit by Hurricane Dennis just weeks earlier. The rains caused widespread flooding over a period of several weeks; nearly every river basin in the eastern part of the state exceeded 500-year flood levels. In total, Floyd was responsible for 57 fatalities and $4.5 billion (1999 USD; $[tpl]Formatprice|[tpl]Inflation|US|4500000000|1999[/tpl][/tpl] [tpl]#time:Y[/tpl] USD) in damage. Due to the destruction, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Floyd.

==Meteorological history==

Floyd originated as a tropical wave that exited the coast of Africa on September 2. It moved steadily westward and remained disorganized and devoid of deep convection until September 7, when a curved band of deep convection developed over the center in response to a developing anticyclone. At this point, the National Hurricane Center designated it as Tropical Depression Eight, while it was approximately [tpl]convert|1000|mi|km|abbr=on[/tpl] east of the Lesser Antilles. A strong ridge of high pressure to its north forced the developing tropical cyclone westward over warmer waters, allowing it to strengthen to Tropical Storm Floyd on September 8.[tpl]cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|year=1999|title=Preliminary Report: Hurricane Floyd|publisher =NOAA|accessdate=October 4, 2008|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/1999floyd.html[/tpl]
Although a large storm, Floyd initially lacked a well-defined inner core, resulting in slow strengthening and preventing rapid intensification. On September 10 it organized enough to reach hurricane status, and Floyd approached major hurricane strength on September 11 while north of the Leeward Islands. The central Atlantic upper tropospheric trough, along with an upper-level low in the eastern Caribbean Sea, produced vertical wind shear over the hurricane and caused its winds to weaken to [tpl]convert|85|mph|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl]. A turn to the west, caused by building of high pressures, was followed by a period of rapid intensification: in 24 hours maximum sustained winds increased from [tpl]convert|110|to|155|mph|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl], All wind speeds in the article are maximum sustained winds sustained for one minute, unless otherwise noted. while the pressure dropped to [tpl]convert|921|mb|hPa inHg|abbr=on|lk=on[/tpl] by morning on September 13, the third lowest pressure for a hurricane not to reach Category 5 intensity in the Atlantic Ocean—only Hurricane Opal and Hurricane Gloria had lower pressures than Floyd.[tpl]Atlantic hurricane best track[/tpl] One contributor to the intensification was the high oceanic heat content along the storm's path.
Hurricane Floyd remained just below Category 5 status on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale for 12 hours while crossing The Bahamas, making landfalls on Eleuthera and Abaco islands, before an eyewall replacement cycle weakened it to a Category 3 hurricane with winds of [tpl]convert|120|mph|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl]. The new, larger eyewall contracted slightly, and the hurricane briefly re-intensified to Category 4 status. A strong mid- to upper-level trough eroded the western portion of the high-pressure ridge, steering Floyd to the northwest. It paralleled the eastern Florida coast [tpl]convert|110|mi|km[/tpl] off shore, and steadily weakened because of entrainment of dry air and upper-level shear. The storm remained extremely large, however; at its peak, tropical storm-force winds spanned a diameter of [tpl]convert|580|mi|km|abbr=on[/tpl], making Floyd one of the largest Atlantic hurricanes of its intensity ever recorded.[tpl]cite web|author=Herring, David|year=2000|title=Hurricane Floyd's Lasting Legacy|publisher=NASA|accessdate=October 4, 2008|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Study/FloydIntro/[/tpl]
Floyd accelerated to the north and northeast, and weakened greatly to a Category 2 hurricane. It made landfall in Cape Fear, North Carolina with winds of [tpl]convert|105|mph|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl] on September 16. After crossing over North Carolina and southeastern Virginia, it briefly re-entered the western Atlantic Ocean before reaching Long Island on September 17. The storm gradually lost its tropical characteristics due to an approaching frontal zone and became extratropical over southern Maine late on September 17. The extratropical storm continued to the northeast, and after passing over the Canadian Maritimes, it was absorbed by a cold front to the east of Newfoundland.
 

==Preparations==

Although Floyd's track prediction was above average while out at sea, the forecasts as it approached the coastline were merely average compared to forecasts from the previous ten years. The official forecasts did not predict Floyd's northward track nor its significant weakening before landfall.[tpl]cite web| author = National Weather Service| year = 2000| title = Service Assessment: Hurricane Floyd Floods of September 1999| publisher = NOAA| accessdate = October 4, 2008| url = http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/assessments/pdfs/floyd.pdf| format = PDF[/tpl] Nearly all of the East Coast, from Florida City, Florida, to Plymouth, Massachusetts, was under a Hurricane Warning at some point; however, only a fraction of this area actually received hurricane-force winds. The last time such widespread hurricane warnings occurred was during Hurricane Donna in 1960, although the warnings for that storm were accurate.
Initial fears were of a direct hit as a large Category 4 hurricane in Florida, potentially costlier and deadlier than Hurricane Andrew had been in 1992. In preparation for a potentially catastrophic landfall, more than one million Florida residents were told to evacuate, of which 272,000 were in Miami-Dade County.[tpl]cite news| title = 'Very, very dangerous' Floyd heads toward Florida| publisher = CNN| date = September 14, 1999| accessdate = October 4, 2008| url = http://www-cgi.cnn.com/WEATHER/9909/13/floyd.06/index.html[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] U.S. President Bill Clinton declared a federal state of emergency in both Florida and Georgia in anticipation of the storm's approach.[tpl]cite news| title = Floyd keeps US guessing| newspaper = BBC News| date = September 15, 1999| accessdate = October 4, 2008| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/446419.stm[/tpl] As the storm turned to the north, more people were evacuated as a progressively larger area was threatened. The massive storm caused what was at the time the largest peacetime evacuation ever in the U.S., with around 2.6 million evacuating coastal areas in Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas.[tpl]cite web| author = National Climatic Data Center| year = 1999| title = Climate-Watch, September 1999| publisher = NOAA| accessdate = October 4, 2008| url = http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/extremes/1999/september/extremes0999.html[/tpl]
With the storm predicted to hit near Cape Canaveral with winds of over [tpl]convert|140|mph|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl], all but 80 of Kennedy Space Center's 12,500-person workforce were evacuated. The hangars that house three space shuttles can withstand winds of only [tpl]convert|105|mph|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl], and a direct hit could have resulted in potentially billions of dollars in damage of space equipment, draining funds of an already money-strained government organization.[tpl]cite web| author = Kenneth Silber| year = 1999| title = Bracing for Impact| publisher = space.com| accessdate = October 4, 2008| url = http://www.space.com/news/floyd_team.html[/tpl] In the theoretical scenario, the damage would be caused by water, always a potential problem in an area only nine feet above sea level. If water entered the facility, it would damage the electronics as well as requiring a complete inspection of all hardware.[tpl]cite web| author = Jonathan Lipman| year = 1999| title = Storm May Further Jeopardize NASA Budget| publisher = space.com| accessdate = October 4, 2008| url = http://www.space.com/news/floyd_washington.html[/tpl] When Floyd actually passed by the area, Kennedy Space Center only reported light winds with minor water intrusion.

A hurricane warning was issued for the North Carolina coastline 27 hours prior to landfall. However, due to the size of the storm, initial forecasts predicted nearly all of the state would be affected in one form or another. School systems and businesses as far west as Asheville shut down for the day landfall was predicted, but, as it turned out, only the Coastal Plain sustained significant damage; much of the state west of Raleigh escaped unscathed. In New York City, public schools were closed on September 16, 1999, the day Floyd hit the area. This was a rare decision by the city, as New York City public schools close on average once every few years. Before Floyd, the last time New York City closed its schools was for the Blizzard of 1996. After Floyd, the next time its public schools would close was due to a blizzard on March 5, 2001.http://articles.nydailynews.com/2001-03-05/news/18165234_1_snow-bad-weather-newark-airport

==Impact==

With a death toll of 57, Hurricane Floyd was the deadliest United States hurricane since Hurricane Agnes in 1972. The storm also was one of the costliest in the nation's history, amounting to $4.5 billion (1999 USD; $5.3 billion in 2006 U.S. dollars). Most of the deaths and damage were from inland, freshwater flooding in eastern North Carolina.

===Bahamas===

Hurricane Floyd lashed the Bahamas with winds of [tpl]convert|155|mph|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl] and waves up to [tpl]convert|50|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] in height. A [tpl]convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on|sigfig=3[/tpl] storm surge inundated many islands with over five ft (1.5 m) of water throughout. The wind and waves toppled power and communication lines, severely disrupting electricity and telephone services for days. Damage was greatest at Abaco Island, Cat Island, San Salvador Island, and Eleuthera Island, where Floyd uprooted trees and destroyed a significant number of houses.[tpl]cite web|author=Wahlstrom, Margareta|year=1999|title=Bahamas: Hurricane Floyd — Preliminary appeal #23/99|publisher=International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies|accessdate= October 4, 2008|url=http://www.ifrc.org/docs/appeals/99/2399.pdf|format=PDF[/tpl] Numerous restaurants, hotels, shops, and homes were devastated, severely limiting in the recovery period tourism on which many rely for economic well-being.[tpl]cite web|author=Agence France-Presse|year=1999|title=Battered Bahamas start difficult clean-up in Floyd's wake|publisher=ReliefWeb|accessdate=October 4, 2008|url=http://wwwnotes.reliefweb.int/w/rwb.nsf/480fa8736b88bbc3c12564f6004c8ad5/e33c7aea8a47adb6c12567ef00512bfb[/tpl] Damaged water systems left tens of thousands across the archipelago without water, electricity, or food. Despite the damage, however, few deaths were reported, as only one person drowned in Freeport, and there were few injuries reported.
To help the affected citizens, the Bahamian Red Cross Society opened 41 shelters, though within one week many returned home.[tpl]cite web|author=UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs|year=1999|title=Bahamas — Hurricane Floyd OCHA Situation Report No. 2|publisher=ReliefWeb|accessdate=October 4, 2008|url=http://wwwnotes.reliefweb.int/w/rwb.nsf/480fa8736b88bbc3c12564f6004c8ad5/e1c7c486c86145e3852567f3005ae380[/tpl] The Bahamas required $435,000 (1999 USD; $[tpl]Formatprice|[tpl]Inflation|US|435000|1999[/tpl][/tpl] [tpl]#time:Y[/tpl] USD) in aid following the storm, much of it in food parcels.

===Southeastern United States===

Although over a million Florida residents were evacuated, the state was only lightly affected by Hurricane Floyd. Strong waves and tropical storm-force winds resulted in significant beach erosion on the east coast of Florida, as well as the loss of some boat piers in Brevard and Volusia Counties. Moderate rainfall occurred along the coastline, amounting to a maximum of [tpl]convert|3.2|in|mm|abbr=on[/tpl] in Sanford. Floyd's winds downed hundreds of trees, damaging 357 houses. Damage in northeast Florida amounted to $46.5 million (1999 USD; $[tpl]Formatprice|[tpl]Inflation|US|46500000|1999[/tpl][/tpl] [tpl]#time:Y[/tpl] USD), a fraction of what was originally expected.
The states of Georgia and South Carolina, although threatened by the storm, were largely spared when it turned northward. Some areas of eastern South Carolina reported up to [tpl]convert|16|in|mm|abbr=on[/tpl] of rain.

===North Carolina===

North Carolina received the brunt of the storm's destruction. In all, Hurricane Floyd caused 35 fatalities in North Carolina, much of them from freshwater flooding, as well as billions in damage.
The storm surge from the large hurricane amounted to [tpl]convert|9|–|10|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] along the southeastern portion of the state. The hurricane also spawned numerous tornadoes, most of which caused only minor damage. Damage to power lines left over 500,000 customers without electricity at some point during the storm's passage.
Just weeks prior to Floyd hitting, Hurricane Dennis brought up to [tpl]convert|15|in|mm|abbr=on[/tpl] of rain to southeastern North Carolina. When Hurricane Floyd moved across the state in early September, it produced torrential rainfall, amounting to a maximum of [tpl]convert|19.06|in|mm|abbr=on[/tpl] in Wilmington. Though it moved quickly, the extreme rainfall was due to Floyd's interaction with an approaching cold front across the area.
Extensive flooding led to overflowing rivers; nearly every river basin in eastern North Carolina reached 500 year or greater flood levels. Most localized flooding happened overnight; Floyd dropped nearly [tpl]convert|17|in|mm|abbr=on[/tpl] of rain during the hours of its passage and many residents were not aware of the flooding until the water came into their homes. The National Guard and the Coast Guard performed nearly 1700 fresh water rescues of people trapped on the roofs of their homes due to the rapid rise of the water. By contrast, many of the worst affected areas did not reach peak flood levels for several weeks after the storm, as the water accumulated in rivers and moved downstream (see flood graphic at right).
The passage of Hurricane Irene four weeks later contributed an additional six in (150 mm) of rain over the still-saturated area, causing further flooding.
