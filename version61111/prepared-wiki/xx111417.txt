==Membership requirements==

Membership in the Animation Guild can be acquired in either of two ways:

===Membership by employment===

Animation artists, writers and technicians who are hired by employers signed to Guild CBAs will be required to join the Guild after thirty days' employment. The one-time initiation fee consists of two weeks' minimum scale wages for the job category in which the applicant has been hired.
Dues are charged quarterly and are also based upon the scale rate for the job category as of the beginning of the quarter. As of August 2008 the highest dues rate is $101.00.

===Membership by organizing===

Animation artists, writers and technicians who are employed by companies that do not have TAG agreements, may become members if and when the company is organized. Potential members may assist the Guild in its organizing efforts by signing a confidential representation card.
After the employer is organized and signed to a collective bargaining agreement, employees often are brought into membership without initiation fees.
