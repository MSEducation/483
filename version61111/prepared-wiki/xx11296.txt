[[Starship Enterprise]]

CATEGORIES: Star Trek ships, Star Trek lists

The Enterprise or USS ''Enterprise (often referred to as the "'starship Enterprise'") is the name of several fictional spacecraft, some of which are the main setting for various television series and films in the Star Trek'' science fiction franchise.

==Development==

According to The Star Trek Encyclopedia, the registry number "NCC-1701" was devised by Matt Jefferies, art director of the first Star Trek series, inspired by an old science fiction cover that Gene Roddenberry liked, with a starship flying through space. Jefferies, who was a pilot, based NCC on 20th century aircraft registration codes. In such 20th century usage, an "N" first letter refers to an aircraft registered in the USA. A "C" for a second letter refers to a civil aircraft. Jefferies added a second "C" because he thought it looked better.[tpl]cite book|title=The Star Trek Encyclopedia|first=Michael|last=Okuda|authorlink=Michael Okuda|coauthors=Denise Okuda and Debbie Mirek|publisher=Pocket Books|isbn=0-671-53609-5|year=1999[/tpl]
The Franz Joseph Blueprints, the book The Making of Star Trek and a handful of Star Trek novels state that NCC is an initialism for "Naval Construction Contract".
In an interview with the BBC, Jefferies explained that NC was a US designation for commercial vehicles. The Russians used CC CC. He concluded that as common opinion was that any future major space projects would be a combined effort, he would use a combined designation NCC. The 1701 had two functions, it represented the first (01) ship of a 17th federation cruiser design, and that the digits were unlikely to be misread, unlike 6, 8, or 9.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/st/interviews/jefferies/page6.shtml |title=BBC Online - Cult - Star Trek - Matt Jefferies - Why NCC-1701? |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |accessdate=August 21, 2013[/tpl]
In Gene Roddenberry's original Star Trek pitch, the starship is described as a "United Space Ship," and in two episodes of The Original Series (TOS), Kirk refers to the "United Space Ship Enterprise".

===Star Trek: Phase II===

Before Star Trek: The Motion Picture, Paramount had planned a new Star Trek television series to have been named Star Trek: Phase II. Early in the production, Ralph McQuarrie had been hired to redesign the ship. The major feature of the redesign was to replace the cigar-shaped secondary hull with a larger, triangle-shaped section. McQuarrie's design was discarded in favor of keeping the general shape of the ship intact.
