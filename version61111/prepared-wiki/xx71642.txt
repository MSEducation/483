In 1637, Governor De L’Olive conceded a parcel of land to the Dominican monks, from the Fathers’ river to that of Baillif, and today these mark out the boundary of the town. Under the leadership of Father Labat, several fortresses were built in Baillif to protect the region from English invasion. The Dominicans came to preach the good news of Jesus.
The commune is named after an early inhabitant, Robert Baillif. Baillif traded in the area from 1650 to about 1700.
