George William "Bill" James (born 5 October 1949) is an American baseball writer, historian, and statistician whose work has been widely influential.  Since 1977, James has written more than two dozen books devoted to baseball history and statistics. His approach, which he termed sabermetrics in reference to the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR),Steve Sullivan, State of the Art: The Actuarial Game of Baseball, http://www.contingencies.org/mayjun04/stat.pdf scientifically analyzes and studies baseball, often through the use of statistical data, in an attempt to determine why teams win and lose. His Baseball Abstract books in the 1980s are the modern predecessor to websites using sabermetrics such as Baseball Prospectus and Baseball Primer (now Baseball Think Factory).Lewis, M: Moneyball p. 235, Norton Press, 2004.
In 2006, Time named him in the Time 100 as one of the most influential people in the world.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1187260,00.html|publisher=Time|date=30 April 2006|title=Bill James | accessdate=26 April 2010 | first=John | last=Henry[/tpl] He is currently a Senior Advisor on Baseball Operations for the Boston Red Sox. In 2010, Bill James was inducted into the Irish American Baseball Hall of Fame.

==Early life==

James was born in Holton, Kansas; he never knew his mother, who died in 1954. After four years at the University of Kansas residing at Stephenson Scholarship hall, James joined the Army in 1971. He was the last person in Kansas to be sent to fight in the Vietnam War, although he never saw action there. Instead, he spent two years stationed in South Korea, during which time he wrote to KU about taking his final class. He was told he actually had met all his graduation requirements, so he returned to Lawrence in 1973 with degrees in English and economics. He also finished an Education degree in 1975, likewise from the University of Kansas.http://topmlbprospects.net/bill-james-bio/

==The Bill James Baseball Abstracts==

An aspiring writer and obsessive fan, James began writing baseball articles after leaving the United States Army in his mid-twenties.  Many of his first baseball writings came while he was doing night shifts as a security guard at the Stokely-Van Camp's pork and beans cannery.  Unlike most writers, his pieces did not recount games in epic terms or offer insights gleaned from interviews with players.  A typical James piece posed a question (e.g., "Which pitchers and catchers allow runners to steal the most bases?"), and then presented data and analysis written in a lively, insightful, and witty style that offered an answer.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2007[/tpl]
Editors considered James's pieces so unusual that few believed them suitable for their readers. In an effort to reach a wider audience, James self-published an annual book titled The Bill James Baseball Abstract beginning in 1977.  The first edition of the book presented 80 pages of in-depth statistics compiled from James's study of box scores from the preceding season and was offered for sale through a small advertisement in  The Sporting News.
Over the next three years James's work won respect, including a very favorable review by Daniel Okrent in Sports Illustrated.[tpl]cite news| url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1124493/index.htm | work=CNN | title=He Does It by the Numbers | date=25 May 1981 | accessdate=26 April 2010[/tpl] New annual editions added essays on teams and players.  By 1982 sales had increased tenfold, and a media conglomerate agreed to publish and distribute future editions.
While writers had published books about baseball statistics before (most notably Earnshaw Cook's Percentage Baseball, in the 1960s), few had ever reached a mass audience. Attempts to imitate James's work spawned a flood of books and articles that continues to this day.

==Post-Abstracts work==

In 1988, James ceased writing the Abstract, citing workload-related burnout and concern about the volume of statistics on the market.  He has continued to publish hardcover books about baseball history, which have sold well and received admiring reviews.  These books include three editions of The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract (1985, 1988, 2001, the last entitled The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract.)
James has also written several series of new annuals:

In 2008, James launched Bill James Online. Subscribers can read James' new, original writing and interact with one another —- as well as with James —- in a question-and-answer format. The web site also offers new "profiles" of teams and players full of facts and statistics that hope to one day map what James has termed "the lost island of baseball statistics."

==Innovations==

Among the statistical innovations attributable to James are:
Although James may be best known as an inventor of statistical tools, he has often written on the limitations of statistics and urged humility concerning their place amidst other kinds of information about baseball.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2010[/tpl] To James, context is paramount: he was among the first to emphasize the importance of adjusting traditional statistics for park factors and to stress the role of luck in a pitcher's win-loss record.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2010[/tpl] Many of his statistical innovations are arguably less important than the underlying ideas. When he introduced the notion of secondary average, it was as a vehicle for the then-counterintuitive concept that batting average represents only a fraction of a player's offensive contribution. (The runs-created statistic plays a similar role vis-à-vis the traditional RBI.) Some of his contributions to the language of baseball, like the idea of the "defensive spectrum", border on being entirely non-statistical.

==STATS, Inc.==

In an essay published in the 1984 Abstract, James vented his frustration about Major League Baseball's refusal to publish play-by-play accounts of every game. James proposed the creation of Project Scoresheet, a network of fans that would work together to collect and distribute this information.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl]
While the resulting non-profit organization never functioned smoothly, it worked well enough to collect accounts of every game from 1984 through 1991. James's publisher agreed to distribute two annuals of essays and data – the 1987 and 1988 editions of Bill James Presents The Great American Baseball Statbook (though only the first of these featured writing by James).
The organization was eventually disbanded, but many of its members went on to form for-profit companies with similar goals and structure. STATS, Inc., the company James joined, provided data and analysis to every major media outlet before being acquired by Fox Sports in 2001.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]

==Acceptance and employment in mainstream baseball==

Oakland Athletics general manager Billy Beane began applying sabermetric principles to running his low-budget team in the late 1990s, to notable effect, as chronicled in Michael Lewis' book Moneyball.
In 2003, James was hired by a former reader, John Henry, the new owner of the Boston Red Sox.
One point of controversy was in handling the relief pitching of the Red Sox.Baseball Prospectus 2005, pp.69–70 James had previously published analysis of the use of the closer in baseball, and had concluded that the traditional use of the closer both overrated the abilities of that individual, and used him in suboptimal circumstances. He wrote that it is "far better to use your relief ace when the score is tied, even if that is the seventh inning, than in the ninth inning with a lead of two or more runs."Baseball Prospectus 2005, p.66 The Red Sox in 2003 staffed their bullpen with several marginally talented relievers.Baseball Prospectus 2005, p.69 Red Sox manager Grady Little was never fully comfortable with the setup, and designated unofficial closers and reshuffled roles after a bad outing. When Boston lost a number of games due to bullpen failures, Little reverted to a traditional closer approach and moved Byung-Hyun Kim from being a starting pitcher to a closer.Baseball Prospectus 2005, p.70 The Red Sox did not follow James' idea of a bullpen with no closer, but with consistent overall talent that would allow the responsibilities to be shared. Red Sox reliever Alan Embree thought the plan could have worked if the bullpen had not suffered injuries. During the 2004 regular season Keith Foulke was used primarily as a closer in the conventional model; however, Foulke's usage in the 2004 postseason was along the lines of a relief ace with multiple inning appearances at pivotal times of the game.Baseball Prospectus 2005, p.64 Houston Astros manager Phil Garner also employed a relief ace model with his use of Brad Lidge in the 2004 postseason.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2011[/tpl]
[tpl]As of|2014[/tpl], James is still employed by the Red Sox,http://nesn.com/2014/02/bill-james-will-middlebrooks-primed-for-monster-season-with-red-sox/ having published several new sabermetric books during his tenure (see Bibliography, below). Indeed, although James is typically tight-lipped about his activities on behalf of the Red Sox, he is credited with advocating some of the moves that led to the team's first World Series championship in 86 years, including the signing of non-tendered free agent David Ortiz, the trade for Mark Bellhorn, and the team's increased emphasis on on-base percentage.
After the Red Sox suffered through a disastrous 2012 season, Henry stated that James had fallen "out of favor the front office over the last few years for reasons I really don't understand. We've gotten him more involved recently in the central process and that will help greatly."http://hardballtalk.nbcsports.com/2012/09/05/bill-james-to-assume-a-more-prominent-role-in-the-red-sox-front-office/
During his time with the Red Sox, Bill James has received three World Series rings for the team's 2004, 2007, and 2013 victories.

==In culture==

James was profiled on 60 Minutes on 30 March 2008, in his role as a sabermetric pioneer and Red Sox advisor.
Michael Lewis, in his book Moneyball, dedicates a chapter to James' career and Sabermetrics as background for his portrayal of Billy Beane and the Oakland Athletics' unlikely success.
James made a guest appearance on the Simpsons episode "MoneyBART".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nesn.com/2010/10/sabermetrician-bill-james-pokes-fun-at-himself-on-the-simpsons.html|title=Sabermetrician Bill James Pokes Fun at Himself on 'The Simpsons'|author=Hurley, Michael|publisher=NESN|date=11 October 2010|accessdate=6 September 2011[/tpl]
Steven Soderbergh's planned film adaptation of Moneyball would have featured an animated version of James as a "host".http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2009/05/06/exclusive-steven-soderbergh-to-use-animated-bill-james-character-in-moneyball/  This script was discarded when director Bennett Miller and writer Aaron Sorkin succeeded Soderbergh on the project.
Ultimately, the film as produced mentions James several times. His unlikely bio is briefly recapped, and Billy Beane is depicted telling John Henry that Henry's hiring of James is the reason Beane is interested in the Red Sox general manager job.

==Dowd Report controversy==

In his Baseball Book 1990, James heavily criticized the methodology of the Dowd Report, which was an investigation (commissioned by baseball commissioner Bart Giamatti) on the gambling activities of Pete Rose.  James reproached commissioner Giamatti and his successor, Fay Vincent, for their acceptance of the Dowd Report as the final word on Rose's gambling. (James' attitude on the matter surprised many fans, especially after the writer had been deeply critical of Rose in the past, especially what James considered to be Rose's selfish pursuit of Ty Cobb's all-time record for base hits.)
James expanded his defense of Rose in his 2001 book The New Historical Baseball Abstract, with a detailed explanation of why he found the case against Rose flimsy. James wrote "I would characterize the evidence that Rose bet on baseball as...well, not quite non-existent. It is extremely weak."  This countered the popular opinion that the case against Rose was a slam dunk, and several critics claimed that James misstated some of the evidence in his defense of Rose. Derek Zumsteg of Baseball Prospectus wrote an exhaustive review of the case James made and concluded: "James' defense of Rose is filled with oversights, errors in judgment, failures in research, and is a great disservice to the many people who have looked to him for a balanced and fair take on this complicated and important issue."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseballprospectus.com/news/20021031zumsteg.shtml|publisher=Baseball Prowspectus|date=31 October 2002|title=Evaluating the Dowd Report |first=Derek | last=Zumsteg[/tpl]
In 2004, Rose admitted publicly that he had bet on baseball and confirmed the Dowd Report was correct. James remained steadfast, continuing to insist that the evidence available to Dowd at the time was insufficient to reach the conclusion that it did.

==Paterno controversy==

On 4 November 2011, Jerry Sandusky was indicted for committing sex crimes against young boys, which brought the Penn State child sex abuse scandal to national attention.  On 11 December 2011, James published an article called "The Trial of Penn State", depicting an imaginary trial in which Penn State defended itself against charges of "acting rashly and irresponsibly in the matter of Joe Paterno, in such a manner that they defamed, libeled and slandered Paterno, unfairly demolishing his reputation."http://www.billjamesonline.com/the_trial_of_penn_state/?AuthorId=3&Month=12&Year=2011
On 12 July 2012, the Freeh report was released, charging Paterno and three other University officials with covering up reports of sexual assaults and enabling the attacker to prey on other children for more than a decade, often in Penn State facilities.  Soon afterwards, during an interview on ESPN radio, James claimed that the Freeh report's characterizations of Paterno as a powerful figure were wrong, and that it wasn't Paterno's responsibility to report allegations of child molestation to the police. "Paterno had very few allies. He was isolated and he was not nearly as powerful as people imagine him to have been."[tpl]cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/boston/red-sox/post/_/id/20968/sox-advisor-bill-james-defends-paterno|publisher=ESPN|date=12 July 2012|title=Sox advisor Bill James defends Paterno[/tpl] When asked if he knew anyone who had showered with a boy they were not related to, James said it was a common practice when he was growing up.  "That was actually quite common in the town I grew up in. That was quite common in America 40 years ago."[tpl]cite web|url=http://hardballtalk.nbcsports.com/2012/07/14/bill-james-doubles-down-on-the-joe-paterno-defense/|publisher=NBC Sports|date=14 July 2012|title=Bill James doubles down on the Joe Paterno defense[/tpl]

==Other activities==

James is a fan of the University of Kansas men's basketball team and has written about basketball. He has created a formula for what he calls a "safe lead" in the sport.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2185975/|publisher=Slate|date=17 March 2008|title=The Lead is Safe[/tpl]
James has written a true crime book titled Popular Crime: Reflections on the Celebration of Violence.
