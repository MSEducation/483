SOKO (Cyrillic: СОКО) was an Yugoslav aircraft manufacturer based in Mostar, SR Bosnia and Herzegovina. The company was responsible for the production of many military aircraft for the Yugoslav Air Force.
It was created in 1950 by the relocation of the aircraft factory section of Ikarus company from Zemun, SR Serbia. Officially founded as "Preduzeće Soko" (Soko corporation), soon after it will be renamed to "Soko Vazduhoplovna Industrija, RO Vazduhoplovstvo" (Soko aeronautical industry, RO aeronautics). Its first director was Yugoslav People's Army colonel Ivan Sert. The following directors of the company were ingeneers Miljenko Pješčić and Tomislav Mirić. The serial manufacture of numerous types of aircraft was projected by the Aeronautical Technical Institute in Belgrade.  Besides aircraft, SOKO also produced helicopters under licence. Located in the vicinities of Mostar, it used mostly the Mostar Airport for test flights.
By the 1980s SOKO was working on Novi Avion which was a project of a 4th-generation, supersonic multi-role fighter intended to supply the Yugoslav Air Force with domestically built modern fighters.  The production was planned to begin in 1991 however the start of the Yugoslav wars and the international embargo made the project to be cancelled.Novi avion at vazduhoplovnetradicijesrbije.rs, retrieved 4-12-2013 [tpl]sr icon[/tpl]  In the early 1990s the factory ceased aircraft production.  The facilities were partially desmanteled and relocated to Serbia to the Utva Aircraft Industry in Pančevo which had already been working closelly with SOKO in the manufacturing of Orao and Super Galeb.Yugoslavia - The Aviation Industry at aeroflight.co.uk, retrieved 4-12-2013

Between its foundation and until the early 1990s, SOKO continuously produced a series of original aircraft projected by the Aeronautical Technical Institute, of which the last one was the G-4 Super Galeb.

During the 1970s and 1980s, SOKO and Avioane Craiova of Romania, co-developed the Soko J-22 Orao and IAR-93, respectively. Soko also cooperated with Sikorsky, Westland and Aérospatiale in producing various helicopters under license.
