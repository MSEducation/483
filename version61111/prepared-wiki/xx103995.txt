The non-socialist parties gained a majority, and Jan P. Syse became prime minister of a coalition minority cabinet consisting of the Conservative Party, the Christian Democratic Party, and the Centre Party. This cabinet was disbanded a year later after the Center Party broke with the Conservatives due to the Norwegian EU membership issue. Thus the Labour Party was again in government at the 1993 election four years later.
