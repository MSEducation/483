==History==

Merle Fogg Airport opened on an abandoned 9-hole golf course on May 1, 1929. At the start of World War II, it was commissioned by the United States Navy and renamed Naval Air Station Fort Lauderdale. The base was initially used for refitting civil airliners for military service before they were ferried across the Atlantic to Europe and North Africa. NAS Fort Lauderdale later became a main training base for Naval Aviators and enlisted naval air crewmen flying the TBF and TBM Avenger for the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps aboard aircraft carriers and from expeditionary airfields ashore.  NAS Fort Lauderdale was the home base for Flight 19, the five TBM Avenger aircraft that disappeared in December 1945, leading in part to the notoriety of the Bermuda Triangle.
NAS Fort Lauderdale closed on October 1, 1946 and was transferred to county control, becoming Broward County International Airport.
Commercial flights to Nassau began on June 2, 1953 and domestic flights began in 1958–59: Northeast Airlines and National Airlines DC-6Bs flew nonstop to Idlewild, and Northeast flew nonstop to Washington National. In 1959 the airport opened its first permanent terminal building and assumed its current name.
In 1966 the airport averaged 48 airline operations a day; in 1972 it averaged 173 a day. The Feb 1966 Official Airline Guide shows three nonstop departures to JFK and no other nonstops beyond Tampa and Orlando; five years later FLL had added nonstops to ATL, BAL, BOS, BUF, ORD, CLE, DTW, MSP, LGA, EWR, PHL and PIT. (Northeast's nonstop to LAX had already been dropped.) By 1974 the airport was served by Braniff International Airways, Delta Air Lines, Eastern Air Lines, National Airlines, Northwest Orient Airlines, Shawnee Airlines and United Airlines.[tpl]cite web|title=Airlines and Aircraft Serving Fort Lauderdale Effective April 1, 1974|url=http://www.departedflights.com/FLL74intro.html|publisher=DepartedFlights.com|accessdate=4 December 2013[/tpl] By 1979, following deregulation, Air Florida, Bahamasair, Florida Airlines, Mackey International Airlines, Republic Airlines, Trans World Airlines and Western Airlines also served the airport.[tpl]cite web|title=Airlines and Aircraft Serving Fort Lauderdale Effective November 15, 1979|url=http://www.departedflights.com/FLL79intro.html|publisher=DepartedFlights.com|accessdate=4 December 2013[/tpl]
Low-cost traffic grew in the 1990s, with Southwest opening its base in 1996, Spirit in 1999, and JetBlue in 2000. Spirit made FLL a hub in 2002 and in 2003 JetBlue made FLL a focus city. US Airways also planned a hub at Fort Lauderdale in the mid-2000s as part of its reorganization strategy before its merger with America West.[tpl]cite news|last=Alexander|first=Keith|title=American Fare Cuts Presage Price War|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A61231-2004Nov18.html|accessdate=5 December 2013|newspaper=Washington Post|date=19 November 2004[/tpl] Low-cost competition forced several major legacy airlines to cut back service to FLL, with United pulling out entirely in 2008[tpl]cite news|title=United Airlines to halt flights at Fort Lauderdale, West Palm Beach airports|url=http://www.tcpalm.com/news/2008/jun/25/united-airlines-halt-flights-fort-lauderdale-west-/?print=1|accessdate=5 December 2013|newspaper=Sun-Sentinel|date=25 June 2008[/tpl] and American Airlines moving its New York and Los Angeles services to West Palm Beach in 2013.[tpl]cite news|title=American Airlines Moves Flights From Fort Lauderdale To Palm Beach|url=http://exmiami.org/index.php/american-airlines-moves-flight-from-fort-lauderdale-to-palm-beach/|accessdate=5 December 2013|newspaper=exMiami|date=12 August 2013[/tpl]
