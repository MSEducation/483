Antonio Moscheni (17 January 1854, Stezzano, Province of Bergamo, Italy - 15 November 1905, Cochin, Kerala, India) was a Jesuit brother and painter, known best for his elaborate fresco decoration of the church of the St. Aloysius College, Mangalore, India.

==Biography==

Moscheniâ€™s artistic talent was discovered early, and he was sent to study painting at the Accademia Carrara in Bergamo. He then went to Rome to study the masterpieces of the Vatican. Fresco painting now became his passion and several of his works can be found in churches of the Bergamo area.  In 1889, at the age of 35, Moscheni renounced the prospect of a worldy career, and joined the Society of Jesus. After the usual two years of novitiate, his superiors noted his talent, and he was sent to decorate churches in Croatia, Albania as well as in his native country. In 1898, Moscheni was assigned to India,and sent to Mangalore with the specific mission of painting the Chapel of St. Aloysius College, recently founded by the Italian Jesuits.
