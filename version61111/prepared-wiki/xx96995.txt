This was the year that ABC and CBS began televising a majority of their prime-time programs in color, while NBC placed their final two black-and-white shows in prime time — the war drama Convoy and the sitcom I Dream of Jeannie, with the latter moving to color the following season.
This was the television schedule on all three networks for the fall season beginning in September 1965. All times are Eastern and Pacific.
New fall series are highlighted in bold.

Note: The Farmer's Daughter took over the 9:30–10 time period on ABC, effective November 5, because many viewers were not home to watch Peyton Place on Fridays. Starting November 1, Peyton Place was seen Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday.

==Saturday==

Note: Even though ABC Scope was scheduled at 10:30 p.m., not one major affiliate (including WABC-TV New York, the network's flagship station) carried it in that time period, preferring to schedule local or syndicated programming in its place. Most affiliates aired it in "fringe time" during the weekend.
