Gustaf Fröding ([tpl]IPA-sv|ˈɡɵsˌtav ˈfrøːˌdɪŋ|-|sv-gustav-froeding.ogg[/tpl]; August 22, 1860 - February 8, 1911) was a Swedish poet and writer, born in Alster outside Karlstad in Värmland. The family moved to Kristinehamn in the year 1867. He later studied at Uppsala University and worked as a journalist in Karlstad.

==Poetry==

His poetry combines formal virtuosity with a sympathy for the ordinary, the neglected and the down-trodden. It is highly musical and lends itself to musical setting; as songs it has developed into the much wider world of popular music and frequently been re-recorded by Swedish singers like Olle Adolphson, Monica Zetterlund, the Värmland group Sven-Ingvars and recently the Swedish band Mando Diao on their album Infruset. Gustaf wrote openly about his personal problems with alcohol and women and had to face a trial for obscenity for that cause.
He is generally held to be one of the greatest poets of verse that Sweden has ever produced.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2009[/tpl]

==Sickness==

The latter part of his life he spent in different mental institutions and hospitals to cure his mental illness and alcoholism, and eventually diabetes. During the first half of 1890 he spent a couple of years at the Suttestad institution in Lillehammer, Norway, where he finished his work on his third book of poetry Stänk och flikar, which was published in 1896. He wrote much of the material at a mental institution in Görlitz, Germany. In 1896 he moved back to Sweden. But as the year neared Christmas, his sister Cecilia made the difficult decision to make him stay at a hospital in Uppsala. Under the care of professor Frey Svenson Fröding got away from liquor and women, except one, Ida Bäckman. To this day, people think that Ida Bäckman wanted to marry Fröding and corrupt him in some way[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2009[/tpl]. Later she wrote books but they were always judged harshly and never got good reviews. She is about to have her name cleared in Sweden. Fröding never married Ida. She was never asked to stop visiting Fröding by professor Svenson and Cecilia Fröding. Instead Fröding grew fond of a nurse named Signe Trotzig. When he left hospital in Uppsala she stayed with him to the day he died.

==Plays==

There is a famous Swedish play called Sjung vackert om kärlek, written by Gottfried Grafström. The play focuses on Fröding's long visit to Uppsala Hospital. There are also some flashbacks of his life before being institutionalized. One of Grafströms reasons to write the play was to clear the name of Ida Bäckman, who he thinks has gotten way to much criticism for her relationship with Fröding. The play was very popular during the 70's and had a revival in Värmland 2007. It was conducted by the Theater of Värmland at Alsters Herrgård, the very place where Fröding was born.
