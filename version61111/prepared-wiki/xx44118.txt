[[Cheap Truth]]

CATEGORIES: Science fiction-related magazines, Non-fiction Cyberpunk media

Cheap Truth was a free series of one-page, double-sided newsletters (i.e., fanzine) published in the 1980s. It was the unofficial organ of a loose group of authors. This group called themselves many things, including "The Movement" but was later known as the Cyberpunk  movement.
The zine was edited by the science fiction author Bruce Sterling under the alias Vincent Omniaveritas. There were several contributors such as "Sue Denim" (as in pseu-donym, in this case Lewis Shiner), but the real identities behind some aliases are still not commonly known. The newsletter was critical towards what its editors regarded as the "stagnant state of popular science fiction".
