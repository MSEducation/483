Stanlow Abbey (or Stanlaw Abbey) was a Cistercian abbey situated on Stanlow Point on the banks of the River Mersey in the Wirral Peninsula, Cheshire, England ([tpl]gbmapping|SJ427773[/tpl]).
The abbey was founded in 1178 by John FitzRichard, the sixth Baron of Halton.[tpl]citation | last = Greene| first = J. Patrick | authorlink = J.

In 1279 it was flooded by water from the Mersey and in 1287 during a fierce storm, its tower collapsed and part of the abbey was destroyed by fire.  The monks appealed to the pope for the monastery to be moved to a better site and, with the pope's consent and the agreement of Edward I and Henry de Lacy, the 10th Baron, they moved to Whalley Abbey near Clitheroe, Lancashire.[tpl]citation | last =Starkey | first = H.

The standing remains include two sandstone walls and a re-used doorway, and the buried features include part of a drain leading to the River Gowy.  These remains are recognised as a scheduled monument.[tpl]NHLE |num= 1011117|desc= Stanlow Abbey Cistercian monastery and monastic grange|accessdate= 5 September 2012|separator=,|ps=[/tpl]
