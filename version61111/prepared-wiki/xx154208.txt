Founded in 1893, in Windsor, Ontario, with three employees of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company (C.P.R.) and was originally named The Windsor Salt Company. Within a few years, the operation was sold and became The Canadian Salt Company, Limited ([tpl]lang-fr|La Societe Canadienne de Sel Limitee[/tpl]). The company has changed ownership at least twice (owned by Morton Salt since 1954), but it remained a leader in modern salt processing methods, and is considered Canada's largest salt manufacturer.
The Company is engaged in the recovery, processing, importing, and sale of salt, and provides over 200 evaporated and rock salt products under its well-known Windsor, Safe-T-Salt and Fino salt brand names.
Products made from evaporated salt (salt recovered from brine) are used in household and food products, as well as for agricultural, water softening and industrial purposes. Those made from mined rock salt are also sold to household and industrial markets for ice control, and to the water softening and general industrial trades. Government agencies are among the largest users of the Company's products for highway ice control.
The Canadian Salt Company Limited is headquartered in Pointe-Claire, Quebec at 755 Boulevard Saint-Jean, 7th Floor.Scottâ€™s Directories, 2007 Manufacturer 50th Anniversary Edition (2007, Toronto, Division Big Directories) pg 2-876
