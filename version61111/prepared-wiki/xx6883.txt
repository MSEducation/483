Panspermia, also called exogenesis, is the hypothesis that life originated elsewhere in the universe and subsequently transferred to Earth in the form of spores via meteorites, comets, or cosmic dust. Conversely, terrestrial life may be seeded in other solar systems through directed panspermia, to secure and expand some terrestrial life forms. Astroecology experiments with meteorites show that Martian asteroids and cometary materials are rich in inorganic elements and may be fertile soils for microbial, algal and plant life, for past and future life in our and other solar systems.[tpl]Cite journal | last = Mautner | first = Michael N. | title = Planetary bioresources and astroecology. 1.

In 2004, scientists reported[tpl]cite news |last=Battersby |first=S. |url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn4552-space-molecules-point-to-organic-origins.html |title=Space molecules point to organic origins|publisher=New Scientist |year=2004 |accessdate=11 December 2009[/tpl] detecting the spectral signatures of anthracene and pyrene in the ultraviolet light emitted by the Red Rectangle nebula (no other such complex molecules had ever been found before in outer space). This discovery was considered a confirmation of a hypothesis that as nebulae of the same type as the Red Rectangle approach the ends of their lives, convection currents cause carbon and hydrogen in the nebulae's core to get caught in stellar winds, and radiate outward.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1051/0004-6361:20053738|title=Estimated IR and phosphorescence emission fluxes for  specific polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the Red Rectangle|year=2006|last1=Mulas|first1=G.|last2=Malloci|first2=G.|last3=Joblin|first3=C.|last4=Toublanc|first4=D.|journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume=446|issue=2|pages=537|bibcode=2006A&A...446..537M|arxiv = astro-ph/0509586 [/tpl] As they cool, the atoms supposedly bond to each other in various ways and eventually form particles of a million or more atoms. The scientists inferred that since they discovered polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) — which may have been vital in the formation of early life on Earth — in a nebula, by necessity they must originate in nebulae.
In August 2009, NASA scientists identified one of the fundamental chemical building-blocks of life (the amino acid glycine) in a comet for the first time.[tpl]Cite news|author=Staff |title='Life chemical' detected in comet |date=18 August 2009 |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8208307.stm |work=NASA |accessdate=6 March 2010 [/tpl]
In 2010, fullerenes (or "buckyballs") were detected in nebulae. Fullerenes have been implicated in the origin of life; according to astronomer Letizia Stanghellini, "It's possible that buckyballs from outer space provided seeds for life on Earth."[tpl]cite news|last=Atkinson|first=Nancy|url=http://www.universetoday.com/76732/buckyballs-could-be-plentiful-in-the-universe|title=Buckyballs Could Be Plentiful in the Universe|publisher=Universe Today|date=2010-10-27|accessdate=2010-10-28[/tpl]
In August 2011, findings by NASA, based on studies of meteorites found on Earth, suggests DNA and RNA components (adenine, guanine and related organic molecules), building blocks for life as we know it, may be formed extraterrestrially in outer space.[tpl]cite web |last1=Callahan|first1=M.P. |last2=Smith |first2=K.E. |last3=Cleaves |first3=H.J. |last4=Ruzica |first4=J. |last5=Stern|first5=J.C. |last6=Glavin |first6=D.P. |last7=House |first7=C.H. |last8=Dworkin |first8=J.P. |date=11 August 2011 |title=Carbonaceous meteorites contain a wide range of extraterrestrial nucleobases|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2011/08/10/1106493108 |publisher=PNAS |doi=10.1073/pnas.1106493108|accessdate=2011-08-15 [/tpl][tpl]cite web |last=Steigerwald |first=John |title=NASA Researchers: DNA Building Blocks Can Be Made in Space |url=http://www.nasa.gov/topics/solarsystem/features/dna-meteorites.html |publisher=NASA |date=8 August 2011 |accessdate=2011-08-10 [/tpl][tpl]cite web |author=ScienceDaily Staff |title=DNA Building Blocks Can Be Made in Space, NASA Evidence Suggests|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/08/110808220659.htm |date=9 August 2011 |publisher=ScienceDaily |accessdate=2011-08-09[/tpl]
In October 2011, scientists found using spectroscopy that cosmic dust contains complex organic matter ("amorphous organic solids with a mixed aromatic–aliphatic structure") that could be created naturally, and rapidly, by stars.[tpl]cite web |last=Chow |first=Denise |title=Discovery: Cosmic Dust Contains Organic Matter from Stars|url=http://www.space.com/13401-cosmic-star-dust-complex-organic-compounds.html |date=26 October 2011|publisher=Space.com |accessdate=2011-10-26 [/tpl][tpl]cite web |author=ScienceDaily Staff |title=Astronomers Discover Complex Organic Matter Exists Throughout the Universe|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/10/111026143721.htm |date=26 October 2011 |publisher=ScienceDaily |accessdate=2011-10-27 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last1=Kwok|first1=Sun |last2=Zhang |first2=Yong |title=Mixed aromatic–aliphatic organic nanoparticles as carriers of unidentified infrared emission features |date=26 October 2011 |journal=Nature|doi=10.1038/nature10542 |volume=479 |issue=7371 |page=80 |bibcode = 2011Natur.479...80K |pmid=22031328[/tpl] The compounds are so complex that their chemical structures resemble the makeup of coal and petroleum; such chemical complexity was previously thought to arise only from living organisms.

In August 2012, astronomers at Copenhagen University reported the detection of a specific sugar molecule, glycolaldehyde, in a distant star system. The molecule was found around the protostellar binary IRAS 16293-2422, which is located 400 light years from Earth.[tpl]cite journal|title=Sugar Found In Space|journal=National Geographic |last=Than |first=Ker |date=August 29, 2012|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/08/120829-sugar-space-planets-science-life/|accessdate=August 31, 2012 [/tpl][tpl]cite web |author=Staff |title=Sweet!

This finding suggests that complex organic molecules may form in stellar systems prior to the formation of planets, eventually arriving on young planets early in their formation.[tpl]cite journal|title=Detection of the simplest sugar, glycolaldehyde, in a solar-type protostar with ALMA|author=Jørgensen, J.

In September 2012, NASA scientists reported that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), subjected to interstellar medium (ISM) conditions, are transformed, through hydrogenation, oxygenation and hydroxylation, to more complex organics - "a step along the path toward amino acids and nucleotides, the raw materials of proteins and DNA, respectively".[tpl]cite web |author=Staff|title=NASA Cooks Up Icy Organics to Mimic Life's Origins|url=http://www.space.com/17681-life-building-blocks-nasa-organic-molecules.html|date=September 20, 2012 |publisher=Space.com |accessdate=September 22, 2012 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last1=Gudipati |first1=Murthy S. |last2=Yang |first2=Rui|title=In-Situ Probing Of Radiation-Induced Processing Of Organics In Astrophysical Ice Analogs—Novel Laser Desorption Laser Ionization Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectroscopic Studies|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/2041-8205/756/1/L24 |date=September 1, 2012 |journal=The Astrophysical Journal Letters |volume=756 |doi=10.1088/2041-8205/756/1/L24|accessdate=September 22, 2012 |issue=1 |pages=L24 |bibcode = 2012ApJ...756L..24G [/tpl] Further, as a result of these transformations, the PAHs lose their spectroscopic signature which could be one of the reasons "for the lack of PAH detection in interstellar ice grains, particularly the outer regions of cold, dense clouds or the upper molecular layers of protoplanetary disks."
In June 2013, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were detected in the upper atmosphere of Titan, the largest moon of the planet Saturn.[tpl]cite news|last=López-Puertas|first=Manuel |url=http://www.iaa.es/content/pahs-titans-upper-atmosphere |title=PAH's in Titan's Upper Atmosphere |date=June 6, 2013 |work=CSIC |accessdate=June 6, 2013 [/tpl]
In 2013, the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA Project) confirmed that researchers have discovered an important pair of prebiotic molecules in the icy particles in interstellar space (ISM). The chemicals, found in a giant cloud of gas about 25,000 light-years from Earth in ISM, may be a precursor to a key component of DNA and the other may have a role in the formation of an important amino acid. Researchers found a molecule called cyanomethanimine, which produces adenine, one of the four nucleobases that form the "rungs" in the ladder-like structure of DNA. The other molecule, called ethanamine, is thought to play a role in forming alanine, one of the twenty amino acids in the genetic code. Previously, scientists thought such processes took place in the very tenuous gas between the stars. The new discoveries, however, suggest that the chemical formation sequences for these molecules occurred not in gas, but on the surfaces of ice grains in interstellar space.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1088/2041-8205/765/1/L9 |title=The Detection of Interstellar Ethanimine (Ch3Chnh) from Observations Taken During the Gbt Primos Survey |year=2013 |last1=Loomis |first1=Ryan A. |last2=Zaleski|first2=Daniel P. |last3=Steber |first3=Amanda L. |last4=Neill |first4=Justin L. |last5=Muckle |first5=Matthew T. |last6=Harris |first6=Brent J. |last7=Hollis |first7=Jan M. |last8=Jewell |first8=Philip R. |last9=Lattanzi|first9=Valerio |last10=Lovas |first10=Frank J. |last11=Martinez |first11=Oscar |last12=McCarthy|first12=Michael C. |last13=Remijan |first13=Anthony J. |last14=Pate |first14=Brooks H. |last15=Corby|first15=Joanna F. |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=765 |pages=L9 |bibcode=2013ApJ...765L...9L[/tpl] NASA ALMA scientist Anthony Remijan stated that finding these molecules in an interstellar gas cloud means that important building blocks for DNA and amino acids can 'seed' newly formed planets with the chemical precursors for life.Finley, Dave, Discoveries Suggest Icy Cosmic Start for Amino Acids and DNA Ingredients, The National Radio Astronomy Observatory, Feb. 28, 2013
In January 2014, NASA reported that current studies on the planet Mars by the Curiosity and Opportunity rovers will now be searching for evidence of ancient life, including a biosphere based on autotrophic, chemotrophic and/or chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms, as well as ancient water, including fluvio-lacustrine environments (plains related to ancient rivers or lakes) that may have been habitable.[tpl]cite journal |last=Grotzinger |first=John P. |title=Introduction to Special Issue - Habitability, Taphonomy, and the Search for Organic Carbon on Mars |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/343/6169/386 |journal=Science |date=January 24, 2014 |volume=343 |number=6169 |pages=386–387 |doi=10.1126/science.1249944 |accessdate=January 24, 2014 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |authors=Various |title=Special Issue - Table of Contents - Exploring Martian Habitability |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/343/6169.toc#SpecialIssue |date=January 24, 2014|journal=Science |volume=343 |number=6169 |pages=345–452 |accessdate=24 January 2014 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |authors=Various |title=Special Collection - Curiosity - Exploring Martian Habitability |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/site/extra/curiosity/|date=January 24, 2014 |journal=Science |accessdate=January 24, 2014 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |authors=Grotzinger, J.P. et al. |title=A Habitable Fluvio-Lacustrine Environment at Yellowknife Bay, Gale Crater, Mars |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/343/6169/1242777 |date=January 24, 2014 |journal=Science |volume=343 |number=6169 |doi=10.1126/science.1242777 |accessdate=January 24, 2014 [/tpl] The search for evidence of habitability, taphonomy (related to fossils), and organic carbon on the planet Mars is now a primary NASA objective.
In February 2014, NASA announced a greatly upgraded database for tracking polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the universe. According to scientists, more than 20% of the carbon in the universe may be associated with PAHs, possible starting materials for the formation of life. PAHs seem to have been formed shortly after the Big Bang, are widespread throughout the universe, and are associated with new stars and exoplanets.[tpl]cite web |last=Hoover |first=Rachel |title=Need to Track Organic Nano-Particles Across the Universe?
