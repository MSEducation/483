==History==

The yeshiva was founded in 1988 by Rabbi David Harris, Rabbi Zvi Turk, and Rabbi Yehuda Jacobson.  Beginning as a branch of Yeshiva Chofetz Chaim, it has evolved into an established yeshiva. 
Enrollment is approximately 800 at the preschool, elementary, middle school, high school, and beis medrash levels.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/yeshiva_in_the_snoop_e73T9frjBlNik3mOfAX5iP |title=Yeshiva in the snoop: Internet-spy edict|last=Blau |first=Reuven|date=August 22, 2010 |accessdate=September 8, 2011|work=New York Post[/tpl] Most students continue in the associated kollel for three to eight years.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rabbihorowitz.com/PYes/SchoolDetails.cfm?School_ID=481 |title=Yeshiva Mesivta Tiferes Yisroel |publisher=RabbiHorowitz.com|accessdate=September 4, 2011| date=December 17, 2008[/tpl]
Rabbi Turk and Rabbi Jacobson are currently co-principals of the yeshiva, and teach the second and first classes of the beis medrash, respectively. It is a Lithuanian-style, Haredi but non-Hasidic yeshiva focusing on Talmud study.

==Location==

The mesivta (high school) is located at 1271 East 35th Street in Brooklyn, New York, where it shares two buildings with its elementary school, Yeshiva Tiferes Yisroel (also called Yeshiva Ketana Tiferes Yisroel).

==Methodology==

Like its parent institution, Yeshiva Chofetz Chaim, there are three primary characteristics of this yeshiva's methodology of Talmud study that distinguish it from others in its genre:
Firstly, there is an emphasis upon unfolding the latent processes of reasoning within the steps of the Talmudic sugya (matter at hand). The methodology employed by this Yeshiva places emphasis on the notion that the initial assumptions of the Talmud must be highly rigorous, and that the movement between the initial thought process (known as the hava aminah) of the Talmudic sugya to the final thought process must be fully unfolded and understood.
Secondly, their approach to ethical and biblical texts and its commentaries emphasize a rigour that other Yeshivos of their genre generally reserve to halachic or Talmudic texts alone. The term "muchrach" is often employed when discussing what may be learned from biblical commentaries. This term means "logically and textually compelling." This approach yields a much more compelling discourse on Torah.
The third distinguishing characteristic is the emphasis placed upon propagating the ideals and values of Judaism. Students are encouraged upon completion of a rigorous term of study, to seek employment in the field of Jewish education, often launching their own educational institutions themselves or with a partner. However, rather than going into "Harbotzas Hatorah" for selfish reasons (such as the desire to remain in an environment suitable for Torah study), students are taught to act for their beneficiaries. In fact, Rav Henoch believed that one who enters this field for any other reason would be better off going into the workforce.
