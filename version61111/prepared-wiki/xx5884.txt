Kevin Wayne Jeter (born 1950), known both personally and professionally as K.W. Jeter, is an American science fiction and horror author known for his literary writing style, dark themes, and paranoid, unsympathetic characters. He has written novels set in the Star Trek and Star Wars universes, and has written three (to date) sequels to Blade Runner.

==Biography==

Jeter attended college at California State University, Fullerton where he became friends with James P. Blaylock and Tim Powers, and through them, Philip K. Dick. Jeter was actually the inspiration for the character named Kevin in Dick's novel, Valis.[tpl]cite book |title=Divine Invasions |last=Sutin |first=Lawrence  |year=1989 |publisher=Carol Publishing Group |location=New York City |isbn=0-8065-1228-8 |page=258 [/tpl] Many of Jeter's books focus on the subjective nature of reality in a way that is reminiscent of works by Dick.
Jeter wrote an early Cyberpunk novel, Dr. Adder, which was enthusiastically recommended by Philip K. Dick. Due to its violent and sexually-provocative content, it took Jeter approximately ten years to find a publisher for it. Jeter is also the first to coin the term "Steampunk,"[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.boingboing.net/2011/03/01/the-birth-of-steampu.html|title=The Birth of Steampunk|publisher=BoingBoing[/tpl] in a letter to Locus magazine in April 1987, to describe the retro-technology, alternate-history works that he published along with his friends, Blaylock and Powers. Jeter's Steampunk novels were Morlock Night, Infernal Devices and its sequel Fiendish Schemes (2013).
He currently lives in Cuenca, Ecuador with his wife, Geri.
As well as his own original novels, K. W. Jeter has written a number of authorized novel sequels to the critically acclaimed 1982 motion picture Blade Runner, which was adapted from Philip K. Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep.
