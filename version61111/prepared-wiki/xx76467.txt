==History==

Beaverton was first settled in 1822.  The settlement is located on Lake Simcoe at the mouth of the Beaver River.  It was called Calder's Mills (after an early miller), Mill Town and Milton until it was renamed Beaverton when the post office was opened in 1835.  
By 1869, Beaverton was a village with a population of 700 in the Township of Thorah Township in Ontario County. It was the terminus of the Port Hope, Lindsay and Beaverton Railway. The steamer Emily May plied daily between Beaverton and Bell Ewart station of the Northern Railroad. There were stages daily to Whitby and Oshawa. The province of Ontario gazetteer and directory. H.

As part of the creation of Durham Region in 1974, Beaverton was amalgamated with Thorah Township, the original Brock Township and the Villages of Cannington and Sunderland to create the newly expanded Township of Brock.
Today, Beaverton is the largest community in Brock.  There are three elementary schools in Beaverton and area, as well as an arena, curling club, public library, small harbour and yacht club.  The local economy is based on the provision of services to the surrounding area, supplemented by some manufacturing.  Tourism also plays a role; the Trent-Severn Waterway connects with Lake Simcoe a few kilometres north of Beaverton and the area attracts cottagers from other regions of the Province.
Beaverton's downtown core also sports many stores and services including two bars which can lure youth from around the local area. It is noted that many students from the Lakehead University Orillia Campus will participate in the Beaverton night life for its unique dynamic.
Beaverton is the home of The Strand Theatre, Canada's oldest movie theatre.  The Old Stone Church, built in 1853 and a National Historic Site of Canada, is also located in Beaverton.Old Stone Church, Directory of Designations of National Historic Significance of Canada[tpl]CRHP|7775|Old Stone Church[/tpl]
