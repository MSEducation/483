==Football career==

Gomis arrived in Portugal at the age of 19 as he signed for F.C. Famalicão in the third division. In the following transfer window he moved to S.C. Olhanense, proceeding to appear regularly over the course of one 1/2 second level seasons, but mostly as a substitute. 
In 2008 Gomis signed for FC Shinnik Yaroslavl in Russia, appearing rarely during his spell and also suffering relegation from the Premier League. He subsequently returned to the Algarve with Olhanense but, in January 2010, after only 15 minutes of official play in the first half of his first season – against F.C. Paços de Ferreira in the Portuguese League Cup – he was loaned to F.C. Vizela in division three for one 1/2 seasons.
In the 2011 summer Gomis was released by Olhanense and returned to Famalicão, still in the third division.
