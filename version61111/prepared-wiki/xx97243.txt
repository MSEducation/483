==Early History==

Victoria Ward was the wife of Honolulu industrialist Curtis Perry Ward and daughter of influential British shipbuilder James Robinson. Victoria Ward and her husband owned a vast estate (over 100 acres) in central Honolulu that stretched from Thomas Square to the shores of Ala Moana. On the estate was their mansion, Old Plantation, the site of the present-day Neal S. Blaisdell Center. In 1882, Curtis Perry Ward died and left his holdings to his wife and daughters. Victoria Ward continued the family business, purchasing real estate which would be developed for commercial use.[tpl]cite web|title=Ward Centers, About Us|url=http://www.wardcenters.com/info/about|accessdate=9 April 2014[/tpl]
