[[Boûkète]]

CATEGORIES: Pancakes, Belgian cuisine

The boûkète, also spelled bouquette in French, is a Belgian pancake made with buckwheat flour, frequently decorated with raisins, fried in a pan with lard, which are eaten hot or cold, garnished with sugar from a local brown sugar called cassonade or with sirop de Liège.
It derives its name from wheat or buckwheat called "bouquets" and "Boquete", derived from Dutch "boekweit" in a name attested since the early 17th century before taking the meaning of pancake, attested to the first time in 1743.
The introduction of the bouquet in Liège dates back to the 18th century, when it was imported from Flanders by the court of the Prince-Bishops from the County of Loon and around Tongeren. It was eventually adopted by Liege at the end of the 19th century.
It is traditionally eaten accompanied by mulled wine during the holidays of the year but is also being honored at the festival on August 15 in the "free Republic of Outre-meuse" (in Liège).
