==Reception and reissues==

Because Prudence Liew fared so well with critics, having won several Best Album of the Year awards, this follow-up album was often compared to it.  Critics often thought this album to be of lesser quality when compared to the debut album as this album is too "westernized" and contained too many covers. Although this album failed to achieve the critical acclaim of her previous album, it still sold fairly well in Hong Kong and was certified platinumhttp://www.ifpihk.org/www_1/go9e.php Hong Kong IFPI sales certification - 1988 by the Hong Kong IFPI in early 1988.
