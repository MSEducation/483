===Natal Sharks / Sharks===

He made his Super Rugby debut in the [tpl]Rut Sharks[/tpl]', starting in opening match of the 2006 Super 14 season against the [tpl]Rut Chiefs[/tpl].[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.sarugby.net/matchbreakdown.aspx?id=12543&category=&leagueid=407&homeid=5553&awayid=5561&fullview=true | title=Match Breakdown: The Sharks vs Chiefs | work=South African Rugby Union | date=11 February 2006 | accessdate=14 November 2013[/tpl] He quickly established himself as a regular, starting twelve of the Sharks' matches during the season.

===Return to the Cheetahs===

In August 2010, Strauss signed a deal with the Cheetahs for the 2011 Super 15 season, due to the departure of Cheetahs centre Meyer Bosman who joined the Sharks the next season.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.sport24.co.za/Rugby/CurrieCup/More-signings-for-Cheetahs-20100817 | title=More signing for Cheetahs | publisher=Sport24 | date=17 August 2010 | accessdate=14 November 2013[/tpl] In 2011 and 2012 Strauss made almost 40 appearances for the Cheetahs in Super Rugby and the Currie Cup and also played with his cousin Adriaan Strauss during this time.

===Kings===

He joined the [tpl]Rut Kings[/tpl] for the 2013 Super Rugby season.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.rugbyweek.com/news/article.asp?id=36451 | title=Southern Kings snap up Strauss for Super Rugby | date=13 Sep 2012 | publisher=rugbyweek.com | accessdate=13 Sep 2012 [/tpl] He made his Kings debut in their first ever Super Rugby match in 2013, a 22–10 victory over Australian side the [tpl]Rut Force[/tpl].[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.sarugby.net/matchbreakdown.aspx?id=113661&category=&leagueid=1491&homeid=15231&awayid=15111&fullview=true | title=Match Breakdown: Southern Kings vs Force | work=South African Rugby Union | date=23 February 2013 | accessdate=14 November 2013[/tpl] He started thirteen of their sixteen matches during the season – most of them as captain following an injury to regular captain Luke Watson.
