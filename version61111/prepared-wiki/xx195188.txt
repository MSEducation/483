CATEGORIES: Populated places in Sool

Bo'ame (Somali: Boocame) is an ancient town in the northern Sool region of Somalia, the capital of Bo'ame district which includes the small towns of Karin-gorfood, Fardhidin, Dan-Gudban, Caleeli, Buura-wadal and Garaca and Biriqodayaga .
Bo'ame is a commercial centre for the largely agricultural district. Bo'ame has a business relationship to many cities such as Garowe, the administrative capital of Puntland, Galkacyo, Bosasso and Las Anod the capital of Sool.

==History==

Bo'ame is one of the oldest cities in Somalia. The town has historical significance for the inhabitants of the Sool, Sanaag and Cayn (SSC) regions of Somalia for having been the site of the Bo'ame Declaration in November 2007 by the traditional chiefs, intellectuals and civil representatives of the local Dulbahante clan. The declaration dissociated the clan from Somaliland which, along with Puntland, is one of the two self-declared autonomous regions that claim Sool.

==Education==

There are at least two primary and intermediate school, and one secondary school. There are also several Islamic Institutes. A technical school was established in 1980, but closed shortly after the Somali central government collapsed in 1991.

==Telecommunication and water supply==

Apart from the capital Las Anod, Bo'ama is the only district in the Sool region that has maintained telephone lines to every house since the start of the civil war. There are also mobile services and internet access.
Clean filtered water is available on tap from a water supply company. There is also access to wells and a small river within the town.

==Media==

Two online news portals provide local news coverage: allboocame.com and boocameonline.com.
