Alva William Javery (June 5, 1918 – August 16, 1977) was a professional Major League Baseball pitcher who played from 1940–1946, spending all seven seasons with the Boston Braves. He became a key part of the rotation during World War II, which he did not serve in due to varicose veins.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Al_Javery_1918|title=Al Javery - BaseballLibrary.com|accessdate=2007-12-27[/tpl] Nicknamed "Beartracks", he made his debut on April 23, 1940.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/j/javeral01.shtml|title=Al Javery Statistics - Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=2007-12-26| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071213135158/http://www.baseball-reference.com/j/javeral01.shtml| archivedate= 13 December 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

Javery also started a league-leading 37 games, and finished the season with a 3.03 ERA and was 31st in MVP voting. In 1943, Javery arguably had his best season.

He also pitched the final two innings of the 1943 All-Star Game, his first, strikings out three and not allowing a run en route to a 5–3 American League win.[tpl]cite web|url=http://baseball-almanac.com/asgbox/07131943.shtml|title=1943 All-Star Game Box Score by Baseball Almanac|accessdate=2007-12-27[/tpl] He was again named to the All-Star Game in 1944, but he did not pitch.[tpl]cite web|url=http://baseball-almanac.com/asgbox/yr1944as.shtml|title=1944 All-Star Game|accessdate=2007-12-17|publisher=Baseball Almanac| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080109184240/http://www.baseball-almanac.com/asgbox/yr1944as.shtml| archivedate= 9 January 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
