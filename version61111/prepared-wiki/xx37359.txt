Token bus is a network implementing the token ring protocol over a "virtual ring" on a coaxial cable.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.linktionary.com/t/token_bus.html |title=Token Bus Network |accessdate=2012-03-21[/tpl] A token is passed around the network nodes and only the node possessing the token may transmit. If a node doesn't have anything to send, the token is passed on to the next node on the virtual ring. Each node must know the address of its neighbour in the ring, so a special protocol is needed to notify the other nodes of connections to, and disconnections from, the ring.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.technologyuk.net/telecommunications/networks/token_bus.shtml |title=Token Bus (IEEE 802.4) |accessdate=2012-03-21[/tpl]
Token bus was standardized by IEEE standard 802.4.  It is mainly used for industrial applications. Token bus was used by General Motors for their Manufacturing Automation Protocol (MAP) standardization effort.[tpl]cite paper |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=3057 |title=The IEEE token bus-A performance bound on GM MAP |work=Industrial Electronics, IEEE Transactions on |date=February 1988 |author1=Weaver, A.C. |author2=Summers, C.F. |doi=10.1109/41.3057[/tpl]  This is an application of the concepts used in token ring networks.  The main difference is that the endpoints of the bus do not meet to form a physical ring.
Due to difficulties handling device failures and adding new stations to a network, token bus gained a reputation for being unreliable and difficult to upgrade.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.inetdaemon.com/tutorials/networking/lan/token/ |title=Token Bus and Token Ring |accessdate=2012-03-21[/tpl]
In order to guarantee the packet delay and transmission in Token bus protocol, a modified Token bus was proposed in Manufacturing Automation Systems and flexible manufacturing system (FMS).
A means for carrying Internet Protocol over token bus was developed.RFC 1042
The IEEE 802.4 Working Group is disbanded and the standard has been withdrawn by the IEEE.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ieee802.org/dots.shtml |title=IEEE 802 Working Group & Executive Committee Study Group Home Pages |publisher=IEEE 802 LAN/MAN Standards Committee |accessdate=2012-03-21[/tpl]
