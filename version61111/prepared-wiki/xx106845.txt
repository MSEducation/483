Come From the Shadows was a 1972 album by Joan Baez.  After recording for the independent label Vanguard for more than a decade, Baez signed with A&M, and attempted to point her career in a slightly more "commercial" direction (though the album still had overtly political overtones).  In addition to her own compositions "Prison Trilogy", "Myths", and "Love Song to a Stranger", Baez included John Lennon's "Imagine", Anna Marly's "Song of the Partisan", and Mimi Fari√±a's "In the Quiet Morning (for Janis Joplin)".
The album was recorded at Quadrophonic Sound Studios in Nashville.

From the album's liner notes:
 
 "...In 1972 if you don't fight against a rotten thing you become a part of it" - Joan Baez
