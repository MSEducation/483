Patricia Cornwell (born Patricia Carroll Daniels; June 9, 1956) is a contemporary American crime writer. She is widely known for writing a popular series of novels featuring the heroine Dr. Kay Scarpetta, a medical examiner. Her books have sold more than 100 million copies.

==Early life==

A descendant of abolitionist and writer Harriet Beecher Stowe,[tpl]cite web|author=Patricia Cornwell Biography and Notes |url=http://www.biblio.com/authors/601/Patricia_Cornwell_Biography.html |title=Patricia Cornwell Biography and List of Works - Patricia Cornwell Books |publisher=Biblio.com |date=1956-06-09 |accessdate=2012-01-30[/tpl] Cornwell was born in Miami, Florida to Marilyn and Sam Daniels. Her father was one of the leading appellate lawyers in the United States and served as a law clerk to Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black. Cornwell later traced her own motivations in life to the emotional abuse she says she suffered from her father, who walked out on the family on Christmas Day 1961. She has said, "He was on his deathbed. We knew it was the last time we’d see each other; he grabbed my brother's hand and mouthed 'I love you,' but he never touched me. All he did was write on a legal pad 'How's work?'"
In 1961, Cornwell's family moved to Montreat, North Carolina, where her mother was hospitalized for depression. Cornwell and her brothers, Jim and John, were placed in the foster care system. Cornwell attended King College in Bristol, Tennessee, before transferring to Davidson College, where she graduated with a B.A. in English.

==Career==

In 1979, Cornwell started working as a reporter for The Charlotte Observer and soon began covering crime. Her biography of family friend Ruth Bell Graham, A Time for Remembering (renamed Ruth, A Portrait: The Story of Ruth Bell Graham in subsequent editions), was published in 1983. In 1984, she took a job at the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of Virginia. She worked there for six years, first as a technical writer and then as a computer analyst. She also volunteered to work with the Richmond Police Department. Cornwell wrote three novels that she says were rejected before the publication, in 1990, of the first installment of her Scarpetta series, Postmortem.

===Scarpetta series===

The Scarpetta novels include a great deal of detail on forensic science. The initial resolution to the mystery is found in the forensic investigation of the murder victim's corpse, although Scarpetta does considerably more field investigation and confrontation with suspects than real-life medical examiners. The novels generally climax with action scenes in which Scarpetta and her associates confront, or are confronted by, the killer or killers, usually concluding with the death of the killer. The novels are considered to have influenced the development of popular TV series on forensics, both fictional, such as CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, and documentaries, such as Cold Case Files.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2011[/tpl]
Other significant themes in the Scarpetta novels include health, individual safety and security, food, family, and the emerging sexual self-discovery of Scarpetta's niece. Often, conflicts and secret manipulations by Scarpetta's colleagues and staff are involved in the storyline and make the murder cases more complex. Although scenes from the novels take place in a variety of locations around the United States and (less commonly) internationally, they center around the city of Richmond, Virginia.
There are two remarkable style shifts in the Scarpetta novels. Starting from The Last Precinct (2000), the style changes from past tense to present tense. Starting from Blow Fly (2003), the style changes from a first person to a third person, omniscient, narrator. Events are even narrated from the viewpoint of the murderers. Before Blow Fly the events are seen through Scarpetta's eyes only, and other points of view only appear in letters that Scarpetta reads.
Cornwell shifted back to a first-person perspective in the Scarpetta novel Port Mortuary (2010). 

===Andy Brazil/Judy Hammer series===

In addition to the Scarpetta novels, Cornwell has written three pseudo-police fictions, known as the Trooper Andy Brazil/Superintendent Judy Hammer series, which are set in North Carolina, Virginia, and off the mid-Atlantic coast. Besides the older-woman/younger-man premise, the books include discomforting themes of scatology and sepsis.

===Jack the Ripper===

Cornwell has been involved in a continuing, self-financed search for evidence to support her theory that painter Walter Sickert was Jack the Ripper. She wrote Portrait of a Killer—Jack the Ripper: Case Closed, which was published in 2002 to much controversy, especially within the British art world and among Ripperologists.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.artcyclopedia.com/feature-2002-11.html |title=November Article: Portrait of the Artist as a Serial Killer |publisher=Artcyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-30[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.casebook.org/dissertations/dst-artofmurder.html |title=Jack the Ripper - The Art of Murder |publisher=Casebook |date= |accessdate=2012-01-30[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.casebook.org/dissertations/dst-pamandsickert.html |title=Jack the Ripper - Patricia Cornwell and Walter Sickert: A Primer |publisher=Casebook |date= |accessdate=2012-01-30[/tpl] Cornwell denied being obsessed with Jack the Ripper in full-page ads in two British newspapers and has said the case was "far from closed".[tpl]cite news| url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/news/articles/0,,1555958,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=The Grand Old Ripper | date=2005-08-25 | accessdate=2010-05-21[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4190572.stm | work=BBC News | title=Author denies 'Ripper' obsession | date=2005-08-27 | accessdate=2010-05-21[/tpl] In 2001, Cornwell was criticized for allegedly destroying one of Sickert's paintings in pursuit of the Ripper's identity.[tpl]cite news | last = Gibbons  | first = Fiachra | title = Does this painting by Walter Sickert reveal the identity of Jack the Ripper?

Cornwell also claimed a breakthrough: a letter written by someone purporting to be the killer, had the same watermark as some of Sickert's writing paper. Ripper experts noted, however, that there were hundreds of letters from different authors falsely claiming to be the killer, and the watermark in question was on a brand of stationery that was widely available.

===TV appearance===

She made a brief appearance on the police procedural drama Criminal Minds in the episode "True Genius" as herself.

==Legal issues==

On January 10, 1993, Cornwell crashed her Mercedes-Benz while under the influence of alcohol. She was convicted of drunk driving and sentenced to 28 days in a treatment center.[tpl]cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9400E4D8143BF930A15750C0A961958260&sec=health&pagewanted=1 | work=The New York Times | title=New Chapter for a Serial Spender | first=Geraldine | last=Fabrikant | date=1997-03-23[/tpl]

===Leslie Sachs case===

Leslie Sachs, author of The Virginia Ghost Murders (1998), claimed there were similarities between his novel and Cornwell's The Last Precinct. In 2000, he sent letters to Cornwell's publisher, started a web page, and placed stickers on copies of his novel alleging that Cornwell was committing plagiarism. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia granted Cornwell a preliminary injunction against Sachs, opining that his claims were likely to be found baseless.Cyberlaw update - Chapter 10: Privacy Rights and Security Issues Pearson Higher Education
In 2007, during her libel suit against Sachs, Cornwell testified that Sachs had accused her in online postings of being a "Jew hater" and "neo-Nazi" who bribed judges, conspired to have him killed, and was under investigation by U.S. authorities.Dan Glaister, Crime writer Patricia Cornwell takes 'cyberstalker' to court, The Guardian, May 24, 2007.David Mehegan, Crime novelist tries to ward off Internet attacker, Boston Globe, June 7, 2007.

===Anchin, Block & Anchin===

In 2004, Cornwell assigned management of her financial matters to New York based Anchin, Block & Anchin, managed by principal Evan Snapper. Agreeing to pay the firm a base-rate of $40,000/month, her lawyer later claimed that Cornwell had hired Snapper to insulate herself from her money due to her ongoing mental health issues, and that Snapper knew this and took advantage of her over her four-and-a-half-year relationship with the company.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/01/09/patricia-cornwell-case-that-reads-like-one-her-mysteries-sues-her-financial-management-firm-alleging-cost-her-tens-millions/zbm35N6sZXjRaOQOaVsvPO/story.html|title=Mystery novelist accuses her manager of betrayal|author=Milton J.

Cornwell fired the firm after discovering in July 2009 that the net worth of her and her company, Cornwell Entertainment Inc., despite having above $10 million in earnings per year during the previous four years, was a little under $13 million, the equivalent of only one year's net income. After Cornwell filed the lawsuit, Snapper pleaded guilty to violating campaign finance regulations. The court case opened in January 2013, with Cornwell suing the firm for a combined sum of $100M.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-21010235|title=Crime novelist Patricia Cornwell sues finance firm|publisher=BBC News|date=14 January 2012|accessdate=14 January 2012[/tpl]  On February 19, a Boston jury awarded Cornwell [tpl]usd[/tpl]50.9 million (£33.4 million).http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/9882052/Crime-writer-Patricia-Cornwell-wins-51m-lawsuit-against-accountants.html
