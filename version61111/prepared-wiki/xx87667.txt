==Ambani's control over stock exchange==

Extensive marketing of the brand "Vimal" in the interiors of India made it a household name. Franchise retail outlets were started and they used to sell "only Vimal" brand of textiles. In the year 1975, a Technical team from the World Bank visited the Reliance Textiles' Manufacturing unit.
In 1982, Reliance Industries came up against a rights issue regarding partly convertible debentures.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.india-seminar.com/2003/521/521%20paranjoy%20guha%20thakurta.htm |title=The two faces of Dhirubhai Ambani by Paranjoy Guha Thakurta |publisher=India-seminar.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-31[/tpl] It was rumored that the company was making all efforts to ensure that their stock prices did not slide an inch. Sensing an opportunity, The Bear Cartel, a group of stock brokers from Calcutta, started to short sell the shares of Reliance. To counter this, a group of stock brokers until recently referred to as "Friends of Reliance" started to buy the short sold shares of Reliance Industries on the Bombay Stock Exchange.
The Bear Cartel was acting on the belief that the Bulls would be short of cash to complete the transactions and would be ready for settlement under the "Badla" trading system operative in the Bombay Stock Exchange. The bulls kept buying and a price of [tpl]INR[/tpl] 152 per share was maintained until the day of settlement. On the day of settlement, the Bear Cartel was taken aback when the Bulls demanded a physical delivery of shares. To complete the transaction, the much money was provided to the stock brokers who had bought shares of Reliance, by Dhirubhai Ambani. In the case of non-settlement, the Bulls demanded an Unbadla, or penalty sum, of [tpl]INR[/tpl] 35 per share. With this, the demand increased and the shares of Reliance shot above [tpl]INR[/tpl] 180 in minutes. The settlement caused an enormous uproar in the market.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]
To find a solution to this situation, the Bombay Stock Exchange was closed for three business days. Authorities from the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) intervened in the matter and brought down the "Unbadla" rate to [tpl]INR[/tpl] 2 with a stipulation that the Bear Cartel had to deliver the shares within the next few days. The Bear Cartel bought shares of Reliance from the market at higher price levels and it was also learnt that Dhirubhai Ambani himself supplied those shares to the Bear Cartel and earned a healthy profit out of The Bear Cartel's adventure.The Great Indian Scam, Story of Missing Rs. 4000 Crore by S.K. Barua and J.S. Verma (ISBN 81-70941288) P 16 & 17
After this incident, many questions were raised by his detractors and the press. Not many people were able to understand as to how a yarn trader until a few years ago was able to get in such a huge amount of cash flow during a crisis period. The answer to this was provided by the then finance minister, Pranab Mukherjee in the Parliament. He informed the house that a Non-Resident Indian had invested up to [tpl]INR[/tpl] 220 million in Reliance during 1982-83. These investments were routed through many companies like Crocodile, Lota and Fiasco. These companies were primarily registered in Isle of Man. The interesting factor was that all the promoters or owners of these companies had a common surname Shah. An investigation by the Reserve Bank of India in the incident did not find any unethical or illegal acts or transactions committed by Reliance or its promoters.[tpl]cite web|url=http://in.rediff.com/money/2002/jul/08amb4.htm |title=rediff.com: For this fighter, life was a big battle |publisher=In.rediff.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-31[/tpl]

In an unauthorized biography of Dhirubhai Ambani, published in 1998 by Hamish McDonald with the title The Polyester Prince, all his political and business conquests are outlined.

Guru, directed by film maker Mani Ratnam, cinematography by Rajiv Menon and music by A.R.Rahman shows the struggle of a man striving to make his mark in the Indian business world with a fictional Shakti Group of Industries. Guru stars Abhishek Bachchan, Mithun Chakraborty, Aishwarya Rai, R. Madhavan and Vidya Balan. Bachchan plays Gurukant Desai, a character implicitly based on Dhirubhai Ambani. The character is popularly known as "Gurubhai", similar to the real-life "Dhirubhai". Mithun Chakraborty portrays Manikda who bears an uncanny resemblance to the real life Ramnath Goenka and Madhvan portrays S. Gurumurthy, who gained national fame twenty years ago, spearheading virulent attacks against the Reliance group in one of India's bloodiest corporate wars.
