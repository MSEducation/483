.fm is the country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for the Federated States of Micronesia, a group of islands located in the Pacific Ocean.
Except for reserved names like .com.fm, .net.fm, .org.fm and others, any person in the world can register a .fm domain for a fee, much of the income from which goes to the government and people of the islands. The domain name is popular (and thus economically valuable) for FM radio stations and streaming audio websites (other similar ccTLDs are .am, .tv, .cd, .dj and .mu); a notable example is Last.fm, a social music website.

==Social media use==

The .fm domain extension has also been used by various companies outside of the audio streaming industry or the Federated States of Micronesia. Examples include:
Many commercial radio stations also use the domain extension.
