[tpl]Other people2|Christopher Evans (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]Christopher Evans[/tpl]

Christopher James "Chris" Evans (born 1 April 1966) is an English presenter, businessman and producer for radio and television.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/chris-evans-life-story-681299.html|title=Chris Evans: Life Story|accessdate=24 May 2008|work=The Independent | location=London | date=14 April 2001[/tpl]
He started his broadcasting career working for Piccadilly Radio, Manchester as a teenager, before moving to London as a presenter for the BBC's Greater London Radio and then Channel 4 television, where The Big Breakfast made him a star. Soon he was able to dictate highly favourable terms, allowing him to broadcast on competing radio and TV stations. Slots like Radio 1 Breakfast Show and TFI Friday provided an appealing mix of celebrity interviews, music and comic games, delivered in an irreverent style that attracted complaints and higher ratings in equal measure. By 2000 he was the UK's highest paid entertainer, according to the Sunday Times Rich List.
In 2005, he started a new career on Radio 2, involving the long-running Drivetime programme, as well as a new breakfast show. More recent work for BBC1 and Channel 4 has not achieved the success of his earlier ventures.

Evans passed the 11 plus exam and started at Boteler Grammar School, Warrington. But 
After the death of his father, the 13-year-old Evans took part-time work at an outlet of T. J. & B. McLoughlin's newsagent–tobacconist in Woolston, and ran an alternative tuck-shop at Padgate High School, which was a comprehensive school he attended for the final three years of his secondary education. Evans left secondary school at age 16 after moving into the sixth form, and he then had a number of dead-end jobs in and around Warrington, including a private detective agency and notoriously as a "Tarzan-ogram."[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1082833.stm|title=The reign of the Ginger prince|publisher=BBC News|date=22 December 2000|accessdate=23 May 2008[/tpl]

==Career==

===Early career===

Evans began his professional career at Piccadilly Radio, Manchester in 1983, where he had previously had unpaid school-boy work.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.northwestradio.info/memories/piccadilly-key-103/|title=Piccadilly 261|publisher=North West Radio|accessdate=23 May 2008[/tpl] Until 1984 Evans had three jobs: as an assistant to Timmy Mallett, and playing a character on his show called 'Nobby Nolevel' ('No 'O' Level'); acting as a disc jockey in the evenings at local pubs when he was not at Piccadilly Radio; and still working at the newsagents, opening up daily at 5 am to sort out the newspaper deliveries.
Evans switched to a full-time position at the station in 1984, his new role including being driven around the Manchester area in the radio car to turn up at listeners' houses. In addition he was producer to presenter James H. Reeve. Following this he presented a weekday graveyard slot with competitions and segments where listeners had opportunities to sell their belongings on air.
After working as a producer on Richard Branson's service The Superstation, where he produced material for Jonathan Ross, Evans went on to work at BBC London radio station GLR, first as a producer on Emma Freud's mid-morning show, then Weekend Breakfast with Danny Baker. Evans became a GLR presenter in early 1990, taking over a Saturday afternoon show. Three months later, he started presenting The Greenhouse, a Monday to Thursday evening show; he remained on this slot until the end of 1990.
In early 1991, as a result of his first regular TV hosting work presenting the Power Up breakfast show on The Power Station for British Satellite Broadcasting, Evans moved to presenting Round at Chris's, every Saturday morning from 10:00 am to 1:00 pm, which he continued to present until April 1993.

===Rise to popularity===

In addition to his Saturday morning show on GLR, in March 1992 Evans began presenting a Sunday afternoon show on BBC Radio 1, replacing Phillip Schofield who had previously broadcast in the slot. His show called Too Much Gravy, was broadcast from 14:30 to 16:00 and ended in September 1992. His move to Radio 1 was short-lived but seen as a huge success, with controller Johnny Beerling later admitting he wished he'd offered Evans a full-time show there and then. At the time, however, Evans objected that Radio 1 had attempted to constrain his style, preventing him from using the "zoo" format, allegedly because Steve Wright was already doing that on the station.
In April 1993, Evans left GLR and joined the new Virgin Radio, to host a Saturday morning show.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]

===The Big Breakfast===

Evans' departure from radio was in part so he could devote his time to the new Channel 4 breakfast television show, The Big Breakfast, from 28 September 1992. Evans co-hosted the show with Gaby Roslin.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl]
Evans left The Big Breakfast on 29 September 1994 and formed his own television production company, Ginger Productions. Its first major programme, Don't Forget Your Toothbrush, was broadcast between 1994 and 1995. The original concepts proved to be lucrative for Evans as its format was sold to numerous foreign broadcasters.

===Radio 1 Breakfast Show===

In April 1995, Evans returned to radio to host the flagship Radio 1 Breakfast Show. Evans negotiated into his contract with Radio 1 a clause allowing him to still make television programmes, and specifically an option to make a Friday night programme for Channel 4.
Allowed to create the "zoo" format he had previously been disallowed from performing on Radio 1, Evans was given a free rein by his friend, Radio 1 controller Matthew Bannister. Critics hated innuendo-laden features like Honk Your Horn and in Bed With Your Girlfriend, but Evans put on 600,000 new listeners over Steve Wright – one for every £5 spent on salary and advertising. The effect also flowed through into the listening figures for later programs. The audience grew as the breakfast format became more outrageous: humiliating assistant Holly Samos by repeatedly asking her about her sex life (Evans and Samos were reportedly in a relationship at periods through their time working together), and encouraging two female guests to perform a strip show on live radio.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/1997/01/17/neva117.html|title=Rise and fall of Radio 1's gaffe-prone presenter|author=Boshoff, Alison|work=The Telegraph|date=17 January 1997|accessdate=23 May 2008 | location=London[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] The show's highest listening figure reached 7.5million.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://news.scotsman.com/chrisevans/Evans-big-hangover.2439680.jp|title=Evans' big hangover|author=Synnot, Siobhan|work=The Scotsman|date=23 June 2003|accessdate=24 May 2008[/tpl]
Evans began making editions of Channel 4's TFI Friday from 1996. The show – devised, produced and hosted by Evans through his Ginger Media company – combined celebrity interviews, musical guests and daft games and competitions. Largely based on the successful formula of his radio show, it was initially a big success. However, as the success of both shows peaked, combined with a string of celebrity relationships and highly publicised nights drinking with friends Danny Baker and Paul Gascoigne, the strain began to show, and a model emerged described as a "template for his approach to all his subsequent projects – an abundance of enthusiasm at the beginning which eventually falls prey to boredom and shiftlessness."
Beginning to think he was indispensable at Radio 1, the first big falling-out with management came in December 1995 after taking his crew out on a 17-hour pub-crawl which ended two hours before they were due on air: Evans was fined one day's pay, £7,000. In 1996, broadcasting watchdogs investigated a continual trail of complaints against the show: Radio 1 refused to comment, Evans never said sorry. Evans also made increasing public demands of the Radio 1 management: after taking an extra week of unplanned holiday, Evans chose to turn up half an hour late for his 06:30 show and then demanded that his hours were changed so that it was a permanent fixture – this request was accepted.
However after the summer break things got decidedly worse. Criticised by the broadcasting watchdog for a tasteless joke about Holocaust victim Anne Frank, Evans countered with an item about haemorrhoids. Asked by Bannister to watch the rules, Evans the next day branded Bannister "The Fat Controller". In November, Evans announced on air that he was medically unfit to be on the radio – Bannister re-negotiated his contract to double his holiday to twice that of other Radio 1 DJs. After more publicised public drinking and self-confessed illness, Evans' spell at the station ended in January 1997 when he quit after his demand not to host the show on Friday (in order to have a full day getting ready for his TV show) was not accepted.
The Radio 1 Breakfast Show was taken over by Mark and Lard a.k.a. Mark Radcliffe and Marc Riley.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2007/may/28/mondaymediasection.radio|title=Made in Manchester|author=Plunkett, John|work=The Guardian|date=28 May 2007|accessdate=23 May 2008 | location=London[/tpl] When Evans found out that they were a ratings disaster, he quickly got in touch with BBC Radio 1 management to ask whether he could take back the show again. Station management declined but did offer him a weekend slot, which he turned down. In response to the falling ratings, bosses decided to replace its presenters with the relatively unknown Kevin Greening and the well known children's TV presenter Zoë Ball. Their tenure started on 13 October 1997.

===Virgin Radio===

During a holiday in Killarney, he listened to the Irish broadcaster, Gerry Ryan on the radio. Evans claims the variety on Ryan's show made him want to return to radio.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/he-rescued-my-radio-career-says-bbc-star-2162406.html|title=He rescued my career says BBC star|publisher=Irish Independent|date=3 May 2010|accessdate=20 May 2010[/tpl] Evans was then hired by Virgin Radio to host its breakfast show, prompting an immediate upsurge in listening figures to the station 1.8 million to 2.6 million. His first show was on 13 October 1997, the same day as Kevin Greening and Zoë Ball on Radio 1. Starting at 7:00 am, Evans' crew presented the show from Monday to Friday, but without Evans participating on a Friday.
As Sir Richard Branson had decided to reduce his media holding, he began talks to sell the station to Capital Radio in a deal that would have given him 10% of holding company Capital Group. As this became public knowledge, Evans, who did not want to work for Capital, publicly dismissed them as "a bleating, blowing asthmatic dog."[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/search/article/406973/uk-clown-media-mogul-tv-upstart-chris-evans-stunned-the-broadcasting-world-buying-/|title=Can this clown be a media mogul?|publisher=Management Today|date=1 July 1999|accessdate=23 May 2008[/tpl] On 9 December, with the assistance of investors, Evans’ vehicle Ginger Media Group bought Virgin Radio from Branson for £85m, to control the interests both of Ginger Productions and Virgin Radio. Both Apax Partners and Branson each owned 20% of Ginger Media Group, while Evans and his investors owned the remaining 60%.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/601640.stm|title=Evans sells up|publisher=BBC News|date=13 January 2000|accessdate=23 May 2008[/tpl] The group later engaged in the prospect of buying the Daily Star newspaper, but decided against from commercial angles.

===Sale of GMG – dismissal and legal cases===

On 14 March 2000, Evans agreed the sale of Ginger Media Group to SMG plc for £225m. The sale made Evans the highest paid entertainer in the UK in 2000, estimated by the Sunday Times Rich List to have been paid around £35.5million.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1029072.stm|title=Evans tops UK showbiz earners|publisher=BBC News|date=18 November 2000|accessdate=23 May 2008[/tpl] Following poor reviews of TFI Friday,[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/307122.stm|title=Channel 4's TFI a 'turn-off'|publisher=BBC News|date=29 March 1999|accessdate=23 May 2008[/tpl] and Evans himself handing over presentation of the last series to a series of "friends", the show was cancelled in December 2000.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1082844.stm|title=The rise and fall of TFI|publisher=BBC News|date=22 December 2000|accessdate=23 May 2008[/tpl]
Evans continued to host the station's breakfast show, but echoes of his earlier dismissal from Radio 1 began to emerge. In May 2000, the station was fined £75,000 (then the largest penalty imposed by the Radio Authority) for his repeated on-air endorsement of Ken Livingstone in the London mayoral elections.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/evans-counts-the-cost-of-supporting-ken-pound100000-plus-a-pound75000-fine-718870.html |title=Evans counts the cost of supporting Ken: £100,000 (plus a £75,000 fine) |work=The Independent |date=17 May 2000|accessdate=1 May 2009 | location=London | first1=Jojo | last1=Moyes[/tpl]
Virgin Radio's new programme controller Paul Jackson, in light of audience figures which had dropped from a peak of 2.7 million to 1.7 million, had pruned Evans's "zoo" team and installed a music policy which replaced more eclectic choices with a strict diet of chart pop. As a result, on 20 June Evans was followed throughout the day by tabloid newspaper photographers, and undertook an "18-hour bender" which started after his show at 9.30 in the morning, and ended – after numerous pints of Kronenbourg and Guinness, plus five bottles of Dom Pérignon – with Evans asleep in front of a lap-dancer at Stringfellows.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2001/07/01/do10.xml |title=Ginger binger |work=The Telegraph |date=1 July 2001|accessdate=23 May 2008 | location=London[/tpl] Later photographed by the tabloids that week with new wife Billie Piper in the nearest pub to their home in Hascombe, Surrey while claiming he was too ill to present his show,[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/3022702.stm|title=Timeline: Chris Evans and Virgin|publisher=BBC News|date=26 June 2003|accessdate=20 June 2008[/tpl] he was dismissed on 28 June 2001 for repeatedly failing to arrive at work.

In his autobiography, Evans writes that shortly after the sale of Virgin Radio he was offered £56m for his SMG shares by Goldman Sachs. He declined the offer and eventually sold them for £250,000.[

===UMTV===

In August 2002 Chris Evans set up a radio and television production company, UMTV, with the aim of specialising in live, cutting-edge, entertainment programming. Over the next 3 years UMTV produced more than 375 hours of television, with mixed success. TV shows included Boys and Girls hosted by Vernon Kay for Channel 4,[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2979038.stm|title=Evans' game show given chop|publisher=BBC News|date=10 June 2003|accessdate=24 May 2008[/tpl] Johnny Vegas: 18 Stone of Idiot for Channel 4 / E4; OFI Sunday for ITV;[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/4250348.stm|title=Live TV comeback for Chris Evans|publisher=BBC News|date=15 September 2005|accessdate=24 May 2008[/tpl] Live with Christian O'Connell and Live with Chris Moyles for Five;[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2111850.stm|title=Evans signs £4m chat show deal|publisher=BBC News|date=7 July 2002|accessdate=23 May 2008[/tpl] and the BAFTA award-winning School of Hard Knocks for 4 Learning.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/3753555.stm|title=Host Evans 'back for schools TV'|publisher=BBC News|date=27 May 2004|accessdate=24 May 2008[/tpl]
Following two high-profile shows which failed to perform in the ratings, UMTV hired Terry Wogan and Evans' former Big Breakfast co-host Gaby Roslin to host a weekday morning magazine show, The Terry and Gaby Show. Evans said publicly that if this show failed he would set up a market stall. Despite critical acclaim the audience numbers never took off and Channel 5 axed the show after its year-long run, citing its high cost as a reason. True to his word, Evans was pictured at the end of the final show with a market stall and later he opened it for real at Stables Market, Camden.

===Radio 2===

Evans re-entered public life in early 2005, presenting the breakfast slot of UK Radio Aid’s day of programming for the victims of the Asian Tsunami, which was aired on most of the UK's commercial radio stations, and also The BRIT Awards in 2005 and 2006.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/4036423.stm|title=Chris Evans returns as Brits host|publisher=BBC News|date=23 November 2004|accessdate=24 May 2008[/tpl] From April 2005, Evans presented a number of one-off Bank Holiday shows for BBC Radio 2,[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/4321917.stm|title=Evans to return to BBC airwaves|publisher=BBC News|date=5 March 2005|accessdate=24 May 2008[/tpl] including coverage of the Live 8 concert in London.

====Saturday afternoon show====

Evans then joined Radio 2 on a permanent basis in September 2005, presenting a weekly Saturday afternoon show from 14:00 to 17:00. His first show featured singer Robbie Williams, and accompanied by a posse including friend "Big" Pete Winterbottom and newsreader Andrew Peach. Evans told listeners to his first show: "We've had a couple of test drives over the summer and we've decided to take it. Yes, we like this vehicle."[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/4255812.stm|title=Chris Evans starts Radio 2 show|publisher=BBC News|date=17 September 2005|accessdate=24 May 2008[/tpl]

====Move to Drivetime====

The show was well received by listeners and critics, and Evans was announced as the successor to Radio 2's Drivetime show on Thursday 2 March 2006 to succeed long-time host Johnnie Walker, beginning on 18 April.[tpl]cite news|url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/organgrinder/2006/04/chris_evans_live_1.html|title=Chris Evans' new Radio 2 show|author=Brook, Stephen|work=The Guardian|date=18 April 2006|accessdate=24 May 2008 | location=London[/tpl] RAJAR audience figures published in August 2006 showed Evans had 150,000 fewer listeners than his predecessor's last show but was on par with previous years.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5241110.stm|title=Chris Moyles hits audience high|publisher=BBC News|date=3 August 2006|accessdate=24 May 2008[/tpl] The second set of RAJAR's published in October 2006 showed his audience was up by 109,000 year-on-year, and up by 33,000 compared with the previous quarter.

====The Chris Evans Breakfast Show====

Evans took over Radio 2 breakfast show on 11 January 2010. His first three songs were The Beatles' "All You Need Is Love" and "Got to Get You into My Life"; and Frank Sinatra's "Come Fly with Me". His co-presenters include ex-BBC TV newsreader Moira Stuart, sports presenter Jonny Saunders who was replaced in June 2011 by Vassos Alexander, and travel reporter Lynn Bowles. Features include The Gobsmackers (two songs selected by a listener that sound good played back to back).

===Sony Music Radio Personality of the Year===

In May 2006, Evans was named music radio personality of the year at the annual Sony Radio Academy Awards, defeating rivals Jamie Theakston, Lauren Laverne, Marc Riley and Tim Lovejoy to win. When accepting the award, Evans thanked the BBC for giving him "a second chance."[tpl]Cite web|url=http://radio.about.com/b/2006/05/10/bbc-radio-2s-chris-evans-named-music-radio-personality.htm|title=BBC Radio 2's Chris Evans Named Music Radio Personality|author=Deitz, Corey|publisher=About.com|date=10 May 2006|accessdate=24 May 2008[/tpl] Evans won 'music radio personality' the following year, while his show won the Entertainment award.

===Return to television===

After his success in the 1990s, Evans' attempts at a TV comeback in the 21st century have been mixed with a record of poor ratings and cancellations, including falling viewing figures for his recent role as co-host of Friday editions of The One Show.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl] In November and December 2005 Evans presented OFI Sunday on ITV. In a move described by Private Eye as Partridgean, ex-wife Billie Piper was the first guest on the programme.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.nowmagazine.co.uk/videos/256437/billie-piper-appears-on-ofi-sunday/1|title=Billie Piper appears on OFI Sunday|publisher=NOW! magazine|accessdate=24 May 2008[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] OFI Sunday was cancelled after just five shows following poor reviews and low viewing figures. Its cancellation led Evans to complain on air during his Saturday BBC Radio 2 slot that he no longer knew how to be successful on television.

===The One Show===

In 2010, it was announced that Evans would be replacing Adrian Chiles as the Friday co-presenter of The One Show on BBC One.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8618242.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Evans to host Friday's One Show | date=13 April 2010[/tpl] Chiles and then co-host Christine Bleakley left the show to join ITV. Evans now presents the show on Fridays with Alex Jones, and occasionally covers other weekdays.
