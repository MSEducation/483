[[PDC Order of Merit]]

CATEGORIES: Darts, Professional Darts Corporation, Lists of darts players, Sports world rankings

The PDC Order of Merit is a world ranking system used by one of the darts organisations, the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC). Following the 2007 PDC World Darts Championship it superseded a world ranking system based on points being awarded for performances in ranking tournaments.

==How it works==

The Order of Merit is similar to that employed in golf's European Tour. Prize money won during the previous two seasons is calculated and the rankings are determined from this money list.
The Professional Darts Corporation adopted an Order of Merit system in 2007, which is based on prize money won over two years for the main Order of Merit and separate one-year rankings for other PDC Pro Tour events.

==Current PDC ProTour Order of Merit==

The ProTour Order of Merit consists of prize money won in Players Championship events, UK Open Qualifiers and European Tour events. It is used to determine qualification for all Premier Events except for the UK Open,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.pdc.tv/order-of-merit-rules/article/i4cajikuwjge1ib9n5qhnknh9/title/invitations-and-seedings | title=Order of Merit Rules; 3.Invitations and Seedings | publisher=PDC | accessdate=6 June 2013[/tpl] which makes use of a separate UK Open Order of Merit:

The PDC rankings determine exemptions from the qualifying competitions from each major event:

==Televised Ranking Tournaments==

There is often a lot of confusion with televised tournaments and knowing which ones count towards the PDC Order of Merit. While a lot of televised tournaments are ranked, some are not, usually due to the tournament in question having restricted places e.g.  Premier League.

==Previous world ranking system==

Under the previous ranking points system, Colin Lloyd was the world number one player in the PDC for most of 2005 and 2006, despite most of the major titles being shared between Phil Taylor, Raymond van Barneveld and John Part. Although Lloyd also won two major titles, he often accumulated ranking points in the less prestigious non-televised events, in which Taylor did not always compete. Similarly, Alan Warriner was world number one on four separate occasions before ever winning his first and only PDC major, the 2001 Grand Prix, while Taylor won eight world championships and a host of other titles during that period.

==First WDC/PDC rankings==

Following the World Darts Council (now PDC) split from the British Darts Organisation during 1992-94 the WDC drew up its first ranking list in the run-up to its inaugural 1994 World Championship. Mike Gregory and Chris Johns later went back to the BDO set up and Bobby George and many of the non-UK players never competed in the early days of the WDC.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2010[/tpl]
