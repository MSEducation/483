[[Decametre]]

CATEGORIES: Units of length, Orders of magnitude (length)

A decametre or dekametre (American spelling: dekameter, earlier decameter; symbol dam, sometimes Dm or dkm) is a very rarely used unit of length in the metric system, equal to ten metres, the SI base unit of length. It can be written in scientific notation as [tpl]Nowrap|1 E+1 m[/tpl] (exponential notation), meaning [tpl]Nowrap|10 Ã— 1 m[/tpl].
This measure is included in the SI mostly for completeness: in principle, any combination of prefix and unit is permissible, but many are rarely used in practice. One practical use of the decameter is for altitude of geopotential heights in meteorology. Meteorologists also use another seldom encountered SI prefix: hecto- in hectopascal (hPa).  The volumetric form (see below) cubic decametre is convenient for describing large volumes of water such as in rivers and lakes.
