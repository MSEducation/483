===Story===

A man feeling the blues (most likely a love problem), turns on the news when a person comes on, claiming that "heartaches are healed by the sea." Without a moment's notice, he heads down to the beach, eager for a night on the town. After two piña coladas, the man begins to feel elated, and at this point never wants to leave. The chorus also suggests that he continues drinking, specifically, drinking Captain Morgan, until he forgets his troubles and is happy.

===The music===

The song is in F major with an approximate tempo of 120 beats per minute[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtdFPE.asp?ppn=MN0016531&|title=Two Piña Coladas sheet music|work=Musicnotes.com|accessdate=24 September 2011[/tpl] and a moderate Latin music feel, punctuated by several acoustic guitar runs (mostly performed by Shawn Camp, the song's co-writer). A large crowd of singers joins Brooks on the song's final chorus.
