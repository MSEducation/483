She began her professional life as a writer of short stories for magazines. However, at the suggestion of an editor, she reworked one of her unpublished short stories into her first novel, Invisible Tides, subsequently writing over 30 books during a career that spanned more than three decades. Her novels were published almost annually until shortly before her death from heart problems in 1955.[tpl]cite news|title=Mrs. Beatrice Kean Seymour|newspaper=The Times (London, England)|date=Nov. 1955: 11[/tpl]

==Approach to writing==

Seymour believed that the role of the novelist is to help readers think through their emotions.[tpl]cite news|last=Kean Seymour|first=Beatrice|title=article|newspaper=The Bookman (London)|date=vol. 68, pg 8, Ap. 1925[/tpl] She saw the novel as far superior to the short story as a vehicle for conveying social ideas.[tpl]cite book|author1=Leonard Alfred George Strong|author2=Adrian Richard ALINGTON|title=Beginnings, Etc. by Adrian Alington and Other Writers of Fiction on Their Own Literary Beginnings.

==Critical reception==

Some British reviewers reportedly considered Invisible Tides to be the best novel of 1920.[tpl]cite news|title=Books Reviewed for the Gazette Times Readers|newspaper=The Pittsburgh Gazette Times|date=5 Sep 1921. p. 14[/tpl] A reviewer from The Bookman wrote that it was: "a good and moving story, brilliantly set down, having affinities, it seems to us, with  Jude the Obscure on the one hand and with Mr. McKenna's Sonia on the other. Mrs. Seymour is strong in characterisation, subtle and revealing in dialogue, and exquisite in her descriptions of nature, touched as they are with a fine imaginativeness".[tpl]cite news|title=Invisible Tides|newspaper=The Bookman (London, England)|date=57:156 Ja. 1920[/tpl]
Her 1925 novel Unveiled received a glowing review in the 30 May 1925 issue of The New Yorker.[tpl]cite journal|title=Books|journal=The New Yorker|date=30 May 1925|page=26[/tpl] But some critical responses were not so favourable. A Times Literary Supplement critic wrote of her 1927 novel Three Wives: "Had Miss Seymour compressed her novel into three-quarters its present length, it might have been a really distinguished piece of work".[tpl]cite news|title=Review of Three Wives|newspaper=Times Literary Supplement|year=1927|page=688[/tpl]
When she died in 1955, The Times said of her: “She had already established herself as a literary figure of importance 30 years ago and the skill and variety with which she portrayed English domestic scenes and projected them against a larger social and political background are of a high order”.
More recently, her novels have been appraised as reflecting an alertness to the role of women in society.[tpl]cite book|author1=Virginia Blain|author2=Patricia Clements|author3=Isobel Grundy|title=The Feminist Companion to Literature in English: Women Writers from the Middle Ages to the Present|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=A4MjAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=9 August 2013|year=1990|publisher=B.
