Eero Aarnio (born 21 July 1932 in Helsinki) is a Finnish interior designer, noted for his innovative furniture designs in the 1960s, such as his plastic and fibreglass chairs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.scandinaviandesign.com/Eero_Aarnio/ |title=Eero Aarnio |publisher=Scandinaviandesign.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-12[/tpl]
Aarnio studied at the Institute of Industrial Arts in Helsinki, and started his own office in 1962. The following year, he introduced his Ball Chair, a hollow sphere on a stand, open on one side to allow a person to sit within. The similar Bubble Chair was clear and suspended from above. Other innovative designs included his floating Pastil Chair (similar to a solid inner tube),[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=171907 |title=A10905 Armchair, 'Pastilli', moulded fibreglass reinforced polyester, designed by Eero Aarnio, made by Asko Finnternational, Finland, 1968 - Powerhouse Museum Collection |publisher=Powerhousemuseum.com |date=2009-01-22 |accessdate=2010-05-12[/tpl] and Tomato Chair (more stable with a seat between three spheres). His Screw Table, as the name suggests, had the appearance of a flat head screw driven into the ground. He was awarded the American Industrial Design award in 1968.
Aarnio's designs were an important aspect of 1960s popular culture, and could often be seen as part of sets in period science-fiction films.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eero-aarnio.com/83/Fakten.htm|title=Pionier des Kunststoffdesigns – Fakten über Eero Aarnio|publisher=www.eero-aarnio.com|date= |accessdate=2011-07-04[/tpl] Because his designs used very simple geometric forms, they were ideal for such productions.
Eero Aarnio continues to create new designs, including toys and furniture for children. Eero Aarnio opened his official webshop and first Design Eero Aarnio Showroom, in Helsinki. There you can find Aarnio`s latest design, prototypes and latest news.
