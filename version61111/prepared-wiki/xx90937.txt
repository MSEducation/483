Pacific Union College (PUC) is a private, coeducational liberal arts college located in Napa Valley, California. Its campus is located in the upper valley town of Angwin, eight miles north of St. Helena, California. It is the only four-year college in Napa County, California.
Pacific Union College was established in Healdsburg, California in 1882. It is the twelfth oldest institution of higher education in the state of California. In 1906, PUC changed its name from Healdsburg College to Pacific Union College. In 1909, the college moved to its present location in Angwin on Howell Mountain, overlooking California's Napa Valley wine country. The school was ranked America's Most Beautiful College in 2012 by Newsweek and The Daily Beast in part due to its setting in the Napa Valley.
A residential college, it serves an almost exclusively undergraduate student body the overwhelming majority of which live on campus.
PUC is the only liberal arts college affiliated with the Adventist Church. It was also the first school affiliated with the denomination receive regional accreditation when the Northwest Association of Secondary and Higher Schools granted it accreditation in 1933.
In 2014, president Heather J. Knight announced a reinterpretation of the college's statement of academic freedom as it interacted with church teachings and threatened to fire a long-time professor for challenging church teachings.
In the fall of 2011, enrollment at Pacific Union College stood at over 1,500 students.

==History==

Pacific Union College was founded as Healdsburg Academy in 1882 in Healdsburg, California in northern Sonoma County.[tpl]cite web|title=About PUC|url=http://www.puc.edu/about-puc|publisher=Pacific Union College|accessdate=2011-09-03[/tpl] It was renamed Healdsburg College in 1899. Sidney Brownsberger was its first President.[tpl]cite web|title=Sidney Brownsberger|url=http://library.puc.edu/heritage/brownsberger2.html|work=PUC Presidents|publisher=Pacific Union College: Nelson Memorial Library|accessdate=2011-09-04[/tpl] PUC was California's twelfth college and second founded by the Adventist Church, the first west of the Mississippi.Utt, W. (1996) A Mountain, A Pickax, A College, p. 3. In 1906 the name was changed to Pacific Union College. In 1909 it moved to its current location in Angwin, on Howell Mountain in neighboring Napa County, where the school had purchased the 1,636-acre Angwin Resort for $60,000.PUC website 1909 to 1930 photo gallery page.

One reason for relocating to Angwin Resort was its beautiful rural setting, which continues to be a defining characteristic.Angwin Community Council website  "Angwin: Then and Now" page. Accessed 2011-09-10.
In 1933, Pacific Union College became the first higher educational institution affiliated with the Adventist Church to achieve regional accreditation when it was awarded accreditation by the Northwest Association of Secondary and Higher Schools.[tpl]cite news|last=Greenleaf|first=Floyd|title=Timeline for Adventist Education|url=http://circle.adventist.org/files/jae/en/jae200567051005.pdf|accessdate=12 September 2011|newspaper=Journal of Adventist Education|date=Summer 2005|format=PDF[/tpl] The year before, PUC had become the first school to receive denominational accreditation. Pacific Union College also was the first Adventist school to form international affiliations; it affiliated with what is now Avondale College in Australia in 1954.
In 1935 its elementary and high schools were administratively separated from the college. The high school, PUC Preparatory School, is located on the campus itself while the elementary school is located down the road off campus.

===Presidents===

Pacific Union College has had a total of twenty-one presidents. The first eight of these served while the school was still in Healdsburg. Sidney Brownsberger, serving four years from 1882 to 1886, was the first president. In 1983, Malcolm Maxwell became the first alumnus to lead PUC, serving for a record 18 years. The current President is Heather Knight who took office in 2009 after serving as the Provost at Andrews University.

It has been recognized for its strong undergraduate program. It is the only liberal arts college affiliated with the Adventist Church according to the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.https://twitter.com/#!/PUCNow/status/142277996835897345[ref]According to the Carnegie Foundation, for a college to be classified as a 'liberal arts college' 50% or more of its degrees must be liberal arts degrees. PUC is the only Adventist school which meets this threshold. The Carnegie Foundation explains its designations in this reference.

Pacific Union College operates on a quarter-based academic calendar.
Some departments at Pacific Union College require students to submit a senior thesis project to complete their degrees.[tpl]cite news|last=Nakamura|first=Eirene-Gin|title=A Letter Home|url=http://www.puc.edu/puc-life/a-letter-home|accessdate=9 September 2011|newspaper=PUC Student Blogs|date=3 June 2011[/tpl]
In 2006 the faculty, administration and Board of Trustees underscored PUC's commitment to undergraduate education by making a formal decision to remain a college and not change its name to university, as other small private colleges had done. This decision was based on the institution's commitment to quality liberal arts undergraduate teaching."Our ninety-seven teaching faculty members are dedicated to undergraduate teaching and to quality academic programs, a dedication that was reaffirmed in the 2005-06 school year, when the president initiated a campus-wide debate on the question of whether PUC should give in to pressures to call ourselves a university, like many similar institutions. With near unanimity, the entire community—from the chair of the board of trustees to first-year students—soundly declared its determination to remain (in spite of all temptations…) a college."PUC Institutional (Re-accreditation) Proposal May 2007, p.1. Retrieved 2011-09-08.

===Controversy over academic freedom===

In early 2014, there was a controversy when a long-time department chair announced his resignation in response to president Heather Knight, preparing to remove a 26-year, tenured professor in his department for "lectures on sex that administrators said clashed with church teachings."Wilson, Robin (2 February 2013). Clash Over Professor’s Lectures on Sex Tests Academic Freedom at Religious College. Chronicle of Higher Education. Her actions were viewed as a reinterpretation of the school's policy on academic freedom which were previously interpreted to allow variations from church teachings. Knight withdrew her threat to fire the professor but "doubled down" on her reinterpretation of academic freedom after the professor agreed to alter his lectures to conform to her requests and following a major outcry from faculty, students and alumni. 
Academic Dean Nancy Lecourt stated that the conflict originated from tension between the school's commitment to promote the church and professors' freedom to teach, stating, "How do we get students thinking? We poke at them, we introduce them to new ideas, and we ask difficult questions... But how do we get them thinking without losing their faith?" Following the school's re-evaluation of academic freedom, Greg Schneider stated that "This damages the fabric the school's academic focus, and it’s going to take some reweaving." Schneider, who had taught at PUC for 37 years, planned to retire soon and asked, rhetorically, "Can I still, with my whole being, communicate to my students that this is where you ought to be?"
