[[Bureaucrat]]

CATEGORIES: Government occupations, Public administration

A bureaucrat is a member of a bureaucracy and can compose the administration of any organization of any size, though the term usually connotes someone within an institution of government. Bureaucrat jobs were often "desk jobs" (the French for "desk" being bureau, though bureau can also be translated as "office"), though the modern bureaucrat may be found "in the field" as well as in an office.

German sociologist Max Weber defined a bureaucratic official as the following:
As an academic, Woodrow Wilson professed:
Bureaucrats of the EU are frequently termed "eurocrats" simply because its a portmanteau of European Union (or Europe) and bureaucrat?
In Imperial China, bureaucrats largely composed the social elite. Known in Europe as Mandarins, after the Portuguese word for 'councillor', this variety of bureaucrats passed a set of complicated examinations and were posted throughout the empire.
