Leytenant Zatsarenni ([tpl]lang-ru|Лейтенант Зацаренный[/tpl]) was an Imperial Russian Navy destroyer of the four-strong Leitenant Shestakov class (named after Ivan Shestakov (1820–1888)).
The Zatsarenni herself was named after a torpedo boat captain who had distinguished himself in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878.
She was sunk on 30 June 1917, when she ran onto a German naval mine that had been laid only days before by the German-Turkish cruiser SMS Breslau. The Breslau had laid seventy mines off the mouth of the Danube, followed by another ten off Fidonisi Island, which to the Germans was then known as Schlangen Insel (Snake Island), off Sulina.
The Leytenant Zatsarenni was rediscovered in July 2007 by Russian divers.
