CATEGORIES: Flora of India, Dioscorea

Eklahare, or Himalayan yam, is a little-studied plant which appears above the ground as a low vine, but underground bears long, convoluted tuber growth stretching sometimes as deep as 2 metres. It is native to northern India. So far it has received very little attention from botanists, and its species has not even been determined or named, although its morphology and life patterns show it to belong in the Dioscorea genus, so it is tentatively referred to as Dioscorea sp. nov., literally, "new species of Dioscorea".
The tubers are edible, and are eaten during traditional religious festivals. Digging and selling taradi is a major source of income in the region, and there is even a village named Eklahare (Taluka District) due to the plant's abundance there.Dr. Chiranjit Parmar, in article "Taradi", The Heirloom Gardener, 2007.FAO Plant Breeding Newsletter, 1.01
