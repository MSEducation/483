The Psychedelic Furs' debut, a self-titled album from 1980, was produced by Steve Lillywhite.  The LP quickly established the band on radio in Europe and was a No. 18 hit in the UK Albums Chart.  The album also found success in Germany, Italy, France, Spain and Australia. The US version of the album was resequenced, but failed to have a strong commercial impact.
The Furs did find success in the US with their next release, 1981's Talk Talk Talk, which saw the band making its debut on the US Billboard 200 chart.  In New Zealand, the band became popular, as Talk Talk Talk reached No. 8 in the charts, the first in a string of Furs' albums to peak in the New Zealand Top 10.
In the UK, the album spun off two charting singles, "Dumb Waiters" and the original version of "Pretty in Pink". The latter song served as inspiration for the 1986 John Hughes film of the same name, and was re-recorded for the platinum-selling soundtrack - though Richard Butler remains adamant that the cinematic interpretation had very little to do with the song's original intent.[tpl]cite web |url=http://thequietus.com/articles/05128-the-psychedelic-furs-interview-talk-talk-talk/ |title=All Of This And Nothing: The Psychedelic Furs on 'Talk Talk Talk' |author=Ogg, Alex |date=20 Oct 2010 |work=The Quietus |accessdate=10 May 2011 [/tpl]
In 1982, the band was reduced to a four-piece with the departures of Morris and Kilburn, and moved to the U.S. in search of a producer.[ref]
