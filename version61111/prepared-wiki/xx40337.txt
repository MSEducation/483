The National Rainbow Coalition (National Alliance of Rainbow Coalition - NARC) was a coalition of Kenyan political parties in power from 2002 and 2005 when it fell apart in a controversy between its wings about a constitutional referendum.

==Formation==

In preparation of the 2002 elections, the National Alliance Party of Kenya (Formerly NAK now NAPK) allied itself with the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to form the National Alliance of Rainbow Coalition (NARC). On December 27, 2002, NARC won a landslide victory over KANU. NARC presidential candidate Mwai Kibaki got 62% of the votes in the presidential elections, against only 31% for the KANU candidate, Uhuru Kenyatta. On December 30, 2002, Mwai Kibaki was sworn in as the third President of Kenya.

==NARC Government==

Despite its initial popularity, the NARC-led government has been troublesome. The friction between LDP and those loyal to Kibaki became apparent. After the Kenyan constitutional referendum in 2005, all LDP members were thrown out of the government. Subsequently LDP became an opposition party, forming the Orange Democratic Movement, a coalition opposition politicians. Later, NARC members loyal to Kibaki founded a new party, NARC-Kenya. Consequently, the original NARC was left in the hands of its chairperson Charity Ngilu who also served as the minister of health.
