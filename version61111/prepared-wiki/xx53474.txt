[[File:MP & EN plot of metals7.png|500px|right|thumb|Scatter plot of metal electronegativity values and melting points (up to fermium, element 100). The other metals are distinguished by their relatively high electronegativity values and relatively low melting points. High electronegativity corresponds to increasing nonmetallic character;Roher 2001, pp. 2‒3 low melting temperature corresponds to weaker cohesive forces between atoms and reduced mechanical strength.Messler 2006, p. 347 The geography of the plot broadly matches that of the periodic table. Starting from the bottom left, and proceeding clockwise, the alkali metals are followed by the heavier alkaline earth metals; the rare earths and actinides (Sc, Y and the lanthanides being here treated as rare earths); transition metals with intermediate electronegativity values and melting points; the refractory metals; the platinum group metals; the coinage metals; and the other metals.
The increased electropositivity of Be and Mg and the higher melting point of Be distances these light alkaline earth metals from their heavier congeners. This separation extends to other differences in physical and chemical behaviour between the light and heavier alkaline earth metals.[tpl]#tag:ref|Physical properties: 'The lighter alkaline earths possess fairly high electrical and thermal conductivities and sufficient strength for structural use.

Zinc is a soft metal (MH 2.5) with poor mechanical properties.Schweitzer 2003, p. 603 It has a crystalline structure (BCN 6+6) that is slightly distorted from the ideal. Many zinc compounds are markedly covalent in character.Hutchinson 1964, p. 562 The oxides of zinc in its preferred oxidation state of +2, namely ZnO and Zn(OH)2, are amphoteric;Greenwood & Earnshaw 1998, p. 1209; Gupta CK 2002, p. 590 it forms anionic zincates in strongly basic solutions.Rayner-Canham & Overton 2006, p. 30 Zinc forms Zintl phases such as LiZn, NaZn13 and BaZn13.Kneip 1996, p. xxii Highly purified zinc, at room temperature, is ductile.Russell & Lee 2005, p. 339 It reacts with moist air to form a thin layer of carbonate that prevents further corrosion.Sequeira 2013, p. 243
Cadmium is a soft, ductile metal (MH 2.0) that undergoes substantial deformation, under load, at room temperature.Russell & Lee 2005, p. 349 Like zinc, it has a crystalline structure (BCN 6+6) that is slightly distorted from the ideal. The halides of cadmium, with the exception of the fluoride, exhibit a substantially covalent nature.Borsari 2005, p. 608 The oxides of cadmium in its preferred oxidation state of +2, namely CdO and CdOH2, are weakly amphoteric; it forms cadmates in strongly basic solutions.Dirkse 1986, pp. 287–288, 296; Ivanov-Emin, Misel'son & Greksa 1960 Cadmium forms Zintl phases such as LiCd, RbCd13 and CsCd13. When heated in air to a few hundred degrees, cadmium represents a toxicity hazard due to the release of cadmium vapour; when heated to its boiling point in air (just above 1000 K; 725 C; 1340 F; cf steel ~2700 K; 2425 C; 4400 F),Wanamaker & Pennington 1921, p. 56 the cadmium vapour oxidizes, 'with a reddish-yellow flame, dispersing as an aerosol of potentially lethal CdO particles.' Cadmium is otherwise stable in air and in water, at ambient conditions, protected by a layer of cadmium oxide.

===B-subgroup metals===

Superficially, the B-subgroup metals are the metals in Groups IB to VIB of the periodic table, corresponding to Groups 11 to 16 using current IUPAC nonmenclature. Practically, the group 11 metals (copper, silver and gold) are ordinarily regarded as transition metals (or sometimes as coinage metals, or noble metals) whereas the group 12 metals (zinc, cadmium, and mercury) may or may not be treated as B-subgroup metals depending on if the transition metals are taken to end at group 11 or group 12. The 'B' nomenclature (as in Groups IB, IIB, and so on) was superseded in 1988 but is still occasionally encountered in more recent literature.Zubieta & Zuckerman 2009, p. 260: 'The compounds AsSn and SbSn, which are classified as alloys of two B subgroup metals, exhibit superconducting properties with a transition temperature of about 4 K.'; Schwartz 2010, p. 32: 'The metals include the alkali and alkaline earths, beryllium, magnesium, copper, silver, gold and the transition metals. These metals exhibit those characteristics generally associated with the metallic state. The B subgroups comprise the remaining metallic elements.

Van WertVan Wert 1936, pp. 16, 18 grouped the periodic table metals into a. the light metals; b. the heavy brittle metals of high melting point, c. the heavy ductile metals of high melting point; d. the heavy metals of low melting point (Zn, Cd, Hg; Ga, In, Tl; Ge, Sn; As, Sb, Bi; and Po), and e. the strong, electropositive metals. Britton, Abbatiello and RobinsBritton, Abbatiello & Robins 1972, p. 704 speak of 'the soft, low melting point, heavy metals in columns lIB, IlIA, IVA, and VA of the periodic table, namely Zn, Cd, Hg; Al, Ga, In, Tl; Si, Ge, Sn, Pb; and Bi. The Sargent-Welch Chart of the Elements groups the metals into: light metals, the lanthanide series; the actinide series; heavy metals (brittle); heavy metals (ductile); and heavy metals (low melting point): Zn, Cd, Hg, Cn; Al, Ga, In, Tl; Ge, Sn, Pb, Fl; Sb, Bi; and Po.Sargent-Welch 2008[tpl]#tag:ref|Hawkes,Hawkes 1997 attempting to address the question of what is a heavy metal, commented that, 'Being a heavy metal has little to do with density, but rather concerns chemical properties'. He observed that, 'It may mean different things to different people, but as I have used, heard and interpreted the term over the last half-century, it refers to metals with insoluble sulfides and hydroxides, whose salts produce colored solutions in water, and whose complexes are usually colored.' He goes on to note that, 'The metals I have seen referred to as heavy metals comprise a block of all the metals in Groups 3 to 16 that are in periods 4 and greater. It may also be stated as the transition metals and post-transition metals.|group=n[/tpl]

===Less typical metals===

HabashiHabashi 2010 groups the elements into eight major categories: 1 typical metals (alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, and aluminium); 2 lanthanides (Ce–Lu); 3 actinides (Th–Lr); 4 transition metals (Sc, Y, La, Ac, groups 4–10); 5 less typical metals (groups 11–12, Ga, In, Tl, Sn and Pb); 6 metalloids (B, Si, Ge, As, Se, Sb, Te, Bi and Po); 7 covalent nonmetals (H, C, N, O, P, S and the halogens); and 8 monatomic nonmetals (that is, the noble gases).

===Metametals===

The metametals are zinc, cadmium, mercury, indium, thallium, tin and lead. They are ductile elements but, compared to their metallic periodic table neighbours to the left, have lower melting points, relatively low electrical and thermal conductivities, and show distortions from close-packed forms.Wiberg, Holleman & Wiberg 2001, p. 143 Sometimes berylliumKlemm 1950 and galliumMiller GJ, Lee C & Choe W 2002, p. 22 are included as metametals despite having low ductility.

===Ordinary metals===

AbrikosovAbrikosov 1988, p. 31 distinguishes between ordinary metals, and transition metals where the inner shells are not filled. The ordinary metals have lower melting points and cohesive energies than those of the transition metals.Cremer 1965, p. 514 GrayGray 2009, p. 9 identifies as ordinary metals: aluminium, gallium, indium, thallium, element 113, tin, lead, element 114, bismuth, element 115, and element 116. He adds that, 'in reality most of the metals that people think of as ordinary are in fact transition metals...'.

===P-block metals===

The p-block metals are the metals in groups 13‒15 (or 16) of the periodic table. Usually, this includes aluminium, gallium, indium and thallium; tin and lead; and bismuth. Germanium, antimony and polonium are sometimes also included, although the first two are commonly recognised as metalloids. The p-block metals tend to have structures that display low coordination numbers and directional bonding. Pronounced covalency is found in their compounds; the majority of their oxides are amphoteric.Parish 1977, pp. 178, 189–190, 192–3

===Peculiar metals===

SlaterSlater 1939, p.&npsb;444‒445 divides the metals 'fairly definitely, though not perfectly sharply' into the ordinary metals and the peculiar metals, the latter of which verge on the nonmetals. The peculiar metals occur towards the ends of the rows of the periodic table and include 'approximately:' gallium, indium, and thallium; carbon, silicon '(both of which have some metallic properties, though we have previously treated them as nonmetals),' germanium and tin; arsenic, antimony, and bismuth; and selenium '(which is partly metallic)' and tellurium. The ordinary metals have centro-symmetrical crystalline structures[tpl]#tag:ref|On manganese, Slater says, 'It is a very peculiar and anomalous exception to the general order of the elements. It is the only definite metal, far from the nonmetals in the table, which has a complicated structure.'Slater 1939, p. 448|group=n[/tpl] whereas the peculiar metals have structures involving directional bonding. More recently, Joshua observed that the peculiar metals have mixed metallic-covalent bonding.Joshua 1991, p. 45

===Poor metals===

Farrell and Van SicienFarrell & Van Sicien 2007, p. 1442 use the term poor metal, for simplicity, 'to denote one with a significant covalent, or directional character.' Hill and HolmanHill & Holman 2000, p. 40 observe that, 'The term poor metals is not widely used, but it is a useful description for several metals including tin, lead and bismuth. These metals fall in a triangular block of the periodic table to the right of the transition metals. They are usually low in the activity (electrochemical) series and they have some resemblances to non-metals.' Reid et al.Reid 2011, p. 143 write that 'poor metals' is, 'An older term for metallic elements in Groups 13‒15 of the periodic table that are softer and have lower melting points than the metals traditionally used for tools.'

===Post-transition metals===

The term post-transition metal is generally used to describe the category of metallic elements in periods 4–6 of the periodic table, to the right of the transition elements. As this description excludes aluminium, a period 3 metal,[tpl]#tag:ref| Aluminium is sometimes referred to as a pre-transition metal, along with the group 1 alkali metals and group 2 alkaline earth metals.|group=n[/tpl] the post-transition elements thereby form a subset of the other metals. The post-transition metals generally show reduced electropositivity, anionic species formation and a capacity to combine with electropositive metals to give Zintl phases. Compounds of the group 12 metals (zinc, cadmium and mercury) are markedly non-ionic in character, both in structure and properties. Simple cationic chemistry in the group 14 metals, tin and lead, is the exception rather than the norm.Cox 2004, pp. 27, 112, 185, 196, 202–3
Which elements are counted as post-transition metals depends, in periodic table terms, on where the transition metals are taken to end.[tpl]#tag:ref|A first IUPAC definition states "The elements of groups 3–12 are the d-block elements. These elements are also commonly referred to as the transition elements, though the elements of group 12 are not always included". Depending on the inclusion of group 12 as transition metals, the post-transition metals therefore may or may not include the group 12 elements—zinc, cadmium, and mercury. A second IUPAC definition for transition metals states "An element whose atom has an incomplete d sub-shell, or which can give rise to cations with an incomplete d sub-shell." Based on this definition one could argue group 12 should be split with mercury and copernicium as transition metals, and zinc and cadmium as post-transition metals. Of relevance is the synthesis of mercury(IV) fluoride, which seemingly establishes mercury as a transition metal. This conclusion has been challenged by JensenJensen 2008 with the argument that HgF4 only exists under highly atypical non-equilibrium conditions (at 4° K) and should best be considered as an exception. Copernicium is predicted to have (a) an electron configuration similar to that of mercury; and (b) a predominance of its chemistry in the +4 state, and on that basis would be regarded as a transition metal.|group=n[/tpl] In the 1950s, most inorganic chemistry textbooks defined transition elements as finishing at group 10 (nickel, palladium and platinum), therefore excluding group 11 (copper, silver and gold), and group 12 (zinc, cadmium and mercury). A survey of chemistry books in 2003 showed that the transition metals ended at either group 11 or group 12 with roughly equal frequency.

===Semimetals===

In modern use, the term 'semimetal' sometimes refers, loosely or explicitly, to metals with incomplete metallic character in crystalline structure, electrical conductivity or electronic structure. Examples include gallium, ytterbium,Johansen & Mackintosh 1970, pp. 121–4; Divakar, Mohan & Singh 1984, p. 2337; Dávila et al. 2002, p. 035411-3 bismuth, mercurySavitsky 1961, p. 107 and neptunium.Hindman 1968, p. 434: 'The high values obtained for the electrical resistivity indicate that the metallic properties of neptunium are closer to the semimetals than the true metals. This is also true for other metals in the actinide series.'; Dunlap et al. 1970, pp. 44, 46: '...α-Np is a semimetal, in which covalency effects are believed to also be of importance...For a semimetal having strong covalent bonding, like α-Np...' Metalloids, which are in-between elements that are neither metals nor nonmetals, are also sometimes instead called semimetals. The elements commonly recognised as metalloids are boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony and tellurium. In old chemistry, before the publication in 1789 of  Lavoisier's 'revolutionary'Strathern 2000, p. 239 Elementary Treatise on Chemistry,Roscoe & Schormlemmer 1894, p. 4 a semimetal was a metallic element with 'very imperfect ductility and malleability'Murray 1809, p. 300 such as zinc, mercury or bismuth.

===Transition metals===

Historically, the transition metal series 'includes those elements of the Periodic Table which "bridge the gap" between the very electropositive alkali and allkaline earth metals and the electronegative non-metals of the groups: nitrogen-phosphorus, oxygen-sulfur, and the halogens.'Young et al. 1969, p. 228 Cheronis, Parsons and RonnebergCheronis, Parsons & Ronneberg 1942, p. 570 wrote that, 'The transition metals of low melting point form a block in the Periodic Table: those of Groups II b cadmium, mercury, III b gallium, indium, thallium, and germanium, tin and lead in Group IV. These metals all have melting points below 425 °C.'[tpl]#tag:ref|In fact, both aluminium (660.32) and germanium (938.25) have melting points greater than 425°C.|group=n[/tpl]
