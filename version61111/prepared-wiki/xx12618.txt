[[Demographics of Zimbabwe]]

CATEGORIES: Demographics of Zimbabwe, Ethnic groups in Zimbabwe

This article is about the demographic features of the population of Zimbabwe, including population density, ethnicity, education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.

==Population==

The population of Zimbabwe has grown during the twentieth century in accordance with the model of a developing country with high birth rates and falling death rates, resulting in relatively high population growth rate (around 3% or above in the 1960s and early 1970s). After a spurt in the period 1980-1983 following independence, a decline in birth rates set in. Since 1991, however, there has been a jump in death rates from a low of 10 per 1000 in 1985 to a high of 25 per 1000 in 2002/2003. It has since subsided to just under 22 per 1000 (estimate for 2007) a little below the birth rate of around 27 per 1000.Statesman's Yearbook 2007, Palgrave Macmillan, New YorkCIA Factbook 2007, CIA Publications, Washington D.C. The high death rate is due to the impact of AIDS, which is by far the main cause of death.  This leads to a small natural increase of around 0.5%. However, outward migration rates of around 1.5% or more have been experienced for over a decade, therefore actual population changes are uncertain. Because of the high number of unaccounted emigrants, the recent increase of emigration and the death toll from AIDS, the total population might be declining to as low as 8 million according to some estimates.Article from The Independent

===Current estimates===

Based on a 2010 revision of World Population Prospects, the population of Zimbabwe was estimated by the United Nations at 12,576,000 in 2010. About 38.9% comprised youths under 15, while another 56.9% grouped persons aged between 15 and 65 years. Only around 4.2% of  citizens were apparently over 65.Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat, World Population Prospects: The 2010 Revision

==Vital statistics==

Registration of vital events is in Zimbabwe not complete. The Population Department of the United Nations prepared the following estimates.

==Ethnic groups==

According to 2012 Census report, 99.7% of the population is of African origin.http://www.zimstat.co.zw/dmdocuments/Census/CensusResults2012/National_Report.pdf
Of the rest of the population, the great bulk - perhaps 30,000 personshttp://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/11/02/zimbabwe-only-white-minster-says-insults-against-whites-continue-at-top/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/3df4becc1c.htmlhttp://www.newzimbabwe.com/pages/nitelife18.16206.html - are white Zimbabweans of European ancestry, a minority which had already diminished in size prior to independence.[tpl]cite book|last=Raeburn|first=Michael|title=We are everywhere: Narratives from Rhodesian guerillas|pages=1–209[/tpl]
The vast black majority has grown at a projected annual rate of 4.3% since 1980.http://www.indexmundi.com/zimbabwe/population_growth_rate.html Although present figures are difficult to ascertain, the white community once reproduced itself at an annual rate (under 1.5%) similar to that of most totals in developed nations.[tpl]cite book|last=Nelson|first=Harold|title=Zimbabwe: A Country Study|pages=80–137[/tpl] Of the two major ethnolinguistic categories, Shona speakers formed a decisive plurality and occupied the eastern two-thirds of Zimbabwe.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.scholars.nus.edu.sg/post/zimbabwe/zpeople.html |title=The People of Zimbabwe |accessdate=2007-11-13[/tpl] Ndebele speakers constitute about 16%, and none of the other indigenous ethnic groups came to as much as 2% in recent decades.[tpl]cite book|last=Famighetti|first=Robert|title=The World Almanac and Book of Facts, 1996|pages=837[/tpl] African speakers of nonindigenous languages included migrant workers from Malawi, Zambia, and Mozambique.http://www.postcolonialweb.org/zimbabwe/politics/losers.html
Three-quarters of white Zimbabweans are of British or British diasporan origin; at various times many immigrated from South Africa and elsewhere. After World War II, Zimbabwe (then Southern Rhodesia) received a substantial influx of emigrants from the United Kingdom - a handful previously resided in other colonies such as Pakistan and Kenya. Also represented on a much smaller scale were individuals of Afrikaner, Greek, and Portuguese origin. After Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence in 1965, Ian Smith's administration removed technical obstacles to immigration from southern Europe.
A heavily urbanised Coloured (or Goffal) population is descended partially from early unions between Rhodesian settlers and local African females. Many, however, can also trace their ancestry to the Dutch/Khoisan mulatto clans of the Cape. With the exception of a select few who were brought to Zimbabwe as railroad workers, most Asians in Zimbabwe arrived from India pursuing employment or entrepreneurship. An educated class, they have traditionally engaged in retail trade or manufacturing.

==Languages==

Zimbabwe has 16 official languages: Chewa, Chibarwe, English, Kalanga, Koisan, Nambya, Ndau, Ndebele, Shangani, Shona, sign language, Sotho,  Tonga, Tswana, Venda, Xhosa.The following languages, namely Chewa, Chibarwe, English, Kalanga, Koisan, Nambya, Ndau, Ndebele, Shangani, Shona, sign language, Sotho, Tonga, Tswana, Venda and Xhosa, are the officially recognised languages of Zimbabwe.  (CONSTITUTION OF ZIMBABWE (final draft)). English is also one of the official language of Zimbabwe and is widely used in administration, law and schools, though less than 2.5%, mainly the white and Coloured (mixed race) minorities, consider it their native language. The rest of the population speak Shona (70%) and Ndebele (20%) Kalanga (2%), etc.,.Zimbabwe GAP Adventures Shona has a rich oral tradition, which was incorporated into the first Shona novel, Feso by Solomon Mutswairo, published in 1956.Mother Tongue: Interviews with Musaemura B. Zimunya and Solomon Mutswairo University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill English is spoken primarily in the cities, but less so in rural areas.  Television news is  broadcast in English, Shona and Ndebele though the local languages time slot falls out of prime viewing time, but radio broadcasts in English, Ndebele, Shona, Kalanga, Nambya, Venda, Suthu and Tonga. English, Ndebele and Shona are given far more airtime.

==Religions==

Sixty two percent of Zimbabweans attend Christian churches.[tpl]cite web|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761575825_3/Zimbabwe.html |title=MSN Encarta |accessdate=2007-11-13|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwbJgfBy|archivedate=2009-10-31|deadurl=yes[/tpl] The largest Christian churches are Anglican, Roman Catholic, and Methodist. However like most former European colonies, Christianity is often mixed with enduring traditional beliefs. Besides Christianity, ancestral worship (Amadlozi) is the most practiced non-Christian religion which involves ancestor worship and spiritual intercession. Under 1% of the population is Muslim, although many Zimbabweans are influenced by Islamic food laws.

==Refugee crisis==

The economic meltdown and repressive political measures in Zimbabwe has led to a flood of refugees into neighboring countries. An estimated 3.4 million Zimbabweans, a quarter of the population, had fled abroad by mid 2007.Refugees flood from Zimbabwe The Observer Some 3 million of these have gone to South Africa.Zimbabwean refugees suffer in Botswana and South Africa Sokwanele Civic Action Group
Aside from those who fled into the neighbouring countries, an estimated 570,000 people are displaced within the borders of the country, many of whom remain in transit camps and have limited access to assistance. Most of the displaced have been victims of the Operation Murambatsvina in 2005 and continuing evictions and violent farm seizures. Their plight is virtually impossible to assess, as there has been no national survey of people displaced since 2005.Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC), Internal displacement in Zimbabwe''

==Health==

According to the United Nations World Health Organization, the life expectancy for men is 37 years and the life expectancy for women is 34 years of age, the lowest in the world in 2006.[tpl]cite book | title = The World Health Report 2006|url=http://www.who.int/entity/whr/2006/annex/06_annex1_en.pdf|chapter=Annex Table 1 - Basic indicators for all Member States|author=The World Health Organization|format=PDF[/tpl] An association of doctors in Zimbabwe have made calls for President Mugabe to make moves to assist the ailing health service.[tpl]cite news|title=In Zimbabwe, life ends before 40|author=Peta Thornycroft|location=Harare|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|date=2006-04-10|accessdate=2006-04-10|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/in-zimbabwe-life-ends-before-40/2006/04/09/1144521210993.html[/tpl]
Zimbabwe has a very high HIV infection rate. In 2001 it was measured at its highest level ever of 33.7% for people aged 15–49.
