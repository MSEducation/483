[[2-Pyrone]]

CATEGORIES: 2-Pyrones

2-Pyrone (α-pyrone or pyran-2-one) is an unsaturated cyclic chemical compound with the molecular formula C5H4O2. It is isomeric with 4-pyrone.
2-Pyrone is used in organic synthesis as a building block for more complex chemical structures because it may participate in a variety of cycloaddition reactions to form bicyclic lactones.  For example, it readily undergoes Diels-Alder reactions with alkynes producing, upon loss of carbon dioxide, substituted benzenes.[tpl]cite journal | author = Woodard BT, Posner G H | title = Recent Advances in Diels-Alder Cycloadditions Using 2-Pyrones | journal = Advances in Cycloaddition | year = 1999 | volume = 5 | pages = 47–83[/tpl]  The Gogte Synthesis (1938) is a method for the alkylation of certain pyrones with acid chlorides.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2008[/tpl]
The most common natural products containing a 2-pyrone are the bufanolides and kavalactones. Oxovitisin A, a pyranoanthocyanin found in wine, also contains a 2-pyrone element.
