==History==

The ship was built by Danziger Werft in Danzig for  Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine. Named Ägir, she was launched on May 18, 1942. After World War II, she was taken by the United Kingdom to England, where she was rebuilt in a salvage tug, and renamed Hercules in 1949. She was based in Gibraltar from 1950 until 1954 when she was sold to Turkey.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.shipstamps.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=7186&start=0 |publisher=Ship Stamps |title=MTA Sismik 1 |accessdate=2011-09-24 [/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.turkgemileri.com/ships/mtasismik1.htm |publisher=Türk Gemileri |title=MTA Sismik 1 |accessdate=2011-09-24 [/tpl]
Her Turkish owner, the Denizcilik Bankası renamed her Hora and put her as salvage tug in service four year long from 1954 in Istanbul, and then ten years long in İzmir. In 1968, she was acquired by the Port Authority of Izmir to be used as stationary pilot boat.
In 1975, MTA purchased the ship Hora to transform her into a research vessel, and renamed her MTA Sismik 1. After fitting her with up to date technology equipment for subsea geophysical exploration at seas around Turkey, she was commissioned in 1976.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mta.gov.tr/v1.0/daire_baskanliklari/idari/index.php?id=english |publisher=Maden Tetkik ve Arama Genel Müdürlüğü-İdari ve Mali İşler Dairesi Başkanlığı |title= |title=Anasayfa |accessdate=2011-09-24 [/tpl]
Finally in 2005, it was decided that the more than 60-year old ship has completed her service life. She was donated to Istanbul Technical University's Faculty of Maritime to be used as a training ship.
