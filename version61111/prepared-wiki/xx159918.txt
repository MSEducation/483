Roncador Bank is a mostly-submerged atoll with several sandy cays. It lies in the west Caribbean Sea off the coast of Central America. Originally claimed by the United States under the Guano Islands Act of 1856, the atoll was ceded by the United States to Colombia on September 17, 1981,  as the result of a treaty signed in 1972. It is about 15 by 6 kilometers in size, with an area of 65 km² composed mostly of lagoon.[tpl]cite web |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20101223015139/http://www.oceandots.com/atlantic/san-andres/roncador.php |title=San Andrés Archipelago - Roncador Bank |date=10 February 2002 |accessdate=17 June 2010[/tpl] In the northern area lies Roncador Cay.
