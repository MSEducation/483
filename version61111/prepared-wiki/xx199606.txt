==Role as Qazi Quzaz in Mughal Court==

He was an emissary of Akbar in Kashmir and was instrumental in pacifying a revolt which was in offing and he obtained the first census of the areas of Mughal Empire during Akbar's reign. This earned him great respect and trust of the Mughal emperor.
On his return he was appointed as Chief Qazi (Qazi Quzaz), position equivalent of Chief Justice, of the Mughal empire by Jalal-ud-Din Muhammad Akbar.

==Jahangir's period and charges leading to his execution==

Under Jahangir's reign he continued to hold the same high position as in Akbar's time. But his position was now threatened because of Jahangir's more orthodox nature. Other groups which had tried to malign his position during Akbar's reign had once again become powerful and influential. Moreover, he had made enemies from his involvement in settling of disputes in Kashmir and Agra. His book Ahqaq-ul-Haq (Justification of the Truth) was brought as an evidence against him. A fatwa was passed declaring him a heretic. Thus Jehangir was made to issue death orders for Qazi Nurullah Shustari. 'The Empire of the Great Mughals' mentions this incidence, "However, he had both the Sikh guru Arjan and the Shi'i Qadi Nurullah Shushtari executed, which demonstrates how different he was from Akbar. ..."The Empire of the Great Mughals By Annemarie Schimmel, Corinne Attwood, Burzine K.
