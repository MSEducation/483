Love is a soundtrack remix album of music recorded by the Beatles, released in November 2006. It features music compiled and remixed as a mashup for the Cirque du Soleil show of the same name. The album was produced by George Martin and his son Giles Martin, who said, "What people will be hearing on the album is a new experience, a way of re-living the whole Beatles musical lifespan in a very condensed period."[tpl]cite web|title=Beatles to release new album|date=2 October 2006|work=NME|accessdate=3 October 2006|url=http://www.nme.com/news/beatles/24534[/tpl]

==Release history==

George Martin and his son Giles began work on Love after getting permission from Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Yoko Ono, and Olivia Harrison (the latter two representing the estates of John Lennon and George Harrison, respectively). In discussing the project, Giles Martin noted that elements were used from recordings in the Beatles catalogue, "the original four tracks, eight tracks and two tracks and used this palette of sounds and music to create a soundbed."
Giles Martin said in an interview that he was afraid they would not get the green light to do the project, so he started by making digital back-ups of the original multi-track recordings just to get started on the project. He also said that he and his father mixed more music than was eventually released, including "She's Leaving Home" and a version of "Girl" that he was particularly fond of which was eventually released in 2011 as a bonus track on the album on iTunes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.norwegianwood.org/beatles/disko/uklp/love2006.htm |title=The Beatles Fan Club |publisher=Norwegian Wood |accessdate=20 August 2011[/tpl]
McCartney and Starr, the surviving members of the Beatles, responded very positively to the album. McCartney noted that "This album puts The Beatles back together again, because suddenly there's John and George with me and Ringo". Starr commended George and Giles Martin for the album and said that the album is "really powerful for me and I even heard things I'd forgotten we'd recorded."[tpl]cite web|title="Love" Released in Stereo and 5.1 – on November 20th 2006|date=16 October 2006|work=The Beatles|accessdate=17 October 2006|url=http://www.beatles.com/newsletters/Issue_16/index.htm |archiveurl = //web.archive.org/web/20061020041757/http://www.beatles.com/newsletters/Issue_16/index.htm  |archivedate = 20 October 2006[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=The Beatles' new album: full details here|date=17 October 2006|work=NME|accessdate=17 October 2006|url=http://www.nme.com/news/beatles/24757[/tpl]
