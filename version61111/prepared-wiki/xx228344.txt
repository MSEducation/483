The Georgian Bay Land Trust (GBLT) is a not-for-profit, registered charity, whose goal is to protect the uniqueness of the eastern shore and North Channel (Ontario) of Georgian Bay through the securement and on-going stewardship of land that has ecological, geological and historical importance.
Through this work, the GBLT works to educate and promote the importance of this area. The GBLT is one of 45 land trusts working in Ontario to protect important private land from development and loss of native habitats and flora and fauna. As one of the first land trusts in Ontario, GBLT has been a leader in many facets, helping to promote the land trust movement and support other land trusts in their interests and activities in other areas throughout the province.
Since forming in 1991, the GBLT has secured and currently stewards over [tpl]convert|1000|acre|km2[/tpl] that have come to the Trust via donations, purchases, conservation easements and a lease. Currently, both independently and in partnership with the Nature Conservancy of Canada, our land protection committee is actively involved in discovering new opportunities and assessing these opportunities with the goals and objectives of the Trust and the funds available to purchase, if necessary and steward these potential projects.
