The basilica is not a cathedral. The nearby Cathedral of Saint Augustine is the principal place of worship and seat of the bishop of the Diocese of Yamoussoukro.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/diocese/odie0.htm |title=Diocese of Odienné, Cote d'Ivoire |work= GCatholic |publisher=www.gcatholic.org |accessdate=10 September 2010 [/tpl]
Guinness World Records lists it as the largest church in the world, having surpassed the previous record holder, St. Peter's Basilica, upon completion. It has an area of 30,000 sq metres (322,917 sq ft) and is 158 m (518 ft) high.[tpl]cite news |first= |last= |authorlink=  |title=The biggest, longest, tallest... |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,11710,1240318,00.html |work=The Guardian |publisher= |date=17 July 2004 |accessdate=22 July 2008 [/tpl] However, it also includes a rectory and a villa (counted in the overall area), which are not strictly part of the church. It can accommodate 18,000 worshippers, compared to 60,000 for St. Peter's.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.churchesguide.com/basilica-our-lady-of-peace-yamoussoukro.php |title=Our Lady of Peace Basilica, Yamoussoukro |publisher=www.churchesguide.com |accessdate=10 September 2010 [/tpl]
The Basilica is administered by Polish Pallottines.

==Architecture==

While designing it after the Vatican Basilica, Lebanese architect Pierre Fakhoury constructed the dome to be slightly lower than the Basilica of Saint Peter, but ornamented with a larger cross on top. The finished height is [tpl]convert|158|m|ft[/tpl].[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl] The basilica is constructed with marble imported from Italy and is furnished with [tpl]convert|7000|m2|sqft[/tpl] of contemporary stained glass from France. 
Columns are plentiful throughout the basilica but are not uniform in style; the smaller columns are there for structural reasons, while the bigger ones are decorative and contain elevators, rainwater evacuation from the roof and other building mechanical devices. There is enough space to seat 7,000 people in the nave, with standing room for an additional 11,000 people.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl] Apart from the basilica are two identical buildings each serving as rectory and private papal villa, respectively. The villa is reserved for papal visits, of which only one has occurred: when the basilica was consecrated.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl]

==Memorial==

Côte d'Ivoire President Félix Houphouët-Boigny chose his birthplace of Yamoussoukro to be the future site of the new capital city of his country in 1983. As part of the plan of the city, the president wanted to memorialize himself with the construction of what he called the greatest church in the world.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl] He is even pictured beside Jesus in one stained-glass panel."Côte d'Ivoire's capital: Better late than never: Africa’s largest and most grandiose church gets a new neighbour", The Economist, dated 16 June 2012.
