===Post-retirement===

After his retirement from the professional game, Higgins spent time playing for small sums of money in and around Northern Ireland. He made appearances in the 2005 and 2006 Irish Professional Championship, these comebacks ending in first-round defeats by Garry Hardiman and Joe Delaney respectively.
On 12 June 2007, it was reported that Higgins had assaulted a referee at a charity match in the north-east of England. Higgins returned to competitive action in September 2007 at the Irish Professional Championship in Dublin but was whitewashed 0–5 by former British Open champion Fergal O'Brien in the first round at the Spawell Club, Templelogue.[ref]
 [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][/ref]
Higgins continued to play fairly regularly and enjoyed "hustling" all comers for small-time stakes in clubs in Northern Ireland and beyond; in May 2009 he entered the Northern Ireland Amateur Championship, "to give it a crack", but failed to appear for his match.
On 8 April 2010 Higgins was part of the debut Snooker Legends Tour event in Sheffield, at the Crucible, checking himself out of hospital two days before the event after having been admitted with pneumonia and breathing problems.[tpl]cite news | first = Christian | last = Gyan | title = Alex Higgins admitted to hospital | date = 2010-04-02 | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1262858/Alex-Hurricane-Higgins-admitted-hospital-battle-cancer.html | work = Daily Mail | accessdate = 2010-07-28 | location=London[/tpl] He appeared alongside other retired or close-to-retiring professionals including John Parrott, Jimmy White, John Virgo and Cliff Thorburn.
It is estimated that Higgins earned and spent £3–4 million in his career as a snooker player.

==Playing style==

Higgins's speed around the table, his ability to pot balls at a rapid rate and flamboyant style earned him the nickname "Hurricane Higgins" and made him a very high-profile player. His highly unusual cueing technique sometimes included a body swerve and movement, as well as a stance that was noticeably higher than that of most professionals.
The unorthodox play of Higgins was encapsulated in his break of 69, made under unusual pressure, against Jimmy White in the penultimate frame of their World Professional Snooker Championship semi-final in 1982. Higgins was 0–59 down in that frame, but managed to compile an extremely challenging clearance during which he was scarcely in position until the colours. In particular, former world champion Dennis Taylor considers a three-quarter-ball pot on a blue into the green pocket especially memorable, not only for its extreme degree of difficulty but for enabling Higgins to continue the break and keep White off the table and unable to clinch victory at that moment. In potting the blue, Higgins screwed the cue-ball on to the side cushion to bring it back towards the black/pink area with extreme left-hand sidespin, a shot Taylor believes could be played 100 times without coming close to the position Higgins reached with cue-ball. He went a little too far for ideal position on his next red but the match-saving break was still alive.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dViH2UERKBs @2.42[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2011[/tpl]
Higgins drank alcohol and smoked during tournaments, as did many of his contemporaries. A volatile personality got him into frequent fights and arguments, both on and off the snooker table. One of the most serious of these clashes was when he head-butted a referee at the UK championship in 1986. This led to his being fined £12,000 and banned from five tournaments. He was convicted of assault and criminal damage, and fined £250 by a court. Another came at the 1990 World Championship; after losing his first-round match to Steve James, he punched tournament official Colin Randle in the abdomen before the start of a press conference at which he announced his retirement. This, added to his having threatened to have fellow player and compatriot Dennis Taylor shot, led to a ban for the whole of the following season.

==Outside snooker==

At the time of his 1972 triumph at the World Championship, Higgins had no permanent home and by his own account had recently lived in a row of abandoned houses in Blackburn which were awaiting demolition. In one week he had moved into five different houses on the same street, moving down one every time his current dwelling was demolished.[tpl]Cite book|title=Byrne's Advanced Technique in Pool and Billiards|last=Byrne|first=Robert[/tpl]

He had a long and enduring friendship with Oliver Reed and was a good friend of Jimmy White, with whom he often played exhibition matches.
While not normally noted for his philanthropy, in 1983 Higgins helped a young boy from the Manchester area, a fan of his who had been in a coma for two months. His parents were growing desperate and wrote to Higgins. He recorded his voice on a tape and sent it to the boy with his best wishes. He later visited the boy in hospital, unannounced, and promised that if the boy recovered they would play snooker together. True to his word, once the boy was out, the match was held.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpA784DGHVM&feature=related| title = I'm No Angel 6 (at 3:16)| publisher = Youtube| accessdate = 2009-08-07[/tpl]

==Illness and death==

For most of his adult life Higgins often smoked up to 60 cigarettes a day. He had cancerous growths removed from his mouth in 1994 and 1996. In June 1998, he was found to have throat cancer; on 13 October of that year, he had major surgery.
By 2009, Higgins lived alone in a caravan. In spring 2010, he contracted pneumonia. In April 2010 Higgins's friends announced that they had set up a campaign to help raise the £20,000 he needed for teeth implants, to enable him to eat properly again and put on weight. Higgins had lost his teeth after intensive radiotherapy used to treat his throat cancer. It was reported that since losing them he had been living on liquid food, and had become increasingly depressed, even contemplating suicide. He was too ill to have the implants fitted. Despite his illness he continued to smoke cigarettes and drink heavily until the end of his life.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/snooker/2010/04/02/cancer-stricken-snooker-legend-alex-hurricane-higgins-fighting-for-life-after-contracting-pneumonia-86908-22156622/| title = Cancer-stricken snooker legend Alex 'Hurricane' Higgins fighting for life after contracting pneumonia | publisher = Daily Record| accessdate = 2011-01-02[/tpl]
At the end of his life, Higgins' weight fell to [tpl]convert|6|st|kg|lk=on|abbr=off[/tpl]. He lived in sheltered housing on the Donegall Road, Belfast. Despite having once been worth £4 million, he was bankrupt and survived on a £200-a-week disability allowance.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/alex-higgins-lsquothought-about-suicide-14781305.html |title=Alex Higgins ‘thought about suicide' |publisher=BelfastTelegraph.co.uk |date=2010-04-26 |accessdate=2013-05-04[/tpl] He was found dead in bed in his flat on 24 July 2010.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/snooker/8852020.stm |title=Snooker legend Alex 'Hurricane' Higgins dies at 61 |accessdate=2010-07-24 |publisher=BBC |date=July 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100724192234/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/snooker/8852020.stm| archivedate= 24 July 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] The cause of death was a combination of malnutrition, pneumonia, a bronchial condition and throat cancer.[tpl]cite web|last=Tinney|first=Aaron|title=Video: Last footage of Alex Higgins shows cupboards stacked with food... but he couldn’t eat a bite |url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/video-last-footage-of-alex-higgins-shows-cupboards-stacked-with-foodbut-he-couldnrsquot-eat-a-bite-14920839.html|publisher=Belfast Telegraph|accessdate=2 January 2011[/tpl] His children survive him.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/others/alex-higgins-electrifying-on-the-table-combustible-off-it-2034913.html |title=Electrifying on the table, combustible off it |accessdate=2010-07-25 |publisher=The Independent |date=July 2010 | location=London | first=David | last=Hendon| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100727184722/http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/others/alex-higgins-electrifying-on-the-table-combustible-off-it-2034913.html| archivedate= 27 July 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
Higgins' funeral service was held in Belfast on 2 August 2010. He was cremated, and his ashes were interred in Carnmoney Cemetery in Newtownabbey, County Antrim.

==Legacy==

Alex Higgins was an inspiration to many subsequent professional snooker players including Ken Doherty, Jimmy White and Ronnie O'Sullivan who in an interview stated "Alex was an inspiration to players like Jimmy White and thousands of snooker players all over the country, including me. The way he played at his best is the way I believe the game should be played. It was on the edge, keeping the crowd entertained and glued to the action."
In Clive Everton's TV documentary The Story of Snooker (2002), Steve Davis described Higgins as the "one true genius that snooker has produced", despite the autobiography of a contemporary leading professional Willie Thorne characterising Higgins as "not a great player".[tpl]Cite book|title=Double or Quits: The Willie Thorne Story|last=Thorne|first=Willie|authorlink=Willie Thorne|location=Liverpool|year=2004|pages=140–41[/tpl]  Higgins arguably fulfilled his potential only intermittently during his career peak in the 1970s and '80s; Everton puts this down to Davis and Ray Reardon generally being too consistent for him.[tpl]Cite news| url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2010/jul/25/alex-higgins-dies-aged-61| title = Alex Higgins, snooker's anti-hero, dies aged 61| publisher = guardian.co.uk| accessdate = 2011-01-02| location=London| first=Clive| last=Everton| date=2010-07-25[/tpl]
Regardless, Higgins' exciting style and explosive persona helped make snooker a growing television sport in the 1970s and 1980s. Higgins also made the first 16-red clearance (in a challenge match in 1976); it was a break of 146 (with the brown as the first "red", and sixteen colours: 1 green, 5 pinks and 10 blacks).
