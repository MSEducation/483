[[Ƒ]]

CATEGORIES: Uncommon Latin letters

The letter [tpl]unicode|Ƒ[/tpl] (minuscule: ƒ) is a letter of the Latin alphabet, based on the italic form of f; or on its regular form with a descender hook added. A very similar-looking letter, [tpl]angle bracket|[tpl]IPA|ʄ[/tpl][/tpl] (a dotless j with a hook and a horizontal stroke), is used in the IPA for a voiced palatal implosive.

==Regular==

Ƒ is used in writing the Ewe language in a straight form to represent the sound [tpl]IPAblink|ɸ[/tpl], as distinct from the letter F, which represents an [tpl]IPAblink|f[/tpl].

==Italic==

The minuscule italic ƒ, also called the florin sign, is used as a symbol for several currencies, including the former Dutch guilder, the Aruban florin, and the Netherlands Antillean guilder. It can be found as italic in non-italic fonts.
The italic ƒ has been used to denote mathematical functions,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0180.pdf |format=PDF |title=Latin Extended-B |work=Official Unicode code chart |accessdate=January 17, 2009[/tpl] or to indicate aperture in photography (e.g. ƒ/2.8) in place of the more common italic f (in serif fonts) or oblique f (in sans-serif fonts).[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl]

==Appearance in computer fonts==

Older fonts and character encodings included only the minuscule form for its use as an abbreviation. Unicode includes both the majuscule and the minuscule.
Because of its origin, the italic ƒ (f with a hook) looks exactly like the italic f (f) in some typefaces.
Ƒ and ƒ occupy code points U+191 and U+192 in Unicode respectively, and may be entered by appropriate input methods.
On a computer running Microsoft Windows and using the Windows-1252 character encoding, the minuscule can be input using [tpl]key press|alt|1[/tpl][tpl]key press|5[/tpl][tpl]key press|9[/tpl].
The character has been used on the Macintosh to mean folder, in particular as part of a folder name. For example, the game Bugdom, when included on some Mac OS 9 installations, was contained in a folder called "Bugdom ƒ". This usage has died out with the advent of Mac OS X. The character is created on the Macintosh by pressing [tpl]key press|opt|f[/tpl].
