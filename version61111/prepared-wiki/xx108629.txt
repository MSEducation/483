[[Lentiform nucleus]]

CATEGORIES: Neuroanatomy, Basal ganglia

The lentiform nucleus or lenticular nucleus comprises the putamen and the globus pallidus within the basal ganglia. It is a large, cone-shaped mass of gray matter just lateral to the internal capsule. 

==Etymology==

The name comes from Latin and means lens-shaped, probably referring to the appearance of the nucleus from the side.

==Sections and size==

When divided horizontally, it exhibits, to some extent, the appearance of a biconvex lens, while a coronal section of its central part presents a somewhat triangular outline. 
It is shorter than the caudate nucleus and does not extend as far forward. 

==Boundaries==

It is lateral to the caudate nucleus and thalamus, and is seen only in sections of the hemisphere. 
It is bounded laterally by a lamina of white substance called the external capsule, and lateral to this is a thin layer of gray substance termed the claustrum. 
Its anterior end is continuous with the lower part of the head of the caudate nucleus and with the anterior perforated substance.

==Components==

In a coronal section through the middle of the lentiform nucleus, two medullary lamin√¶ are seen dividing it into three parts. 
The lateral and largest part is of a reddish color, and is known as the putamen, while the medial and intermediate are of a yellowish tint, and together constitute the globus pallidus; all three are marked by fine radiating white fibers, which are most distinct in the putamen.
