==Licensing==

LaTeX is typically distributed along with plain TeX. It is distributed under a free software license, the LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL). The LPPL is not compatible with the GNU General Public License, as it requires that modified files must be clearly differentiable from their originals (usually by changing the filename); this was done to ensure that files that depend on other files will produce the expected behavior and avoid dependency hell. The LPPL is DFSG compliant as of version 1.3.  As free software, LaTeX is available on most operating systems including UNIX (Solaris, HP-UX, AIX), BSD (FreeBSD, Mac OS X, NetBSD, OpenBSD), GNU/Linux (Red Hat, Debian, Arch, Gentoo), Microsoft Windows (9x, XP, Vista, 7, 8), DOS, RISC OS, AmigaOS and Plan9.

==Related software==

As a macro package, LaTeX provides a set of macros for TeX to interpret. There are many other macro packages for TeX, including TiCTeX, Plain TeX, GNU Texinfo, AMSTeX, and ConTeXt.
When TeX "compiles" a document, it follows (from the user's point of view) the following processing sequence: Macros → TeX → Driver → Output. Different implementations of each of these steps are typically available in TeX distributions. Traditional TeX will output a DVI file, which is usually converted to a PostScript file. More recently, Hàn Thế Thành and others have written a new implementation of TeX called pdfTeX, which also outputs to PDF and takes advantage of features available in that format. The XeTeX engine developed by Jonathan Kew merges modern font technologies and Unicode with TeX.
The default font for LaTeX is Knuth's Computer Modern, which gives default documents created with LaTeX the same distinctive look as those created with plain TeX. XeTeX allows the use of OpenType and TrueType (that is, outlined) fonts for output files.
There are also many editors for LaTeX.

==Versions==

LaTeX2e is the current version of LaTeX, since it replaced Latex 2.09 in 1994. [tpl]As of|2014[/tpl], a future version called LaTeX3, started in the early 1990s, is still in development.See e.g. bubl.ac.uk Planned features include improved syntax, hyperlink support, a new user interface, access to arbitrary fonts, and new documentation.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.latex-project.org/guides/ltx3info.pdf | title=The LaTeX3 Project | author=Frank Mittelbach, Chris Rowley | date=January 12, 1999 | format=PDF | accessdate=2007-07-30[/tpl]
There are numerous commercial implementations of the entire TeX system.  System vendors may add extra features like additional typefaces and telephone support. LyX is a free, WYSIWYM visual document processor that uses LaTeX for a back-end. TeXmacs is a free, WYSIWYG editor with similar functionalities as LaTeX but a different typesetting engine. Other WYSIWYG editors that produce LaTeX include Scientific Word on MS Windows.
A number of community-supported TeX distributions are available, including TeX Live (multiplatform), teTeX (deprecated in favor of TeX Live, UNIX), fpTeX (deprecated), MiKTeX (Windows), proTeXt (Windows), MacTeX (TeX Live with the addition of Mac specific programs), gwTeX (Mac OS X), OzTeX (Mac OS Classic), AmigaTeX (no longer available) and PasTeX (AmigaOS, available on the Aminet repository).

==Compatibility==

LaTeX documents (*.tex) can be opened with any text editor.  They consist of plain text and do not contain hidden formatting codes or binary instructions.  Additionally, TeX documents can be shared by rendering the LaTeX file to Rich Text Format (.rtf) or XML. This can be done using the free software programs LaTeX2RTF or TeX4ht.  LaTeX can also be rendered to PDF files using the LaTeX extension pdfLaTeX.  LaTeX files containing Unicode text can be processed into PDFs by the LaTeX extension XeLaTeX.
