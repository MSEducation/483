Ilchi was the first Persian foreign affairs minister assigned by Fat′h-Ali Shah Qajar.  He was sent to London to learn English, where he was trained by Sir Gore Ouseley, who came to Iran along with Kabir as the first British consulate to Iran.  Ouseley encouraged Ilchi to join the Free Masons organization in 1810.  Ilchi was the main delegate for Iran in the Gulistan and Trukmanchay treaties.  In 1835, Kabir sealed himself in Shah Abdolazim as a protest to Prime Minister Ghaem Magham Farahani.
