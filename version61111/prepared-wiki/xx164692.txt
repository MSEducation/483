==Introduction==

A man is walking home with his girlfriend when he is suddenly struck by a meteorite in the head. When the morticians remove the object from his head, he rises from the dead. He's not the only one who "rises" â€” and they seem to have a plan now...

==Opening narration==

==Plot==

The Medical Examiner who conducted the autopsy, Dr. Ian Michaels, shaken, reports the bizarre events to homicide investigator Lt. Joseph Dane, who is skeptical to say the least. The mystery deepens, when during a visit to his comatose wife (a long-term victim of a hit and run driver) at a local hospital, Ian learns that Jacob Hardy was not the only meteor casualty who had inexplicably risen from the dead. So did a taxi driver, Curtis Sawyer, and waitress Kelly Risely.
The police investigation reveals that all three have apparently become geniuses in the wake of their transformations. But more unsettling is that all of them seem to be working together...
Unbeknownst to Ian or the police, the three meteor victims are using the alien projectiles which struck them to build a mysterious machine, capable of vaporizing any living thing. The conspiracy becomes more sinister when the three gather a large group of patients who are near death, including Ian's wife Daria, and prepare to subject them to the incinerating ray. Is it mercy killing or a murder? Or maybe, it is something that lies beyond our understanding?
