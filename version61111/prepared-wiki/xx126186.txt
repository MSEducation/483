[[Ophthalmic acid]]

CATEGORIES: Peptides

Ophthalmic acid, also known as ophthalmate (chemically L-Ύ-glutamyl-L-α-aminobutyrylglycine), is a tripeptide analogue of glutathione in which the cysteine group is replaced by L-2-aminobutyrate. It was first discovered and isolated from calf lens.Waley SG; Biochem. J. 64, 715 (1956).

==Biosynthesis==

Recent studies have shown that the ophthalmate can be biologically synthesized from 2-amino butyric acid through consecutive reactions with gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase and glutathione synthetase. So the ophthalmic acid could be used as a biomarker in oxidative stress where the depletion of glutathione takes place.[ref]
