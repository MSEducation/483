The American Correctional Association (ACA), formerly known as the National Prison Association, is the oldest and largest international correctional association in the world.  Approximately 80 percent of all state departments of corrections and youth services are active participants.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl] Also included are programs and facilities operated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons and the private sector. ACA accredits over 1,500 prisons, jails, community residential centers (halfway houses) and various other corrections facilities in the U.S. using their independently published Standards manuals.

==History==

The ACA was originally founded under the name National Prison Association in 1870. The name was officially changed in 1954 with hopes of having a name that more accurately reflected the organization's philosophy on corrections. [tpl]cite web|title=ACA History|url=http://www.aca.org/pastpresentfuture/history.asp|publisher=American Correctional Association|accessdate=17 November 2013|language=English[/tpl] In 2011 ACA began to branch out and the first detention facilities outside of the U.S. or Canada were audited. In January 2012 four Mexican facilities became accredited by ACA using their Core International Standards manual.
