Perlite is an amorphous volcanic glass that has a relatively high water content, typically formed by the hydration of obsidian.  It occurs naturally and has the unusual property of greatly expanding when heated sufficiently. It is an industrial mineral and a commercial product useful for its light weight after processing.

==Properties==

Perlite softens when it reaches temperatures of 850–900 °C (1560-1650 °F). Water trapped in the structure of the material vaporises and escapes, and this causes the expansion of the material to 7–16 times its original volume. The expanded material is a brilliant white, due to the reflectivity of the trapped bubbles. Unexpanded ("raw") perlite has a bulk density around 1100 kg/m3 (1.1 g/cm3), while typical expanded perlite has a bulk density of about 30–150 kg/m3 (0.03-0.150 g/cm3).

==Production and uses==

Perlite is a non-renewable resource. The world reserves of perlite are estimated at 700 million tonnes. In 2011, 1.7 million tonnes were produced, mostly by Greece (500,000 t), United States (375,000 t) and Turkey (220,000 t). However, no information for China – a leading producer – was available.Perlite, USGS Mineral Commodity Summaries 2011 Starting 2003, Greece was a leader in processed Perlite production, however estimates of Perlite production from USGS Mineral Commodity Summaries 2013 indicate that US may have overtaken Greece.http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/perlite/mcs-2013-perli.pdf, USGS Mineral Commodity Summaries 2013
Because of its low density and relatively low price (about US$50 per tonne of unexpanded perlite), many commercial applications for perlite have developed. In the construction and manufacturing fields, it is used in lightweight plasters and mortars, insulation and ceiling tiles.Wallace P. Bolen Perlite USGS 2009 Minerals Yearbook
In horticulture, perlite can be used as a soil amendment or alone as a medium for hydroponics or for starting cuttings. When used as an amendment it has high permeability / low water retention and helps prevent soil compaction.http://www.extension.iastate.edu/newsrel/2004/feb04/feb0429.html
Perlite is an excellent filter aid. It is used extensively as an alternative to diatomaceous earth. The popularity of perlite usage in this application is growing considerably worldwide. Perlite filters are fairly commonplace in filtering beer before it is bottled.
Small quantities of perlite are also used in foundries, cryogenic insulation, as a lightweight aggregate in mortar (firestop) and in ceramics as a clay additive. It is also used by the explosives industry.Emulsion explosive composition containing expanded perlite United States Patent 4940497
