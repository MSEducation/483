CATEGORIES: Kentish monarchs, 7th-century English monarchs

Oswine, King of Kent, jointly with Swæfberht and Swæfheard.
Oswine is known from three charters: one http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+12 is dated July 689 and apparently witnessed by Swæfberht (corruptly as Gabertus); another http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+13 is dated 26 January 690, witnessed by Swæfheard, and implies Oswine's descent from Eormenred; and in third http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+14, which is undated, but again witnessed by Swæfheard, expresses Oswine’s gratitude for his restoration to the kingdom of his fathers (gratias refero miserenti Deo omnipotenti qui confirmauit me in regno patrum meorum et dedit mihi domum cognationis mee).
