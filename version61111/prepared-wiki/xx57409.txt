==Biography==

Edward Rolf Tufte was born in 1942 in Kansas City, Missouri, to Virginia Tufte and Edward E. Tufte. He grew up in Beverly Hills, California, and graduated from Beverly Hills High School.Reynolds, Christopher.  "ART; Onward means going upward; Edward Tufte has spent his career fighting the visually dull and flat. Even his sculpture is a leap.", Los Angeles Times, November 14, 2002. Accessed April 23, 2008. "Tufte, who shares [tpl]convert|20|acre|m2[/tpl] in Cheshire, Conn., with his wife, graphic design professor Inge Druckrey, and three golden retrievers, is a 1960 graduate of Beverly Hills High School." He received a BS and MS in statistics from Stanford University and a PhD in political science from Yale. His dissertation, completed in 1968, was entitled The Civil Rights Movement and Its Opposition. He was then hired by Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School, where he taught courses in political economy and data analysis while publishing three quantitatively inclined political science books.
In 1975, while at Princeton, Tufte was asked to teach a statistics course to a group of journalists who were visiting the school to study economics. He developed a set of readings and lectures on statistical graphics, which he further developed in joint seminars he taught with renowned statistician John Tukey, a pioneer in the field of information design. These course materials became the foundation for his first book on information design, The Visual Display of Quantitative Information.[tpl]Citation | first1 = Mark | last1 = Zachry | first2 = Charlotte | last2 = Thralls | format = PDF | url = http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/s15427625tcq1304_5.pdf | title = An interview with Edward R. Tufte | journal = Technical Communication Quarterly | year = 2004[/tpl].[tpl]Sfn | Tufte | 2001[/tpl]
After difficult negotiations with mainline publishers failed, Tufte decided to self-publish Visual Display in 1982 where he worked closely with graphic designer Howard Gralla. He financed the work by taking out a second mortgage on his home. The book quickly became a commercial success and secured his transition from political scientist to information expert.
On March 5, 2010, President Barack Obama appointed Tufte to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act's Recovery Independent Advisory Panel "to provide transparency in the use of Recovery-related funds."[tpl]Citation | url = http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/president-obama-announces-more-key-administration-posts-3510 | title = President Obama Announces More Key Administration Posts | publisher = White House Office of the Press Secretary | date = March 5, 2010[/tpl].

==Work==

Tufte is an expert in the presentation of informational graphics such as charts and diagrams, and is a fellow of the American Statistical Association. He has held fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation and the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences.
His work habits are forward-looking and he is intensely critical in the self-editing process. He pulls in and casts out ideas from books, journals, posters, auction catalogs, and other less common sources. He invites others to critique his work in-progress and may nurture dozens of ideas over months in various states of growth and fruition. He deletes almost every photograph he takes. Over time, he deletes most of what he writes on his own forum, ET Notebooks. Every printing of every book corrects numerous small blemishes, ranging from color registration to kerning and hinting.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]
This pattern of work is repeated in his sculpture: he digs through sources ranging from other art and other genres (most notably Feynman diagrams), to flea markets, nuclear power plants, and fields of grass. He is in search of forms and ideas from which to build models, table pieces, and occasionally larger landscape pieces. Even some nominally finished, large scale works are reworked heavily. But at the same time, some random sculptural equivalents of brush strokes or artifacts of a piece's former life are retained, a degree of wabi-sabi, as may be seen in Rocket Science (circa 2006–9, Hogpen Hill, Connecticut).[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]

===Information design===

Tufte's writing is important in such fields as information design and visual literacy, which deal with the visual communication of information.  He coined the term "chartjunk" to refer to useless, non-informative, or information-obscuring elements of quantitative information displays.  Other key concepts of Tufte are the lie factor, the data-ink ratio, and the data density of a graphic.[tpl]cite journal |last = Mulrow | first = EJ |year= 2002 | title = The Visual Display of Quantitative Information | journal = Technometrics | volume =44|issue=4|page =400 |doi=10.1198/tech.2002.s78|ref= harv[/tpl]
He uses the term "data-ink ratio" to argue against using excessive decoration in visual displays of quantitative information.[tpl]cite book |title=Graph design for the eye and mind |last=Kosslyn |first=Stephen Michael | publisher = Oxford University Press |year=2006 |page=126 |isbn= 978-0-19-531184-6[/tpl] In Visual Display, Tufte states:
He also encourages the use of data-rich illustrations with all the available data presented. When such illustrations are examined closely, every data point has a value, but when they are looked at more generally, only trends and patterns can be observed. Tufte suggests these macro/micro readings be presented in the space of an eye-span, in the high resolution format of the printed page, and at the unhurried pace of the viewer's leisure.
In addition to current developments in information design, Tufte is interested in classic and breakthrough examples of historic information graphics. He draws on examples from his own personal collection, as well as rare volumes available in libraries such as the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale, and takes great pains to reproduce them at high resolution and in full color in his books.
He uses several historical examples to make his case, including John Snow's cholera outbreak map, Charles Joseph Minard's Carte Figurative, early space debris plots, Galileo Galilei's Sidereus Nuncius, and Maya Lin’s Vietnam Veterans Memorial. For instance, the listing of the names of deceased soldiers on the black granite of Lin's sculptural memorial is shown to be more powerful as a chronological list rather than as an alphabetical one. The sacrifice each fallen individual has made is thus highlighted within the overall time scope of the war.[tpl]Sfn | Tufte | 2001b | pp = 43–4[/tpl] In Sidereus Nuncius Galilei presents the nightly observations of the moons of Jupiter in relation to the body itself, intervowen with the two-month narrative record.[tpl]Citation | last = Tufte | first = Edward R | author-mask = 3 | year = 2006 | title = Beautiful Evidence | place = Cheshire, CT | publisher = Graphics Press | ISBN = 0-9613921-7-7[/tpl]

===Criticism of PowerPoint===

Tufte has criticized the way Microsoft PowerPoint is typically used. In his essay "The Cognitive Style of PowerPoint", Tufte criticizes many aspects of the software:
Tufte uses the way PowerPoint was used by NASA engineers in the events leading to the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster as an example of the many problems.  The software style is designed to persuade rather than to inform people of technical details.  Tufte's analysis of a NASA PowerPoint slide is included in the Columbia Accident Investigation Board’s report—including an engineering detail buried in small type on a crowded slide with six bullet points, that if presented in a regular engineering white paper, might have been noticed and the disaster prevented.[tpl]Citation | url = http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001yB&topic_id=1 | contribution = Analysis | first = Edward Rolf | last = Tufte | title = Forum[/tpl].[tpl]Citation | url = http://anon.nasa-global.speedera.net/anon.nasa-global/CAIB/CAIB_lowres_chapter7.pdf | publisher = Columbia Accident Investigation Board | title = Report | volume = 1 |date=August 2003 | page = 15[/tpl].
Instead, Tufte argues that the most effective way of presenting information in a technical setting, such as an academic seminar or a meeting of industry experts, is by distributing a brief written report that can be read by all participants in the first 5 to 10 minutes of the meeting. Tufte believes that this is the most efficient method of transferring knowledge from the presenter to the audience and then the rest of the meeting is devoted to discussion and debate.[tpl]Citation | last = Tufte | first = Edward Rolf | url = http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001yB | title = PowerPoint Does Rocket Science—and Better Techniques for Technical Reports[/tpl].

===Small multiple===

One method Tufte encourages to allow quick visual comparison of multiple series is the small multiple, a chart with many series shown on a single pair of axes that can often be easier to read when displayed as several separate pairs of axes placed next to each other. It's particularly helpful when the series are measured on quite different vertical (y-axis) scales, but over the same range on the horizontal x-axis (usually time).

===Sparkline===

Tufte also invented sparklines – a condensed way to present trends and variation, associated with a measurement such as average temperature or stock market activity, often embedded directly in the text; for example: The Dow Jones index for February 7, 2006 alt=sparkline which illustrates the fluctuations in the Down Jones index on February 7, 2006|100px.[tpl]cite web | last=Bissantz|first=Nicolas|title= Sparklines, another masterpiece of Edward Tufte|url = http://www.bissantz.com/sparklines/ | format = blog| publisher= Bissantz & Co |accessdate= 2011-03-20[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Oppenheimer|first=Diego|title=Sparklines in Excel|url = http://blogs.office.com/b/microsoft-excel/archive/2009/07/17/sparklines-in-excel.aspx?PageIndex=2 |work= The Microsoft Office Blog|publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=2011-03-20[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last = Rimlinger |first=Fabrice|title= Project Summary|url= http://sourceforge.net/projects/sparklinesforxl/ | work = Sparklines for Microsoft Excel|publisher=SourceForge|accessdate=2011-03-20[/tpl] These are often used as elements of a small multiple with several lines used together. Tufte explains the sparkline as a kind of "word" that conveys rich information without breaking the flow of a sentence or paragraph made of other "words" both visual and conventional.

===Sculpture===

Beyond his academic endeavors over the years, Tufte has created sculptures, often large outdoor ones made of metal or stone, which were first primarily exhibited on his own rural Connecticut property. In 2009–10, some of these artworks were exhibited at the Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum in Ridgefield, Connecticut, in the one-man show Edward Tufte: Seeing Around.[tpl]cite web | first =Edward Rolf | last = Tufte | title = Seeing Around|url= http://www.aldrichart.org/exhibitions/past/tufte.php | publisher= Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum| accessdate= 2012-06-03| format= exhibit| date = June 13, 2009, to April 11, 2010[/tpl]
