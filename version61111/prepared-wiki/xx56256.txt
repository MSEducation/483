After the success of the movie The Warriors, Hollywood looked to take the youth gang concept and market it to TV.  In 1981, Swayze did a TV show, Return of the Rebels, about an aging motorcycle gang who get together to help a friend who owns a popular campground that is being threatened by a band of arrogant groupies.  However, the show didn't catch on and was quickly canceled.  
Brother team Lawrence and Charles Gordon tried to market Swayze's rebel look, combine the gang concept with a police angle and came up with The Renegades.  It too didn't do well and due to weak ratings ABC pulled the show.
Director Roger Spottiswoode, screenwriter Steven E. de Souza, and producers Lawrence and Charles Gordon went on to make 48 Hrs..  The Gordon brothers and de Souza went on to create the Die Hard franchise.[tpl]cite web |date= September 20, 2008|url = http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/20/movies/20watc.html?_r=1&pagewanted=print|title = Battle Over ‘Watchmen’ Surrounds a Producer|format = |publisher = New York Times| accessdate = 23 May 2009 | last=Michael Cieply |quote=[/tpl]  Lawerence served as President of 20th Century Fox from 1984 to 1986.
