[[Washdyke]]

CATEGORIES: Timaru, Populated places in New Zealand

Washdyke is an industrial suburb in the north of Timaru, in south Canterbury, New Zealand. State Highway 1 passes through Washdyke on the way north out of the city. The northern terminus of State Highway 8 is in Washdyke.
Washdyke is home of Timaru's horse racetrack, which is named for the suburb's most famous former resident, champion racehorse Phar Lap.
The Main South Line railway passes through Washdyke, and it was formerly the location of a railway junction.  On 18 February 1874, construction began on a branch line to Pleasant Point; this line ultimately became known as the Fairlie Branch when it was opened past Pleasant Point to Fairlie in 1884.  Declining traffic led to the closure of the branch on 2 March 1968 and since then, the Main South Line has been the only railway through Washdyke.  Passenger services through Washdyke ceased on 10 February 2002 with the cancellation of the Southerner express that operated between Christchurch and Invercargill.
Slightly south of the suburb is Washdyke Lagoon, a medium-sized tidal lagoon which a variety of wading birds frequent.
