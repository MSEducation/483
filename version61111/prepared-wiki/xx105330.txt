Royal Samuel Copeland (November 7, 1868[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]June 17, 1938) was an American academic, homeopathic physician and politician who held elected offices in both Michigan (as a Republican) and New York (as a Democrat). He represented New York in the United States Senate from 1923 until 1938.

==Early life and medical career==

Born in Dexter, Michigan to parents Roscoe P. Copeland and Frances J. (Holmes) Copeland, Royal Copeland graduated from the Michigan State Normal College (now Eastern Michigan University) with a bachelor's degree. In 1888, he taught school in Sylvan Township, Michigan. He graduated from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor with a degree in medicine in 1889. After graduate studies in Europe, Dr. Copeland practiced medicine in Bay City, Michigan, from 1890 to 1895. Copeland was admitted to the Homeopathy Society of Michigan on May 21, 1890, and was made secretary of the society in October 1893. He was a professor of Ophthalmology and Otology in the University of Michigan Medical School's Homeopathic Department from 1895 until 1908.

==Political career in Michigan==

During his time as a medical professor in Ann Arbor, Copeland was active in municipal politics. He served as Republican mayor of Ann Arbor from 1901 to 1903, as president of the Ann Arbor Board of Education from 1907 to 1908, and as president of the Ann Arbor Board of Park Commissioners.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2008[/tpl]

==Political career in New York==

On July 15, 1908, Copeland married Frances Spalding. The same year, Copeland moved to New York City to take a position as dean at the New York Homeopathic Medical College and Flower Hospital,[tpl]cite news |title=New York Homeopathic Medical College and Flower Hospital |url=http://archive.org/stream/independen79v80newy#page/n41/mode/1up |newspaper=The Independent |date=Jul 6, 1914 |accessdate=August 1, 2012[/tpl] a position he left in 1918 to serve as President of the New York Board of Health. He gained much positive public attention for keeping New Yorkers calm during the influenza outbreak of 1918.[tpl]cite book |first= Natalie |last=Robins, |title=Copeland's Cure: Homeopathy and the War Between Conventional and Alternative Medicine |year = 2005 | quote= New York did come out better than any other city in the nation. |pages= 154â€“166 |unused_data= |publisher =Knopf, New York[/tpl]
In 1922, Copeland ran as a Democrat for the U.S. Senate, defeating first-term Republican Senator William M. Calder. Franklin D. Roosevelt served as his honorary campaign manager for this election.Robert Dallek, Franklin D. Roosevelt and American Foreign Policy, 1932-1945 (New York: Oxford University Press, 1979), p. 14.  Copeland was re-elected in 1928 over Republican challenger Alanson B. Houghton, the U.S. Ambassador to Britain and a former U.S. Representative. Copeland was again re-elected in 1934, this time defeating future U.S. Congressman E. Harold Cluett.Congressional Biography of E. Harold Cluett.
During his three terms in the Senate, Copeland served as chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Rules and Administration from 1933 to 1936 and chairman of the Committee on Commerce from 1935 to 1938. In 1935-1936 Copeland served as Chairman of the highly controversial Copeland Committee, which gave a scathing review of air traffic safety and the operation of the Bureau of Air Commerce. Copeland served as primary author and sponsor of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938, an important consumers right law.  He was the primary sponsor of the Copeland "Anti-kickback" Act, which targeted kickbacks to federal contractors, subcontractors and officials from construction employees.[tpl]cite web | url=http://wlstorage.net/file/crs/94-408.pdf | title=The Davis-Bacon Act: Institutional Evolution and Public Policy | publisher=United States Congressional Research Service | work=CRS report no. 94-408 | date=November 30, 2007 | accessdate=October 26, 2012 | author=Whittaker, William G. | pages=14-15, 41[/tpl]
Copeland was close to the regular Democratic organization in New York, the boss-led Tammany Hall. He was a conservative Democrat and not especially supportive of his fellow New Yorker, President Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal policies. He was also a friend of Harry S. Truman when they both served in the U.S. Senate. Copeland was known for his successful efforts to bring air conditioning to the Senate.
In 1937 he lost the Democratic nomination for Mayor of New York City to Judge Jeremiah T. Mahoney, and the Republican nomination to incumbent Republican Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia."Perplexing Primary", TIME Magazine, Monday, September 27, 1937 (free access on May 28, 2008.) Senator Copeland died in office on June 17, 1938 and was buried at Mahwah Cemetery in Mahwah, New Jersey.
