Callowhill Depot is a bus and trolley barn operated by the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA), located in West Philadelphia, near the Delaware County border. It was built in 1913 by the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company (PRT) and was later operated by the Philadelphia Transportation Company (PTC) before being taken over by SEPTA.  The depot was constructed as part of the Thomas E. Mitten modernization program.  Since its construction, the depot has suffered fire damage and reconstruction in 1949, 1950, and 1995.
The Callowhill Depot is located in the heart of West Philadelphia, located on the southwest corner of the 5900 block of Callowhill Street with the bus and trolley bays across the street. The depot is surrounded by 59th, Vine, 58th & Callowhill Streets. Callowhill Depot was an all trolley depot until May 28, 1955 when Route 70 (52nd Street Line) was converted to bus operation. Callowhill Depot was home to all streetcar trolley lines that operated in West Philadelphia until National City Lines converted most of the Philadelphia Trolley Routes into Bus Lines. The depot is accessible only to SEPTA Employees; however, Trolley fans often come by to photograph streetcars pulling in and out. And for safety reason the SEPTA Transit Police Department will stop and question anyone found on the property without a reason or authorization.
