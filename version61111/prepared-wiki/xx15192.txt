KFC (the name was originally an initialism for Kentucky Fried Chicken) is a fast food restaurant chain that specializes in fried chicken and is headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, in the United States. It is the world's second largest restaurant chain (as measured by sales) after McDonald's, with 18,875 outlets in 118 countries and territories [tpl]as of|lc=y|December 2013[/tpl]. The company is a subsidiary of Yum! Brands, a restaurant company that also owns the Pizza Hut and Taco Bell chains.
KFC was founded by Harland Sanders, an entrepreneur who began selling fried chicken from his roadside restaurant in Corbin, Kentucky, during the Great Depression. Sanders identified the potential of the restaurant franchising concept, and the first "Kentucky Fried Chicken" franchise opened in Utah in 1952. KFC popularized chicken in the fast food industry, diversifying the market by challenging the established dominance of the hamburger. By branding himself as "Colonel Sanders," Harland became a prominent figure of American cultural history, and his image remains widely used in KFC advertising. However, the company's rapid expansion saw it overwhelm the ageing Sanders, and in 1964 he sold the company to a group of investors led by John Y. Brown, Jr. and Jack C. Massey.
KFC was one of the first fast food chains to expand internationally, opening outlets in the United Kingdom, Mexico, and Jamaica by the mid-1960s. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, KFC experienced mixed fortunes domestically, as it went through a series of changes in corporate ownership with little or no experience in the restaurant business. In the early 1970s, KFC was sold to the spirits distributor Heublein, who were taken over by the R.J. Reynolds food and tobacco conglomerate, who sold the chain to PepsiCo. The chain continued to expand overseas however, and in 1987 KFC became the first Western restaurant chain to open in China. The chain has since expanded rapidly in China, which is now the company's single largest market. PepsiCo spun off its restaurants division  as Tricon Global Restaurants, which later changed its name to Yum! Brands.
KFC's original product is pressure fried chicken pieces, seasoned with Sanders' recipe of 11 herbs and spices. The constituents of the recipe represent a notable trade secret. Larger portions of fried chicken are served in a cardboard "bucket," which has become a well known feature of the chain since it was first introduced by franchisee Pete Harman in 1957. Since the early 1990s, KFC has expanded its menu to offer other chicken products such as chicken fillet burgers and wraps, as well as salads and side dishes, such as French fries and coleslaw, desserts, and soft drinks, the latter often supplied by PepsiCo. KFC is known for the slogan "finger lickin' good," which has since been replaced by "Nobody does chicken like KFC" and "So good."

==History==

Harland Sanders was born in 1890 and raised on a farm outside Henryville, Indiana.[tpl]cite news|last=Whitworth|first=William|title=Kentucky-Fried|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1970/02/14/1970_02_14_040_TNY_CARDS_000295737|accessdate=February 23, 2013|newspaper=New Yorker|date=February 14, 1970[/tpl] When Harland was five years old, his father died, forcing his mother to work at a canning plant.[tpl]cite book|last=Klotter|first=James C. |title=The Human Tradition in the New South|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=X2UtXHKGj0sC&pg=PA210|accessdate=June 29, 2013|year=2005|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-4476-5|page=129[/tpl] This left Harland, as the eldest son, to care for his two younger siblings. After he reached seven years of age, his mother taught him how to cook. After leaving the family home at the age of 13, Sanders passed through several professions, with mixed success.[tpl]cite book|last=Sanders|first=Harland|title=The Autobiography of the Original Celebrity Chef|year=2012|publisher=KFC|location=Louiseville|page=15|url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/colcookbook/us/pdf/English_FullBook.pdf[/tpl] In 1930, he took over a Shell filling station on US Route 25 just outside North Corbin, Kentucky, a small town on the edge of the Appalachian Mountains.[tpl]cite book|last=Ozersky|first=Josh|title=Colonel Sanders and the American Dream|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qh5AEnwoJuIC|accessdate=27 September 2013|date=April 2012|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-0-292-74285-7|pages=19–24[/tpl] It was here that he first served to travelers the recipes that he had learned as a child: fried chicken and other dishes such as steaks and country ham. After four years of serving from his own dining room table, Sanders purchased the larger filling station on the other side of the road and expanded to six tables.[tpl]cite book|last=Aaseng|first=Nathan|title=Business Builders in Fast Food|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vwyiE8Gd8GQC&pg=PA116|accessdate=March 13, 2013|date=January 2001|publisher=Oliver Press|isbn=978-1-881508-58-8|page=116[/tpl] By 1936, this had proven successful enough for Sanders to be given the honorary title of Kentucky colonel by Governor Ruby Laffoon.[tpl]cite book|last=Smith|first=Andrew F.|title=Fast Food and Junk Food: An Encyclopedia of What We Love to Eat|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Wq3tvL_uIHcC&pg=PA612|date=2 December 2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-39394-5|page=612[/tpl] In 1937 he expanded his restaurant to 142 seats, and added a motel he purchased across the street, naming it Sanders Court & Café.[tpl]cite book|last=Hollis|first=Tim|title=Dixie Before Disney: 100 Years of Roadside Fun|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ecaVOl1wzg0C&pg=PT19|year=1999|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|isbn=978-1-61703-374-2|pages=19–20[/tpl]
Sanders was unhappy with the 35 minutes it took to prepare his chicken in an iron frying pan, but he refused to deep fry the chicken, which he believed lowered the quality of the product.[tpl]cite book|last=Sanders|first=Harland|title=The Incredible Colonel|year=1974|publisher=Creation House|location=Illinois|pages=98–131|isbn=978-0-88419-053-0[/tpl] If he pre-cooked the chicken in advance of orders, there was sometimes wastage at day's end. In 1939, the first commercial pressure cookers were released onto the market, mostly designed for steaming vegetables.[tpl]cite book|last=Binney|first=Ruth|title=Wise Words and Country Ways for Cooks|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kfQg_xASoTEC&pg=PA202|date=1 April 2012|publisher=David & Charles|isbn=978-0-7153-3420-1|page=202[/tpl] Sanders bought one, and modified it into a pressure fryer, which he then used to fry chicken. The new method reduced production time to be comparable with deep frying, while, in the opinion of Sanders, retaining the quality of pan-fried chicken.
In July 1940, Sanders finalised what came to be known as his "Original Recipe" of 11 herbs and spices.[tpl]cite news|last=Schreiner|first=Bruce|title=KFC still guards Colonel's secret|url=http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/072305/bus_19314459.shtml|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6LFY4JpRe|archivedate=2013-11-19|accessdate=19 September 2013|newspaper=Associated Press|date=23 July 2005[/tpl] Although he never publicly revealed the recipe, he admitted to the use of salt and pepper, and claimed that the ingredients "stand on everybody's shelf."[tpl]cite book|last=Kleber|first=John E. |title=The Kentucky Encyclopedia|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8eFSK4o--M0C&pg=PA796|accessdate=March 13, 2013|date=May 18, 1992|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=978-0-8131-2883-2|page=796[/tpl] After being recommissioned as a Kentucky colonel in 1950 by Governor Lawrence Wetherby, Sanders began to dress the part, growing a goatee and wearing a black frock coat (later switched to a white suit), a string tie, and referring to himself as "Colonel." His associates went along with the title change, "jokingly at first and then in earnest," according to biographer Josh Ozersky.[tpl]cite book|last=Ozersky|first=Josh|title=Colonel Sanders and the American Dream|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qh5AEnwoJuIC|accessdate=April 7, 2013|year=2012|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-0-292-74285-7|page=25[/tpl]
The Sanders Court & Café generally served travelers, so when the route planned in 1955 for Interstate 75 bypassed Corbin, Sanders sold his properties and traveled the US to franchise his chicken recipe to restaurant owners.[tpl]cite book|author1=John A.

In 1952 he had already successfully franchised his recipe to his friend Pete Harman of South Salt Lake, Utah, the operator of one of the city's largest restaurants.[tpl]cite news|author1=Patty Henetz|author2=Jenifer K.

Don Anderson, a sign painter hired by Harman, coined the name "Kentucky Fried Chicken." For Harman, the addition of KFC was a way of differentiating his restaurant from competitors; a product from Kentucky was exotic, and evoked imagery of Southern hospitality. Harman trademarked the phrase "It's finger lickin' good," which eventually become the company-wide slogan. He also introduced the "bucket meal" in 1957 (14 pieces of chicken, five bread rolls and a pint of gravy in a cardboard bucket).[tpl]cite book|last=Darden|first=Robert|title=Secret Recipe: Why Kfc Is Still Cooking After 50 Years|date=January 1, 2004|publisher=Tapestry Press|isbn=978-1-930819-33-7|pages=12, 57–58, 101, 159, 175, 211[/tpl] Serving their signature meal in a paper bucket was to become an iconic feature of the company.
By 1963 there were 600 KFC restaurants, making the company the largest fast food operation in the United States. KFC popularized chicken in the fast food industry, diversifying the market by challenging the established dominance of the hamburger.[tpl]cite book|last=Smith|first=Andrew F.|title=The Oxford Companion to American Food and Drink|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=AoWlCmNDA3QC|accessdate=March 11, 2013|page=341|date=May 1, 2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-530796-2[/tpl]
In 1964, Sanders sold the company to a group of investors led by John Y. Brown Jr. and Jack C. Massey for US$2 million (around US$15 million in 2013). The contract included a lifetime salary for Sanders and the agreement that he would be the company's quality controller and trademark. The chain had reached 3,000 outlets in 48 different countries by 1970.[tpl]cite book|last=Aaseng|first=Nathan|title=Business Builders in Fast Food|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vwyiE8Gd8GQC&pg=PA158|accessdate=March 13, 2013|date=January 1, 2001|publisher=The Oliver Press, Inc.|isbn=978-1-881508-58-8|page=125[/tpl] In July 1971, Brown sold the company to the Connecticut-based Heublein, a packaged food and drinks corporation, for US$285 million (around US$1.6 billion in 2013). Sanders died in 1980, his promotional work making him a prominent figure in American cultural history. By the time of his death, there were an estimated 6,000 KFC outlets in 48 different countries worldwide, with $2 billion of sales annually.[tpl]cite news|last=Smith|first=J. Y.|title=Col.

In 1982, Heublein was acquired by R. J. Reynolds, the tobacco giant. In July 1986, Reynolds sold KFC to PepsiCo for $850 million (around US$1.8 billion in 2013). PepsiCo made the chain a part of its restaurants division alongside Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. The Chinese market was entered in November 1987, with an outlet in Beijing.
In 1991, the KFC name was officially adopted, although it was already widely known by that initialism. Kyle Craig, president of KFC US, admitted the change was an attempt to distance the chain from the unhealthy connotations of "fried".[tpl]cite news|title=And Now, Finger Lickin' Good For Ya?|url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/1991-02-17/and-now-finger-lickin-good-for-ya|accessdate=February 5, 2013|newspaper=Businessweek|date=February 17, 1991[/tpl] The early 1990s saw a number of successful major products launched throughout the chain, including spicy "Hot Wings" (launched in 1990), popcorn chicken (1992), and internationally, the "Zinger", a spicy chicken fillet burger (1993).[tpl]cite news |title=A feast of bargains |url= |newspaper=Sunday Herald Sun |date=May 31, 1992[/tpl] By 1994, KFC had 5,149 outlets in the US, and 9,407 overall, with over 100,000 employees.[tpl]cite book|author1=John A.

Initially, Sanders and KFC used hydrogenated vegetable oil for frying, but in the 1980s the company began to switch to cheaper oils such as palm or soybean.Tennessee Ernie Ford, Colonel Sanders, ABC In the 2000s it became apparent that these oils contain relatively high levels of trans fat, which increases the risk of heart disease.

KFC was described in 2012 by Bloomberg Businessweek as a "muscular player" in developing regions, specifically Africa, China and India, while noting its falling market share in the US to rivals such as Chick-fil-A and Popeyes. Some analysts speculated that KFC would begin spinning off its ailing US operations. That year, the company began divesting control of company-owned US restaurants to franchised operations, with the intention of reducing overall company ownership from 35 percent to 5 percent.

Japan is the third-largest market for KFC after China and the United States with 1,200 outlets.[tpl]cite web|title=Top 25 Markets — Traditional Stores (Year-End 2012)|url=http://yum.com/investors/restcounts.asp|publisher=Yum!

KFC Japan was originally formed as a joint venture between the American parent and the Japanese Mitsubishi Corporation.[tpl]cite web|title=KFC Japan|url=http://www.mitsubishicorp.com/jp/en/mclibrary/projectstory/vol02/|publisher=Mitsubishi Corporation|accessdate=June 29, 2013[/tpl] After four years of negotiations, Mitsubishi was awarded the franchise rights to KFC in Japan, and a test store was opened at the Osaka World Expo in March 1970. After the début proved to be a success, the first store proper was opened in the suburban location of Nagoya in November 1970.[tpl]cite web|title=KFC Japan|url=http://www.mitsubishicorp.com/jp/en/mclibrary/projectstory/vol02/page2.html|publisher=Mitsubishi Corporation|accessdate=June 29, 2013[/tpl] The American parent wanted suburban locations, whereas Mitsubishi had argued for city centre locations, as the car had not been widely adopted in Japan at that time. Two more locations were opened in Osaka, but the stores struggled, and after less than a year operations had lost JP¥ 100 million. As a result of this failure, Mitsubishi's original plan for urban locations was pursued.
The first new strategy store opened in Kobe in 1972, an upmarket residential area with a large Western expatriate community. The new strategy was a success, and by December 1973, 100 outlets had been opened. In December 1974, KFC Japan began to promote fried chicken as a Christmas meal. Eating KFC as a Christmas time meal has since become a widely practised custom in Japan.[tpl]cite news|last=Whipp|first=Lindsay|title=All Japan wants for Christmas is Kentucky Fried Chicken|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/bb2dafc6-0ba4-11e0-a313-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2XRv8gnig [tpl]Subscription required[/tpl] |accessdate=June 29, 2013|newspaper=Financial Times|date=December 19, 2010[/tpl] Harland Sanders himself visited the Japanese operations in 1972, 1978 and 1980.[tpl]cite web|title=Colonel's Story|url=http://www.kfc.co.jp/room/story.html|work=KFC Japan|publisher=Yum!|accessdate=November 13, 2013[/tpl]

In 2006, the company stopped pre-salting its fries and removed trans fats from its products. In 2012 palm oil was replaced by rapeseed oil in the fryers. Between 2004 and 2014, KFC UK increased its offering of "portable" foods: burgers, wraps and salads. During that period, sales rose from around £500 million to almost £1 billion. In 2012 KFC UK invested £9 million to install ovens in all of its outlets, so that it could offer griddled chicken.

There are over 600 KFC outlets in Australia, and around 100 in New Zealand.

This had a major impact on Australian chicken production, which increased by 38 percent during the period. By 1995 there were 452 outlets, and the company employed 12,000 staff. That year, Australia produced 35 percent of KFC's international earnings.
The first KFC opened in New Zealand in 1971 at Royal Oak, a suburb of Auckland.[tpl]cite web|title=About us — Milestones|url=http://www.kfc.com.au/about-us/milestones.asp|publisher=KFC Australia|accessdate=July 4, 2013[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl] By 1980 there were 37 outlets.

As well as the standard KFC offerings, the chain sells a chickpea burger and hot wings with chilli lemon sprinkles.[tpl]cite news|last=Sharma|first=Amol|title=KFC's Big India Plans|url=http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2013/02/12/kfcs-big-india-plans/|accessdate=February 12, 2013|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=February 12, 2013[/tpl] A major franchise holder is QSR Brands (M) Holdings, which operated 26 outlets as of 2012.[tpl]cite web|title=Foods and Quick Service Restaurants Sector|url=http://www.jcorp.com.my/kfc-56.aspx|work=Johor Corporation|accessdate=October 10, 2013[/tpl]
The first Indian KFC was a two-storey outlet on the fashionable Brigade Road in Bangalore in June 1995. According to journalist Michael White, the company could not have chosen a "more difficult venue for its maiden entrée into the country."[tpl]cite book|last=White|first=Michael|title=A Short Course in International Marketing Blunders: Mistakes Made by Companies that Should Have Known Better|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zz1L3nnNmMcC&pg=PA68|year=2009|publisher=World Trade Press|isbn=978-1-60780-008-8|page=68[/tpl] Bangalore housed the headquarters of the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha, one of the most influential, vocal and anti-foreign investment farmers' associations in the country. There were protests from left wing, anti-globalisation and environmental campaigners, as well as local farmers, who objected to the chain bypassing local producers. Many Indians were concerned about the onslaught of consumerism, the loss of national self-sufficiency, and the disruption of indigenous traditions. The protests came to a head in August 1995, when the Bangalore outlet was repeatedly ransacked. The KFC outlet in Bangalore demanded, and received, a police van permanently parked outside for a year. The outlet was closed on 13 September 1995 by local authorities, who claimed its food was unhealthy. However, the outlet reopened for business within six hours of its closure, after the Karnataka High Court blocked the local authorities' order on an appeal by KFC. The company had argued that it prepared food in India using the same formula as in 77 other countries.[tpl]cite news|title=KFC's India outlet reopens: India's first Kentucky Fried...|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-09-13/news/9509140320_1_karnataka-reopens-local-authorities|accessdate=19 November 2013|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=September 13, 1995[/tpl] Rural activist M. D. Nanjundaswamy subsequently claimed KFC would adversely affect the health of the impoverished, by diverting grain from poor people to make the more profitable animal feed. Former environment minister Maneka Gandhi joined the anti-KFC movement. KFC was also accused of using illegally high amounts of monosodium glutamate (MSG) and frying its food in pork fat. A second store opened in Delhi, but was closed by the authorities throughout November, purportedly for health reasons, but more likely to avoid a repetition of the Bangalore incident.[tpl]cite news|last=Reuters|title=Fried chicken outlet stays shut|newspaper=Financial Times|date=14 November 1995[/tpl] The Delhi outlet soon closed permanently.[tpl]cite news|last=Dhillon|first=Amrit|title=India has no beef with fast-food chains|newspaper=Financial Times|date=23 March 2002[/tpl]

Unnat Varma, marketing director of KFC India, states "The vegetarian offerings have made the brand more relevant to a larger section of consumers and that is necessary for KFC's growth." KFC also began using Indian spices and cooking techniques to localize its chicken dishes. By 2008–09, KFC operated 34 outlets in India.[tpl]cite web|title=Made for India: Succeeding in a Market Where One Size Won't Fit All|url=http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/made-for-india-succeeding-in-a-market-where-one-size-wont-fit-all/|work=Wharton|publisher=Wharton|accessdate=19 November 2013|date=12 March 2009[/tpl]

==Products==

KFC's core product offering is pressure fried on-the-bone chicken pieces seasoned with the "Original Recipe". The product is typically available in either two or three piece individual servings, or in a family size cardboard bucket, typically holding between 6 and 16 chicken pieces. Poultry is divided into 9 different cuts (2 drumsticks, 2 thighs, 2 wings, 1 keel, and a backbone based breast cut divided into 2 pieces.[tpl]cite web|title=Nutrition Guide|url=http://kfc.ca/en/assets/pdf/KFC11834_NutritionalChart_Eng.pdf|publisher=KFC Canada|accessdate=February 23, 2013[/tpl] The product is hand-breaded at individual KFC outlets with wheat flour mixed with seasoning in a two to four minute process.

It is KFC policy to discard chicken if it has not been sold within 90 minutes, in order to ensure freshness. The frying oil varies regionally, and versions used include sunflower, soybean, rapeseed and palm oil. A KFC executive stated that the taste of the chicken will vary between regions depending on the oil variety used, and whether the chicken has been corn-fed or wheat-fed.

===Equipment===

KFC initially used stove-top covered cooking pots to fry its chicken.[tpl]cite news|last=Coomes|first=Steve|title=Winston Shelton: The Colonel's Corporal|newspaper=Louisville Magazine|date=July 17, 2012|url=http://www.louisville.com/content/winston-shelton-colonels-corporal-food-dining|accessdate=October 1, 2013[/tpl] In the 1960s, the officially recommended model was the L S Hartzog developed "KFC 20-Head Cooker," a large device that cost $16,000.[tpl]cite web|title=History|url=http://www.winstonind.com/kfc/history/|publisher=Winston Industries|accessdate=October 1, 2013[/tpl] The Hartzog model had no oil filtration system, meaning that filtering had to be done manually, and the pressure fryers occasionally exploded. In 1969, an engineer called Winston Shelton developed the "Collectramatic 519" pressure fryer that would self-filter the oil, and used precision timers and temperature controls. Fred Jeffries, then vice president of purchasing at KFC, claimed that the invention helped fuel the company's rapid expansion and success: "There's no way it could have grown like it did without the Collectramatic. Stores were doing about $200,000 a year in sales on average with the pots but they could never have done the $900,000 a year it became without Win's fryer."
Although a number of franchisees bought the Collectramatic, which had the support of Colonel Sanders from 1970 onwards, John Y. Brown had already signed an exclusive contract to only use the L S Hartzog fryer. Brown warned franchisees that they were in violation of their contract if they used the Collectramatic. Brown held his ground on the issue until he learned that his father, John Y. Brown, Sr., who was a KFC franchisee himself, was also using the Collectramatic. The issue was eventually resolved after Heublein purchased KFC and acquired Hartzog in order to invalidate the contract. The Collectramatic thus became the official pressure fryer for KFC from 1972 onwards.
Winston previously supplied KFC with holding cabinets, but since 2010, these have been supplied by Henny Penny.[tpl]cite press release |last= |first= |title=QSR Equipment Leader Named KFC US Supplier of the Year|trans_title= |language= |date=June 20, 2010 |publisher=PR Newswire |location= |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/qsr-equipment-leader-named-kfc-us-supplier-of-the-year-124188524.html |accessdate=2013-10-02 |archiveurl= |archivedate=2013-10-02 |deadurl= |quote= |ref= [/tpl]

==Advertising==

===Colonel Sanders===

Colonel Sanders was a key component of KFC advertising until his death in 1980. Despite his death, Sanders remains a key symbol of the company; an "international symbol of hospitality."[tpl]cite book|last=President and Fellows of Harvard College|title=PepsioCo's Restaurants|year=1994|publisher=Harvard Business School|location=Boston|page=9[/tpl]
Modern renditions of the Colonel are sometimes used in post 1980 advertising. In 1994, Henderson Forsythe portrayed the Colonel in a television campaign entitled "The Colonel's Way." From 1998 to 2001 an animated version of the Colonel voiced by Randy Quaid was used for television advertisements.[tpl]cite news|last=Howard|first=Theresa|title=New Products : KFC, with Pepsi, Mulls Putting New Colonel' On Proprietary Beverage|newspaper=Brandweek|date=September 28, 1998[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=White|first=Jeremy|title=KFC seeks a modern identity beyond the animated Colonel|url=http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/50297/close-up-live-issue-kfc---kfc-seeks-modern-identity-beyond-theanimated-colonel-kfc-retaking-control-its-advertising-improvesales-jeremy-white-writes|accessdate=February 20, 2013|newspaper=Campaign|date=January 18, 2002[/tpl] In 2012, a UK advertisement entitled "4000 cooks" featured an actor made up to resemble Sanders.[tpl]YouTube|id=Ewt7sappG14|title=4000 cooks[/tpl]
The ubiquity of Sanders has not prevented KFC from introducing a mascot aimed at children. "Chicky," a young animated chicken, was first introduced in Thailand in the 1990s, and has since been rolled out across a number of markets worldwide, mostly in Asia and South America.[tpl]cite news|last=O'Keefe|first=Brian|title=What Do KFC and Pizza Hut Conjure Up Abroad?|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2001/11/26/314105/|accessdate=October 15, 2013|newspaper=Fortune|date=November 26, 2001[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Liu|first=Warren|title=KFC in China: Secret Recipe for Success|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=z-qDLQAACAAJ|accessdate=April 13, 2013|date=September 26, 2008|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-470-82384-2|page=69[/tpl]

===Slogans===

Early official slogans included "North America's Hospitality Dish" (from 1956) and "We fix Sunday dinner seven nights a week" from 1957 until 1967.[tpl]cite web|title=North America's Hospitality Dish|url=http://www.trademarkia.com/north-americas-hospitality-dish-72209166.html|work=Trademarkia|publisher=KFC Corporation|accessdate=March 13, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Dukes|first=Terry|title=KFC: The Animated Colonel Campaign|newspaper=Institute of Practitioners in Advertising|year=2000|publisher=WARC Advertising Center|url=http://www.warc.com/Content/Documents/A35068_KFC_The_Animated_Colonel_Campaign.content?CID=A35068&ID=a93e70b1-4bea-4cbf-a2d8-436868cc296d&q=AID%3a35068&qr=[/tpl]
The "finger lickin' good" slogan was used from 1956, and went on to become one of the best-known slogans of the twentieth century. The trademark expired in the US in 2006, and was replaced in that market with "Follow your taste" until 2010. In 2011, the "finger lickin' good" slogan was dropped in favor of "So good," to be rolled out worldwide. A Yum! executive said that the new slogan was more holistic, applying to staff and service, as well as food.[tpl]cite news|last=Reynolds|first=John|title=Profile: Jennelle Tilling, vice-president of marketing, UK and Ireland at KFC|url=http://www.marketingmagazine.co.uk/article/1063711/profile-jennelle-tilling-vice-president-marketing-uk-ireland-kfc|accessdate=January 28, 2013|newspaper=PR Week|date=April 6, 2011[/tpl]
"Nobody does chicken like KFC" was first introduced by KFC Australia in 1998, and has continued to be used by the company in some markets.[tpl]cite news|last=Thornton|first=Phil|title=True lies|newspaper=The Sun Herald (Sydney, Australia)|date=May 31, 1998[/tpl]

===Logos===

The first KFC logo was introduced in 1952 and featured a "Kentucky Fried Chicken" typeface and a logo of the Colonel.[tpl]cite web|last=Rogers|first=Ian|title=The Mystery of the Colonel|url=http://www.greynotgrey.com/blog/2012/06/09/the-mystery-of-the-colonel/|publisher=Grey Not Grey|accessdate=April 3, 2014[/tpl] It was designed by the Lippincott & Margulies corporate identity agency. Lippincott & Margulies were hired to redesign it in 1978, and used a similar typeface and a slightly different Sanders logo. The "KFC" initialism logo was designed by Schechter & Luth of New York and was introduced in 1991, and the Colonel's face logo was switched from brown to blue ink.[tpl]cite news|last=Koeppel|first=Dan|title=The Feathers Are Really Flying At Kentucky Fried|newspaper=Adweek|date=September 3, 1990[/tpl]
Landor redesigned the logo in 1997, with a new image of the Colonel. The new Colonel image was more thinly lined, less cartoonish and a more realistic representation of Sanders. In 2006, the Colonel logo was updated by Tesser of San Francisco, replacing his white suit with an apron, bolder colors and a better defined visage.[tpl]cite news|last=Lovan|first=Dylan T.|title=Colonel Sanders gets a makeover in new KFC logo|newspaper=The Associated Press State & Local Wire|date=November 13, 2006[/tpl] According to Gregg Dedrick, president of KFC's US division, the change, "communicates to customers the realness of Colonel Sanders and the fact that he was a chef."

===Television===

====United States====

Advertising played a key role at KFC after it was sold by Sanders, and the company began to advertise on US television with a budget of US$4 million in 1966.[tpl]cite news|last=Rood|first=George|title=Accidental Competitor in Chicken Game Is Winner|newspaper=New York Times|date=January 5, 1969[/tpl] In order to fund nationwide advertising campaigns, the Kentucky Fried Chicken Advertising Co-Op was established, giving franchisees ten votes and the company three when deciding on budgets and campaigns.
In 1969, KFC hired its first national advertising agency, Leo Burnett. A notable Burnett campaign in 1972 was the "Get a bucket of chicken, have a barrel of fun" jingle, performed by Barry Manilow.
By 1976 KFC was one of the largest advertisers in the US.[tpl]cite book|last=Georgescu|first=Peter|title=The Source of Success: Five Enduring Principles at the Heart of Real Leadership|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=F2rJlkLq-twC&pg=PA75|accessdate=27 September 2013|date=July 2005|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-7879-8133-4|page=75[/tpl] Young & Rubicam (Y&R) was KFC's agency of record in the US from 1976 until December 2000.[tpl]cite news|last=Elliott|first=Stuart|title=KFC's Very Real Problems May Be Solved in Lake Edna|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/19/business/media-business-advertising-kfc-s-very-real-problems-may-be-solved-lake-edna.html|accessdate=January 23, 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=May 19, 1992[/tpl] From 1978 to 1980 "It's nice to feel so good about a meal" was the slogan.[tpl]cite book|title=Poultry and Egg Marketing|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nntQAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=April 10, 2013|year=1979|publisher=Poultry & Egg News, Incorporated|page=vii[/tpl] It was chosen because KFC had identified consumer guilt as its core marketing obstacle.[tpl]cite book|last=O'Shaughnessy|first=Nicholas J.|title=Politics and Propaganda: Weapons of Mass Seduction|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=FTrgh74moswC&pg=PA45|accessdate=August 18, 2013|year=2004|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-6853-9|page=45[/tpl] Meanwhile, KFC hired the Mingo-Jones agency to target African American audiences.[tpl]cite news|last=Delaney|first=Tom|title=KFC Cooks Up New $80-Mil.

By 2005, this believed to have been a failure, and KFC UK's marketing director left the company amid speculation that the US head office was unhappy with the campaign. Marketing subsequently moved towards a more family-orientated line.

Since the turn of the 21st century, fast food has been criticised for its animal welfare record, its links to obesity and its environmental impact.[tpl]cite news|last=Barnett|first=Michael|title=Colonel Sanders' new modern army of outlets|url=http://www.marketingweek.co.uk/colonel-sanders-new-modern-army-of-outlets/3021690.article|accessdate=February 11, 2013|newspaper=Marketing Week|date=December 16, 2010[/tpl] Eric Schlosser's book Fast Food Nation (2002) and Morgan Spurlock's film Super Size Me (2004) reflected these concerns.
