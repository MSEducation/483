Baruch Samuel "Barry" Blumberg (July 28, 1925[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]April 5, 2011) was an American doctor and co-recipient of the 1976 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (with Daniel Carleton Gajdusek) for his work on the Hepatitis B virus as an investigator at the NIH, and the President of the American Philosophical Society from 2005 until his death.
Blumberg received the Nobel Prize for "discoveries concerning new mechanisms for the origin and dissemination of infectious diseases." Blumberg identified the Hepatitis B virus, and later developed its diagnostic test and vaccine.[tpl]cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1976/blumberg-autobio.html |title="Baruch S.

==Early life and education==

Blumberg was born in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Ida (Simonoff) and Meyer Blumberg, a lawyer.[tpl]cite news|title=Medicine Obtuaries: Professor Baruch Blumberg|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/medicine-obituaries/8433131/Professor-Baruch-Blumberg.html|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=8 April 2011|quote=One of three children of a lawyer, Baruch Samuel Blumberg was born on July 28, 1925 in Brooklyn, New York, and educated at Far Rockaway High School in Queens, where he won a science prize after making a working refrigerator from junk parts.|location=London|date=April 6, 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110427085717/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/medicine-obituaries/8433131/Professor-Baruch-Blumberg.html| archivedate= 27 April 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl]http://www.faqs.org/health/bios/39/Baruch-Samuel-Blumberg.html He first attended the Orthodox Yeshivah of Flatbush for elementary school, where he learned to read and write in Hebrew and to study the Bible and Jewish texts in their original language. (That school also had among its students a contemporary of Blumberg, Eric Kandel, who is another recipient of the Nobel Prize in medicine.) Blumberg then attended Far Rockaway High School in the early 1940s, a school that also produced fellow laureates Burton Richter and Richard Feynman.Schwach, Howard. "Museum Tracks Down FRHS Nobel Laureates", The Wave (newspaper), April 15, 2005. Accessed October 2, 2007. "Burton Richter graduated from Far Rockaway High School in 1948." Blumberg served as a U.S. Navy deck officer during World War II. He then attended Union College in Schenectady, New York and graduated from there with honors in 1946.[tpl]cite web|title=Baruch Blumberg '46, winner of Nobel Prize, dies|url=http://www.union.edu/News/stories/2011/04/baruch-blumberg-46,-winner-of-nobel-prize,-dies.php|publisher=Union College|accessdate=8 April 2011[/tpl]
Originally entering the graduate program in mathematics at Columbia University, Blumberg switched to medicine and enrolled at Columbia's College of Physicians and Surgeons, from which he received his M.D. in 1951. He remained at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center for the next four years, first as an intern and then as a resident. He then began graduate work in biochemistry at Balliol College, Oxford and earned his Ph.D there in 1957 as well as eventually being the first American to be master there.[tpl]cite news |title=Barry Blumberg |url=http://www.economist.com/node/18617858 |newspaper=The Economist |date=28 April 2011 |accessdate=30 August 2012[/tpl]

==Scientific career==

Throughout the 1950s, Blumberg traveled the world taking human blood samples and studying the inherited variations in human beings, focusing on why some people contracted diseases in similar environments that others did not.  In 1964, while studying yellow jaundice, he discovered a surface antigen for hepatitis B in the blood of an Australian aborigine.[tpl]cite journal |last=Blumberg |first=B.

Blumberg later freely distributed his vaccine patent in order to promote its fielding by drug companies.  Deployment of the vaccine reduced the infection rate of hepatitis B in children in China from 15% to 1% in 10 years.[tpl]cite news |work=The Economist |url=http://www.economist.com/node/18617858?story_id=18617858&CFID=163885233&CFTOKEN=77593797 |title=Obituary:  Barry Blumberg |date=30 April 2011 |page=92 [/tpl]
Blumberg became a member of the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia in 1964, and held the rank of University Professor of Medicine and Anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania starting in 1977. Concurrently, he was Master of Balliol College from 1989 to 1994. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1994.[tpl]cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter B |url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=6 April 2011[/tpl] From 1999 to 2002, he was also director of the NASA Astrobiology Institute at the Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/1999/99-061.txt |title=Nobel Prize Winner To Lead NASA Astrobiology Institute NASA |date= |accessdate=2011-04-07| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110417032917/http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/1999/99-061.txt| archivedate= 17 April 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewnews.html?id=446 |title="Astrobiology at T+5 Years" Ad Astra Magazine/NSS |publisher=Spaceref.com |date=2002-05-09 |accessdate=2011-04-07[/tpl][tpl]cite pmid|14678657[/tpl]
In November 2004, Blumberg was named Chairman of the Scientific Advisory Board of United Therapeutics Corporation,[tpl]cite web|title=Scientific Advisory Board|url=http://www.unither.com/scientific-advisory-board|publisher=United Therapeutics Corporation|accessdate=7 April 2011[/tpl] a position he held until his death.  As Chairman he convened three Conferences on Nanomedical and Telemedical Technology,[tpl]cite web|title=Unither Nanomedical & Telemedical Technology Conference|url=http://www.unithertechnologyconference.com/conferenceinfo.php|accessdate=7 April 2011[/tpl] as well as guiding the biotechnology company into the development of a broad-spectrum anti-viral medicine.
Beginning in 2005, Blumberg  also served as the President of the American Philosophical Society. He had been first elected to membership in the society in 1986.[tpl]cite web|title=In Memoriam|url=http://www.amphilsoc.org/memorial/2783|work=amphilsoc.org|publisher=American Philosophical Society|accessdate=8 April 2011|year=2011|quote=Baruch S. Blumberg, President of the American Philosophical Society from 2005–2011, died on April 5, 2011 at the age of 85.[/tpl]
In October 2010 Blumberg participated in the USA Science and Engineering Festival's Lunch with a Laureate program whereby middle and high school students of the Greater Washington D.C., Northern Virginia and Maryland area get to engage in an informal conversation with a Nobel Prize winning scientist over a brown bag lunch.[ref]
</ref>  Blumberg came to General George A. McCall Elementary on Sept. 29, 2010 as part of the program.
In an interview with the New York Times in 2002 he stated that "lives is what drew me to medicine. There is, in Jewish thought, this idea that if you save a single life, you save the whole world".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/07/health/07blumberg.html?_r=1&pagewanted=2|title=Baruch Blumberg, Who Discovered and Tackled Hepatitis B, Dies at 85|publisher=New York Times|date=6 April 2011|accessdate=7 April 2011|first=H.

In discussing the factors that influenced his life, Blumberg always gave credit to the mental discipline of the Jewish Talmud, and as often as possible he attended weekly Talmud discussion classes until his death.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.seti.org/page.aspx?pid=1593 |title=SETI Institute |publisher=Seti.org |date= |accessdate=2011-04-07| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110517062141/http://www.seti.org/page.aspx?pid=1593| archivedate= 17 May 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
