''
Re was Café Tacuba's second and perhaps most important contribution to Mexico's music scene. The album was called "the equivalent of the Beatles 'White Album' for the rock en español movement" by the New York Times.[tpl]cite web|title = Madcap Music by a Mexican Band With Its Ears to the World|author=|publisher=New York Times|date=24 August 2006|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/04/arts/madcap-music-by-a-mexican-band-with-its-ears-to-the-world.html|accessdate = 10 January 2006 [/tpl] The name probably comes from the second syllable in Solfege, perhaps because it was their second album. It was released in 1994 and consisted of twenty songs.
The album is widely considered to be the best Latin American album of all time.http://www.milenio.com/cdb/doc/noticias2011/a9662747c48c8d3b6218fe1afc0aff35http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-10-greatest-latin-rock-albums-of-all-time-20121119/cafe-tacuba-re-aa994-19691231

==Track listing==

Re album established Café Tacuba's style of genre-switching, which hadn't been as prominent in their debut album, Café Tacuba, released two years earlier. Its sheer length - an hour long - and experimentation with musical styles has made it a favorite among fans. One notable aspect of the album is that it contains several musical genres, notably  norteño, Banda, and Bolero music.  The album's diversity in genres showcase the vocal capabilities of Rubén Albarrán, credited on this album as "Cosme".
