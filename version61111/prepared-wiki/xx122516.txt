"Last Thing on My Mind" is a song written and recorded by English girl group Bananarama. The song is featured on their album Please Yourself and was released as the album's second single in the UK in 1992. It was produced by Mike Stock and Pete Waterman, two-thirds of the Stock Aitken Waterman (SAW) trio. Pete Waterman said in 2002 the song was influenced by Mozart. The single met with little success, peaking at number seventy-one in the UK singles chart. However, the song later became a hit when a cover by the band Steps was released as a single in 1998.

==Music video==

The music video features the two girls dressed in suits, ties, and gloves as they meet in a high-class European cafe where they chat, giggle, and whisper into each other's ears. These scenes are intercut with scenes of each of the girls being caressed or hugging a male companion in an upscale bedroom. The video ends with the two girls leaving together in a limousine. There is a lesbian subtext to the storyline due to the intimacy between the girls, their masculine outfits, and the ending with the two girls leaning against each other without their male partners.
