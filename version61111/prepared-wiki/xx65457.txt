Chevron Corporation ([tpl]nyse|CVX[/tpl] [tpl]euronext|CHTEX[/tpl]) is an American multinational energy corporation. Headquartered in San Ramon, California, and active in more than 180 countries, it is engaged in every aspect of the oil, gas, and geothermal energy industries, including exploration and production; refining, marketing and transport; chemicals manufacturing and sales; and power generation. Chevron is one of the world's six "supermajor" oil companies; [tpl]as of | 2013 | lc = y[/tpl], it ranked eleventh in the Fortune Global 500 list of the world's largest companies.[tpl]cite news|title=Chevron |work=Fortune Global 500 |publisher=CNN.com |year=2013 | url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/global500/2013/snapshots/385.html?iid=G500_fl_list [/tpl]
Chevron's downstream operations manufacture and sell products such as fuels, lubricants, additives and petrochemicals. The company's most significant areas of operations are the west coast of North America, the U.S. Gulf Coast, Southeast Asia, South Korea, Australia and South Africa. In 2010, Chevron sold an average 3.1 million barrels per day (490×103 m3/d) of refined products like gasoline, diesel and jet fuel.
Chevron's alternative energy operations include geothermal, solar, wind, biofuel, fuel cells, and hydrogen. In 2011–2013, the company plans to spend at least $2 billion on research and acquisition of renewable power ventures.  Chevron has claimed to be the world's largest producer of geothermal energy.  In October 2011, Chevron launched a 29-MW thermal solar-to-steam facility in the Coalinga Field to produce the steam for enhanced oil recovery. The project is the largest of its kind in the world.
Chevron has been involved in controversies and environmental and safety incidents. In 2012, a large fire due to aging equipment and lack of oversight erupted at a Chevron refinery in Richmond, California. In Ecuador, Chevron has been involved in an ongoing class action lawsuit filed by indigenous residents.

==History==

===Predecessors===

One of Chevron's early predecessors, Star Oil, was founded after it discovered oil at the Pico Canyon north of Los Angeles in 1876. According to geophysicist Marius Vassiliou, the 25 bpd well was considered the beginning of the oil industry in California and the start of Newhall field. Energy analyst Antonia Juhasz has said that while Star Oil's founders were influential in establishing an oil industry in California, Union Matolle Company discovered oil in the state eleven years prior.[tpl]cite book|author=Antonia Juhasz|title=The Bush Agenda|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ROTr9RCRr8IC&pg=PA106|accessdate=August 9, 2013|date=October 6, 2009|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-197761-9|pages=106–[/tpl] In September 1879, Charles N.

Another predecessor, Texas Fuel Company, was founded in Beaumont, Texas in 1901 by "Buckskin Joe" as an oil equipment vendor. The founder's nickname came from being harsh and aggressive. Texas Fuel worked closely with Chevron. It began oil mining operations in 1936, when it formed a join venture called Caltex with Chevron to mine oil in Saudi Arabia.[tpl]cite book|author1=Charles A.

===Formation of the Chevron name===

In 1911, Standard Oil Co. (California) was severed from its parent corporation, Standard Oil, as a result of the federal government's successful lawsuit against Standard Oil under the Sherman Antitrust Act. It went on to become part of the "Seven Sisters", which dominated the world oil industry in the early 20th century.[tpl]cite news|title=Chevron drops the Texaco from its name|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2005-05-10/business/17371722_1_chevron-and-texaco-san-ramon-s-chevron-oil-industry|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=May 2, 2011|first=David R.|last=Baker|date=May 10, 2005[/tpl] In 1926, the company changed its name to Standard Oil Co. of California (SOCAL). The Chevron name came into use for some of its retail products in the 1930s. The name Calso was also used from 1946 to 1955 in states outside its native West Coast territory."Chevron and Calso". Landscape Change Program, University of Vermont."Whatever happened to Standard Oil?". Robert V. Droz, US-Highways.com."Vintage Calso Gasoline / Standard Oil of California pump".

In 1933, Saudi Arabia granted SoCal a concession to find oil, which led to the discovery of oil in 1938. In 1948, SoCal discovered the world's largest oil field (Ghawar) in Saudi Arabia.[tpl]cite web|title=The King of Giant Fields|url=http://www.geoexpro.com/article/The_King_of_Giant_Fields/d311f583.aspx|accessdate=June 5, 2013[/tpl] SoCal's subsidiary, California-Arabian Standard Oil Company, grew over the years and became the Arabian American Oil Company (ARAMCO) in 1944. In 1973, the Saudi government began buying into ARAMCO. By 1980, the company was entirely owned by the Saudis, and in 1988, its name was changed to Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Saudi Aramco).[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]
Standard Oil of California and Gulf Oil merged in 1984, which was the largest merger in history at that time. To comply with U.S. antitrust law, SoCal divested many of Gulf's operating subsidiaries, and sold some Gulf stations and a refinery in the eastern United States. (The refinery is currently owned by Sunoco.) Among the assets sold off were Gulf's retail outlets in Gulf's home market of Pittsburgh, where Chevron lacks a retail presence but does retain a regional headquarters there as of 2013, partially for Marcellus Shale-related drilling.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/business/news/chevron-acquires-kmart-property-in-moon-for-possible-regional-headquarters-685784/ | work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | title=Chevron acquires Kmart property in Moon for possible regional headquarters - Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | first1=Mark | last1=Belko | first2=Erich | last2=Schwartzel | date=May 1, 2013[/tpl] The same year, SoCal also took the opportunity to change its legal name to Chevron Corporation, since it had already been using the well-known "Chevron" retail brand name for decades. Chevron would sell the Gulf Oil trademarks for the entire U.S. to Cumberland Farms, the parent company of Gulf Oil LP, in 2010 after Cumberland Farms had a license to the Gulf trademark in the Northeastern United States since 1986.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.vermontbiz.com/news/january/gulf-oil-acquires-brand-rights-entire-us|title=Gulf Oil acquires brand rights for entire US|work=Vermont Business Magazine|date=January 13, 2010|accessdate=May 5, 2010[/tpl]

==Controversies==

===Environmental damage in Ecuador===

Texaco and Gulf Oil began operating in the Oriente region of Ecuador in 1964 as a consortium.Juan Forero "Rain Forest Residents, Texaco Face Off In Ecuador".  NPR, April 30, 2009. Retrieved December 17, 2012 Texaco operated the Lago Agrio oil field from 1972 to 1993 and the Ecuador state oil company continued to operate the same oil fields after Texaco left. In 1993 Texaco was found responsible for dumping billions of gallons of toxic waste and they spent $40m cleaning up the area during the 1990s.  In 1998 the Ecuadorean government signed an agreement with Texaco accepting the clean-up as complete and absolving Texaco of any further responsibility. In 1998 an Ecuadorean scientific team took water and soil samples after Texaco left and found petroleum hydrocarbons at unsafe levels in almost half.  The clean up was called "a sham" by critics.
In 2003 a class action lawsuit against Chevron was filed in Ecuadorian court for $28 billion by indigenous residents, who accused Texaco of making residents ill and damaging forests and rivers by discharging [tpl]convert|18|e9USgal|m3[/tpl] of formation water into the Amazon rainforest without any environmental remediation.Bogumil Terminski "Oil-Induced Displacement and Resettlement: Social Problem and Human Rights Issue".

===NiMH battery technology for automobiles===

Chevron was accused to be limiting access to large NiMH batteries through its stake in Cobasys corporation and control of patent licenses in order to remove a competitor to gasoline.  This culminated in a lawsuit against Panasonic and Toyota over production of the EV-95 battery used in the RAV4 EV.http://investor.shareholder.com/ovonics/secfiling.cfm?filingID=950123-10-82515 [tpl]dead link|date=July 2012[/tpl]http://investor.shareholder.com/ovonics/secfiling.cfm?filingID=950123-09-38450 [tpl]dead link|date=July 2012[/tpl]  Chevron's influence over Cobasys extends beyond a strict 50/50 joint venture as it held a 19.99% interest in ECD Ovonics."ECD Ovonics Definitive Proxy Statement". Shareholder.com.[tpl]dead link|date=February 2013[/tpl] of January 15, 2003  In her book, Plug-in Hybrids: The Cars that Will Recharge America, published in February 2007, Sherry Boschert argues that large-format NiMH batteries are commercially viable but that Cobasys refuses to sell the batteries or license the technology to small companies or individuals. Boschert argues that Cobasys accepts only very large orders for the batteries. Major automakers showed little interest in placing large orders for large-format NiMH batteries. However, Toyota complained about the difficulty in getting smaller orders of large format NiMH batteries to service the existing 825 RAV-4EVs. Because no other companies were willing to place large orders, Cobasys was not manufacturing or licensing large format NiMH battery technology for automobiles. Boschert concludes that "it's possible that Cobasys (Chevron) is squelching all access to large NiMH batteries through its control of patent licenses in order to remove a competitor to gasoline. Or it's possible that Cobasys simply wants the market for itself and is waiting for a major automaker to start producing plug-in hybrids or electric vehicles."Boschert, S. (2007) Plug-in Hybrids: The Cars that Will Recharge America (Gabriola Island, BC: New Society Publishers) ISBN 978-0-86571-571-4  In an interview with The Economist, the ECD Ovonics founder Stan Ovshinsky subscribed to the former view. "I think we at ECD we made a mistake of having a joint venture with an oil company, frankly speaking. And I think it's not a good idea to go into business with somebody whose strategies would put you out of business, rather than building the business."[tpl]cite web|last=Brigis|first=Alvis|url=http://www.theenergyroadmap.com/futureblogger/show/1030-stanford-ovshinsky-and-the-future-of-energy-interview-part-1|title=The Edison of our Age: Stan Ovshinsky and the Future of Energy Interview Part 1|publisher=The Energy Roadmap|date=October 14, 2008|accessdate=February 16, 2011[/tpl]

===KS Endeavor explosion===

The KS Endeavor jackup rig exploded on January 16, 2012 while drilling an exploration well for Chevron in the Funiwa field in Nigeria.  The explosion resulted in the death of two of the 154 workers on board and a fire that burned for 46 days before the well was sealed on June 18.   According to a Reuters news report, workers on the KS Endeavor were ignored by Chevron when they requested evacuation due to concerns of increasing smoke billowing from the drilling borehole.  A senior worker said the blowout was triggered by a massive build-up of pressure.  A witness said that rig engineers advised Chevron to stop drilling and evacuate staff but Chevron told them to continue with drilling.   Expecting an explosion, the rig manager, one of the two that later died, kept the lifeboats at hand and ready for use.  A witness reported: "This is the reason so many of us survived because we were all aware that it was going to happen, but just didn't know when."
In an email response to Reuters, Chevron said it did not receive requests to evacuate the  rig and that staff on board had the right to call a halt to work if they believed conditions were unsafe.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/11/us-chevron-nigeria-idUSBRE86A0OP20120711 | work=Reuters | title=Exclusive: Riggers sought evacuation before deadly Chevron blast | date=July 11, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|newspaper=Upstream Online|publisher=NHST Media Group|title=Chevron prepares to drill Nigeria relief well|url=http://www.upstreamonline.com/live/article298359.ece|first=Kathrine|last=Schmidt|date=January 17, 2012|accessdate=January 24, 2012|id=[tpl]subscription required[/tpl][/tpl]

===Destruction of natural forest in Bangladesh===

On June 26, 2008, a fire in Lawachara National Park (a natural forest; a major national park, rare of its kind in the region, and crucial to maintain the biodiversity of Bangladesh's flora & fauna) had broken out as Chevron Corp. carried out a 3D seismic survey that was to be six-months long. The company had violated the conditions of the government's environment clearance certificate by not informing the ministry about the cracks that had occurred in nearby residents' properties due to explosions caused by their activities.[tpl]cite news |title=Chevron violated terms of environmental clearance from govt|url=http://www.bangladeshnews.com.bd/2008/05/06/chevron-violated-terms-of-environmental-clearance-from-govt|newspaper=BangladeshNews.com.bd|date=May 6, 2008|accessdate=May 10, 2011[/tpl]

===Polish gas exploration===

Chevron has experienced mass protests aimed at the company by local communities in Southern Poland when they started gas exploration in the region. Their complaint is that Chevron didn't provide all of the documents required for gas exploration in Poland, and that the company has not promised to share a percentage of the revenues with the local landholders. The landholders of the region view Chevron's presence in the region negatively since they may be forced to sell their properties at a low cost if gas is discovered in the region.  As well, potential environmental disasters are a concern for local farmers.  Another of the residents' primary concern is water pollution from the chemicals used in fracking. In response to some of the protests Chevron has sued some of the protesters from Żurawlów for disrupting their operations.http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/wiadomosci/1,114883,14910068,Blokuja_badania_wsChevron_pozywa_mieszkancow.html
According to gas and oil expert Andrzej Szczesniak, one of the main reasons for the protest is the difference between Polish and American law. In the USA property owners typically receive 15-20% from the income of gas exploration.  In Poland, the discovery of gas on private property usually results in a forced sale of the property, with the owner receiving only the prior value of the land and no percentage of the gas revenue. This is the result of outdated, Communist Era laws that are still on the books and which are often exploited by municipal governments if they can get a 'kick back' from a larger company.Polish TVP interview and material about gas exploration in Poland, first broadcast in Wiadomosci, on 7-11-2013http://www.eko-unia.org.pl/ekounia/index.php/de/strona-glowna/lupki/wiadomosci/765-przez-upki-premier-tusk-moe-straci-dziak

===Romanian gas exploration===

In October 2013, Chevron suspended its drilling plans in Pungești, Vaslui County, where villagers had been opposing shale gas exploration due to fears of ground water contamination. Thousands more protested throughout Romania, and in December protests became violent when Chevron announced plans to resume exploration. Following the incident, Chevron said it was again suspending activities in the area.http://sarahinromania.canalblog.com/archives/2013/10/16/28227487.htmlhttp://www.realitatea.net/noi-incidente-la-pungesti-dubele-jandarmilor-atacate-cu-pietre-11-persoane-duse-la-ipj-vaslui_1334689.htmlhttp://rt.com/news/chevron-fracking-protest-clashes-884/

===Argentina agreement, repression of environmentalists, workers and Native Americans===

After the 2012 decision of the Argentine government to regain  control of the biggest oil company of the country, YPF, the search for foreign investors for exploitation of unconventional oil started. Finally in 2013, YPF and Chevron signed an agreement for the Vaca Muerta oil field, the world’s second-largest shale gas deposit . In August 2013, the Congress of Neuquén province voted on the agreement. A massive peaceful protest of between 5,000 http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/economia/2-227831-2013-08-29.html and 10,000 http://www.clarin.com/politica/Masiva-Neuquen-acuerdo-Vaca-Muerta_0_983901657.html workers, students and other Native Americans was severely repressed by the government and finally the bill was approved.
