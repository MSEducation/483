Thomas Francis Peter Mulchinock (born 13 October 1984 in Beverley, England) is a musician and songwriter. Thomas is the former lead vocalist & co-writer of the band 'Some Are Saints'.

==Some Are Saints==

'Some Are Saints' was founded in 2004, by close friends, 'Mark Wardale' (Row Boat) & 'Christopher Beale'.
Thomas joined the line-up in the Summer of 2005 as 'lead vocalist/rhythm guitarist' & played an immediate vital role in the songwriting and recording of 'Some Are Saints' solitary album project 'Ginger Face'. He penned such tracks as 'Changing', 'Wooden Ship' and 'I Owe You'.
Thomas left the band in December 2006 and after a change of line-ups for the next 2 years, 'Some Are Saints' finally disbanded in 2008.

==Solo-Projects==

Thomas took an unexpected break from music after the exit from 'Some Are Saints' and It wasn't until September 2008 that he decided to put together a project of his own as a solo-artist which was completed and released under Musiker Records in 2009, which was run by former band member Mark Wardale. The completed project was named "Restless World" which included singles "Devil In My Bed" and "Mysteries Of Tomorrow".
In February 2011, it was announced that Thomas would start work on his follow-up album (Title yet to be known) which will again be released through Musiker Records in October of the same year.

==Influences==

Thomas draws most of his inspiration from melodic based songwriting artists such as Neil Finn, Liam Finn, David Byrne (Talking Heads), Lauri Ylonen (the Rasmus) and Rivers Cuomo (Weezer).
