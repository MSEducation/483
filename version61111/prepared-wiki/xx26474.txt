==Geography==

The Chafarinas Islands are made up of three islands (with areas in hectares):
Under Spanish control since 1847, there is a 190-man military garrison on Isla Isabel II, the only stable population on the small archipelago, down from 426 people in 1900 and 736 people in 1910.
The islands had a certain relevance in Spanish environmentalist circles during the 1980s and 1990s as the very last individual of Mediterranean Monk Seal in Spanish territory lived there, until it disappeared in the 1990s.Foca monje del Mediterráneo | CONSUMER.es EROSKI Nine out of 11 marine invertebrates considered endangered species and the second largest colony in the world of the endangered Audouin's gull inhabit the islands.Ceberia, Monica et al (17 September 2012) The last remains of the empire El Pais in English, Retrieved 24 September 2012
