On2 Technologies ([tpl]AMEX|ONT[/tpl]), formerly known as The Duck Corporation,The Duck Corporation On2 Technologies - The Duck Corporation, Retrieved on 2009-08-11[tpl]dead link|date=January 2012[/tpl] was a small publicly traded company (on the American Stock Exchange), headquartered in Clifton Park, New York, that designed video codec technology. It created a series of video codecs called TrueMotion (including TrueMotion S, TrueMotion 2, TrueMotion RT 2.0,[tpl]cite web |url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2361 |title=WAVE and AVI Codec Registries - RFC 2361 |date=June 1998 |accessdate=2009-12-05[/tpl] TrueMotion VP3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8).
In February 2010, On2 Technologies was acquired by Google for an estimated $124.6 million.

==History==

While known by the name The Duck Corporation, they developed TrueMotion S, a codec that was used by some games for FMV sequences during the 1990s. The original office of the Duck Corporation was founded in New York City by Daniel B. Miller, Victor Yurkovsky, and Stan Marder.  Miller became CEO of newly renamed On2 Technologies until Doug McIntyre was hired in late 2000, when Miller resumed his role as CTO. CEO's after McIntyre included Bill Joll and Matt Frost.
After Miller's departure in 2003, newly promoted CTO Eric Ameres moved the primary engineering office to upstate NY's capital region.[tpl]clarify|What does this mean?|date=June 2012[/tpl] Ameres later departed in 2007 to pursue other research as part of the opening of the Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center (EMPAC) at his alma mater, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI).  After Ameres' departure in 2007 Paul Wilkins served as co-CTO with Jim Bankoski. Wilkins was founder of "Metavisual" which was acquired by On2 in 1999 to bring the VP3 codec to market. The VP3 codec became the basis of On2's future codecs as well as the basis of the open source Theora video codec.
In 1995, The Duck Corporation raised $1.5 million in venture funding from Edelson Technology Partners.
In 1997, they raised an additional $5.5 million in a venture round primarily financed by Citigroup Ventures.
In 1999, The Duck Corporation merged with Applied Capital Funding, Inc., a public company on the American Stock Exchange. The merged entity was first renamed On2.Com and then On2 Technologies, trading on the AMEX as ONT. ONT's price peaked at a little over $40 per share, briefly giving the company a market cap in excess of $1 billion.
On April 4, 2000, On2 buys Quickband, Inc.("Quickband"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, acquired substantially all of the assets of DVD Mags, Inc. ("DVD Mags"), a California corporation in the business of aggregating and producing short-form entertainment content for distribution across digital and traditional channels (the "Quickband Acquisition"). The Quickband Acquisition was effected pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement ("Purchase Agreement") dated as of March 9, 2000 by and among the Company, Quickband and DVD Mags.
In May 2007, On2 announced an agreement to acquire Finnish Hantro Products, a provider of video codecs for chips for wireless devices.http://www.hantro.com/ The acquisition was finalized on November 1, 2007.On2 company information page[tpl]dead link|date=January 2012[/tpl]
In November 2008, On2 announced that it would partner with Zencoder to create Flix Cloud, a high-capacity online video encoding service using Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2).On2 Technologies and Zencoder Partner to Create On-Demand Video Encoding Service Flix Cloud launched in April 2009.On2 Technologies Releases On2 Flix Cloud On-Demand Video Transcoding Service

==Technology==

===TrueMotion S===

According to the company itself, development started in the early 1990s.archived information from duck.com The first versions of the codec were mainly targeted at and used for full motion video scenes in computer games. Therefore they were especially fit to run on limited resources. Actually all versions of the codec compared quite favorably to their respective contemporary main competitors in terms of consumption of computational power.
At first there were only hardware-implementations of the codec, meant to run on special hardware boards only.
This was the first version in the TrueMotion series of proprietary lossy video compression formats and video codec.  This format compressed frame in either a 32-bit or 16-bit RGB color space with a FourCC of DUCK (or TMOT for a version of TrueMotion S that was licensed by Horizon TechnologiesWINAMP.COM | Forums - Codecs). It is usually put in an AVI container. The filename extension varies from game to game. Some leave it with .avi, other games use .bin or .duc. The codec is notorious for being used frequently during the 32-bit era of video game consoles. For example the games Bug!, Bug Too! or Fighting Vipers (all Sega Saturn) used this codec for FMV sequences. Simon & Schuster first person games such as Star Trek: Borg also used the compression format. 
Nowadays, TrueMotion S is obsolete. Some of the files can be played back with a video player that uses the libavcodec library, such as MPlayer.
In 1995, Horizons Technology Inc. began shipping the TrueMotion-S Compressor software for Macintosh and MS Windows.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Horizons+Technology+ships+the+Windows+version+of+its+TrueMotion-S+...-a017434566 | title=Horizons Technology ships the Windows version of its TrueMotion-S software-only video compressor; TrueMotion-S Compressor can be implemented without expensive desktop upgrades. | date=1995-10-26 | accessdate=2009-10-24 [/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Horizons+Technology+signs+new+international+distributors+for...-a017098558 | title=Horizons Technology signs new international distributors for TrueMotion-S software-only video; new distributors to bring high-quality software-only video to Europe and Israel. | date=1995-06-21 | accessdate=2009-10-24[/tpl] TrueMotion-S was originally developed by the Duck Corp. for applications such as the Sega game box.
In 1996, the main competitors for TrueMotion S software codec were Cinepak and Indeo in games for first-generation CD-ROM based game consoles.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.synthetic-ap.com/qt/trumot.html | title=Horizon Technology's TrueMotion-S Codec | year=1996 | author=Robert Currier | accessdate=2009-10-24[/tpl]

===TrueMotion RT===

The “real time” version in the series was released in 1996. It was meant for real time capturing and processing of digital video.

===TrueMotion 2===

The second version in this series only supported a 24-bit RGB color space optimized for Windows rendering which orders components as BGR with a FourCC of TM20. Used for Final Fantasy 7 and Star Trek: Klingon.
In 1997, Microsoft Corp. licensed The Duck Corp.'s TrueMotion 2.0 video codec technology to bring TV-quality video to the PC platform.Microsoft Corp. (April 28, 1997) Microsoft Licenses Duck Corp.'s TrueMotion 2.0 To Bring Television-Quality Video to the PC, Retrieved on 2009-08-11

===DK ADPCM Audio 3/4===

There are two obsolete versions for associated ADPCM audio compression.

===TrueMotion VP3/4===

In June 1, 2000 brought version 3.1; August 16, 2000 version 3.2.  The third version in the series switched to using a planar Y'CbCr 4:2:0 color space.
In late 2001, On2 released their VP3(.2) compression technology into the open-source community including their patents on the technology. The technology lives on in the form of Theora.  The Xiph.Org Foundation created its codec Theora as a fork of the codebase of VP3.2.  The forked version added 4:2:2 and 4:4:4 sub sampling for better color quality options.
In April 2001 VP4 was published, which brought only an improved encoder for the same bitstream format.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2010[/tpl]

===TrueMotion VP5/6===

A preview version of VP5 was published on February 21, 2002 with production version being available as of May 1, 2002.On2 (2002-02-21) On2 Releases Preview Version Of VP5, The World's Most Powerful Video Compression Technology, Retrieved on 2009-08-16CNet (2002-02-22) On2: Move over, MPEG-4, Retrieved on 2009-08-16StreamingMedia.com (2002-02-27) On2 Previews VP5, Retrieved on 2009-08-16 The production version of VP5 codec was released in May 2002.On2 (2002-05-01) On2 Technologies Releases Production Version Of VP5 & TrueCast 7.2, Retrieved on 2009-08-16
When the codec was in beta, to preview its quality, On2 created a plug-in for RealPlayer. Lately the final version of the codec was ready. The VP5 codec was limited, when the VP6 came out.
The sixth version like VP3 and VP4 kept the same bitstream as VP5 and added an optional alpha channel to the color space.
In April 2003 AOL has bought broad licensing rights for VP5 and VP6 codecs.CNET News (2003-04-04) AOL licenses On2 video codecs, Retrieved on 2009-08-17 More recently,[tpl]When|date=February 2011[/tpl] On2 licensed its technology to AOL for use in an IP-based video telephony product, to Tencent Holdings of China for use in its instant messaging products, and to Saver Corporation of Japan to enable new Flash 8 mobile video applications.
On May 12, 2003 On2 announced the release of VP6.Press release of On2 on the release of VP6 Revised versions 6.1 and 6.2 followed later that year.
Since October 2003 it may be used free of charge for personal use.
In late 2003, On2 announced that its VP5 and VP6 codecs were selected by Beijing E-World as a video coding method to be used in a Chinese-developed competitor to the DVD format called the EVD (Enhanced Versatile Disc) format. Then in April 2004, On2 announced that its business relationship with E-World had soured, and that On2 would file multiple breach of contract claims against E-World in arbitration proceedings. The arbitrator reached a conclusion on March 10, 2005, according to SEC filings by On2 on March 14, 2005. The arbitrator dismissed each of On2's claims and ruled that E-World owed nothing to On2 and had not breached the contract. It seems unlikely that On2 will ultimately get any significant payback from the EVD initiative, although some contract relationship remains in effect.
A number of less highly visible deals with other customers and partners seem to have worked out more amicably than the Chinese DVD project. Recent announcements have related to deals with Apex Datacom, IWAPI Inc., Vividas, Digital Witness, XM Satellite Radio, PowerLinx, and LeapFrog Enterprises. In particular, the company indicated that it expected to recognize some revenue from the Leapfrog deal in the third quarter of 2005 and also made optimistic statements about the future with XM Satellite Radio.
In 2004, On2's VP6 was selected for use as the Macromedia Flash Video 8 codec. This apparently stems from a deal made in the second quarter of 2004 with revenue in that quarter of $1.4 million for the licensing agreement. In related news, On2 announced on April 5, 2005 that it had acquired the Flix Flash video encoder technology from Wildform, Inc. On2 added support for Flash 8 video output to the Flix 8 product line that they released on September 13, 2005.

===TrueMotion VP7===

The seventh version changed the bitstream from previous versions for better coding efficiency was released in March 2005; since July it may be used free of charge for personal use.
It is a codec with both VFW and DirectShow support that On2 Technologies claims has better compression than leading competitive codecs such as MPEG-4 AVC (H.264) and VC-1.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2009[/tpl]

On March 9, 2005, On2 announced a new codec, VP7. On2 claimed that VP7 is superior to the H.264/AVC standard, based on claims of comparative technical capabilities and licensing costs.
