Project: Funk Da World is the debut studio album by rapper Craig Mack, released September 20, 1994. The album was the second release on Bad Boy Records, following The Notorious B.I.G.'s classic Ready to Die by one week. Propelled by the success of the Platinum-selling smash hit single "Flava In Ya Ear", the album reached Gold sales status on February 22, 1995. "Flava In Ya Ear" also featured a successful remix (not included on the album), featuring guest verses from The Notorious B.I.G., Busta Rhymes, Rampage and LL Cool J. The album's second single, "Get Down", was the rapper's second Top 40 hit in 1994, and achieved Gold sales status in April 1995.
Though moderately successful and acclaimed at the time of its release, the album was overshadowed by the massive success of Ready to Die, and Craig Mack quickly lost public image, releasing only one other album, the commercially unsuccessful Operation: Get Down, in 1997.
