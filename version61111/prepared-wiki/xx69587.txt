==Blue dress controversy==

Good wore a plunging royal blue dress designed by Michael Costello to the June 30, 2013 BET Awards ceremony. The dress caused a controversy on both traditional and social media because Good had recently married Sony Pictures Executive and Seventh-day Adventist pastor Devon Franklin and she was presenting the BET Award for Best Gospel Artist.

===Background===

According to Christine Thomasos of The Christian Post, Good has a history of defending her stylistic choices of presenting herself as a "sexy Christian". She had stated that "there is a classy way to do everything and there is nothing wrong with being sexy or having sex appeal and I think that I am definitely going to be someone who is boldly going to go out to the masses and be someone who say, ' Look! Women its okay'..." during a speaking engagement earlier in the year. Good and Franklin had wed on June 16, 2012 at Triunfo Creek Winery in Malibu, California.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20604812,00.html|title=Meagan Good Weds In Malibu|accessdate=2013-07-13|date=2012-06-17|work=People|author=Herndon, Jessica[/tpl] During their courtship and engagement periods the couple claims to have observed chastity. Good presented the 2013 BET Award for Best Gospel Artist with Lala Anthony.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fashionnstyle.com/articles/8617/20130701/meagan-good-bet-awards-2013-photos-twitter-explodes-hot-plunging-cleavage-baring-style-deception-star-turns-heads-celebrates-wedding-anniversary-instagram.htm|title=Meagan Good BET Awards 2013: PHOTOS Twitter Explodes With Hot, Plunging, Cleavage-Baring Style, 'Deception' Star Turns Heads, Celebrates Wedding Anniversary on Instagram|accessdate=2013-07-14|date=2013-07-01|work=Fashion & Style|author=Durham, Jessica[/tpl]

===Design===

The royal blue dress was designed by Michael Costello. It had a  neckline that plunged to her midriff and a front slit that rose to her mid thigh.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/01/meagan-good-cleavage-baring-gown-2013-bet-awards-_n_3528375.html|title=Meagan Good Cleavage-Baring, Low-Cut Gown Stuns At The 2013 BET Awards (PHOTOS)|accessdate=2013-07-14|date=2013-07-02|work=The Huffington Post|author=Wilson, Julee[/tpl] Rachel Levy of the British Daily Mail said that the dress "hugged Meagan's curves, ruching from her waist down." She also stated that Good accentuated her cleavage by going braless with the "skintight, long-sleeved" dress and presented athletic legs via the front slit in silver peep-toe pumps along with "dangling silver earrings". Good matched her sparkly silver heels with a silver clutch and dark lipstick, but few distracting accessories.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/megan-good-dress-actress-pulls-jennifer-lopez-plunging-blue-gown-2013-bet-awards-photo-1329421|title=Megan Good Dress: Actress Pulls A Jennifer Lopez In Plunging Blue Gown At 2013 BET Awards PHOTO|accessdate=2013-07-14|date=2013-07-01|author=Amethyst Tate|work=International Business Times[/tpl] According to Fashion & Style journalist Jessica Durham, "the hemline extended behind her into a sweeping train".

===Reception===

Los Angeles Times journalist Greg Braxton sarcastically queried whether a new social rule should be put in place: "Should there be another commandment: 'Thou shall not wear skin-bearing dresses when presenting religious awards?'" His column was one of many that questioned the propriety of a cleavage bearing dress given her role as a presenter of a gospel award.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-megan-good-dress-bet-awards-20130701,0,7118857.story|title=Meagan Good presents BET gospel award in a dress cut to her navel|accessdate=2013-07-13|date=2013-07-01|work=Los Angeles Times|author=Braxton, Greg[/tpl]
Julee Wilson of The Huffington Post noted that Good "stole the show" at the BET Awards but described the controversy as follows: "the night's holiest honor came with a side of cleavage, which definitely got people talking". Wilson also noted that the wide-ranging public response included a sizeable proportion that wondered how a fashion mishap was avoided, specifically wondering about her use of fashion tape.
Amethyst Tate of International Business Times said that Good "pulled out all the stops", comparing the dress to the Green Versace dress of Jennifer Lopez and describing Good's voluptuous figure.
Levy described the out fit as "raunchy".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2352171/BET-Awards-2013-Meagan-Good-goes-braless-extremely-low-cut-gown-attends-BET-Awards.html|title=Taking the plunge!
