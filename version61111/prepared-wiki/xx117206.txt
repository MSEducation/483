[[Louisiana Almanac]]

CATEGORIES: Almanacs

The Louisiana Almanac is a regularly updated reference work, published by the Gretna, Louisiana based Pelican Publishing Company. New editions are produced typically within a two to four year timespan, although, since the first publication in 1949, the book has been updated from durations between one and six years. The 2006-2007 Edition is the seventeenth version of the almanac. 

==Book synopsis==

The Louisiana Almanac is a mesh of statistical data, historical information, and often obscure trivia relating to the State of Louisiana. Resources are provided in the following categories: general information, tourism, weather and climate, geography, population, sports, history, government, agriculture, economy, health, and transportation. Although often placed where relevant, maps, charts, and graphs are often printed poorly and can be difficult to interpret.

===Chapters===

The current edition (2006-2007) is divided into thirty-one chapters (excluding a foreword, index and list of acknowledgments) and totals 757 pages.
