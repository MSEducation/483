CATEGORIES: Cities and towns in Kottayam district

Neendoor is a very small town in the Kottayam district in Kerala, India. The town is located 8 km south of Kottayam town, and is bordered by the towns of Kaipuzha, Athirampuzha, Kallara, Manjoor, Vechoor, and Onamthuruthu.

==Geography==

Neendoor is situated at [tpl]coord|8|40|42|N|76|30|20|E|[/tpl].
Needoor is on the northern border of "Kuttanadu," 16 km from Kottayam and 5 km from Ettumanoor. In old days, say up until early 1990s, the "punchapadam" (rice fields) gave a distinct Kuttandu look for Neendoor. The greenery is still there, what are missing are rice fields and farming. The income comes now mostly from non-farming.

==Economy==

In terms of pure currency in-flow, money sent by ex-pats play a huge role (Middle East, USA, UK, Australia etc.) . Rubber is Neendoor's major cash crop. Up until the late 1970s, rice was a major cash crop as well. However, in the last several decades, the local economy has increasingly been bolstered by cash sent by Indian expatriates living in the Middle East, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. This foreign support has contributed to the town's development in recent years - for example, with a large mansion replacing the existing small houses. For whatever reason, many expatriates who worked out of state or out of country all their working life come back to Neendoor at retirement and prefer to build a house in the already crowded neighborhood.

==People==

Nearly 100% of the young adults will graduate from high school and a big majority will get some college education or a degree. Although English rarely spoken, most college level students understand and write excellent English. Neendoor's has been home to several well-known individuals.
The population of Neendoor is primarily of Hindus and Knanaya Catholics.The famous lord Muruga temple Neendoor Subrahmanya Swami Temple is located in this place.  The patron saint of the area is St. Michael, after whom the local parish church is named. With the increase in automobile population, gone are the days of quite streets and all people walking to church for Sunday masses. A significant percentage of Neendoor's residents of Kna heritage has migrated to the US, Australia and the UK in the last few decades. With the privatization of professional colleges many and attending engineering and other technical schools lately. One of the recent trent seen among the younger generation is to get into a medical career (such as nursing, or X-ray technician) and to find a job abroad.
What used be scenic rice fields now gave way to more and more developments and home building. In fact paddy farming is rare these days in Neendoor. Or, for that matter, revenue from farming is nearly non-existent.
