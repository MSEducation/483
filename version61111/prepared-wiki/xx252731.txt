==History==

Line 19 was opened as a tramway line in 1930. The line started at Slussen and crossed over the island of Södermalm on existing tramway tracks to Johanneshov from where a new built part continued south towards Stureby and terminated at Örby. In 1933, a tunnel was constructed from Slussen to Skanstull, and operations of line 19, along with tramway line 8, was transferred into the tunnel. This was the first "tunnelbana" (underground railway) in Stockholm, even if it did not have the modern metro standard which is now connected with the term.
In 1950 the line from Slussen to Johanneshov (now Gullmarsplan) was converted from tramway to metro standard. The part of line 19 south of Johanneshov was still serviced by trams until it also was converted in 1951. The new metro line diverted from the original at Stureby and continued to Bandhagen and Högdalen. The stations at the old line, Juliaborg and Örby, were closed, and those areas are since then serviced by busses. In 1957, the line was connected at Slussen to the northern Metro and has since then had its northern terminus at various stations on the line. Southward, the line was extended to Rågsved in 1959 and finally to Hagsätra in 1960.
