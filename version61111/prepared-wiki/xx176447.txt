==Music video==

A video for "A Little Too Late," directed by Michael Salomon, premiered on May 11, 2006. It has aired on CMT and Great American Country.
At the beginning of the video, a middle-aged man (Keith) appears at the doorway of a basement stairwell with a shovel, announces that he's home and begins playing a vinyl record of the song. He then approaches his ex-girlfriend (Krista Allen), who has been tied to a chair in the basement. After mocking her, he begins mixing cement in a trough and removes a tarp over a pallet of bricks. The man's intent is to seal his girlfriend inside and leave her for dead; indeed, the woman's fear and apprehension grows as the man completes his work. However, Keith fails to notice he is actually bricking himself inside; this does not become evident until the end of the song. Keith, who continues to mock his girlfriend after he places the last brick, suddenly realizes his predicament. At the end, the young woman frees herself and walks out of the basement; Keith, meanwhile, tries to apologize to her and meekly calls for help.
