Bemotrizinol (INNhttp://whqlibdoc.who.int/druginfo/18_4_2004_INN92.pdfhttp://whqlibdoc.who.int/druginfo/INN_2005_list54.pdf/USAN,http://www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/365/bemotrizinol.doc INCI bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine) is an oil-soluble organic compound that is added to sunscreens to absorb UV rays. It is marketed as Tinosorb S by BASF and as Escalol S by Ashland Inc. A recent development is Tinosorb S Aqua, which is bemotrizinol in a PMMA matrix dispersed in water. This makes it possible to add bemotrizinol to the water phase.Tinosorb S Aqua infohttp://www.basf-chemtrade.de/images/stories/broschueren/PCI/100413_tinosorb_s_aqua.pdf
Bemotrizinol is a broad-spectrum UV absorber, absorbing UVB as well as UVA rays. It has two absorption peaks, 310 and 340 nm. It is highly photostable. Even after 50 MEDs (minimal erythemal doses), 98.4% remains intact. It helps prevent the  photodegradation of other sunscreen actives like avobenzone.
Bemotrizinol has strong synergistic effects on the SPF when formulated with bisoctrizole, ethylhexyl triazone or iscotrizinol.http://www.ciba.com/tinosorb-s_brochure.pdf It is the most effective UV absorber available measured by SPF, based on the maximum concentration permitted by European legislation.
Bemotrizinol is not approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, but is approved in the European Union since the year 2000.SpringerLink - Journal Article and other parts of the world, including Australia.NEW-WAVE SUNSCREENS: Active ingredient makers are frustrated by the long list of sunscreens and UV-A testing protocols that are still awaiting FDA decisions, Chemical & Engineering News, April 11, 2005, Volume 83, Number 15, pp. 18–22.

Unlike some other organic sunscreen actives, it shows no estrogenic effects in vitro.[tpl]cite journal| title=Lack of binding to isolated estrogen or androgen receptors, and inactivity in the immature rat uterotrophic assay, of the ultraviolet sunscreen filters Tinosorb M-active and Tinosorb S|date=December 2001| pmid=11754532| author=Ashby J, Tinwell H, Plautz J, Twomey K, Lefevre PA| journal= Regul Toxicol Pharmacol| volume=34 | pages=287–91| doi=10.1006/rtph.2001.1511| issue=3[/tpl]
