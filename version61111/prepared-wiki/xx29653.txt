</ref> However, the Liberal attacks against Day as a right-wing fanatic affected the voters more than did wariness with Chrétien. The climax of the Liberal effort to paint the Canadian Alliance as a gang of far-right wing extremists came on 16 November 2000 when the Liberal MP [[Elinor Caplan]] gave a much publicised speech, in she declared about the rank and file of the Canadian Alliance: "Their supporters are Holocaust deniers, prominent bigots and racists".<ref name="ReferenceB"/> Leading a certain degree of creditability to the Grit claim that the Alliance was a party of racists was a speech on 18 November 2000 by the Alliance candidate [[Betty Granger]] in Winnipeg where she ominously warned that Canada was faced with the threat of an “Asian invasion”, by which Granger meant that Canada was accepting too many Asian immigrants for its own good.<ref name="Harrison, Trevor page 84">Harrison, Trevor ''Requiem for a Lightweight'', Montreal: Black Rose Books, 2002 page 84.</ref> Through Day promptly apologised, forced Granger to suspend her candidacy and insisted that the Alliance was opposed to racism, the damage had been done, and the Liberals made extensive use of the “Asian invasion” speech to suggest to Canadians, especially [[Asian Canadian|Asian-Canadians]] that the Alliance was a haven of white supremacists’.<ref name="Harrison, Trevor page 84"/> On 22 November 2000, Chrétien gave a speech in New Brunswick which in which he implied that people from Alberta were not quite normal, saying: "I like to do politics with people from the East. Joe Clark and Stockwell Day are from Alberta. They are a different type".<ref>Hebert, Chantal ''French Kiss: Stephen Harper's Blind Date with Quebec'', Toronto: Random House, 2011 page 168.</ref><ref>Harrison, Trevor ''Requiem for a Lightweight'', Montreal: Black Rose Books, 2002 page 85</ref><ref>Johnson, William ''Stephen Harper and the Future of Canada''  Toronto: Douglas Gibson Books, 2006 page 283</ref>
In November 2000 in the middle of the election, the Grand-Mere Affair, also known as the Shawinigate scandal broke. After initial denials, Chrétien acknowledged having lobbied the Business Development Bank of Canada, owned by the Government of Canada, to grant a $2 million loan to Yvon Duhaime. Duhaime was a friend and constituent to whom the Prime Minister stated that he had sold his interest in the Grand-Mère Inn, a local Shawinigan-area hotel and golf resort, eventually providing evidence of the sale - a contract written on a cocktail napkin. Duhaime was a local businessman with an unsavoury reputation and a criminal record, who received a loan from the Business Development Bank that he was ineligible to collect on the account of his criminal record (Duhaime did not mention his record when applying for the loan).Martin, Lawrence Iron Man, Tornoto: Viking, 2003 pages 222-223. The Business Development Bank had turned down the initial loan application, but later approved a $615,000 loan following further lobbying by Chrétien. When the Business Development Bank refused to extent the loan in August 1999 under the grounds that Duhaime was a businessman with a bad reputation and with a history for losing money on past business ventures and that he was already behind on his current payments, the president of the bank François Beaudoin was fired by Chrétien in September 1999, which led to a wrongful dismissal suite that Beaudoin was to win in 2004.[ref]
</ref> It was revealed that Chrétien had never been paid for his share in the sale of the adjoining golf course, and criminal charges were laid against Duhaime. The Prime Minister's ethics counselor Howard Wilson, who was appointed by and reported to the Prime Minister,<ref>[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/cdngovernment/ethics.html |title=CBC News Indepth: Canadian Government |publisher=Cbc.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-04-20 |deadurl=yes[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2014|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl]</ref> determined that Prime Minister Chrétien had not violated any conflict-of-interest rules, noting that there were no clear rules on lobbying Crown corporations for making loans to business ventures that the Prime Minister may or may not had a stake in. There was no comment on ethics of Chrétien's lobbying by the ethics counselor Wilson. The revelation of the Grand-Mere affair did not affect the outcome of the 2000 election. Chrétien and his circle believed that the breaking of the Grand-Mere story in the middle of the election was the work of the Martin fraction.<ref>Martin, Lawrence ''Iron Man'', Tornto: Viking, 2003 page 297.</ref>
Day turned in a generally weak performance during the campaign that did little to allay media concerns about his socially-conservative views. A particular campaign stunt that attracted much attention occurred, when Warren Kinsella, often known as Chrétien's "attack dog", went on the Canada A.M TV show with a stuffed Barney dinosaur doll to mock's Day's purported belief that dinosaurs and humans once co-existed, saying that "I just want to remain Mr. Day that The Flintstones was not a documentary. And this is the only dinosaur that recently co-existed with humans" while holding up the Barney doll.Martin, Lawrence Iron Man, Tornto: Viking, 2003 page 299.Kinsella, Warren The War Room: Political Strategies for Business, NGOs, and Anyone who Wants to Win, Toronto: Dundurn, 2007 page 143. Kinsella had gotten the idea for the Barney stunt after a meeting with Chrétien's close associate Jean Carle to discuss a documentary about Day where several people claimed that Day had given a speech in 1997 where he was alleged to have stated his belief that humans and dinosaurs had co-existed.Kinsella, Warren The War Room: Political Strategies for Business, NGOs, and Anyone who Wants to Win, Toronto: Dundurn, 2007 page 141. According to Kinsella, Chrétien phoned him to congratulate him on the Barney stunt, and found it so funny that he asked Kinsella to repeat his retelling of the "Barney moment" several times.Kinsella, Warren The War Room: Political Strategies for Business, NGOs, and Anyone who Wants to Win, Toronto: Dundurn, 2007 page 144. The New Democrats and Bloc Québécois also ran lacklustre campaigns, while the Progressive Conservatives, led by former Prime Minister Joe Clark, struggled to retain official party status. The relentless Grit attacks meant to demonize the Alliance as a gang of crazed right-wingers with a "hidden agenda" had the effect of causing many New Democratic voters to support the Liberals as the best party to stop the Alliance. The Liberals secured a strong majority mandate in the 2000 election, winning nearly as many seats as they had in 1993, largely thanks to significant gains in Quebec and in Atlantic Canada. Without Jean Charest as leader, the Tories who had done well in winning the popular vote in Quebec in 1997 fared poorly in 2000, and most of their voters defected over to the Liberals.Dornan, Christopher & Pammett, Jon H. The Canadian general election of 2000, Toronto: Dundurn Press, 2001 page 21. Many voters in English Canada expressed the view that they had voted Liberal less of affection for the "natural governing party" than because the alternative in the form of Day was so much more worse.Martin, Lawrence Iron Man, Tornto: Viking, 2003 pages 299-300. The fact that Martin attracted more enthusiasm from the public on the campaign trail than did Chrétien was much noticed within the Liberal Party.

===Third parliament as prime minister===

Reflecting the non-activist nature of his government, Chrétien's major policy initiative in the first half of 2001 was increasing the pay of MPs by 20%.Martin, Lawrence Iron Man, Toronto: Viking 2003 page 326 As a result, the pay of MPs went from $109,000 per year to $131,000 per year while Chrétien's own salary went from $184,000 per year to $262,000 per year. Chrétien was due to face a leadership review in February 2002, but the Liberal national executive, which was controlled by partisans of Paul Martin, agreed to Chrétien's request in early January 2001 that the leadership review be pushed back to February 2003. In agreeing to this request, Martin believed that this was the pro quid quo for allowing Chrétien a decent interval to retire with dignity sometime in 2002, an interpretation that Chrétien did not hold.
In what Chrétien saw as a personal triumph, on 11 January 2001, Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard resigned, saying he did not foresee the necessary "winning conditions" for another referendum emerging at that time.Martin, Lawrence Iron Man, Toronto: Viking, 2003 page 305. Chrétien argued that the Clarity Act had prevented the "winning conditions" from appearing, and maintained that if the charismatic Bouchard could not create the necessary "winning conditions", then his more dour successor Bernard Landry would certainly not.Martin, Lawrence Iron Man, Toronto: Viking, 2003 pages 305–306. Chrétien took the view that effectively the Quebec sovereignty movement had been neutered by the Clarity Act, and that it did not matter if the PQ remained in office or not because they could not win a referendum.Martin, Lawrence Iron Man, Toronto: Viking, 2003 page 306. By contrast, the Martinista fraction of the Liberals argued that the decline of the PQ was due more to an improving economy—which they credited Paul Martin for—rather than with the Clarity Act and "Plan B", which they saw as pointlessly aggressive towards Quebec.Martin, Lawrence Iron Man, Toronto: Viking, 2003 pages 306–307.
In early 2001, politics were dominated by questions about the Grand-Mere Affair. Both the Canadian Alliance and the Progressive Conservatives frequently charged that Chrétien had broken the law in regards to his lobbying for Business Development Bank for loans to the Auberge Grand-Mère inn.[ref]
