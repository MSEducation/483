==Cast==

==Production==

The film is based on Gabrielle Lord's novel of the same name, which was loosely based on the 1972 Faraday School Kidnapping.
At one stage it was thought the novel would be filmed by Murdoch and Stigwood's R & R Films as a follow up to Gallipoli (1981). However this never eventuated."Production Blues", Cinema Papers, Oct-Nov 1980 p312
The film rights were purchased by Crawfords Productions who intended to make a feature film for local release and a tele movie for HBO in the US. Half the budget was from HBO who insisted the lead be played by an actress who was familiar to the American public.
Everett De Roche wrote the script and originally Bruce Beresford was announced as director. He dropped out and then Arch Nicholson was hired. Crawfords and HBO wanted Bess Armstrong to play the lead. Actors Equity objected, so Sigrid Thornton was accepted as a compromise. However two months prior to shooting Thornton fell pregnant and HBO and Crawfords insisted on Armstrong. Actors Equity would not relent and the film shut down, despite the fact $700,000 had already been spent.Hector Crawford, "The Rules of the Game", Cinema Papers, September 1985 p20-22 The project was later re activated when Rachel Ward (a British actress who had moved to Australia) was approved.David Stratton, The Avocado Plantation: Boom and Bust in the Australian Film Industry, Pan MacMillan, 1990 p266-268
The movie was shot in Australia during 1985 over 12 5-day weeks at Bairnsdale near the Gippsland Coast and in the Grampians. It contains scenes of graphic violence unusual for TV productions of the time.

==Release==

The film was initially released directly to cable television by the HBO channel in the United States in late 1985. It was released to cinemas in Australia a year later during 1986.

==Awards==

It won the American Cinema Editors for direction of Photography in 1986.
