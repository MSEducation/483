===Final performances, illness and death===

As 1953 began, Ferrier was busy rehearsing for Orpheus, an English-language version of Orfeo ed Euridice to be staged in four performances at the Royal Opera House in February. Barbirolli had instigated this project, with Ferrier's enthusiastic approval, some months previously.Leonard, pp. 216 and 228 Her only other engagement in January was a BBC recital recording, in which she sang works by three living English composers: Howard Ferguson, William Wordsworth and Edmund Rubbra.Campion, pp. 100–01 During her regular hospital treatment she discussed with doctors the advisability of an oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries), but on learning that the impact on her cancer would probably be insignificant and that her voice might be badly affected, she chose not to have the operation.[tpl]Cite journal|last=Baum|first=Michael et al.|title=Adjuvant Treatment with Tamoxifen|journal=British Medical Journal|volume=312|issue=7037|pages=1036–37|date=20 April 1996|jstor=29731404|doi=10.1136/bmj.312.7037.1036|last2=Cuzick|first2=J.[/tpl][tpl]subscription[/tpl]Leonard, pp. 229–30
The first Orpheus performance, on 3 February, was greeted with unanimous critical approval. According to Barbirolli, Ferrier was particularly pleased with one critic's comment that her movements were as graceful as any of those of the dancers on stage.Barbirolli, p. 107 However, she was physically weakened from her prolonged radiation treatment; during the second performance, three days later, her left femur partially disintegrated. Quick action by other cast members, who moved to support her, kept the audience in ignorance. Although virtually immobilised, Ferrier sang her remaining arias and took her curtain calls before being transferred to hospital.Fifield (ed.), pp. 183–84 This proved to be her final public appearance; the two remaining performances, at first rescheduled for April, were eventually cancelled.Leonard, pp. 231–34 Still the general public remained unaware of the nature of Ferrier's incapacity; an announcement in The Guardian stated: "Miss Ferrier is suffering from a strain resulting from arthritis which requires immediate further treatment. It has been caused by the physical stress involved in rehearsal and performance of her role in Orpheus".[tpl]cite news|title= Miss Kathleen Ferrier Suffering From Strain|newspaper=The Guardian|page=5|date=10 February 1953[/tpl]
Ferrier spent two months in University College Hospital. As a result she missed her CBE investiture; the ribbon was brought to her at the hospital by a friend.Leonard, p. 234 Meanwhile her sister found her a ground-floor apartment in St John's Wood, since she would no longer be able to negotiate the many stairs at Frognal Mansions.Leonard, pp. 235–36 She moved to her new home in early April, but after only seven weeks was forced to return to hospital where, despite two further operations, her condition continued to deteriorate.Leonard, pp. 241–45 Early in June she heard that she had been awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society, the first female vocalist to receive this honour since Muriel Foster in 1914.Fifield (ed.), p. 185 In a letter to the secretary of the Society she wrote of this "unbelievable, wondrous news which has done more than anything to make me feel so much better".Fifield (ed.), p. 192 This letter, dated 9 June, is probably the last that Ferrier signed herself. [tpl]#tag:ref|Winifred Ferrier says of this letter: "Kathleen dictated her reply and signed it herself".Ferrier, p. 179 All subsequently dated letters in Fifield's Letters and Diaries are written and signed by Bernadine Hammond, Ferrier's assistant.Fifield (ed.), pp. 192–93 and 199–200|group= n[/tpl] As she weakened she saw only her sister and a few very close friends, and, although there were short periods of respite, her decline was unremitting.
Kathleen Ferrier died at University College Hospital on 8 October 1953, aged 41; the date for which, while still hopeful of recovery, she had undertaken to sing Frederick Delius's A Mass of Life at the 1953 Leeds Festival.Fifield (ed.), p. 305 She was cremated a few days later, at Golders Green Crematorium, after a short private service.Leonard, pp. 246–51 She left an estate worth £15,134, which her biographer Maurice Leonard observes was "not a fortune for a world-famous singer, even by the standards of the day".Leonard, p. 248[tpl]#tag:ref|According to Measuringworth.com, £15,134 in 1953 equates to £329,000 in 2010 using the Retail Price Index, or £909,000 using average earnings.[tpl]cite web|title=Five Ways to Compute the Relative Value of a UK Pound Amount, 1830 to Present|url= http://www.measuringworth.com/ukcompare/|publisher= MeasuringWorth|accessdate=25 June 2011[/tpl]|group=n[/tpl]

==Assessment and legacy==

The news of Ferrier's death came as a considerable shock to the public. Although some in musical circles knew or suspected the truth, the myth had been preserved that her absence from the concert scene was temporary.[tpl]#tag:ref|On 23 May 1953 a local newspaper, the West Somerset Free Press, apologised to its readers for having, in an earlier report, suggest that Ferrier's career was over. "We are now informed that although Miss Ferrier has been ill her incapacity is purely temporary and will in no way affect her return to professional activity."Leonard, p. 29|group= n[/tpl] The opera critic Rupert Christiansen, writing as the 50th anniversary of Ferrier's death approached, maintained that "no singer in this country has ever been more deeply loved, as much for the person she was as for the voice she uttered". Her death, he continued, "quite literally shattered the euphoria of the Coronation" (which had taken place on 2 June 1953). Ian Jack, editor of Granta, believed that she "may well have been the most celebrated woman in Britain after the Queen."[tpl]cite journal|authorlink= Ian Jack|last= Jack|first= Ian|title= How suffering became a public act|url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/mar/28/jade-goody-public-illness-cancer|journal= The Guardian|date= 28 March 2009|accessdate= 7 June 2011[/tpl] Among the many tributes from her colleagues, that of Bruno Walter has been highlighted by biographers: "The greatest thing in music in my life has been to have known Kathleen Ferrier and Gustav Mahler—in that order".Leonard, p. 246 Very few singers, Lord Harewood writes, "have earned so powerful a valedictory from so senior a colleague". At a memorial service at Southwark Cathedral on 14 November 1953 the Bishop of Croydon, in his eulogy, said of Ferrier's voice: "She seemed to bring into this world a radiance from another world".
From time to time commentators have speculated on the directions Ferrier's career might have taken had she lived. In 1951, while recovering from her mastectomy, she received an offer to sing the part of Brangäne in Wagner's opera Tristan und Isolde at the 1952 Bayreuth Festival. According to Christiansen she would have been "glorious" in the role, and was being equally sought by the Bayreuth management to sing Erda in the Ring cycle.Leonard, pp. 197–98 Christiansen further suggests that, given the changes of style over the past 50 years, Ferrier might have been less successful in the 21st century world: "We dislike low-lying voices, for one thing—contraltos now sound freakish and headmistressy, and even the majority of mezzo-sopranos should more accurately be categorised as almost-sopranos". However, she was "a singer of, and for, her time—a time of grief and weariness, national self-respect and a belief in human nobility". In this context "her artistry stands upright, austere, unfussy, fundamental and sincere".
Shortly after Ferrier's death an appeal was launched by Barbirolli, Walter, Myra Hess and others, to establish a cancer research fund in Ferrier's name. Donations were received from all over the world. To publicise the fund a special concert was given at the Royal Festival Hall on 7 May 1954, at which Barbirolli and Walter shared the conducting duties without payment. Among the items was a rendition of Purcell's When I am laid in earth, which Ferrier had often sung; on this occasion the vocal part was played by a solo cor anglais. The Kathleen Ferrier Cancer Research Fund helped establish the Kathleen Ferrier Chair of Clinical Oncology at University College Hospital, in 1984. [tpl]As of|2012[/tpl], it was continuing to fund oncology research.Kathleen Ferrier fund led way for cancer study Lancashire Telegraph 20 April 2012. Retrieved 9 January 2013.Leonard, pp. 246–49
As the result of a separate appeal, augmented by the sales proceeds of a memoir edited by Neville Cardus, the Kathleen Ferrier Memorial Scholarship Fund was created to encourage young British and Commonwealth singers of either sex. The Fund, which has operated from 1956 under the auspices of the Royal Philharmonic Society, initially provided an annual award covering the cost of a year's study to a single prizewinner.[tpl]cite web|title= About the Fund|url= http://www.ferrierawards.org.uk/main/abouthefund.asp|publisher= The Kathleen Ferrier Memorial Scholarship Fund|accessdate= 7 June 2011[/tpl]Leonard, p. 250 With the advent of additional sponsors, the number and scope of awards has expanded considerably since that time; the list of winners of Ferrier Awards includes many singers of international repute, among them Felicity Palmer, Yvonne Kenny, Lesley Garrett and Bryn Terfel.[tpl]cite web|title= The Kathleen Ferrier Awards: Winners|url= http://www.ferrierawards.org.uk/main/winners.asp|publisher= The Kathleen Ferrier Memorial Scholarship Fund|accessdate= 7 June 2011[/tpl] The Kathleen Ferrier Society, founded in 1993 to promote interest in all aspects of the singer's life and work, has since 1996 awarded annual bursaries to students at Britain's major music colleges.[tpl]cite web|title= Kathleen Ferrier Society Bursary for Young Singers|url= http://www.kathleenferrier.org.uk/index.php/bursary|publisher= The Kathleen Ferrier Society|year= 2010|accessdate= 2 March 2014[/tpl] The Society organised a series of events to commemorate the centenary of Ferrier's birth in 2012.[tpl]cite web|title= 2012 – 100th Anniversary|url= http://www.kathleenferrier.org.uk/index.php/2012-centenary|publisher= The Kathleen Ferrier Society|accessdate= 2 March 2014[/tpl] In February 2012 Ferrier was one of ten prominent Britons honoured by the Royal Mail in the "Britons of Distinction" stamps set.

==Recordings==

Ferrier's discography consists of studio recordings originally made on the Columbia and Decca labels, and recordings taken from live performances which were later issued as discs. In the years since her death, many of her recordings have received multiple reissues on modern media; between 1992 and 1996 Decca issued the Kathleen Ferrier Edition, incorporating much of Ferrier's recorded repertoire, on 10 compact discs.[tpl]cite web|title= Kathleen Ferrier Edition|url= http://www.deccaclassics.com/cat/single?PRODUCT_NR=4756060|publisher= Decca Records|accessdate= 9 June 2011[/tpl] The discographer Paul Campion has drawn attention to numerous works which she performed but did not record, or for which no complete recording has yet surfaced. For example, only one aria from Elgar's Dream of Gerontius, and none of her renderings of 20th-century songs by Holst, Bax, Delius and others were recorded. Only a small part of her St John Passion was captured on disc.Campion, pp. 106–07
Two recordings were especially popular, being bought as records and played regularly as favourites on BBC Radio in shows such as Desert Island Discs, Housewives' Choice and Your Hundred Best Tunes. These were her unaccompanied rendition of the Northumbrian folk tune, "Blow the Wind Southerly", and the aria Che farò ("What is life?") from the opera Orfeo ed Euridice. These were the A-sides of the records and the corresponding B-sides, which also became familiar, were "The Keel Row" and "Art thou troubled?" from Handel's Rodelinda. These records sold in large numbers which rivalled other stars of the time such as Frank Sinatra and Vera Lynn. Today her recordings still sell hundreds of thousands of copies each year.Fifield (ed.), p. 3[tpl]Cite book |title=Leonora's Last Act |author=Roger Parker |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-691-01557-6 |page=168[/tpl][tpl]Cite book |chapter=A voice is a person |title=The Country Formerly Known as Great Britain |author=Ian Jack |publisher=Random House |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-4464-4809-0[/tpl][tpl]Cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/opera/9019989/Kathleen-Ferrier-Consoling-angel-and-the-nations-darling.html |author=Rupert Christiansen |date=17 Jan 2012 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |title=Kathleen Ferrier: Consoling angel and the nation's darling [/tpl]
