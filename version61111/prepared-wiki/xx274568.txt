==Opus==

Brändle photographs and edits posters.Contemporary poster artists (List in Wikipedia) She uses posters as a commodity, in order to create independent art works of its own kind.
"Pola Brändle treats again, the subject of collage and décollage, interpreting it in a new manner. This is the way traditions are formed. She also uses the de-clarifying, the obscuring section, the near view preventing you from getting a grasp of the whole; an aesthetic intimacy bleeding into the uncontrollable poetic. This makes the poster walls which she photographed in twenty six countries, almost look like  classical compositions as in the work of Kurt Schwitters. This is the European way of doing it, a counterposition to American art like that of Robert Rauschenberg, where the classical rules do not apply."
