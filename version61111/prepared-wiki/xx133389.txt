Saint Mary's Catholic Primary School is an historic coeducational Catholic primary school located in Darley Abbey, on the outskirts of Derby, England.

==History==

St Mary’s School has served the catholic community and the wider community of Derby for a very long time.  The school has never been exclusively catholic and has always welcomed pupils from other traditions.   Indeed part of the old school site had been owned by the Church of England.
St Mary’s School’s history began in pre industrial revolution Derby in the aftermath of the Napoleonic wars.  The first school began in 1813/1814 in a quiet back street called Chapel Street, then on the outskirts of the town, associated with a local catholic chapel.  In 1850 Augustin Pugin, who later played a major part in rebuilding the Palace of Westminster, constructed a St Mary’s School, as part of a convent, off Nottingham Road.  This moved to Darley Lane in about 1863 to join an existing school, almost certainly the earlier Chapel Street School, on land donated by the Curzon family.  The school, usually referred to as ‘the old school’ remained in the same site from 1863 to 2002.  It was modernized several times but by the early 1990s it was clear that as a building it had reached the end of its natural life.
In September 2002, thanks to the generosity of the Sisters of Mercy, the school moved onto its present green field site.  The splendid new building on land formerly owned by the Sisters was opened in September 2002. It is one of the most exciting, innovative and modern schools in the country.
