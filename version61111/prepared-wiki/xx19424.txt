[[Grimm's law]]

Grimm's law (also known as the First Germanic Sound Shift or the Rask's rule), named after Jacob Grimm, is a set of statements describing the inherited Proto-Indo-European (PIE) stop consonants as they developed in Proto-Germanic (the common ancestor of the Germanic branch of the Indo-European family) in the 1st millennium BC. It establishes a set of regular correspondences between early Germanic stops and fricatives and the stop consonants of certain other centum Indo-European languages (Grimm used mostly Latin and Greek for illustration).

==History==

Grimm's law was the first non-trivial systematic sound change to be discovered in linguistics; its formulation was a turning point in the development of linguistics, enabling the introduction of a rigorous methodology to historical linguistic research. The correspondence between Latin p and Germanic f was first noted by Friedrich von Schlegel in 1806. In 1818 Rasmus Christian Rask elaborated the set of correspondences to include other Indo-European languages such as Sanskrit and Greek, and the full range of consonants involved.  In 1822 Jacob Grimm, the elder of the Brothers Grimm, in his book Deutsche Grammatik, formulated the law as a general rule (and extended to include standard German).
Grimm himself already noticed that there were many words that had different consonants from what his law predicted. These exceptions defied linguists for a few decades, but eventually received explanation from the Danish linguist Karl Verner, in the form of Verner's law.

==Overview==

Grimm's law consists of three parts which form consecutive phases in the sense of a chain shift.[tpl]cite book |last=Campbell |first=Lyle |title=Historical linguistics | edition=2nd ed. |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge |year=2004 |isbn=0-262-53267-0 |pages=49[/tpl] The phases are usually constructed as follows:
This chain shift can be abstractly represented as:
Here each sound moves one position to the right to take on its new sound value. Note that within Proto-Germanic, the sounds denoted by [tpl]angbr|b[/tpl], [tpl]angbr|d[/tpl], [tpl]angbr|g[/tpl] and [tpl]angbr|gw[/tpl] were stops in some environments and fricatives in others, so [tpl]PIE|bʰ[/tpl] > [tpl]PIE|b[/tpl] should be understood here as [tpl]PIE|bʰ[/tpl] > [tpl]PIE|b/β[/tpl], and likewise for the others. The voiceless fricatives are customarily spelled [tpl]angbr|f[/tpl], [tpl]angbr|þ[/tpl], [tpl]angbr|h[/tpl] and [tpl]angbr|hw[/tpl] in the context of Germanic.
The exact details of the shift are unknown, and it may have progressed in a variety of ways before arriving at the final situation. The three stages listed above show the progression of a "pull chain", in which each change leaves a "gap" in the phonological system that "pulls" other phonemes into it to fill the gap. But it is also conceivable that the shift happened as a push chain, where the changes happened in reverse order, with each change "pushing" the next forward to avoid merging the phonemes.
The steps could also have occurred somewhat differently. Another possible sequence of events could have been:
This sequence would lead to the same end result. This variety of Grimm's law is often suggested in the context of the glottalic theory of Proto-Indo-European, which is followed by a minority of linguists. This theoretical framework assumes that "voiced stops" in PIE were actually voiceless to begin with, so that the second phase did not actually exist as such, or was not actually devoicing but a loss of some other articulatory feature such as glottalization. This alternative sequence also accounts for the phonetics of Verner's law (see below), which are easier to explain within the glottalic theory framework when Grimm's law is formulated in this manner.

==Further changes==

Once Grimm's law had taken place, there was only one type of voiced consonant, with no distinction between voiced stops and voiced fricatives. They eventually became stops at the beginning of a word (for the most part), as well as after a nasal consonants, but fricatives elsewhere. Whether they were plosives or fricatives at first is therefore not clear. The voiced aspirated stops may have first become voiced fricatives, before hardening to stops under certain conditions. But they may also have become stops at first, softening to fricatives in most positions later.
Around the same time as Grimm's law took place, another change occurred known as Verner's law. Verner's law caused the voicing of the voiceless fricatives that resulted from Grimm's law under some conditions, creating apparent exceptions to the rule. For example:
Here, the same sound *t appears as *þ in one word (following Grimm's law), but as *d in another (apparently violating Grimm's law). See the Verner's law article for a more detailed explanation of this discrepancy.
The early Germanic *gw that had arisen from Proto-Indo-European [tpl]PIE|*gʷʰ[/tpl] (and from [tpl]IPA|*kʷ[/tpl] through Verner's law) underwent further changes of various sorts:
Perhaps the usual reflex was *b (as suggested by the connection of bid 
==Examples==

Further changes following Grimm's law, as well as sound changes in other Indo-European languages, can sometimes obscure its effects. The most illustrative examples are used here.
This is strikingly regular.  Each phase involves one single change which applies equally to the labials ([tpl]PIE|p, b, bʰ, f[/tpl]) and their equivalent dentals ([tpl]PIE|t, d, dʰ, þ[/tpl]), velars ([tpl]PIE|k, g, gʰ, h[/tpl]) and rounded velars ([tpl]PIE|kʷ, gʷ, gʷʰ, hʷ[/tpl]).  The first phase left the phoneme repertoire of the language without voiceless stops, the second phase filled this gap but created a new one, and so on until the chain had run its course.

==Behaviour in consonant clusters==

When two obstruents occurred in a pair, the first underwent Grimm's law if possible, while the second did not. If either of the two was voiceless, the whole cluster was devoiced, and the first obstruent also lost its labialisation, if it was present.
Most examples of this occurred with obstruents preceded by *s (resulting in *sp, *st, *sk, *skʷ), or obstruents followed by *t (giving *ft, *ht). The latter change was frequent in suffixes, and became a phonotactic restriction known as the Germanic spirant law. This rule remained productive throughout the Proto-Germanic period. The cluster *tt became *ss, but this was often restored to *st later on.
Examples with preceding *s:
Examples with following *t:

==Correspondences to PIE==

The Germanic "sound laws", combined with regular changes reconstructed for other Indo-European languages, allow one to define the expected sound correspondences between different branches of the family. For example, Germanic (word-initial) *b- corresponds regularly to Latin *f-, Greek [tpl]PIE|pʰ-[/tpl], Sanskrit [tpl]PIE|bʰ-[/tpl], Slavic, Baltic or Celtic b-, etc., while Germanic *f- corresponds to Latin, Greek, Sanskrit, Slavic and Baltic p- and to zero (no initial consonant) in Celtic. The former set goes back to PIE *[tpl]PIE|bʰ-[/tpl] (faithfully reflected in Sanskrit and modified in various ways elsewhere), and the latter set to PIE *p- (shifted in Germanic, lost in Celtic, but preserved in the other groups mentioned here).
