==Background==

===Protests on the Goldfields: 1851–1854===

Hiscock's gold rush began on 12 August 1851 following the publication in the Geelong Advertiser of Thomas Hiscock's gold findings at Hiscock's, 3 kilometres west of Buninyong (now Magpie approximately 10 kilometres south of Eureka).  Just days later on 16 August 1851, Lieutenant-Governor Latrobe proclaimed in the Government Gazette crown rights for all mining proceeds and a licence fee of 30 shillings per month effective from 1 September 1851.Charles La Trobe, Victoria’s Separation & Gold Tax – ‘turning a wild colonial country into a civilised one' Roy Morgan Research
On 26 August, a rally of 40-50 miners opposing the fee was held at Hiscock's gully – the first of many such protests in the colony.GOLD. Pg 2. The Argus. 30 August 1851 The miners opposed government policies of oppression including the licence fee as well as demanded rights to vote and to buy land. This first meeting was followed by dissent across the colony's mining settlements.
In December the government announced that it intended to triple the licence fee from £1 to £3 a month, from 1 January 1852.pg. 24. Bate, Weston. Lucky City This move incited protests around the colony, including the Forest Creek Monster Meeting of December 1851. In Ballarat, historian Weston Bate noted that diggers became so agitated that they began to gather arms. The government hastily repealed its plans due to the reaction.
Nevertheless, the oppressive licence hunts continued and increased in frequency causing general dissent among the diggers. In addition, Weston Bate noted that the Ballarat diggings were in strong opposition to the strict liquor licensing laws imposed by the government.
Changes to the Goldfields Act in 1853 allowed licence allowing searches to occur at any time which further incensed the diggers. In Bendigo in 1853, an Anti-Gold Licence Association was formed and the miners were apparently on the brink of an armed clash with authorities. Again in 1854, Bendigo miners responded to an increase in the frequency of twice weekly licence hunts with threats of armed rebellion.pg. 55. Bate, Weston. Lucky City
The Ballarat diggings, according to historian Weston Bate, was relatively speaking one of the more civilised mining settlements.  However a number of events of perceived injustice in 1854 agitated the miners at Eureka toward a bloody rebellion.

===Murder of James Scobie and the burning of Bentley's Hotel===

On 6 October 1854, Scottish miner James Scobie was murdered at the Eureka hotel.Murder of James Scobie[tpl]dead link|date=November 2011[/tpl] Ten days later, on 17 October 1854, between 1,000 and 10,000 miners gathered at the hotel to protest the acquittal of James Bentley, the hotel proprietor and prime suspect in Scobie's murder, by a corrupt magistrate.
The miners rioted and Bentley and his wife Catherine fled for their lives as the hotel was burnt down by the angry mob.  A small group of soldiers was unable to suppress the riot.

===Further unrest===

On 22 October 1854, Ballarat Catholics met to protest the treatment of Father Smyth.
The next day, the arrests of miners McIntyre and Fletcher for the Eureka Hotel fire provoked a mass meeting which attracted 4,000 miners. The meeting resolved to establish a 'Digger's Rights Society', to protect their rights. On 1 November 1854, 3,000 miners met once again at Bakery Hill. They were addressed by Thomas Kennedy, Henry Holyoake, George Black and Henry Ross. The diggers were further angered by the arrest of another seven of their number for the Eureka Hotel fire.

===Ballarat Reform League===

On Saturday, 11 November 1854 a crowd estimated at more than 10,000 miners gathered at Bakery Hill, directly opposite the government encampment. At this meeting, the Ballarat Reform League was created, under the chairmanship of Chartist John Basson Humffray. Several other Reform League leaders, including Kennedy and Holyoake, had been involved with the Chartist movement in England. Many of the miners had past involvement in the Chartist movement and the social upheavals in Britain, Ireland, and continental Europe during the 1840s.
In setting its goals, the Ballarat Reform League used the British Chartist movement's principles. The meeting passed a resolution "that it is the inalienable right of every citizen to have a voice in making the laws he is called on to obey, that taxation without representation is tyranny". The meeting also resolved to secede from the United Kingdom if the situation did not improve.[tpl]cite web| last = MacDougal | first = Ian | year = 2006 | url = http://webdiary.com.au/cms/?q=node/1711 | title = 29 November and the Birth of Australian Democracy | publisher = Webdiary | accessdate =17 January 2007[/tpl]
Throughout the following weeks, the League sought to negotiate with Commissioner Robert Rede and Governor of Victoria, Sir Charles Hotham, both on the specific matters relating to Bentley and the Scobie's death, and the men being tried for the burning of the Eureka Hotel, and on the broader issues of abolition of the licence, suffrage and democratic representation of the gold fields, and disbanding of the Gold Commission.  Governor Hotham, on 16 November 1854, appointed a Royal Commission on goldfields problems and grievances.  However, Commissioner Rede, rather than hear miner's grievances, increased the police presence in the gold fields and summoned reinforcements from Melbourne.  Many historians (most notably Manning Clark) attribute this to his belief in his right to exert authority over the "rabble."
On 28 November 1854, the reinforcements marching from Melbourne were attacked by a crowd of miners. A number were injured and a drummer boy was allegedly killed. The rumour of the drummer boy's death was perpetuated, even with a memorial erected to him in Ballarat Cemetery for many years, although historical research has shown that the boy, John Egan, continued military service until dying in 1860.Drummer Boy John Egan (Regiment No. 3059) Eureka's first Military Casualty. Retrieved 29 November 2006.
At a meeting of about 12,000 'diggers' on the following day, (29 November), the Reform League delegation relayed its failure to achieve any success in negotiations with the authorities. The miners resolved on open resistance to the authorities and to burn the hated licences.
Rede responded by ordering police to conduct a licence search on 30 November. Eight defaulters were arrested, and most of the military resources available had to be summoned to extricate the arresting officers from the angry mob that had assembled.[tpl]cite web| year = 2003 | url = http://eureka.imagineering.com.au/documents.htm?id=7300&subpage=1 | title = Rede's account of the Gravel Pits riots and call for Martial Law to be proclaimed | work = Eureka on Trial | publisher = Public record Office of Victoria | accessdate =20 February 2007[/tpl]
This raid prompted a change in the leadership of the Reform League, to people who argued in favour of 'physical force' rather than the 'moral force' championed by Humffray and the old leadership.Reclaiming the Radical Spirit of the Eureka Rebellion in 1854. Retrieved 29 November 2006.

==Battle of the Eureka Stockade==

===Paramilitary mobilisation and swearing allegiance to the Southern Cross===

In the rising tide of anger and resentment amongst the miners, a more militant leader, Peter Lalor, was elected. In swift fashion, a military structure was assembled. Brigades were formed, and captains were appointed. Licences were burned, and on 1 December at Bakery Hill, "The disaffected miners... held a meeting where at the Australian flag of independence was solemnly consecrated and vows proffered for its defence.",Three Despatches From Sir Charles Hotham, Public Record Office, Melbourne, (1981?). with the 'Eureka oath' being sworn by Peter Lalor to the affirmation of his fellow demonstrators, who encamped themselves around the flag to resist further licence hunts and harassment by the authorities: "We swear by the Southern Cross to stand truly by each other and fight to defend our rights and liberties."[tpl]cite web| year = 2003 | url = http://eureka.imagineering.com.au/escalating_tensions.htm#3 | title = Escalating Tensions: The Southern Cross | work = Eureka on Trial | publisher = Public record Office of Victoria | accessdate =20 February 2007[/tpl]
The white and blue Eureka Flag, said to be designed by a Canadian miner, "Captain" Henry Ross, and bearing nothing but the Southern Cross, was then flown for the first (recorded) occasion; according to the Ballarat Times, which first mentioned the flag a week earlier on 24 November 1854, at "about eleven o'clock the 'Southern Cross' was hoisted, and its maiden appearance was a fascinating object to behold." The flag was believed to have been sewn by Anastasia Hayes. Reportedly influenced by earlier designs such as the Australian Federation Flag,http://www.australianflag.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/ANFA-Newsletter-2009-Comp.pdf as a gesture of defiance [tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl], it deliberately excluded the British Union Flag, which is included in the official flag of Australia. The Eureka flag was commonly referred to at the time as the Australian flag, and as the Southern Cross, with The Age variously reporting, on 28 November: "The Australian flag shall triumphantly wave in the sunshine of its own blue and peerless sky, over thousands of Australia's adopted sons";Ballarat Times, cited in The Age, 28 November 1854, p. 5. the day after the battle: "They assembled round the Australian flag, which has now a permanent flag-staff";The Age, 4 December 1854, p. 5. and during the 1855 Eureka trials, that it was sworn that the Eureka flag was also known as the "digger's flag" and also as "the Southern Cross".The Age, 24 February 1855, p. 5

===="Remember Vinegar Hill": Irish dimension factors in dwindling numbers at stockade====

The Argus newspaper of 4 December 1854 reported that the Union Jack "had" to be hoisted underneath the Eureka flag at the stockade, and that both flags were by then in the possession of the foot police.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.slv.vic.gov.au/ergo/eureka_stockade |title=ergo | Research, resources and essay writing |publisher=Slv.vic.gov.au |accessdate=29 November 2011[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=August 2012[/tpl]"The Revolt at Eureka", Pictorial Social Studies, Vol 16, pp. 25 – 27.
Some have questioned whether this sole contemporaneous report of the otherwise unaccounted for Union Jack being present is accurate,M. Clark. Sources of Australian History, Oxford University Press, Melbourne, 1966, pp. 278,301. with former CEO of the Royal Australian Historical Society, John Vaughan, theorising that the Union Jack in the adjacent government camp may have created an optical illusion, whilst others in defence of this alternative scenario have stressed the investigating journalist may have had eyewitness reports of the two flags having being seized available, and that it was possibly an 11th hour response to the divided loyalties among the heterogeneous rebel force which was in the process of melting away (at one stage 1,500 of 17,280 men in Ballarat were present, with only 150 taking part in the battle), with Lalor's choice of password for the night of 2 December - Vinegar Hill - Desmond O'Grady.

Asked by one of the subordinate leaders of the revolt for the "night pass", he gave "Vinegar Hill"... Many at Ballaarat, who were disposed before that to resist the military, now quietly withdrew from the movement... when the news circulated that Irish independence had crept into it" (also known as the Castle Hill uprising, Vinegar Hill was the site of an 1804 rebellion by convicts in the colony of New South Wales, involving mainly Irish transportees).

Gregory Black, military historian and author of Eureka Stockade: A Ferocious and Bloody Battle, concedes two flags may have been flown on the day of the battle, as the miners were claiming to be defending their British rights, with a further article in The Argus on 9 December 1854, reporting that Constable Hugh King had found a Union Jack like flag being carried by a prisoner;According to Constable Hugh King's testimony: "...three or four hundred yards a heavy fire from the stockade was opened on the troops and me. When the fire was opened on us we received orders to fire. I saw some of the 40th wounded lying on the ground but I cannot say that it was before the fire on both sides. I think some of the men in the stockade should-they had a flag flying in the stockade; it was a white cross of five stars on a blue ground. - flag was afterwards taken from one of the prisoners like a union jack – we fired and advanced on the stockade, when we jumped over, we were ordered to take all we could prisoners..." http://wiki.prov.vic.gov.au/index.php/Eureka_Stockade:Depositions_VPRS_5527/P_Unit_2,_Item_9 and, according to The Eureka Encyclopedia, Sergeant John McNeil at the time shredded a flag at the Spencer Street Barracks in Melbourne, which was said to be the Eureka flag, but which may well have been a Union Jack.
It is certain that Irish born people were strongly represented at the Eureka Stockade.C.H. Curry, 'The Irish at Eureka', Angus & Robertson, 1954 Eureka historians have discovered that as well as comprising most of the miners inside the stockade at the finish, the area where the defensive position was established was overwhelmingly populated by the Irish to begin with.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/stories/s290806.htm |title=Lateline – 7/5/2001: Historians discuss Eureka legend. Australian Broadcasting Corp |publisher=Abc.net.au |date= |accessdate=2013-06-08[/tpl] Professor Geoffrey Blainey has advanced the view, that the white cross behind the stars on the Eureka flag "really is an Irish cross rather than being a configuration of the Southern Cross".Ibid.

====Departing detachment of Independent Californian Rangers leaves small garrison behind====

During 2 December, the peak rebel force trained in and around the stockade. A further two hundred Americans, the Independent Californian Rangers, under the leadership of James McGill, arrived about 4pm. The Americans were armed with revolvers and Mexican knives and possessed horses. In a fateful decision, McGill decided to take most of the Californian Rangers away from the stockade to intercept rumoured British reinforcements coming from Melbourne. Rede's spies observed these actions. That night many of the miners went back to their own tents after the traditional Saturday night carousing, with the assumption that the Queen's military forces would not be sent to attack on the Sabbath (Sunday). A small contingent of miners remained at the stockade overnight, which the spies reported to Rede.

===Stockade===

The stockade itself was a ramshackle affair[tpl]cite web|last=Benwell|first=Phillip|title=EUREKA|url=http://www.monarchist.org.au/articlesarchive_detail.html?_SKU=12154821304659065&startat=26&index_no=26|publisher=The Australian Monarchist League Inc|accessdate=15 July 2013[/tpl]  which was hastily constructed over the following days from timber and overturned carts. The structure was never meant to be a military stockade or fortress. In the words of Lalor: "it was nothing more than an enclosure to keep our own men together, and was never erected with an eye to military defence". Lalor had already outlined a plan whereby, "if the government forces come to attack us, we should meet them on the Gravel Pits, and if compelled, we should retreat by the heights to the old Canadian Gully, and there we shall make our final stand".[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl]

===Siege of Bakery Hill===

Rede's inaction thus far did not reflect his true intent, and at 3 am on Sunday, 3 December 1854, a party of 276 police and military personnel under the command of Captain John W. Thomas approached the Eureka Stockade and a battle ensued. There is no agreement as to which side fired first, but the battle was fierce, brief, and terribly one-sided. The ramshackle army of miners was hopelessly outclassed by a military regiment and was routed in about 10 minutes. During the height of the battle, Lalor was shot in his left arm, took refuge under some timber and was smuggled out of the stockade and hidden. His arm was later amputated.
Stories tell how women ran forward and threw themselves over the injured to prevent further indiscriminate killing. The Commission of Inquiry would later say that it was "a needless as well as a ruthless sacrifice of human life indiscriminate of innocent or guilty, and after all resistance had disappeared".[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl]
Early in the battle 'Captain' Henry Ross was shot dead.
According to Lalor's report, fourteen miners (mostly Irish) died inside the stockade and an additional eight died later from injuries they sustained. A further dozen were wounded but recovered. Three months after the Eureka Stockade, Peter Lalor wrote: "As the inhuman brutalities practised by the troops are so well known, it is unnecessary for me to repeat them. There were 34 digger casualties of which 22 died. The unusual proportion of the killed to the wounded, is owing to the butchery of the military and troopers after the surrender."Joseph Toscano, The Killing Times Reclaiming the Radical Spirit of the Eureka Rebellion in 1854, (2004) Accessed 20 October 2008
During the battle, trooper John King the police constable, took down the Eureka flag. By 8 am, Captain Charles Pasley, the second in command of the British forces, sickened by the carnage, saved a group of prisoners from being bayoneted and threatened to shoot any police or soldiers who continued with the slaughter. Pasley's valuable assistance was acknowledged in despatches printed and laid before the Victorian Legislative Council.[tpl]DNB|wstitle=Pasley, Charles (1824-1890)[/tpl]
One hundred and fourteen diggers, some wounded, were marched off to the Government camp about two kilometres away, where they were kept in an overcrowded lock-up, before being moved to a more spacious barn on Monday morning.
Of the soldiers and police, six were killed, including Captain Wise. Martial law was imposed, and all armed resistance collapsed. News of the battle spread quickly to Melbourne and other gold field regions, turning a perceived Government military victory in repressing a minor insurrection into a public relations disaster. Thousands of people in Melbourne turned out to condemn the authorities, in defiance of their mayor and some Legislative Councillors, who tried to rally support for the government.The Eureka Stockade : Gateway to Democracy – by Weston Bate (Historian) http://www.ballaratreformleague.org.au/ballarat.htm In Ballarat, only one man responded to the call for special constables, although in Melbourne 1500 were sworn in and armed with batons.Mary Proctor: Convict, Pioneer and Settler By Jeff Atkinson Many people voiced their support for the diggers' requested reforms.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl]
Exact numbers of deaths and injuries and persons are difficult to determine as many miners "fled to the surrounding bush and it is likely a good many more died a lonely death or suffered the agony of their wounds, hidden from the authorities for fear of repercussions." according to Eureka researcher and author Dorothy Wickham. The official register of deaths in the Ballarat District Register shows 27 names associated with the stockade battle at Eureka.Dorothy Wickham, Deaths at Eureka an extract from her book "Deaths at Eureka", 64pp, 1996 ISBN 0-646-30283-3

==Aftermath==

Historian Geoffrey Blainey has commented, "Every government in the world would probably have counter-attacked in the face of the building of the stockade." [tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2010[/tpl] For a few weeks it appeared that the status quo had been restored, and Rede ruled the camps with an iron fist.

===Trials for sedition and high treason===

The first trial relating to the rebellion was a charge of sedition against Henry Seekamp of the Ballarat Times. Seekamp was arrested in his newspaper office on 4 December 1854, for a series of articles that appeared in the Ballarat Times. Many of these articles were written by George Lang, the son of the prominent republican and Presbyterian Minister of Sydney, the Reverend John Dunmore Lang. He was tried and convicted of seditious libel by a Melbourne jury on 23 January 1855 and, after a series of appeals, sentenced to six months imprisonment on 23 March. He was released from prison on 28 June 1855, precisely three months early.
Of the approximately 120 'diggers' detained after the rebellion, thirteen were brought to trial. They were:[tpl]cite web| year = 2003 | url = http://eureka.imagineering.com.au/state_treason_trials.htm | title = The State Trials | work = Eureka on Trial | publisher = Public record Office of Victoria | accessdate =19 February 2007[/tpl]
The first trial started on 22 February 1855, with defendants being brought before the court on charges of high treason. Joseph was one of three Americans arrested at the stockade, with the United States  Consul intervening for the release of the other two Americans. The prosecution was handled by Attorney-General William Stawell representing the Crown[ref]
