==History==

In 2000 was raised the idea of creating a gay and lesbian film award in the frame of San Sebastián Film Festival.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sansebastianfestival.com/in/pagina.php?ap=3&id=1997 |title=AWARD-WINNERS 2010|date=September  2010|publisher=Sansebastian Festival[/tpl]
This idea came up among Gehitu GEHITU (LGBT Association from Bask Country) members, a gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender association from the Basque Country. The goal intended, as it was already happening from 1987 on with the Teddy Award in the Berlinale, was that the prize would help gay-theme movies have more relevance in movies theatres as well as in mass media.
"Krámpack" ("Nico and Dani" in English), from the film director Cesc Gay, was the first film awarded with  Sebastiane Prize."Geisemuá Magazine n.1", San Sebastian, March 2001 The film reflected the sexual awakening of two teenagers, as one comes to terms with his homosexuality and the other with his heterosexuality. The jury of this edition was made up by the writer Luis G. Martin,  film critic Begoña del Teso, Angel Retamar from ZERO magazine, Gehitu members, Patricia García and David Montero."Historia del Palmares del Premio Sebastiane",Gehitu Magazine n.60, San Sebastián, Sep. 2009
The name given to the Award, “Sebastiane”, honoured the film with the same name directed in 1976 by British Derek Jarman. It was his first film, in which he portrayed introspectively the Roman soldier Sebastian, martyr of Christianity, later a Middle Age Saint and  eventually turned into a homoerotic icon.
Saint Sebastian, patron saint of San Sebastián (Donostia), is a root symbol of the city itself,  venue of the Festival, but likewise it is too a symbol the homosexual culture itself. That serves a perfect picture to represent the Sebastiane Prize.

The Prize figurine was designed by Enrique Rojas. It represents the silhouette in metal of the image that traditionally has pictured San Sebastián martyr: a half naked body, which torso is pierced by arrows.
