USS ''Clifton Sprague'' (FFG-16), is an Oliver Hazard Perry-class guided missile frigate of the United States Navy, the tenth ship of that class. She was named for Vice Admiral Clifton A. F. Sprague (1896â€“1955), hero of the Samar action of the Battle of Leyte Gulf, where he received the Navy Cross.  The unclassified citation was in the wardroom until shortly before decommissioning.  Ordered from Bath Iron Works on 27 February 1976 as part of the FY76 program, Clifton Sprague was laid down 30 July 1979, launched 16 February 1980, and commissioned 21 March 1981. She was decommissioned on 2 June 1995 at NAVSTA Mayport, Florida, and was stricken from the US Navy register on 4 September 1997 after being transferred to Turkey.
Clifton Sprague (FFG-16) was the first ship of that name in the US Navy.
