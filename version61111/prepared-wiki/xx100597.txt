First mixed team to take World Championships points, in 2002 and then again in 2003.

Followed in her fathers (Gösta Jeppsson) footsteps with then boyfriend Conny Strandberg as they raced in the final Swedish Championship of 1997 just for the fun of it. They did well and decided to continue.

In 2010, Johanna continued as a sidecarcross passenger and teamed up with Magnus Birgersson from Varberg, after Conny felt unable to continue after the 2009 season.
