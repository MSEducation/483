The New Providence Wharf is a residential development in London's Docklands, at the north end of the Blackwall Tunnel. It was designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.som.com/content.cfm/new_providence_wharf|title=New Providence Wharf Project Page|publisher=SOM.com[/tpl] and is being developed by Ballymore, a property development company.
It consists of a crescent-shaped block along Fairmont Avenue and Yabsley Street, plus two skyscrapers. The Ontario Tower has already been built but the taller Quebec Tower is apparently on hold. Residents can use some of the facilities of the adjacent Radisson Edwardian hotel.
