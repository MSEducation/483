The Oregon Institute of Marine Biology (or OIMB) is the marine station of the University of Oregon. It is located in Charleston, Oregon at the mouth of Coos Bay. This [tpl]convert|100|acre|km2|sing=on[/tpl] marine station was first deeded to the University of Oregon in 1931. However, university students had been studying marine science in the summer from tents at nearby Sunset Bay since 1924. Currently OIMB is home to several permanent faculty members and a number of graduate students. In addition to graduate research, undergraduate classes are offered in the spring, summer, and fall, including marine birds and mammals, estuarine biology, marine ecology, invertebrate zoology, and embryology.
