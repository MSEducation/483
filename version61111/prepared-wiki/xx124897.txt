==History==

===Peace and prosperity===

After the birth of Sarada Devi, who is worshipped as Holy Mother, the spiritual consort of Ramakrishna, the village began to show signs of prosperity which was not so much in evidence before her advent. The main source of irrigation of the nearby cultivable lands is the big lake called 'Mother's Tank' where the visitors and the village-folk take their bath and get refreshed. It is said that the Holy Mother in her girlhood used to cut grass for cows in neck-deep water from this very tank. At present water is supplied to this reservoir from the river Amodar by means of an electric pump and is used for the irrigation of the surrounding fields. 
There is another tank called 'Barunjjey Pukur' (i.e. Banerji's tank) which lies on the south-eastern corner of this village and is surrounded with palmyra trees.

===Birth place of Sarada Devi===

Sarada Devi was born in this village in 1853.INS Netaji Subhash This village with its sacred traditions has become a holy place of pilgrimage, particularly among followers of Sri Ramakrishna. On one occasion, the Holy Mother, after touching the dust of this place with her forehead, remarked, One's own mother and the land of birth are even far superior to Heaven.
