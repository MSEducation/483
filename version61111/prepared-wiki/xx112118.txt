Storage Technology Corporation (StorageTek or STK), aka STC until about 1983, is a data storage technology company. Current StorageTek products focus on tape backup equipment and software to manage storage systems. New products include data retention systems, which they call information lifecycle management, or ILM. Now a subsidiary of Oracle Corporation and referred to as Oracle StorageTek, StorageTek was headquartered in Louisville, Colorado, United States with manufacturing facilities in Ponce, Puerto Rico. 

==History==

In 1969 four former IBM engineers: Jesse Aweida, Juan Rodriguez, Thomas S. Kavanagh, and Zoltan Herger, founded the Storage Technology Corporation, which officially became known as StorageTek in 1983. In the 1970s, StorageTek launched its Disk Products division. After a failed attempt to develop an IBM compatible mainframe, and an optical disk product line, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1984. New management invested in an automated tape library system that 'picked' tapes with a robot arm and stored them in a silo-like contraption in 1987.
StorageTek has acquired Documation (1980), Aspen Peripherals Corporation (1989), Network Systems Corporation (1995), and Storability (2005). On June 2, 2005, Sun Microsystems, Inc. announced it would purchase Storage Technology Corporation ("StorageTek") for US$4.1 billion in cash, or $37.00 per share.[tpl]cite web | url=http://news.cnet.com/Buying-StorageTek-Suns-last-big-gamble/2100-1015_3-5729961.html | publisher=CNET News | date=2 June 2005 | accessdate=21 June 2011 | title=Buying StorageTek: Sun's last big gamble?[/tpl] On August 31, 2005, the acquisition was completed.
