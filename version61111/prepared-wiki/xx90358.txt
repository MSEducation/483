==Playing career==

===Early Philadelphia years===

Boucher was drafted by the Philadelphia Flyers in the first round of the 1995 NHL Entry Draft, 22nd overall. He began play with the Flyers during the 1999–2000 season, taking the starting position from veteran John Vanbiesbrouck and helped the team secure the Eastern Conference and Atlantic Division regular season titles while leading the NHL in goals against average at 1.91. In the playoffs, he backstopped his team to the Eastern Conference Finals. Along the way, he recorded several memorable moments, including a five-overtime victory against the Pittsburgh Penguins[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2000/05/04/flyers-pens000504.html | title = Primeau gives Flyers win in 5 OT epic | publisher = CBC Sports | date = 2000-11-10 | accessdate = 2011-01-08[/tpl] and a sprawling save against Patrik Elias of the New Jersey Devils.[tpl]cite web | url = http://flyers.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=552180 | title = Boucher & "The Save" | publisher = Philadelphia Flyers | author = Bill Meltzer | date = 2011-02-09 | accessdate = 2011-02-09[/tpl] Although the Flyers were ahead 3-1 in the Eastern Conference Finals against the Devils and despite the return of the injured Eric Lindros, Boucher and the Flyers lost in seven games to the eventual Stanley Cup champion New Jersey Devils. In 2000–01, however, a weak start saw him lose his starting position to Roman Cechmanek.

===Phoenix/Shutout streak===

While with Phoenix, he broke the modern-day NHL record for the longest shutout streak by a goalie, going unscored upon for 332 minutes, or 5 and a half games. On February 1, 2006, Phoenix traded him to the Calgary Flames along with Mike Leclerc in exchange for Steven Reinprecht and Philippe Sauvé.

===Chicago/Columbus===

Boucher began the 2006–07 NHL season with the Chicago Blackhawks. On February 27, 2007, Boucher was picked up on waivers by the Columbus Blue Jackets. Boucher arrived hours prior to the Blue Jackets-Colorado Avalanche game that evening.  During the game, he wore Ty Conklin's number 35 sweater. On March 3, 2007, Boucher made his Blue Jackets debut against his former team the Phoenix Coyotes.  His first game was a successful 4–3 win.

===San Jose Sharks===

On July 23, 2007, Boucher signed an AHL contract with the Philadelphia Phantoms, the Flyers' AHL affiliate. He played with the Phantoms until he signed a one-year contract with the San Jose Sharks on February 26, 2008.http://sharks.nhl.com/team/app/?service=page&page=NewsPage&articleid=354988
On June 25, 2008, stating how much he liked the San Jose atmosphere, he signed another one-year contract with the Sharks, worth US$650,000.Pollak, David.

He recorded consecutive shutouts in each of his first two games of the 2008–09 NHL season for the Sharks, before finally allowing a goal in his third game.

===Return to Philadelphia===

On July 1, 2009, Boucher agreed to a two-year contract with the Philadelphia Flyers to be the steady, veteran backup to the starting goaltender Ray Emery. When Emery was hurt midway through the season, however, Boucher was thrust into the spotlight with mediocre results. A hand injury soon pushed Boucher to the sideline, and he was replaced by third-string goaltender Michael Leighton. Leighton excelled in Boucher's absence, and once healthy, Boucher found himself backing up Leighton.  Upon the return of Emery, Boucher was further demoted to the press box, with Leighton now the backup. Emery soon re-injured himself, giving Boucher a chance to back-up Leighton, who once again was playing well. Near the end of the season though, with only 13 games left, Leighton went down with a high-ankle sprain, and Boucher was back into the spotlight for the Flyers once again. After a 2-1 shootout victory in the final game of the season against the New York Rangers, Boucher and the Flyers advanced to the playoffs. 
In the 2010 Stanley Cup playoffs, Boucher beat Martin Brodeur and the New Jersey Devils in the first round by a margin of 4–1. The national media remarked that he was the surprise of the playoffs after the first round with his outstanding play in net. The Flyers defeated the Boston Bruins in the second round by overcoming an 0-3 game deficit, but Boucher was injured in Game 5 of that series with knee injuries. Boucher returned from his injuries to serve as a backup to Michael Leighton in Game 1 of the Stanley Cup Finals against the Chicago Blackhawks. He saw game action in Game 1 and Game 5 in relief of Leighton, but the Flyers lost in 6 games to the Blackhawks.

Bobrovsky started most of the games, and was named the Flyers playoff starter. After game 2 of the conference quarterfinals against the Buffalo Sabres, in which Boucher relieved Bobrovsky, and earned the win, Boucher started the next three games, but was pulled in Game 5 for Leighton, who was called up as a 3rd goaltender.  Leighton played well, but lost Game 5 in overtime, nonetheless earning the start for Game 6. However, in Game 6, Leighton allowed 3 goals in the opening period, but once again Boucher was able to earn the win in relief, making  Boucher became the only goaltender in NHL history to record two wins in a playoff series when coming in relief. Boucher went on to start Game 7, as the Flyers defeated Buffalo. Boucher started the first 3 games in the next round against Boston, but played poorly, allowing for the deposed starter Bobrovsky to return in Game 4, as the Flyers were swept.

===Carolina Hurricanes and third stint with Flyers===

After the Flyers acquired goaltender Ilya Bryzgalov and decided to keep Bobrovsky as backup, Boucher was the odd man out. On July 1, 2011, Boucher was signed by the Carolina Hurricanes to a two-year deal worth $950,000 per season.[tpl]cite web|title=NHL Free Agent Tracker|url=http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/feature/?id=25880|work=The Sports Network|accessdate=1 July 2011[/tpl] He played sparingly as the backup to Cam Ward, and his season ended early due to injury.
On January 13, 2013, after the end of the 2012–13 NHL lockout, Boucher began his fourth stint in the Flyers' organization when he and defenseman Mark Alt were traded to Philadelphia in exchange for Luke Pither.http://hurricanes.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=650126  Three days later, Boucher was waived and sent down to Adirondack, the new home of the AHL Phantoms.  Boucher was named the team's starting goaltender, relegating previous starter Scott Munroe to backup duty and sending Phantoms backup Cal Heeter to the Trenton Titans, the Flyers' ECHL affiliate.  On February 10, Boucher was recalled by the Flyers after Michael Leighton suffered a lower body injury. He saw action in four games before being sent back down to Adirondack on March 9 after Leighton returned to health.
