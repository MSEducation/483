[[Wali]]

CATEGORIES: Islamic terms, Saints

Walī ([tpl]lang-ar|ولي[/tpl], plural ʾawliyāʾ أولياء), is an Arabic word meaning "custodian", "protector", "helper", etc.Hans Wehr, p.  1289 "Wali" is someone who has "Walayah" (authority or guardianship) over somebody else. For example, in fiqh, a father is wali of his children especially for his daughters in marriage.
In Islam, the phrase [tpl]lang|ar|ولي الله[/tpl] walī allāh can be used to denote one vested with the "authority of God":
[tpl]quote|Only Allah is your Wali and His Messenger and those who          believe, those who keep up prayers and pay the poor-rate while         they bow.|Quran, sura 5 (Al-Ma'ida), ayah 55[tpl]Cite quran|5|55|s=ns[/tpl][/tpl]
In English, wali most often means a Muslim saint or holy person. It should not be confused with the different word wāli ([tpl]lang|ar|والي[/tpl]) which is an administrative title that means magistrateHans Wehr, p. 1290 and is still used today in some Muslim countries, such as the Wali of Swat.

==Wali as custodian of a woman in marriage==

According to Islamic law (shari'a) a woman needs a wali, that is a custodian, to get married, as the marriage contract is signed by her wali and the bridegroom. Normally the father or the paternal grandfather of the bride is her wali. In this case the father or paternal grandfather is wali mujbir, if it is the her first marriage. In this case, the bride's silence is considered consent.[tpl]cite book|title=Sahih Muslim, The Book of Marriage (Kitab Al-Nikah), Book 008, Number 3303[/tpl] If father and grandfather are deceased another male relative may function as wali. If there is no Muslim relative, a qadi may function as wali. There are only very few exceptions to this ruling, e.g. in the Hanafi school of Islamic law a woman may under certain circumstances marry without a wali, if it is not her first marriage.

==Sunni Islam==

In religious uses, it is generally short for walī allāh (Arabic ولي الله) or friend of God. Belief in the ʾawliyāʾ is an agreed upon article of faith in Sunni Islam having been mentioned in the earliest creeds to the most recent. Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Tahawi mentions them in his creed:
Islamic books of Aqeedah are not meant to be exhaustive of every branch of faith but rather to clarify points deviated from by non-Sunni sects.

==Use in Tasawuf/Sufism==

A hierarchy of ʾawliyāʾ and their functions are outlined in the books of Sufi Masters. There is disagreement as to the terms used for each rank but there is a general agreement about the numbers and functions of each level. Starting from the top downwards:Chodkiewicz, Michel.

Al-Hakim al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Arabi amongst others also contended that there was a Seal of the ʾawliyāʾ much in the same way that Muhammad is considered the Seal of the Prophets.Radtke, Bernd, and John O'Kane.
