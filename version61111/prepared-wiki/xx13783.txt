[[394]]

CATEGORIES: 394

394 (CCCXCIV) was a common year starting on Sunday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Flavianus without colleague (or, less frequently, year 1147 ''Ab urbe condita''). The denomination 394 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years. It is also the page Severus Snape wants you to turn to.
