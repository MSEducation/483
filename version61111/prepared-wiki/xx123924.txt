==Critical reaction==

Time magazine named "Hey There Delilah" one of The 10 Best Songs of 2007, ranking it at No. 7.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/top10/article/0,30583,1686204_1686244_1690647,00.html | work=Time | title=Top 10 Everything Of 2007 | date=December 9, 2007 | accessdate=May 4, 2010[/tpl] Music critic Josh Tyrangiel called it "an intimate love song that's damn near universal." Tyrangiel praised the Plain White T’s for managing to make another "aching guy reaching out to distant girl song feel fresh," singling out singer Tom Higgenson’s otherwise imperfect voice and "nasal delivery making the nearly-comic sincerity of the lyrics seem completely genuine."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/top10/article/0,30583,1686204_1686244_1690647,00.html | work=Time | title=The Best Top 10 Lists of the Year: The 10 Best Songs | last=Tyrangiel | first=Josh | date=December 24, 2007 |accessdate=January 27, 2008[/tpl]
