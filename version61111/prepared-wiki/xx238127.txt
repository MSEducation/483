==Television appearances==

Okines has been the subject of television specials both in Europe and in the United States. Discovery Health aired a special titled Extreme Aging: Hayley's Story, which focused on the balance of the disease being currently terminal but with a possible cure on the horizon.[tpl]cite web |title=Extreme Aging: Hayley's Story |url=http://health.discovery.com/tv/amazing-families/extreme-aging-hayleys-story.html |work=Amazing Families |publisher=Discovery Health |accessdate=2009-10-18[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=November 2013[/tpl] In the UK, a television documentary titled Extraordinary Lives also discusses Okines, her condition, and her options.[tpl]cite web |author=Tim Utton |title=Courage of girl who ages eight years in 12 months |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-132348/Courage-girl-ages-years-12-months.html |publisher=Daily Mail |accessdate=2009-10-18[/tpl]

She was featured in the second part of a three-part documentary series called Make Me Live Forever, in which presenter Michael Mosley investigated a number of proposed treatments to enable humans to extend their lifespan. Okines was discussed in relation to telomeres (short telomeres are a characteristic of Progeria) and their apparent role in the aging process.
She has also been featured in a report by Tara Brown on the Australian version of 60 Minutes.http://sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=7962926

==Fundraisers==

Although the United States' Progeria Research funds Okines's treatment, airfare for the family is left to them. Some athletes were inspired by Okines to raise money for progeria research. London's Chelsea Football Club raised thousands of pounds through a charity raffle in Okines's honor. Additionally, after Steve Keens saw Okines on a television special, he bicycled [tpl]convert|1000|mi|km[/tpl] to support her.[tpl]cite web |title=The Progeria Research Foundation Newsletter, December 2005 |url=http://progeriaresearch.org/assets/files/pdf/newsletters/PRFNEWSDec05.pdf |publisher=The Progeria Research Foundation |date=December 2005 |accessdate=2009-10-18[/tpl]
