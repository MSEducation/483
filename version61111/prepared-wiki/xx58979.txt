==Life==

He was born in the parish of Coldingham, Berwickshire, Scotland. After a course of study in Edinburgh, he was licensed to preach by the Church of Scotland, but made his way to London in 1771, to teach in schools at Edmonton, Hampstead and Camberwell. In 1777, he settled as minister of the Congregational church at Gosport in Hampshire.[tpl]cite web| last = | first = | title = David Bogue (1750-1825)|chapter=|year= 2011|publisher=Dr Williams’s Centre for Dissenting Studies | url= http://dissacad.english.qmul.ac.uk/new_dissacad/phpfiles/sample1.php?parameter=personretrieve&alpha=6886| accessdate=21 December 2013[/tpl] His predecessors at the Independent Chapel of Gosport were the Rev.

In 1771 he established an institution for preparing men for the ministry.[tpl]sfn|Grosart|1886[/tpl][tpl]cite web| last = | first = | title = Gosport, Hampshire, 1777-1826|chapter=|year= 2011|publisher=Dr Williams’s Centre for Dissenting Studies | url= http://dissacad.english.qmul.ac.uk/new_dissacad/phpfiles/sample1.php?parameter=academyretrieve&alpha=61| accessdate=22 December 2013[/tpl] It was the age of the new-born missionary enterprise, and Bogue's academy was largely the seed from which the London Missionary Society grew. In 1800 the society placed missionaries with Bogue for preparation for their ministries.[tpl]cite book |last1= Parker |first1= Irene |authorlink1= |title= Dissenting academies in England: their rise and progress, and their place among the educational systems of the country |url= http://www.archive.org/details/dissentingacadem00parkiala/ |format= |accessdate= |year=1914 & 2009|publisher= Cambridge University Press |location= |language= |isbn=978-0-521-74864-3|oclc= |doi= |id= |page=140 |pages= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= [/tpl] 
Bogue himself would have gone to India in 1796 if not for the opposition of the East India Company. In 1824 he taught Samuel Dyer at Gosport before he left for Penang as a missionary with the London Missionary Society.[tpl]sfn|Grosart|1886[/tpl]
He was also involved in founding the British and Foreign Bible Society and the Religious Tract Society, and in conjunction with James Bennett, minister at Romsey, wrote a well-known History of Dissenters (3 vols., 1809). Another of his writings was an Essay on the Divine Authority of the New Testament. He died at Brighton.[tpl]sfn|Grosart|1886[/tpl]
