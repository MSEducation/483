Tung Ying Building ([tpl]zh|t=東英大廈[/tpl]) was a 17-storey office building and shopping centre at 100 Nathan Road, at the corner of Granville Road in Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon, Hong Kong.
It was built in the 1960s and its style of architecture had become rare in Hong Kong. It was named after the given name of Sir Robert Hotung and his wife. A statue of Sir Robert was located at the ground floor of the building.
