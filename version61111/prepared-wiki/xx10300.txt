Dawkins came to prominence with his 1976 book The Selfish Gene, which popularised the gene-centred view of evolution and introduced the term meme. In 1982, he introduced into evolutionary biology the influential concept that the phenotypic effects of a gene are not necessarily limited to an organism's body, but can stretch far into the environment, including the bodies of other organisms; this concept is presented in his book The Extended Phenotype.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/01/090119081333.htm |title=European Evolutionary Biologists Rally Behind Richard Dawkins's Extended Phenotype |publisher=Sciencedaily.com |date=20 January 2009 |accessdate=2011-06-28[/tpl]
Dawkins is an atheist, a vice president of the British Humanist Association, and a supporter of the Brights movement.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/en/richard_dawkins_on_militant_atheism.html|title=Richard Dawkins on militant atheism|accessdate=2011-12-14 |publisher=TED Conferences, LLC[/tpl] He is well known for his criticism of creationism and intelligent design. In his 1986 book The Blind Watchmaker, he argues against the watchmaker analogy, an argument for the existence of a supernatural creator based upon the complexity of living organisms. Instead, he describes evolutionary processes as analogous to a blind watchmaker.
He has since written several popular science books, and makes regular television and radio appearances, predominantly discussing these topics. In his 2006 book The God Delusion, Dawkins contends that a supernatural creator almost certainly does not exist and that religious faith is a delusion—"a fixed false belief".[tpl]cite book| last = Dawkins| first = Richard| title = The God Delusion| year = 2006| publisher = Transworld Publishers| isbn = 0-593-05548-9[/tpl][tpl]rp|5[/tpl] As of January 2010, the English-language version had sold more than two million copies and had been translated into 31 languages.[ref][tpl]cite web |url=http://richarddawkins.net/articles/5000#455619 | publisher= Richard Dawkins at RichardDawkins.net | title= The God Delusion – back on the Times extended list at #24 |accessdate=2010-02-06 | date = 27 January 2010 [/tpl]

==Background==

===Kenya===

Dawkins was born in Nairobi, Kenya.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fontem.com/archivos/usuarios/cv_521.pdf |title=Curriculum vitae of Richard Dawkins |accessdate=2008-03-13 |publisher=The University of Oxford|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080423211133/http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/dawkins/CV.shtml |archivedate =2008-04-23|deadurl=no[/tpl] He is the son of Jean Mary Vyvyan (née Ladner) and Clinton John Dawkins (1915–2010), who was an agricultural civil servant in the British Colonial Service in Nyasaland (now Malawi).Dawkins, Richard 1941- - Contemporary Authors, New Revision Series | Encyclopedia.com
Dawkins has a younger sister. His father was called up into the King's African Rifles during World War II;[tpl]cite book| author = Richard Dawkins| title = The Ancestor's Tale| url = http://books.google.com/?id=Tub-X6wydKgC| date = October 2004| publisher = Houghton Mifflin Harcourt| isbn = 978-0-618-00583-3| page = 317 [/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://richarddawkins.net/articles/4757-brief-scientific-autobiography |title=Brief Scientific Autobiography |accessdate=2010-07-17 |publisher=RichardDawkins.net |last=Dawkins |first=Richard[/tpl] he returned to England in 1949, when Dawkins was eight. His father had inherited a country estate, Over Norton Park in Oxfordshire, which he turned into a commercial farm. Both his parents were interested in natural sciences; they answered Dawkins's questions in scientific terms.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/uk/2000/newsmakers/1595744.stm |title=Richard Dawkins: The foibles of faith |accessdate=2008-03-13 |date=12 October 2001 |publisher=BBC News[/tpl]
Dawkins describes his childhood as "a normal Anglican upbringing".[tpl]cite journal| last = Pollard| first = Nick| title = High Profile| url = http://books.google.com/?id=17rzvh_Ve0IC| volume = 18| date = April 1995| publisher = Hymns Ancient & Modern Ltd| location = Harrow, England| page = 15| issn = 0309-3492| issue = 3| journal = Third Way [/tpl] He was a Christian until halfway through his teenage years, at which point he concluded that the theory of evolution was a better explanation for life's complexity, and ceased believing in a god.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2003/feb/10/religion.scienceandnature |author=Hattenstone, Simon |title=Darwin's child |accessdate=2008-04-22 |date=10 February 2003 |publisher=The Guardian |location=London[/tpl] Dawkins states: "the main residual reason why I was religious was from being so impressed with the complexity of life and feeling that it had to have a designer, and I think it was when I realised that Darwinism was a far superior explanation that pulled the rug out from under the argument of design. And that left me with nothing."

===Education===

Dawkins attended Oundle School in Northamptonshire, an English public school with a distinct Church of England flavour, from 1954 to 1959, where he was in Laundimer house.[tpl]cite web|ref=CITEREFOundle2012b|url=http://www.oundleschool.org.uk./extracurric/lectures.php|title=The Oundle Lecture Series|publisher=Oundle School|year=2012b|accessdate=2012-06-12[/tpl] He studied zoology at Balliol College, Oxford, graduating in 1962; while there, he was tutored by Nobel Prize-winning ethologist Nikolaas Tinbergen. He continued as a research student under Tinbergen's supervision, receiving his MA and DPhil degrees by 1966, and remained a research assistant for another year. Tinbergen was a pioneer in the study of animal behaviour, particularly in the areas of instinct, learning and choice;[tpl]cite news| first=Michael |last=Schrage |title=Revolutionary Evolutionist |date=July 1995 |url=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/3.07/dawkins_pr.html |publisher=Wired |accessdate=2008-04-21[/tpl] Dawkins's research in this period concerned models of animal decision-making.[tpl]cite journal |first=Richard |last=Dawkins |title=A threshold model of choice behaviour |journal=Animal Behaviour |volume=17 |year=1969 |doi=10.1016/0003-3472(69)90120-1 |page=120 |issue=1[/tpl]

===Teaching===

From 1967 to 1969, he was an assistant professor of zoology at the University of California, Berkeley. During this period, the students and faculty at UC Berkeley were largely opposed to the ongoing Vietnam War, and Dawkins became heavily involved in the anti-war demonstrations and activities.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/atheism/people/dawkins.shtml |title="Belief" interview |accessdate=2008-04-08 |date=5 April 2004 |publisher=BBC[/tpl] He returned to the University of Oxford in 1970, taking a position as a lecturer. In 1990, he became a reader in zoology. In 1995, he was appointed Simonyi Professor for the Public Understanding of Science at Oxford, a position that had been endowed by Charles Simonyi with the express intention that the holder "be expected to make important contributions to the public understanding of some scientific field",[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/aims/manifesto.shtml |title=Manifesto for the Simonyi Professorship |accessdate=2008-03-13 |author=Simonyi, Charles |authorlink=Charles Simonyi |date=15 May 1995 |publisher=The University of Oxford|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080423211123/http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/aims/manifesto.shtml |archivedate =2008-04-23|deadurl=yes[/tpl] and that its first holder should be Richard Dawkins.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/aims/index.shtml |title= Aims of the Simonyi Professorship|date=23 April 2008 |accessdate=2011-06-28 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080423211118/www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/aims/index.shtml |archivedate=23 April 2008[/tpl]

H. Huxley Memorial Lecture (1992), the Irvine Memorial Lecture (1997), the Sheldon Doyle Lecture (1999), the Tinbergen Lecture (2004) and the Tanner Lectures (2003). In 1991, he gave the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures for Children on Growing Up in the Universe. He has also served as editor of a number of journals, and has acted as editorial advisor to the Encarta Encyclopedia and the Encyclopedia of Evolution. He is a senior editor of the Council for Secular Humanism's Free Inquiry magazine, for which he also writes a column.

===Evolutionary biology===

In his scientific works, Dawkins is best known for his popularisation of the gene as the principal unit of selection in evolution; this view is most clearly set out in his books:[tpl]cite book| last = Lloyd| first = Elisabeth Anne| title = The structure and confirmation of evolutionary theory| url = http://books.google.com/?id=hO8vHTSiBkAC| year = 1994| publisher = Princeton University Press| isbn = 978-0-691-00046-6 [/tpl]
Dawkins has consistently been sceptical about non-adaptive processes in evolution (such as spandrels, described by Gould and Lewontin)[tpl]cite journal|last=Gould|first=Stephen Jay|coauthors=Lewontin, Richard C.|year=1979|title=The Spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian Paradigm: A Critique of the Adaptationist Programme |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London|location=London|volume= 205|issue=1161|series=B|pages=581–598|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/205/1161/581.short | doi = 10.1098/rspb.1979.0086 | pmid= 42062|accessdate=2009-08-14[/tpl] and about selection at levels "above" that of the gene.[tpl]cite book|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|title=The extended phenotype: the long reach of the gene|year=1999|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|location=Oxford u.a.|isbn=0192880519|edition=Rev. ed. with new afterword and further reading.[/tpl] He is particularly sceptical about the practical possibility or importance of group selection as a basis for understanding altruism.[tpl]rp|169–172[/tpl]
This behaviour appears at first to be an evolutionary paradox, since helping others costs precious resources and decreases one's own fitness. Previously, many had interpreted this as an aspect of group selection: Individuals are doing what is best for the survival of the population or species as a whole. British evolutionary biologist W. D. Hamilton had used the gene-centred view to explain altruism in terms of inclusive fitness and kin selection—that individuals behave altruistically toward their close relatives, who share many of their own genes.[tpl]cite journal |author=Hamilton, W.D. |authorlink=W.

In June 2012 Dawkins was highly critical of fellow biologist E.O.

Critics of Dawkins's approach suggest that taking the gene as the unit of selection (a single event in which an individual either succeeds or fails to reproduce) is misleading; the gene could be better described, they say, as a unit of evolution (the long-term changes in allele frequencies in a population).[tpl]cite book| last = Dover| first = Gabriel| title = Dear Mr Darwin| year = 2000| publisher = London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson| isbn = 0-7538-1127-8 [/tpl] In The Selfish Gene, Dawkins explains that he is using George C.

Advocates for higher levels of selection (such as Richard Lewontin, David Sloan Wilson, and Elliott Sober) suggest that there are many phenomena (including altruism) that gene-based selection cannot satisfactorily explain.

===Meme===

Dawkins coined the word meme (the behavioural equivalent of a gene) as a way to encourage readers to think about how Darwinian principles might be extended beyond the realm of genes.[tpl]cite book| author = Dawkins, Richard| title = The Selfish Gene| edition = 2nd| year = 1989| publisher = Oxford University Press| location = United Kingdom| isbn = 0-19-286092-5[/tpl][tpl]rp|11[/tpl] Indeed, it was intended as an extension of his "replicators" argument,  but it took on a life of its own in the hands of other authors such as Daniel Dennett and Susan Blackmore. These popularisations then led to the emergence of memetics, a field from which Dawkins has distanced himself.Burman, J. T. (2012). The misunderstanding of memes: Biography of an unscientific object, 1976–1999. Perspectives on Science, 20(1), 75-104.  [tpl]doi|10.1162/POSC_a_00057[/tpl] (This is an open access article, made freely available courtesy of MIT Press.)
Dawkins's meme refers to any cultural entity that an observer might consider a replicator of a certain idea or complex of ideas. He hypothesised that people could view many cultural entities as capable of such replication, generally through exposure to humans, who have evolved as efficient (although not perfect) copiers of information and behaviour. Because memes are not always copied perfectly, they might become refined, combined, or otherwise modified with other ideas; this results in new memes, which may themselves prove more or less efficient replicators than their predecessors, thus providing a framework for a hypothesis of cultural evolution based on memes, a notion that is analogous to the theory of biological evolution based on genes.[tpl]cite book| author = Kelly, Kevin| title = Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic World| year = 1994| publisher = Addison-Wesley| location = United States| isbn = 0-201-48340-8| page = 360 [/tpl]
Although Dawkins invented the specific term meme independently, he has not claimed that the idea itself was entirely novel, and there have been other expressions for similar ideas in the past. For instance, John Laurent has suggested that the term may have derived from the work of the little-known German biologist Richard Semon. In 1904, Semon published Die Mneme (which appeared in English in 1924 as The Mneme). This book discusses the cultural transmission of experiences, with insights parallel to those of Dawkins. Laurent also found the term mneme used in Maurice Maeterlinck's The Life of the White Ant (1926), and has highlighted the similarities to Dawkins's concept.
Author James Gleick describes Dawkins's concept of the meme as "his most famous memorable invention, far more influential than his selfish genes or his later proselytizing against religiosity".[tpl]cite book| author = James Gleick| title = The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood| date = 2011-02-15| publisher = Pantheon| isbn = 978-0-375-42372-7| page = 269 [/tpl]

===Criticism of creationism===

Dawkins is a prominent critic of creationism (the religious belief that humanity, life, and the universe were created by a deity[tpl]cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/creationism/|title=Creationism|last=Ruse|first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Ruse|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Laboratory, Stanford University|quote=a Creationist is someone who believes in a god who is absolute creator of heaven and earth.|accessdate=2009-09-09[/tpl] without recourse to evolution[tpl]cite book| last = Scott| first = Eugenie C| authorlink = Eugenie Scott| title = Evolution vs. creationism: an introduction| date = 2009-08-03| publisher = University of California Press| location = Berkeley, CA| isbn = 978-0-520-26187-7| page = 51| chapter = Creationism| quote = The term 'creationism' to many people connotes the theological doctrine of special creationism: that God created the universe essentially as we see it today, and that this universe has not changed appreciably since that creation event.

He has described the Young Earth creationist view that the Earth is only a few thousand years old as "a preposterous, mind-shrinking falsehood",[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2002/mar/09/religion.schools1 |title=A scientist's view |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |date=9 March 2002 |work=The Guardian |accessdate=2009-11-07 |location=London[/tpl] and his 1986 book, The Blind Watchmaker, contains a sustained critique of the argument from design, an important creationist argument. In the book, Dawkins argues against the watchmaker analogy made famous by the 18th-century English theologian William Paley via his book Natural Theology, in which Paley argues that just as a watch is too complicated and too functional to have sprung into existence merely by accident, so too must all living things—with their far greater complexity—be purposefully designed. Dawkins shares the view generally held by scientists that natural selection is sufficient to explain the apparent functionality and non-random complexity of the biological world, and can be said to play the role of watchmaker in nature, albeit as an automatic, nonintelligent, blind watchmaker.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/dawkins/WorldOfDawkins-archive/Dawkins/Work/Books/blind.shtml |title=Book: The Blind Watchmaker |accessdate=2008-02-28 |author=Catalano, John |publisher=The University of Oxford|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080415140851/http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/dawkins/WorldOfDawkins-archive/Dawkins/Work/Books/blind.shtml |archivedate =2008-04-15|deadurl=yes[/tpl]

Wilder-Smith (a Young Earth creationist) and Edgar Andrews (president of the Biblical Creation Society).[tpl]Ref label|b|b|none[/tpl] In general, however, Dawkins has followed the advice of his late colleague Stephen Jay Gould and refused to participate in formal debates with creationists because "what they seek is the oxygen of respectability", and doing so would "give them this oxygen by the mere act of engaging with them at all". He suggests that creationists "don't mind being beaten in an argument. What matters is that we give them recognition by bothering to argue with them in public."[tpl]cite book| last = Dawkins| first = Richard| title = A Devil's Chaplain: Reflections on Hope, Lies, Science, and Love| url = http://books.google.com/?id=loVMMlxC1XoC| year = 2004| publisher = Houghton Mifflin Harcourt| isbn = 0-618-48539-2| page = 218 [/tpl], Chapter 5, p 218
In a December 2004 interview with American journalist Bill Moyers, Dawkins said that "among the things that science does know, evolution is about as certain as anything we know." When Moyers questioned him on the use of the word theory, Dawkins stated that "evolution has been observed. It's just that it hasn't been observed while it's happening." He added that "it is rather like a detective coming on a murder after the scene... the detective hasn't actually seen the murder take place, of course. But what you do see is a massive clue... Huge quantities of circumstantial evidence. It might as well be spelled out in words of English."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/now/transcript/transcript349_full.html#dawkins |title=Now with Bill Moyers |accessdate=2006-01-29 |author=Moyers, Bill |date=3 December 2004 |publisher=Public Broadcasting Service[/tpl]

===Foundation===

In 2006, Dawkins founded the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science (RDFRS), a non-profit organisation. The foundation is in a developmental phase. It has been granted charitable status in the United Kingdom and the United States. RDFRS plans to finance research on the psychology of belief and religion, finance scientific education programs and materials, and publicise and support charitable organisations that are secular in nature. The foundation also offers humanist, rationalist, and scientific materials through its website.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.richarddawkins.net/foundation,ourMission |title=Our Mission |accessdate=2006-11-17 |publisher=The Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061117150429/http://www.richarddawkins.net/foundation,ourMission |archivedate =2006-11-17|deadurl=yes[/tpl]
Dawkins has said the "trend toward theocratic thinking in the United States is a danger not only for America but for the entire world."  Connected to this concern, Dawkins invited Sean Faircloth to serve as opening speaker on Dawkins's 2011 US book tour. Faircloth is author of the book Attack of the Theocrats, How the Religious Right Harms Us All and What We Can Do About It.  The Richard Dawkins Foundation (United States branch) later hired Faircloth, who has ten years experience as a state legislator, as Director of Strategy and Policy.[tpl]cite web |url=http://richarddawkins.net/articles/643044-sean-faircloth-joins-rdfrs-us-as-director-of-strategy-and-policy |title=Sean Faircloth joins RDFRS (US) as Director of Strategy and Policy |accessdate=2011-10-01 |publisher=The Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science[/tpl]

In his role as professor for public understanding of science, Dawkins has been a critic of pseudoscience and alternative medicine. His 1998 book Unweaving the Rainbow considers John Keats's accusation that by explaining the rainbow, Isaac Newton diminished its beauty; Dawkins argues for the opposite conclusion.

He specifically cites astrology, spiritualism, dowsing, alternative faiths, alternative medicine, and homoeopathy. He also discusses how the Internet can be used to spread religious hatred and conspiracy theories with scant attention to evidence-based reasoning.

In 2012, ichthyologists in Sri Lanka honored Dawkins by creating Dawkinsia as a new genus name (members of this genus were formerly members of the genus Puntius). Explaining the reasoning behind the genus name, lead researcher Rohan Pethiyagoda was quoted as stating that "Richard Dawkins has, through his writings, helped us understand that the universe is far more beautiful and awe-inspiring than any religion has imagined ... We hope that Dawkinsia will serve as a reminder of the elegance and simplicity of evolution, the only rational explanation there is for the unimaginable diversity of life on Earth.".[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hEvNbHt8O7e3jB5HlC2uwNrSQvpQ?docId=CNG.2417bf61f21b75ec00dacc78e05295ae.341 |title=Sri Lankans name new fish genus after atheist Dawkins |accessdate=2012-07-16|work=Google News|agency=Agence France-Presse |date=2012-07-15[/tpl]
