An aurora is a natural light display in the sky (from the Latin word aurora, "sunrise" or the Roman goddess of dawn), especially in the high latitude (Arctic and Antarctic) regions, caused by the collision of solar wind and magnetospheric charged particles with the high altitude atmosphere (thermosphere). Most auroras occur in a band known as the auroral zone,[tpl]cite journal|year=1963|title=Some problems concerning the morphology of auroras and magnetic disturbances at high latitudes|journal= Geomagnetism and Aeronomy |volume=3|pages= 183–192|author=Feldstein, Y.

The charged particles  and solar wind are  directed into the atmosphere by the Earth's magnetosphere. A geomagnetic storm expands the auroral zone to lower latitudes.

Auroras or auroraehttps://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=auroras%2Caurorae%2CAuroras%2CAurorae&year_start=1808&year_end=2008&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2Cauroras%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Caurorae%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CAuroras%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CAurorae%3B%2Cc0 are classified as diffuse and discrete. The diffuse aurora is a featureless glow in the sky that may not be visible to the naked eye, even on a dark night. It defines the extent of the auroral zone. The discrete auroras are sharply defined features within the diffuse aurora that vary in brightness from just barely visible to the naked eye, to bright enough to read a newspaper by at night. Discrete auroras are usually seen in only the night sky, because they are not as bright as the sunlit sky. Auroras occasionally occur poleward of the auroral zone as diffuse patches or arcs,[tpl]cite journal|author=Frey, H. U.|year=2007|title=Localized aurora beyond the auroral oval|doi=10.1029/2005RG000174|journal= Rev. Geophys.|volume= 45|pages= RG1003[/tpl] which are generally subvisual.
In northern latitudes, the effect is known as the aurora borealis (or the northern lights), named after the Roman goddess of dawn, Aurora, and the Greek name for the north wind, Boreas, by Galileo in 1619.George Siscoe (1986). An Historical Footnote on the Origin of Aurora Borealis, History of Geophysics 2, 11-14. Auroras seen near the magnetic pole may be high overhead, but from farther away, they illuminate the northern horizon as a greenish glow or sometimes a faint red, as if the Sun were rising from an unusual direction. Discrete auroras often display magnetic field lines or curtain-like structures, and can change within seconds or glow unchanging for hours, most often in fluorescent green. The aurora borealis most often occurs near the equinoxes. The northern lights have had a number of names throughout history. The Cree call this phenomenon the "Dance of the Spirits". In Medieval Europe, the auroras were commonly believed to be a sign from God.Wilfried Schröder, Das Phänomen des Polarlichts, Darmstadt 1984
Its southern counterpart, the aurora australis (or the southern lights), has features that are almost identical to the aurora borealis and changes simultaneously with changes in the northern auroral zone.[tpl]cite journal|author=N.

Auroras occur on other planets. Similar to the Earth's aurora, they are visible close to the planet's magnetic poles. Modern style guides recommend that the names of meteorological phenomena, such as aurora borealis, be uncapitalized.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www1.umn.edu/urelate/style/sciterminology.html#Anchor-37516 |title=University of Minnesota Style Manual |publisher=.umn.edu |date=18 July 2007 |accessdate=5 August 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100722101345/http://www1.umn.edu/urelate/style/sciterminology.html| archivedate= 22 July 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

==History of aurora theories==

Multiple superstitions and obsolete theories explaining the aurora have surfaced over the centuries.

==Auroral mechanism==

Auroras are associated with the solar wind, a flow of ions continuously flowing outward from the Sun. The Earth's magnetic field traps these particles, many of which travel toward the poles where they are accelerated toward Earth. Collisions between these ions and atmospheric atoms and molecules cause energy releases in the form of auroras appearing in large circles around the poles. Auroras are more frequent and brighter during the intense phase of the solar cycle when coronal mass ejections increase the intensity of the solar wind.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/worldbook/aurora_worldbook.html |title=NASA – NASA and World Book |publisher=Nasa.gov |date=7 February 2011 |accessdate=26 July 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110629043027/http://www.nasa.gov/worldbook/aurora_worldbook.html| archivedate= 29 June 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=May 2012[/tpl]
Auroras result from emissions of photons in the Earth's upper atmosphere, above [tpl]convert|80|km|mi|sp=us|abbr=on[/tpl], from ionized nitrogen molecules regaining an electron, and oxygen atoms and nitrogen molecules returning from an excited state to ground state.[tpl]cite web|title=Ultraviolet Waves|url=http://missionscience.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves.html[/tpl]  They are ionized or excited by the collision of solar wind and magnetospheric particles being funneled down and accelerated along the Earth's magnetic field lines; excitation energy is lost by the emission of a photon, or by collision with another atom or molecule:
Oxygen is unusual in terms of its return to ground state: it can take three quarters of a second to emit green light and up to two minutes to emit red. Collisions with other atoms or molecules absorb the excitation energy and prevent emission. Because the very top of the atmosphere has a higher percentage of oxygen and is sparsely distributed such collisions are rare enough to allow time for oxygen to emit red. Collisions become more frequent progressing down into the atmosphere, so that red emissions do not have time to happen, and eventually even green light emissions are prevented.
This is why there is a color differential with altitude; at high altitude oxygen red dominates, then oxygen green and nitrogen blue/red, then finally nitrogen blue/red when collisions prevent oxygen from emitting anything. Green is the most common of all auroras. Behind it is pink, a mixture of light green and red, followed by pure red, yellow (a mixture of red and green), and finally, pure blue.

===Auroral colors===

==Forms and magnetism==

Typically the aurora appears either as a diffuse glow or as "curtains" that approximately extend in the east-west direction. At some times, they form "quiet arcs"; at others ("active aurora"), they evolve and change constantly. Each curtain consists of many parallel rays, each lined up with the local direction of the magnetic field lines, suggesting that auroras are shaped by Earth's magnetic field. Indeed, satellites show that electrons are guided by magnetic field lines, spiraling around them while moving toward Earth.
The similarity to curtains is often enhanced by folds called "striations". When the field line guiding a bright auroral patch leads to a point directly above the observer, the aurora may appear as a "corona" of diverging rays, an effect of perspective.
Although it was first mentioned by Ancient Greek explorer/geographer Pytheas, Hiorter and Celsius first described in 1741 evidence for magnetic control, namely, large magnetic fluctuations occurred whenever the aurora was observed overhead. This indicates (it was later realized) that large electric currents were associated with the aurora, flowing in the region where auroral light originated. Kristian Birkeland (1908)[tpl]cite book|last=Birkeland|first=Kristian|title=The Norwegian Aurora Polaris Expedition 1902–1903|year=1908 (section 1), 1913 (section 2)|publisher=H. Aschehoug & Co.|location=New York: Christiania (Oslo)|page=720|url=http://www.archive.org/details/norwegianaurorap01chririch[/tpl] out-of-print, full text online deduced that the currents flowed in the east-west directions along the auroral arc, and such currents, flowing from the dayside toward (approximately) midnight were later named "auroral electrojets" (see also Birkeland currents).
Still more evidence for a magnetic connection are the statistics of auroral observations. Elias Loomis (1860) and later in more detail Hermann Fritz (1881)Fritz, Hermann (1881). "Das Polarlicht." and S. Tromholt (1882)S. Tromholt, Om nordlysets perioder/Sur les périodes de l'aurore boréale, l'annuaire 1880, Inst. Météorol. Danois, Copenhagen, 1882. established that the aurora appeared mainly in the "auroral zone", a ring-shaped region with a radius of approximately 2500 km around Earth's magnetic pole. It was hardly ever seen near the geographic pole, which is about 2000 km away from the magnetic pole. The instantaneous distribution of auroras ("auroral oval") is slightly different, centered about 3–5 degrees nightward of the magnetic pole, so that auroral arcs reach furthest toward the equator about an hour before midnight. The aurora can be seen best at this time, called magnetic midnight, which occurs when an observer, the magnetic pole in question and the Sun are in alignment.
In the 1970s, astrophysicist Joan Feynman deduced that auroras are a product of the interaction between the Earth's magnetosphere and the magnetic field of the solar wind.  Her work resulted from data collected by the Explorer 33 spacecraft.
On 26 February 2008, THEMIS probes were able to determine, for the first time, the triggering event for the onset of magnetospheric substorms.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/themis/auroras/themis_power.html |title=NASA – THEMIS Satellites Discover What Triggers Eruptions of the Northern Lights |publisher=Nasa.gov |accessdate=26 July 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110629043044/http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/themis/auroras/themis_power.html| archivedate= 29 June 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Two of the five probes, positioned approximately one third the distance to the moon, measured events suggesting a magnetic reconnection event 96 seconds prior to auroral intensification.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.1160495 |title=Tail Reconnection Triggering Substorm Onset|year=2008|last1=Angelopoulos|first1=V.|last2=McFadden|first2=J.

==Solar wind and the magnetosphere==

The Earth is constantly immersed in the solar wind, a rarefied flow of hot plasma (gas of free electrons and positive ions) emitted by the Sun in all directions, a result of the two-million-degree heat of the Sun's outermost layer, the corona. The solar wind usually reaches Earth with a velocity around 400 km/s, density around 5 ions/cm3 and magnetic field intensity around 2–5 nT (nanoteslas; Earth's surface field is typically 30,000–50,000 nT). These are typical values. During magnetic storms, in particular, flows can be several times faster; the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) may also be much stronger.
The IMF originates on the Sun, related to the field of sunspots, and its field lines (lines of force) are dragged out by the solar wind. That alone would tend to line them up in the Sun-Earth direction, but the rotation of the Sun skews them (at Earth) by about 45 degrees, so that field lines passing Earth may actually start near the western edge ("limb") of the visible Sun.Alaska.edu, Solar wind forecast from a University of Alaska website
Earth's magnetosphere is formed by the impact of the solar wind on the Earth's magnetic field. It forms an obstacle to the solar wind, diverting it, at an average distance of about 70,000 km (11 Earth radii or Re),[tpl]cite journal|last=Shue|first=J.-H|coauthors=J .K. Chao, H .C. Fu, C. T. Russell, P. Song, K. K. Khurana, and H. J. Singer|title=A new functional form to study the solar wind control of the magnetopause size and shape|journal=J. Geophys. Res.|date=May 1997|volume=102|issue=A5|pages=9497–9511|doi=10.1029/97JA00196|bibcode = 1997JGR...102.9497S [/tpl] forming a bow shock 12,000 km to 15,000 km (1.9 to 2.4 Re) further upstream. The width of the magnetosphere abreast of Earth, is typically 190,000 km (30 Re), and on the night side a long "magnetotail" of stretched field lines extends to great distances (> 200 Re).
The magnetosphere is full of trapped plasma as the solar wind passes the Earth. The flow of plasma into the magnetosphere increases with increases in solar wind density and speed, with increase in the southward component of the IMF and with increases in turbulence in the solar wind flow.[tpl]cite journal|last=Lyons|first=L. R.|coauthors=H.-J. Kim, X. Xing, S. Zou, D.-Y. Lee, C. Heinselman, M. J. Nicolls, V. Angelopoulos, D. Larson, J. McFadden, A. Runov, and K.-H. Fornacon|title=Evidence that solar wind fluctuations substantially affect global convection and substorm occurrence|journal=J. Geophys. Res.|year=2009|volume=114|issue=A11306|pages=1–14|doi=10.1029/2009JA014281|bibcode = 2009JGRA..11411306L [/tpl] The flow pattern of magnetospheric plasma is from the magnetotail toward the Earth, around the Earth and back into the solar wind through the magnetopause on the day-side. In addition to moving perpendicular to the Earth's magnetic field, some magnetospheric plasma travel down along the Earth's magnetic field lines and lose energy to the atmosphere in the auroral zones. Magnetospheric electrons accelerated downward by field-aligned electric fields cause the bright aurora features. The un-accelerated electrons and ions cause the dim glow of the diffuse aurora.

==Frequency of occurrence==

Auroras are occasionally seen in temperate latitudes, when a magnetic storm temporarily enlarges the auroral oval. Large magnetic storms are most common during the peak of the eleven-year sunspot cycle or during the three years after that peak.[tpl]cite journal|last=Stamper|first=J.|coauthors=M. Lockwood and M. N. Wild|title=Solar causes of the long-term increase in geomagnetic activity|journal=J. Geophys. Res.|date=December 1999|volume=104|issue=A12|pages=28,325–28,342|doi=10.1029/1999JA900311|bibcode = 1999JGR...10428325S [/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Papitashvili|first=V. O.|coauthors=N. E. Papitashva and J .H . King|title=Solar cycle effects in planetary geomagnetic activity: Analysis of 36-year long OMNI dataset|journal=Geophys. Res. Lett.|date=September 2000|volume=27|issue=17|pages=2797–2800|doi=10.1029/2000GL000064|bibcode = 2000GeoRL..27.2797P [/tpl] Within the auroral zone the likelihood of an aurora occurring depends mostly on the slant of interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) lines (the slant is known as Bz), however, being greater with southward slants.
Geomagnetic storms that ignite auroras actually happen more often during the months around the equinoxes. It is not well understood why geomagnetic storms are tied to Earth's seasons while polar activity is not. But it is known that during spring and autumn, the interplanetary magnetic field and that of Earth link up. At the magnetopause, Earth's magnetic field points north. When Bz becomes large and negative (i.e., the IMF tilts south), it can partially cancel Earth's magnetic field at the point of contact. South-pointing Bzs open a door through which energy from the solar wind reaches Earth's inner magnetosphere.
The peaking of Bz during this time is a result of geometry. The IMF comes from the Sun and is carried outward with the solar wind. The rotation of the Sun causes the IMF to have a spiral shape called the Parker spiral. The southward (and northward) excursions of Bz are greatest during April and October, when Earth's magnetic dipole axis is most closely aligned with the Parker spiral.
Bz is not the only influence on geomagnetic activity, however, the Sun's rotation axis is tilted 8 degrees with respect to the plane of Earth's orbit. The solar wind blows more rapidly from the Sun's poles than from its equator, thus the average speed of particles buffeting Earth's magnetosphere waxes and wanes every six months. The solar wind speed is greatest – by about 50 km/s, on average – around 5 September and 5 March when Earth lies at its highest heliographic latitude.
Still, neither Bz nor the solar wind can fully explain the seasonal behavior of geomagnetic storms. Those factors together contribute only about one-third of the observed semiannual variations.

==Auroral events of historical significance==

The auroras that resulted from the "great geomagnetic storm" on both 28 August and 2 September 1859 are thought the most spectacular in recent recorded history. In a paper to the Royal Society on 21 November 1861, Scottish physicist Balfour Stewart described both auroral events as documented by a self-recording magnetograph at the Kew Observatory and established the connection between the 2 September 1859 auroral storm and the Carrington-Hodgson flare event when he observed that, "It is not impossible to suppose that in this case our luminary was taken in the act."[tpl]cite journal|jstor=111936|title= On the Great Magnetic Disturbance of 28 August to 7 September 1859, as Recorded by Photography at the Kew Observatory|author=Balfour Stewart|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London|volume= 11 |year=1860–1862|pages=407–410|doi=10.1098/rspl.1860.0086[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|jstor=108745 |title=On the Great Magnetic Disturbance Which Extended from 28 August to 7 September 1859, as Recorded by Photography at the Kew Observatory|author=Balfour Stewart|journal= Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London|volume= 151|year=1861|pages=423–430|doi=10.1098/rstl.1861.0023[/tpl] The second auroral event, which occurred on 2 September 1859 as a result of the exceptionally intense Carrington-Hodgson white light solar flare on 1 September 1859, produced auroras so widespread and extraordinarily brilliant that they were seen and reported in published scientific measurements, ship logs, and newspapers throughout the United States, Europe, Japan, and Australia.

Between 1859 and 1862, Elias Loomis published a series of nine papers on the Great Auroral Exhibition of 1859 in the American Journal of Science where he collected world-wide reports of the auroral event.
The aurora is thought to have been produced by one of the most intense coronal mass ejections in history, very near the maximum intensity that the Sun is thought capable of producing. It is also notable for the fact that it is the first time where the phenomena of auroral activity and electricity were unambiguously linked. This insight was made possible not only due to scientific magnetometer measurements of the era, but also as a result of a significant portion of the [tpl]convert|125000|mi|km[/tpl] of telegraph lines then in service being significantly disrupted for many hours throughout the storm. Some telegraph lines, however, seem to have been of the appropriate length and orientation to produce a sufficient geomagnetically induced current from the electromagnetic field to allow for continued communication with the telegraph operator power supplies switched off. The following conversation occurred between two operators of the American Telegraph Line between Boston and Portland, Maine, on the night of 2 September 1859 and reported in the Boston Traveler:

The conversation was carried on for around two hours using no battery power at all and working solely with the current induced by the aurora, and it was said that this was the first time on record that more than a word or two was transmitted in such manner. Such events led to the general conclusion that
