==Introduction==

The city of Agadir together with the neighbouring cities of Inezgane and Ait Melloul was estimated in 2013 to have 609,088 inhabitantsWorld Gazetteer : Morocco - the most important cities [tpl]Fr icon[/tpl] 
According to the 2004 census, there were 346,106 inhabitants in that yearGeneral Census of the population and habitat 2004, Commisariat of Planning,  Website: www.lavieeco.com, consulted on 7 February 2012 [tpl]Fr icon[/tpl] [tpl]ar icon[/tpl] and the population of the Prefecture of Agadir-Ida Outanane was 487,954 inhabitants Information on the population of Agadir from different sources is contradictory.
Agadir is one of the major urban centres of Morocco, the seventh largest conurbation of the country after Casablanca, Rabat, Fez, Marrakech, Meknes, and Tangier. The population density is quite high. Three languages are spoken in the city:   Arabic (mainly Darija, which is the Moroccan Arabic dialect); Ta-Chelh-it (or Shilha Berber) by the Berbers (who are also known as I-Mazigh-en Berbers or Ch'leuhs: I-Celḥiy-en); and French.
The mayor is Tariq Kabbaj.
Destroyed by earthquake in 1960, the city has been completely rebuilt with mandatory seismic standards. It is now the largest seaside resort in Morocco, where foreign tourists and many residents are attracted by an unusually mild year-round climate. Since 2010, it has been well served by low cost flights and a Motorway from Tangiers, the city attracts all walks of life and has had an annual growth rate of over 6% per year in housing demand while housing production barely exceeds 3.4%[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl].

==Districts of Agadir==

The current conurbation of Agadir is actually a combination of four communes:

===The city centre===

Large and dynamic, it includes the boulevards Mohammed V and Hassan II, the Valley of Birds, the avenues General Kettani, Mohammed VI, Moulay Abdellah, and Mokhtar Soussi as well as the main avenue of the FAR ( Royal Armed Forces of Morocco). The city centre also includes the Place Salam, Place de l'Esperance, the Loubnane Mosque, and the Square with two fountains that leads to the greenbelt of the municipality. With the combination of several communes, the city centre is process to gradually move towards the Haut Founty district where the new administraton have built a new building for the Court of Appeal.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]

===The seaside===

Lively and dynamic, the tourist area at the seaside consists of the boulevard of 20 August, Tawada Avenue, the Corniche, Avenue of Oued Souss, and the Founty district: Baie des Palmiers. It has many hotels, restaurants, trendy cafes, and residential villas.
A large beautification project for the city is in course of being completed. Agadir is well equipped with a beautiful waterfront promenade about 5 km long.
A recent marina with many luxury shops was built at the foot of the Casbah and at the beginning of the Oued Tildi.

===New Talborjet===

This area is known as the old district of Talborjet (meaning "small fort" in local Berber, in remembrance of the water tower which was first built on the plateau in the former Talborjt). Lively, the New Talborjt which has been rebuilt away from the Old Talborjt, has as a main artery the Boulevard Mohammed Sheikh Saadi, who was the victor against the Portuguese in 1541. Other major avenues are the Avenue President Kennedy and the Avenue February 29. There is also the Mohammed V mosque, the Olhão garden (Olhão is a coastal city located in the south of Portugal, which is paired with Agadir) and its memorial museum and the garden Ibn Zaydoun. Some good hotels and restaurants have been built on the main arteries.

===Residential districts===

===Ports===

Over the decades, Agadir has had several ports: two fishing ports, a major trading port, and the recent port for leisure boats with its marina.
The Avenue du Port, the main artery of the Anza district, is surrounded by canneries and has many popular small restaurants adjacent to the fish market.
The fishing port is one of the premier major sardine ports in the world. The commercial port is also known for its exports of cobalt, manganese, zinc, and citrus products.

===The Casbah or Agadir Oufella===

The Casbah (Agadir Oufella, Agadir le haut, Agadir N'Ighir, or Agadir de la colline) was, along with Founti by the sea, the oldest district of Agadir. An authentic fortress with winding streets and lively, the Casbah was built in 1572 by Moulay Abdallah al-Ghalib. Above the front door; today, the original inscription in Arabic and in Dutch reads: "Fear God and honour the King."
Of this fortress there remains, after the earthquake of 29 February 1960, a restored long high wall that surrounds land that is not buildable. The view, however, is exceptional over the bay of Agadir and the ports. The old people of Agadir remember the famous "Moorish café" of the Casbah and its panoramic view.
The hill bears the inscription in Arabic: "God, Country, King" which, like the walls, is illuminated at night.

===Old Talborjt===

Overlooking the waterfront and Wadi Tildi, this old district (whose name is sometimes spelled Talbordjt) was once a shopping area and very lively with its large square where there was a weekly market, hotels, schools, mosqueTalborjt 1930-1960 [tpl]Fr icon[/tpl] 90% of the buildings in Old Talborjt were destroyed or severely damaged by the earthquake in 1960. Razed to the ground after the earthquake and now overgrown, it is classified as non-buildable area. Its main thoroughfare, the Avenue El Moun stretches over 2 km and serves only for driving schools who teach their students to drive.

===The Abattoir (Industrial area)===

One of the most popular neighbourhoods, it is known for its Square for taxis and buses. It is a junction that unites the heart of the city and its surroundings. This district was the least affected by the earthquake of 1960.

===Souk El Had===

This is the largest market in the region. It has about 6,000 small shops. It is surrounded by walls and has several entrances. It is organized into different sectors: furniture, crafts, clothing, vegetables, meat, spices etc. It is possible to find little marvels, including all kinds of handicrafts and traditional decorations.  There are also objects of poor quality "made in China", imitation traditional slippers in plastic at ridiculous prices, and counterfeit articles.
The walls have been restored and the interior design is being finished.

===La Médina===

La Médina is a handicrafts space created in 1992 by the Italian artist Coco Polizzi, at Ben Sergao, a district close to Agadir 4.5 km from the city centre. Built using techniques of traditional Berber construction, it is a kind of small open-air museum, on five hectares and home to artisan workshops, a museum, individual residences, a small hotel, and an exotic garden.

===Subdivisions===

The prefecture is divided administratively into the following communes:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lavieeco.com/documents_officiels/Recensement%20population.pdf|title=Recensement général de la population et de l'habitat de 2004|publisher=Haut-commissariat au Plan, Lavieeco.com|accessdate=22 April 2012[/tpl] [tpl]Fr icon[/tpl] [tpl]ar icon[/tpl]

==History==

History is virtually silent on Agadir before the 12th century.
In the 2nd century AD, the historian Polybius referred to North Africa on the Atlantic, a place called cap Rhysaddir, that may have been located near Agadir but its location is still under debate.
The oldest cartographic mention of Agadir is on a map from 1325: at the approximate location of the modern city there was an indication of a place called Porto Mesegina, after the name of a Berber tribe already mentioned in the 12th century, the Mesguina, that is to say the Ksima.
At the end of the medieval period, Agadir was a town of some notoriety. The name itself, Agadir el-arba, was attested to for the first time in 1510A name which seemed to attest to the existence of a Wednesday market - the souk el-arba close to a collective granary. Chronique de Santa-Cruz du Cap de Gué [tpl]Fr icon[/tpl] , Paris, 1934
In 1505, the Portuguese, who were already installed on the Moroccan coast, founded a trading post and a fort at the foot of the hill to the sea, Santa Cruz do Cabo de Aguer on the site of the now-vanished neighborhood of Founti (named after the Portuguese word fonte meaning fountain) under a governor.
Quickly, the Portuguese were exposed to the hostility of the tribes of the region. From 1530, they were blockaded in Santa Cruz. Portuguese weakness showed itself on 12 March 1541 when Sherif Saâdien Mohammed ash-Sheikh captured the fortress of Santa Cruz de Aguer. Six hundred Portuguese survivors were taken prisoner, including the governor, Guterre de Monroy, and his daughter, Dona Mecia. The captives were redeemed by the holy men mostly from Portugal. Dona Mecia, whose husband was killed during the battle, became the wife of Sheikh Mohammed ash-Sheikh but died in childbirth in 1544. In the same year, Mohammed ash-Sheikh released the Governor Guterre de Monroy, who he had befriendedChronique de Santa-Cruz du Cap de Gué, Paris, 1934 (Fr)
The Portuguese possessions in Morocco, acquired between 1505 and 1520, were regressing. After the loss of Agadir, the Portuguese were obliged to abandon Safi and Azemmour. Morocco was beginning to be less important for Portugal which now turned to India and Brazil. After 1550, the Portuguese no longer hold anything in Morocco other than Mazagan  (now El Jadida), Tangier and Ceuta.
In 1572, the Casbah was built on top of the hill by Moulay Abdallah al-Ghalib, successor to Mohammed ash-Sheikh. It was now called Agadir N'Ighir,  literally: fortified granary of the hill in TachelhitIghir (pronounced irrhir) that is to say shoulder, then height.
In the 17th century, during the reign of the Berber dynasty of Tazeroualt, Agadir was a harbour of some importance, expanding its trade with Europe. There was, however no real port nor a wharf. Agadir traded mainly in sugar, wax, copper, hides and skinsCharles-André Julien, History of North Africa, Paris, 1994 (Fr) Europeans took their manufactured goods, particularly weapons and textiles. Under the reign of Sultan Moulay Ismail (1645-1727) and his successors, the trade with France, until then an active partner regressed to the English and the Dutch.
In 1731, the town was completely destroyed by an earthquake.[tpl]cite web|url=http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/world/events/1960_02_29.php |title=Historic Earthquakes |publisher=Earthquake.usgs.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-03-14[/tpl] The harbour of Agadir was then ordered to be closed when Essaouira was established further north.
In 1746, the Dutch set up a trading post at the foot of the Casbah under the authority of the Sultan, and undoubtedly participated in the restoration of the city. Above the door of the Casbah, the Dutch inscription can still be seen with its transcription in Arabic:
"Vreest God ende eert den Kooning", which means "Fear God and honour your King", and the date 1746.
After a long period of prosperity during the reigns of the Saadian and Alawite dynasties, Agadir declined from 1760 because of the pre-eminence given to the competing port of Essaouira by the Alawite Sultan Mohammed ben Abdallah who wanted to punish the Souss for rebelling against his authority. This decline lasted a century and a half. In 1789, a European traveler gave a brief description of Agadir: "It is now a ghost town, there are no more than a few houses and these are crumbling into ruins".
In 1881, Sultan Moulay Hassan reopened the harbour to trade in order to supply the expeditions he planned in the south. These expeditions, which were to reassert his authority over the Souss tribes and counter the plans of English and Spanish, were held in 1882 and 1886Maurice Barbier, The conflict in the Western Sahara, 1982 (Fr)
In 1884, Charles de Foucauld described in Reconnaissance in Morocco (Fr) his rapid passage to Agadir from the east:
"I walk along the shore to Agadir Irir. The road passes below the city, half-way between it and Founti: Founti is a miserable hamlet, a few fishermen's huts; Agadir, despite its white enclosure which gives it the air of a city is, I am told, a poor village depopulated and without tradeCharles de Foucauld, Reconnaissance au Maroc,(1883-1884), éd. L'Harmattan, coll. « Les Introuvables », Paris, (réimp. 2000) ISBN 978-2-7384-6645-7 (Fr)
On the pretext of a call for help from German companies in the valley of the Souss, Germany decided on 1 July 1911, to protect its interests in Morocco and defend its claims on the country. It sent to the Bay of Agadir, (which harbour was, until 1881, closed to foreign trade) the [tpl]SMS|Panther[/tpl] which was quickly joined by the cruiser Berlin. Very strong international reaction, particularly from Great Britain, surprised Germany and triggered the Agadir Crisis between France and Germany. War threatened. After tough negotiations, a Franco-German treaty was finally signed on 4 November 1911, giving a free hand to France, who would be able to establish its protectorate over Morocco in return for giving up some colonies in Africa. It was only then that the gunboat Panther and the cruiser Berlin left the bay of Agadir.
Ironically, the German sales representative Hermann Wilberg, who was sent to provide the pretext for the intervention, only arrived at Agadir three days after the Panther arrived.
In 1913, the cities (Agadir N'Ighir and Founti) totalled less than a thousand inhabitants. On 15 June 1913 French troops landed in Agadir. In 1916, the first pier was built near Founti - a simple jetty, later known as the "Portuguese jetty", which remained until the end of the 20th century. After 1920, under the French protectorate, a port was built and the city saw its first development with the construction of the old Talborjt district located on the plateau at the foot of the hill. Two years later, beside Talborjt along the faultline of the river Tildi construction of the popular district of Yahchech began.
Around 1930, Agadir was an important stop for Aéropostale where Saint-Exupéry and Mermoz stopped.
In the years from 1930, a modern central city began to be built according to the plans of the urban planner Henri Prost, director of the Urban Planning Department of the Protectorate, and his deputy Albert Laprade: a horseshoe layout based on the waterfrontScheme of the Future City in the magazine La Géographie on Gallica around a large avenue perpendicular to the waterfront - the Avenue Lyautey, since renamed Avenue du Général Kettani. In the 1950s, urban development continued under the direction of the Director of Urban Planning Morocco, Michel Ecochard.
After 1950 and the opening of the new commercial port, the city grew with fishing, canning, agriculture, and mining. It also began to open up to tourism thanks to its climate and beautiful hotels. Several years later from 1950 to 1956 Agadir organised the Grand Prix of AgadirSee "Grand Prix automobile d'Agadir" in French wikipedia and, from 1954 to 1956, the Moroccan Grand Prix.
In 1959, the port was visited by the yacht of the Greek owner Aristotle Onassis and his host, Winston ChurchillThe visit of Winston Churchill to Agadir [tpl]Fr icon[/tpl]
By 1960, Agadir numbered over 40,000 residents when at 15 minutes to midnight on 29 February 1960, it was again almost totally destroyed by an earthquake of magnitude 5.7 on the Richter scale that lasted 15 seconds, burying the city and killing more than a third of the populationDocumentary film, Jacques Bensimon, Once Agadir, publisher=National Film Board of Canada, consulted 1 November 2010 The death toll was estimated at 15,000Website dedicated to the Earthquake at Agadir in 1960 [tpl]Fr icon[/tpl] The earthquake destroyed the ancient Casbah.
On seeing the destruction in Agadir, King Muhammad V of Morocco declared: "If Destiny decided the destruction of Agadir, its rebuilding depends on our Faith and Will."

===Agadir after 1960===

The current city was rebuilt 2 km further south, led by the architects Jean-François Zevaco, Elijah Azagury, Pierre Coldefy, and Claude Verdugo. Agadir became a large city of over half a million by 2004, with a large port with four basins: the commercial port with draft of 17 metres, triangle fishing, fishing port, and a pleasure boat port with marina. Agadir was the premier sardine port in the world in the 1980s and has a famous beach stretching over 10 km with one of the finest seafront promenades in the world. Its climate has 340 days of sunshine per year which allows for swimming all year round. The winter is unusually warm and summer heat is never oppressive (summer haze however is common).
Agadir is the premier tourist destination in the country, a claim sometimes disputed by Marrakech, and the premier fishing port of Morocco. Business is also booming with the export of citrus fruit and vegetables produced in the fertile valley of Souss.
With its white buildings, wide flowered boulevards, modern hotels and European style cafes, Agadir is not a typical city of traditional Morocco but it is a modern, active and dynamic city, turned towards the future.
The bay of Agadir and the nearby Bay of Taghazout are members of the "Club of the most beautiful bays in the world".
The city is served by the Agadir–Al Massira International Airport.
