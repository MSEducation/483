Onikan Stadium is a multi-purpose stadium in Lagos, Nigeria.  It is currently used mostly for football matches and is the home stadium of various Lagos teams, most notably Stationery Stores F.C., First Bank and Julius Berger FC.  The stadium has a capacity of 5,000 people and is the oldest in Nigeria. Located on the southeastern corner of Lagos Island near Tafewa Balewa Square, the original stadium was built in 1930 and six years later named after King George V. Between 1963 and 1973, it became known as the Lagos City Stadium. The current Onikan Stadium was renovated & reopened for football and cultural activities in the 1980s.
In March 2008, the stadium was banned for use the rest of the season by the Nigeria Football League when a pitch invasion injured many members of the Warri Wolves after a scoreless draw with First Bank.
