==Gallery==

In 1977 Ammann established his own gallery, Thomas Ammann Fine Art which was soon to be visited by major collectors throughout Europe and the Americas. Its patrons included Giovanni Agnelli, Gustavo Cisneros, David Geffen, Ronald Lauder, Dinos Martinos, Samuel Newhouse Jr, Stavros Niarchos, Ronald Perelman, Yves Saint Laurent and Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza amongst others.Artnewspaper, R.B., Thomas Ammann - Major player and patron of artists dies at 43, News, No. 30, page 3, London, July–September 1993.
From his villa by Otto Rudolf Salvisberg on the hill of Zurich, his chalet in Gstaad or his apartment at the Pierre in New York, Thomas Ammann dealt mainly in major paintings and sculpture of twentieth century masters such as Francis Bacon, Balthus, Max Beckmann, Constantin Brâncuși, Georges Braque, Alexander Calder, Alberto Giacometti, Wassily Kandinsky, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Paul Klee, Willem de Kooning, Fernand Léger, Henri Matisse, Joan Miró, Barnett Newman, Pablo Picasso and Mark Rothko.
Since Ammann's discretion and secrecy in business were legendary, only a few prime examples of artworks which found way into the worlds great museums through his hands are known, such as Max Ernst's "The Blessed Virgin Chastises the Infant Jesus Before Three Witnesses" in the collection of the Ludwig Museum in Cologne or Vincent van Gogh's "Portrait of Joseph Roulin" which Ammann soldKimmelman, Michael: How the MoMA got the Van Gogh, New York Times, 9 October 1989. to the Museum of Modern Art in New York.  Ammann proved to be a major player in the international art auctions in London and New York as a bidder and buyer on record breaking artworks. The press noted "his presence in the worlds salesrooms created a mood of optimism, whatever the market conditions, and his enthusiastic bids for paintings by Cy Twombly and Andy Warhol were driven by genuine passion as much as potential profit".Canatsey, Christopher: The Art of Ammann, W Magazine, 1991. Thomas Ammann started organizing exhibitions at his gallery from 1987.

==Collection==

Besides becoming the leading dealer of his generation Birnbaum, Daniel: Art of the Dealer, page 6. Artforum, Summer 2001. by the end of the 1980s and playing in the first league of older dealers such as William Acquavella and Ernst Beyeler, Thomas Ammann was an equally keen supporter and friend of contemporary artists, whose works he exclusively purchased for his own collection. A small selection of his holdings were exhibited at the Kunsthalle Basel in 1985 with the title "From Twombly to Clemente - Selected works from a private collection", curated by the well known art critic and former museum director Jean-Christophe Ammann (no relation). The art world agreed on Thomas Ammann's collection of works of the second half of the twentieth century to be amongst the finest in existence,White, Edmund: Ammann of Style, page 69-74, 114-116. Vanity Fair, January 1988 with unparalleled E.T. Associated Press: Warhol's Mao sells for record $17.4 M, MSNBC, 16 November 2006. workgroups of artists such as Andy Warhol, Cy Twombly, Brice Marden, Robert Ryman, Sigmar Polke, Eric Fischl, Francesco Clemente and Neil Jenney. Living up to his maxim "You shall not collect what you want to sell", Ammann strictly divided his dealing in early twentieth-century art from his collecting postwar and contemporary works.Gimelson, Deborah: Ammann for all Seasons, Art and Auction, Vol. X, No. 4, November 1987. After Ammann's untimely death in 1993, part of his private collection was embedded in his longtime friend, the Swiss Industrialist Stephan Schmidheiny's corporate collection "Daros".

==Concerns==

Ammann was an early supporter in the fight against AIDS, the illness many prominent figures from the artworld fell victim to. The evening of 2 May 1988, following the auction of the Andy Warhol Collection at Sotheby's in New York, Ammann orchestrated a benefit auction which raised nearly two million US dollars. Ammann convinced artist friends from Jasper Johns to Cy Twombly to donate works to the auction he co-hosted with Patricia Buckley, the proceeds of which went to the supportive care programme of St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center of New York.Ammann, Thomas Contemporary Art - A Benefit Auction for The Supportive Care Program of St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center of New York, Sotheby's New York, 2 May 1988.
In 1991 as chairman of the international programme, Thomas Ammann organized and hosted the Art Against Aids (AmFAR) gala dinner and 1.5 million dollar fund-raiser at the opening of the art fair Basel with Elizabeth Taylor and Audrey Hepburn for some 500 guests, among them the biggest names from the art and entertainment worlds.Suzy: Liz Taylor supports artfair to fight AIDS, The Miami Herald, Palm Beach Edition, 5 June 1991.

==Andy Warhol Catalogue Raisonné==

It was in 1977 that Thomas Ammann envisioned a Catalogue Raisonné of all of Andy Warhol's paintings, sculptures and drawings, and with the artists consent, started the vast undertaking of assembling the material needed for such a project to finally create a comprehensive, scholarly and authoritative publication. The initial volumes were eventually published in 2002 and 2004 by Phaidon Press in a joint effort of Thomas Ammann Fine Art and The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts Inc., New York.
