The manor belonging  to the Hultons of Over Hulton was later sold to the Earl of Ellesmere. There were coal mines and quarries in the 19th century. It was near the Bolton and Leigh Railway.

===Cutacre===

The Cutacre site was granted planning permission in 2001 for the surface mining of 900,000 tonnes of coal and reworking of the spoil tip. The operation was expected to last for 4 years and began in 2006. The restoration scheme would create over 100 hectares of amenity woodland and wetlands as well as for an area of industrial development.[tpl]citation |title=Cutacre|url=http://www.salford.gov.uk/cutacre.htm|publisher=salford.gov.uk |accessdate=2010-01-10[/tpl] UK Coal is currently working with Bolton Metropolitan Borough Council to promote the Cutacre site through the Local Development Framework process. Bolton Council have identified Cutacre as a key strategic site for future development in Bolton and consequently plans have changed. There has been a long campaign against the proposals by residents in Over Hulton and Little Hulton.[tpl]citation |title=Cutacre go ahead|url=http://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/news/4786607.Cutacre_gets_the_go_ahead/|publisher=theboltonnews.co.uk |accessdate=2010-01-10[/tpl]

==Geography==

The former township was situated on the road from Manchester to Preston, now the A6 road. There was no village centre; the most built-up area was in the northern part of the township at Daubhill. It comprises [tpl]convert|1280|acre|km2[/tpl] of flat land, mostly of meadow and pasture, the remainder arable. The underlying rocks are Coal Measures; there is also cannel coal and there is a sandstone quarry. The M61 motorway crosses the former township.
