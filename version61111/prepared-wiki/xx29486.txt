[[U.S. Route 1]]

CATEGORIES: U.S. Highway System, U.S. Route 1, Interstate 95

U.S. Route 1 (US 1) is a major north–south U.S. Highway that serves the East Coast of the United States. It runs 2,369 miles (3,813 km), from Fort Kent, Maine, at the Canadian border, south to Key West, Florida. US 1 is generally paralleled by Interstate 95, though the former is significantly farther west (inland) between Jacksonville, Florida, and Petersburg, Virginia. The highway connects most of the major cities of the east coast, including Miami, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York City, and Boston, passing from the Southeastern United States to New England.
While US 1 is generally the easternmost of the main north–south U.S. Highways, part of Routes 9, 13, 15, 17, 21, 158 and 301 occupy corridors closer to the ocean. When the road system was laid out in the 1920s, US 1 was mostly assigned to the existing Atlantic Highway, which followed the Fall Line between the Piedmont and the Atlantic Coastal Plain north of Augusta, Georgia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/ewjames.htm |title=E.

James on designating the Federal-aid system and developing the U.S. numbered highway plan |publisher=Fhwa.dot.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-08-09[/tpl] At the time, the highways farther east were of lower quality and did not serve the major population centers.  At the time of its construction, Route 99 was its equivalent along the western coast of the United States, before being succeeded by Route 101.

==Route description==

===Florida===

US 1 travels along the east coast of Florida, beginning at 490 Whitehead St. in Key West[tpl]cite web| author=490 Whitehead St |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=490+Whitehead+St,+Key+West,+FL+33040&sll=24.564454,-81.803019&sspn=0.009114,0.013819&layer=c&ie=UTF8&ll=24.559927,-81.803319&spn=0.009114,0.013819&z=16&cbll=24.555358,-81.804056&panoid=FI83lxPQwLIYR-9LZ7Y8rQ&cbp=1,20.256207176035787,,0,5 |title=490 Whitehead St, Key West, FL 33040 – Google Maps |publisher=Maps.google.com |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2012-08-09[/tpl] and passing through Miami, Fort Lauderdale, West Palm Beach, Fort Pierce, Melbourne, Titusville, Daytona Beach, Palm Coast, St. Augustine, and Jacksonville. The southernmost piece through the Florida Keys, about [tpl]convert|100|mi|-1[/tpl] long, is the two-lane Overseas Highway, originally built in the 1930s after the Florida East Coast Railway's Overseas Railroad was ruined by the Labor Day Hurricane of 1935. The rest of US 1 in Florida is generally a four-lane divided highway, despite the existence of the newer I-95 not far away. State Road A1A is a continuous beachfront alternate to US 1, cut only by assorted unbridged inlets and the Kennedy Space Center. North of Jacksonville, US 1 turns northwest towards Augusta, Georgia; US 17 becomes the coastal route into Virginia, where US 13 takes over.Google Maps street maps and USGS topographic maps, accessed via ACME Mapper In Florida until the 1990s, US 1 used high-contrast markers (white text on a red background).John Gordon, The Virginian-Pilot, US Highway 17 to Florida: Scenic, Historic and Very Slow, December 29, 1993: "Drivers know they're in Florida when they notice the U.S. Highway signs are color-coded for easy recognition. The US 17 signs, for example, are yellow, while those of US 1 are red, US 90 blue. and US 27 green."

===Georgia===

The part of US 1 in Georgia, as it shifts from the coastal alignment in Florida to the Fall Line alignment in South Carolina, is generally very rural, passing through marshes and former plantations between the towns and cities of Folkston, Waycross, Baxley, Lyons, Swainsboro, and Augusta. The Georgia Department of Transportation has an ongoing plan to widen all of US 1 to four lanes with bypasses which is more than 50 percent complete.

===The Carolinas===

In South Carolina, US 1 generally serves mostly rural areas as it falls west of I-95 while the coastal areas are served by routes east of it. Starting in South Carolina, US 1 is paralleled by Interstate 20 along the Fall Line through Aiken, Lexington, and Columbia to Camden and Lugoff. US 1 functions as a local two-lane road with occasional boulevard stretches. After Camden, US 1 continues northeast away from any Interstate towards Bethune, Patrick, McBee and Cheraw with no bypasses or four-lane sections except around Cheraw through the US 52 and SC 9 multiplexes. After SC 9, it continues northward into North Carolina as a two-lane highway. SCDOT has no plans to widen or bypass any US 1 alignments northeast of Camden to the North Carolina line.
Between the South Carolina line and the US 74 bypass, US 1 is a two-lane road but sees a considerable amount of truck and tourist traffic of people cutting through from the US 74/US 220 and I-73/I-74 corridor attempting to reach points south and east. US 1 goes through downtown Rockingham, with a bypass in the future plans. North of the NC 177 juncture, it becomes four lanes or greater, becoming a super-street with limited access and then becoming a limited access freeway. US 1 becomes a major artery for the state as it moves north of Rockingham. After Richmond County, it goes into Moore County with two expressway bypasses in Southern Pines, Vass and Cameron. US 1 continues with the Jefferson Davis Highway label through Lee County and Sanford, and on to Cary and Raleigh. US 1 runs concurrently with US 64 through most of Cary, where the freeway recently underwent a major renovation and improvements that added lanes in both directions.[tpl]dead link|date=August 2012[/tpl] North of Raleigh, US 1 (known as Capital Boulevard in northern Wake County) crosses Interstate 540 and then again becomes a four-lane divided arterial to Interstate 85 near Henderson. The North Carolina Department of Transportation has begun a corridor study for section of US 1.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ncdot.org/projects/US1corridor/ |title=US 1 Corridor Study |publisher=NCDOT |date= |accessdate=2012-08-09[/tpl] Moreover, NCDOT is planning to finish four-laning US 1 in Richmond County past NC 177 with a Rockingham bypass to the east. There are no plans from SCDOT to widen US 1 from the state line. From Henderson into Virginia, US 1 runs parallel with I-85 as a two-lane local road until the state line, where Virginia hosts a continuous third center lane for alternate passing towards US Highway 58 before South Hill.

===Mid-Atlantic Region===

In the Mid-Atlantic region, US 1 generally serves some of the most populated areas of the east coast.  Through Virginia, US 1 is paralleled by Interstates: the remainder of Interstate 85 to Petersburg, Interstate 95 through Richmond and Fredericksburg to Alexandria, and Interstate 395 into Arlington. Within Virginia, US 1 is called Jefferson Davis Highway by state law, although most of the Fairfax County portion, except Lorton,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.google.com/#hl=en&biw=853&bih=534&sclient=psy-ab&q=%22Jefferson+Davis+Highway%22+%22Fairfax+county%22+virginia&oq=%22Jefferson+Davis+Highway%22+%22Fairfax+county%22+virginia&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&gs_sm=3&gs_upl=11867l23197l3l23961l49l36l5l0l0l9l224l4423l0.35.1l46l0&gs_l=hp.3...11867l23197l3l23961l49l36l5l0l0l9l224l4423l0j35j1l46l0.llsin&pbx=1&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.,cf.osb&fp=82ebfce347b6b593 |title=Google |publisher=Google |date= |accessdate=2012-08-09[/tpl] is better known as Richmond Highway.
US 1 crosses the Potomac River with I-395 on the 14th Street Bridges, and splits to follow mainly 14th Street and Rhode Island Avenue through the District of Columbia. US 1 is at the minimum a 3 lane (with alternate passing) from the N.C. line to Petersburg with occasional four lane divided sections. North of Petersburg is a four lane undivided roadway at the minimum to the D.C. line. 
After exiting the District into Maryland, US 1 follows the Baltimore-Washington Boulevard, the first of several modern highways built along the Baltimore-Washington corridor; I-95 is the newest, after the Baltimore-Washington Parkway. US 1 runs through the University of Maryland campus in College Park, MD. The route bypasses downtown Baltimore on North Avenue and exits the city to the northeast on Belair Road, gradually leaving the I-95 corridor, which passes through Wilmington, Delaware, for a straighter path towards Philadelphia. Around and beyond Bel Air, US 1 is a two-lane road, crossing the Susquehanna River over the top of the Conowingo Dam before entering Pennsylvania. (U.S. 1 bypasses Delaware, unlike I-95.)
The two-lane US 1 becomes a four-lane freeway, officially known as the John H. Ware III Memorial Highway, just after crossing into Pennsylvania. This bypass extends around Oxford and Kennett Square, merging into the four-lane divided Baltimore Pike just beyond the latter. At Media, US 1 again becomes a freeway – the Media Bypass – ending just beyond Interstate 476. After several name changes, the road becomes City Avenue, the western city limit of Philadelphia, at the end of which a short overlap with the Schuylkill Expressway (I-76) leads to the Roosevelt Expressway and then the twelve-lane Roosevelt Boulevard partly overlapping US 13. US 1 again becomes a freeway after leaving the city, bypassing Penndel and Morrisville and crossing the Delaware River into New Jersey on the Trenton-Morrisville Toll Bridge.
