==Education system==

Yahya Kemal College is a co-educational, English medium, day school whose curriculum corresponds to that of the Turkish Anatolian Science High Schools curriculum. Yahya Kemal Junior School follows the state curriculum enriched with extra IT and English language classes. Four languages (English, Macedonian, Turkish and Albanian) are used in lessons; three are taught as mother tongue classes (Macedonian, Albanian and Turkish). During the first year of the four-year high school education, students are given intensive English and Turkish courses. As a result of this policy, the students are able to learn and speak both languages fluently. The results obtained by the students in the international language exams like TOEFL and TOMER are a clear indication of this success.
