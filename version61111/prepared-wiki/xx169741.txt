Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz Power Station is a major power station in the Klang Valley region of Peninsular Malaysia. This power station, which fires natural gas, bunker oil and coal, is located in Kapar, Selangor. It was opened in March 1987 by then Sultan of Selangor, Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz Shah, and the station was named after him. In terms of power producing capacity, it remains the largest power station in Malaysia, despite the commissioning of several new power stations with 700MW steam turbines. It is also the first coal-fired power plant in the country.
