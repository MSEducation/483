==Production==

Chloral hydrate is produced from chlorine and ethanol in acidic solution. In basic conditions the haloform reaction takes place and chloral hydrate is decomposed by hydrolysis to form chloroform.[tpl]cite journal | url=http://jhs.pharm.or.jp/data/49%281%29/49_1.pdf | title=A Problem in the Determination of Trihalomethane by Headspace-Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry | author=Takahashi, Yasuo; Onodera, Sukeo;  Morita, Masatoshi;  and Terao, Yoshiyasu | journal=Journal of Health Science | year=2003 | volume=49 | issue=1 | pages=3 | doi=10.1248/jhs.49.1[/tpl]

==Uses==

===Building block in organic synthesis===

Chloral hydrate is a starting point for the synthesis of other organic compounds. It is the starting material for the production of chloral, which is produced by the distillation of a mixture of chloral hydrate and sulfuric acid, which serves as the desiccant.
Notably, it is used to synthesize isatin. In this synthesis, chloral hydrate reacts with aniline and hydroxylamine to give a condensation product which cyclicizes in sulfuric acid to give the target compound:[tpl]OrgSynth | title = Isatin | author = C.

===Hypnotic===

Chloral hydrate is used for the short-term treatment of insomnia and as a sedative before minor medical or dental treatment. It was largely displaced in the mid-20th century by barbituratesTariq, Syed H. and Shailaja Pulisetty; “Pharmacotherapy for Insomnia”, Clinics in Geriatric Medicine (24), 2008 p. 93-105 PMID 18035234 and subsequently by benzodiazepines. It was also formerly used in veterinary medicine as a general anesthetic. It is also still used as a sedative prior to EEG procedures, as it is one of the few available sedatives that does not suppress epileptiform discharges.http://jcc.kau.edu.sa/Files/140/Researches/11822_Chloral.pdf
In therapeutic doses for insomnia, chloral hydrate is effective within 20 to 60 minutes.[tpl]cite journal | title=Chloral hydrate: a hypnotic best forgotten? | author=Gauillard J, Cheref S, Vacherontrystram MN, Martin JC. | journal=Encephale |date=May–Jun 2002 | volume=28 | issue=3 Pt 1 | pages=200–204 | pmid=12091779[/tpl] In humans it is metabolized within 7 hours into trichloroethanol and trichloroethanol glucuronide by erythrocytes and plasma esterases and into trichloroacetic acid in 4 to 5 days.[tpl]cite web | url=http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/htdocs/st_rpts/tox059.pdf | title=NTP Technical Report on the Toxicity and Metabolism Studies of Chloral Hydrate | publisher=National Toxicology Program | work=Toxicity Report Series Number 59 | accessdate=March 14, 2013 | author=Beland, Frederick A. | pages=10[/tpl] It has a very narrow therapeutic window making this drug difficult to use. Higher doses can depress respiration and blood pressure.

==Safety==

Chloral hydrate was routinely administered to patients on the gram scale.  Prolonged exposure to the vapors is unhealthy however, with a LC50 for 4-h exposure of 440 mg/m3.  Long-term use of chloral hydrate is associated with a rapid development of tolerance to its effects and possible addiction as well as adverse effects including rashes, gastric discomfort and severe renal, cardiac and hepatic failure.[tpl]Cite book | author = Gelder, M., Mayou, R. and Geddes, J. | year = 2005 | title = Psychiatry | edition = 3rd | location = New York: Oxford | page = 238[/tpl]
Acute overdosage is often characterized by nausea, vomiting, confusion, convulsions, slow and irregular breathing, cardiac arrhythmia, and coma. The plasma, serum or blood concentrations of chloral hydrate and/or trichloroethanol, its major active metabolite, may be measured to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to aid in the medicolegal investigation of fatalities. Accidental overdosage of young children undergoing simple dental or surgical procedures has occurred. Hemodialysis has been used successfully to accelerate clearance of the drug in poisoning victims.[tpl]Cite book | author = R.

==Pharmacodynamics==

Chloral hydrate is metabolized in vivoTrichloroethanol to trichloroethanol, which is responsible for its physiological and psychological effects.Reinhard Jira, Erwin Kopp, Blaine C. McKusick, Gerhard Röderer, Axel Bosch and Gerald Fleischmann "Chloroacetaldehydes" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2007, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. [tpl]DOI|10.1002/14356007.a06_527.pub2[/tpl]
The metabolite of Chloral hydrate exerts its pharmacological properties via enhancing the GABA receptor complex[tpl]cite journal |pmid=17557503 |year=2006 |last1=Lu |first1=J |last2=Greco |title=Sleep circuitry and the hypnotic mechanism of GABAA drugs |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=S19–26 |journal=Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine|first2=MA [/tpl] and therefore is similar in action to  benzodiazepines, nonbenzodiazepines and barbiturates. It can be moderately addictive, as chronic use is known to cause dependency and withdrawal symptoms. The chemical can potentiate various anticoagulants and is weakly mutagenic in vitro and in vivo.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2007[/tpl]

==Legal status==

Chloral hydrate is illegal without prescription and a schedule IV controlled substance in the United States. Its properties have sometimes led to its use as a date rape drug.New York Daily News, 10/25/2008[tpl]Verify credibility|date=June 2011[/tpl]
Chloral hydrate is not controlled in Canada but a prescription is required to purchase the pharmaceutical forms. Possession without a prescription is not illegal and industrial trade is not regulated.
Chloral hydrate is not a controlled substance in the United Kingdom.
Chloral hydrate is a prescription-only-medicine (POM) in the Netherlands, but possession without a valid prescription will result only in seizure of the drug but not in prosecution. Production, sale and distribution are however punishable by law. It is not listed under the Dutch Opium Law, but when the intent is human consumption, it is covered by the Geneesmiddelenwet (Medicin Act).

==Hoyer's mounting medium==

Chloral hydrate is also an ingredient used for Hoyer's solution, a mounting medium for microscopic observation of diverse organisms such as bryophytes, ferns, seeds, and small arthropods (especially mites). One recipe for making Hoyer's is dissolving gum arabic (30.0 g) in water (50.0 mL), then adding chloral hydrate (200.0 g), and then finally adding glycerol (16.0 mL). An advantage of this medium include a high refraction index and clearing (macerating) properties of the small specimens (especially advantageous if specimens require observation with differential interference contrast microscopy). The major disadvantage of Hoyer's is its susceptibility to the effects of rehydration, which causes the mountant to crystallize and threatening the slide to become unusable. It is therefore absolutely necessary, after drying a mounted specimen, to thoroughly ring (2 layers are best) cover slips with a protective coating (e.g., insulating glyptol), which prevents rehydration and mountant deterioration. Chloral hydrate reportedly does not effectively clear larger specimens, or arthropods that are more heavily sclerotized (e.g., larger insects). These should first be cleared with another product (e.g., 10% KOH or NaOH), and then mounted in Hoyer's. Other disadvantages of Hoyer's (principally due to chloral hydrate) include toxicity (see above), and procurement problems due to chloral hydrate being a controlled substance. To cope with the problems of procuring chloral hydrate, a team of Rutgers scientists have developed a working substitute for chloral hydrate in microscopy, known as Visikol,http://otc.rutgers.edu/pdf/Simon-2012-146.pdf which has been demonstrated to be an effective substitute for chloral hydrate in the clearing of botanical specimens.[tpl]cite journal | url = http://www.bioone.org/doi/full/10.3732/apps.1300016 | title = An Improved Clearing and Mounting Solution to Replace Chloral Hydrate in Microscopic Applications | journal = Applications in Plant Sciences. 1(5)[/tpl]
