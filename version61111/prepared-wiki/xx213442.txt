The Black-Yellow Alliance ([tpl]lang-de|Schwarz-Gelbe Allianz[/tpl], SGA) is a monarchist movement in Austria founded on 6 August 2004. This movement is heavily influenced by the ideas of Otto von Habsburg. Their aim is the restoration of monarchy in Austria as well as a Central European monarchic union of the states which have emerged from the old Austria-Hungary.

After more than 800 years of rule of the House of Habsburg, Austria dissolved its monarchy after World War I and introduced a republic.
The Black-Yellow Alliance calls for the reintroduction of hereditary monarchy in Central Europe and advocates a union of Austria, Hungary, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, and Slovakia, united under a common emperor.Long/Palmer: Royal Tourism. Excursions around Monarchy, p. 109.
