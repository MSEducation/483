[[Marsupial]]

CATEGORIES: Marsupials

Marsupials are an infraclass of mammals living primarily in Australasia and the New World. A distinctive characteristic, common to most species, is that the young are carried in a pouch. Well-known marsupials include kangaroos, wallabies, the koala, possums, opossums, wombats and the Tasmanian devil.  Less well-known species of marsupials include the numbat, bandicoots, bettongs, the bilby, quolls, and the quokka.
Marsupials represent the clade originating with the last common ancestor of extant metatherians. Like other mammals in the Metatheria, they are characterized by giving birth to relatively undeveloped young, often residing in a pouch with the mother for a certain time after birth. Close to 70% of the 334 extant species occur in Australia, New Guinea, and nearby islands, with the remaining 100 found in the Americas, primarily in South America, but with 13 in Central America, and one in North America north of Mexico.

==Evolution==

The relationships between the three extant divisions of mammals (monotremes, marsupials, and placental mammals) was long a matter of debate among taxonomists.[tpl]cite book|author=Moyal, Ann Mozley|title=Platypus: The Extraordinary Story of How a Curious Creature Baffled the World|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|location= Baltimore|year=2004|pages= |isbn=0-8018-8052-1|oclc= |doi= |url=http://books.google.com?id=5DkezNMhSTYC&printsec=frontcover|accessdate=[/tpl] Most morphological evidence comparing traits such as number and arrangement of teeth and structure of the reproductive and waste elimination systems favors a closer evolutionary relationship between marsupials and placental mammals than either with the monotremes, as does most genetic and molecular evidence.[tpl]cite doi|10.1093/molbev/msj064[/tpl]
The ancestors of marsupials, part of a larger group called metatherians, probably split from those of placental mammals (eutherians) during the mid-Jurassic period, though no fossil evidence of metatherians themselves are known from this time.[tpl]cite journal |title=A Jurassic eutherian mammal and divergence of marsupials and placentals |journal=Nature |volume=476 |year=2011|pages=442–445 |doi= 10.1038/nature10291 |pmid=21866158 |author=Zhe-Xi Luo, Chong-Xi Yuan, Qing-Jin Meng and Qiang Ji |issue=7361[/tpl] Fossil metatherians are distinguished from eutherians by the form of their teeth; metatherians possess four pairs of molar teeth in each jaw, whereas eutherian mammals (including true placentals) never have more than three pairs.[tpl]cite book|author=Benton, Michael J.|year=1997|title=Vertebrate Palaeontology|publisher=Chapman & Hall|location= London|page=306|isbn=0-412-73810-4[/tpl] Using this criterion, the earliest known metatherian is Sinodelphys szalayi, which lived in China around 125 million years ago (mya).[tpl]cite web|last=Rincon|first=Paul|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3311911.stm|title=Oldest Marsupial Ancestor Found, BBC, Dec 2003|publisher= BBC News|date=2003-12-12|accessdate=2010-03-16[/tpl] This makes it a contemporary to some early eutherian species which have been found in the same area.[tpl]cite journal |first1=Yaoming last1=Hu |first2=Jin Meng2 last2=Chuankui Li |first3= Yuanqing |last3=Li |year=2010 |title=New basal eutherian mammal from the Early Cretaceous Jehol biota, Liaoning, China |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B |volume=277 |issue=1679 |pages=229–236 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2009.0203 |pmid=19419990 |pmc=2842663 |url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2009/05/01/rspb.2009.0203.full.pdf |last1=Hu |last2=Meng |last4=Wang |first4=Y.[/tpl]

From there, metatherians spread westward into modern North America (still attached to Eurasia), where the earliest true marsupials are found. Marsupials are difficult to distinguish from fossils, as they are characterized by aspects of the reproductive system which do not normally fossilize (including pouches) and by subtle changes in the bone and tooth structure that show a metatherian is part of the marsupial crown group (the most exclusive group that contains all living marsupials). The earliest definite marsupial fossil belongs to the species Peradectes minor, from the Paleocene of Montana, dated to about 65 million years ago.[tpl]cite journal |last1=O'Leary |first1=Maureen A. |last2=Bloch |first2=Jonathan I. |last3=Flynn |first3=John J. |last4=Gaudin |first4=Timothy J. |last5=Giallombardo |first5=Andres |last6=Giannini |first6=Norberto P. |last7=Goldberg |first7=Suzann L. |last8=Kraatz |first8=Brian P. |last9=Luo |first9=Zhe-Xi |last10=Meng |first10=Jin |last11=Ni |first11=Michael J. |last12=Novacek |first12=Fernando A. |last13=Perini |first13=Zachary S. |last14=Randall |first14=Guillermo |last15=Rougier |first15=Eric J. |last16=Sargis |first16=Mary T. |last17=Silcox |first17=Nancy b. |last18=Simmons |first18=Micelle |last19=Spaulding |first19=Paul M. |last20=Velazco |first20=Marcelo |last21=Weksler |first21=John r. |last22=Wible |first22=Andrea L. |title=The Placental Mammal Ancestor and the Post–K-Pg Radiation of Placentals |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/339/6120/662.abstract |date=8 February 2013 |journal=Science |volume=339 |pages=662–667 |doi=10.1126/science.1229237 |accessdate=9 February 2013 |pmid=23393258 |issue=6120 |last23=Cirranello |first23=A. L.[/tpl] From their point of origin in Laurasia, marsupials spread to South America, which was connected to North America until around 65 mya. Laurasian marsupials eventually died off, possibly due to competition from placental mammals for their ecological niches.
In South America, the opossums evolved and developed a strong presence, and the Paleogene also saw the evolution of shrew opossums (Paucituberculata) alongside non-marsupial metatherian predators such as the borhyaenids and the saber-toothed Thylacosmilus. South American niches for mammalian carnivores were dominated by these marsupial and sparassodont metatherians. While placental predators were absent, the metatherians did have to contend with avian (terror bird) and terrestrial crocodylomorph competition. South America and Antarctica remained connected until 35 mya, as shown by the unique fossils found there. North and South America were disconnected until about three million years ago, when the Isthmus of Panama formed. This led to the Great American Interchange. Competition from placental mammals from the north drove sparassodonts to extinction, while didelphimorphs (opossums) invaded Central America, with the Virginia opossum reaching as far north as Canada.
Marsupials reached Australia via Antarctica about 50 mya, shortly after Australia had split off. This suggests a single dispersion event of just one species, most likely a relative to South America's monito del monte (a microbiothere, the only New World australidelphian). This progenitor may have rafted across the widening, but still narrow, gap between Australia and Antarctica. In Australia, they radiated into the wide variety seen today. Modern marsupials appear to have reached the islands of Borneo and Sulawesi relatively recently via Australia.[tpl]cite book|author=Dawkins, Richard|title=The Ancestor's Tale : A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Evolution|publisher=Mariner Books|location=Boston|year=2005|pages= |isbn=0-618-61916-X|url=http://books.google.com/?id=rR9XPnaqvCMC&pg=PA223|oclc= |doi= |accessdate=[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=Hand, Suzanne J.; Long, John; Archer, Michael; Flannery, Timothy Fridtjof|title=Prehistoric mammals of Australia and New Guinea: one hundred million years of evolution|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|year= 2002|pages= |isbn=0-8018-7223-5|url=http://books.google.com/?id=92yhnRHdxSoC&printsec=frontcover|oclc= |doi= |accessdate=[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=Kemp, T.S.|title=The origin and evolution of mammals|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford Oxfordshire|year=2005|pages= |isbn=0-19-850761-5|oclc= |doi= |accessdate= [/tpl] A 2010 analysis of retrotransposon insertion sites in the nuclear DNA of a variety of marsupials has confirmed all living marsupials have South American ancestors.

In Australia, terrestrial placental mammals disappeared early in the Cenozoic (their most recent known fossils being 55 million-year-old teeth resembling those of condylarths) for reasons that are not clear, allowing marsupials to dominate the Australian ecosystem. Extant native Australian terrestrial placental mammals (such as hopping mice) are relatively recent immigrants, arriving via island hopping from Southeast Asia.

==Description==

===Early development===

An early birth removes a developing marsupial from its mother's body much sooner than in placental mammals, thus marsupials have not developed a complex placenta to protect the embryo from its mother's immune system. Though early birth puts the tiny newborn marsupial at a greater environmental risk, it significantly reduces the dangers associated with long pregnancies, as there is no need to carry a large fetus to full-term in bad seasons. Marsupials are extremely altricial animals, needing to be intensely cared for immediately following birth (cf. precocial).
Because newborn marsupials must climb up to their mother's nipples, their front limbs are much more developed than the rest of their bodies at the time of birth. This requirement possibly has resulted in the limited range of locomotor adaptations in marsupials compared to placentals. Marsupials must develop grasping forepaws during their early youth, making the transition from these limbs into hooves, wings, or flippers, as some groups of placental mammals have done, far more difficult.
An infant marsupial is known as a joey. Marsupials have a very short gestation period (about four to five weeks), and the joey is born in an essentially fetal state. The blind, furless, miniature newborn, the size of a jelly bean,[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl] crawls across its mother's fur to make its way into the pouch, where it latches onto a teat for food. It will not re-emerge for several months, during which time it develops fully. After this period, the joey begins to spend increasing lengths of time out of the pouch, feeding and learning survival skills. However, it returns to the pouch to sleep, and if danger threatens, it will seek refuge in its mother's pouch for safety.
Joeys stay in the pouch for up to a year in some species, or until the next joey is born. A marsupial joey is unable to regulate its own body temperature and relies upon an external heat source. Until the joey is well-furred and old enough to leave the pouch, a pouch temperature of [tpl]convert|30|-|32|C|F[/tpl] must be constantly maintained.

===Reproductive system===

Marsupials' reproductive systems differ markedly from those of placental mammals.[tpl]cite book|author1=R. V. Short|author2=E.

Discoveries about Marsupial Reproduction Anna King 2001. webpage (note shows code, html extension omitted) The female develops a kind of yolk sac in her womb which delivers nutrients to the embryo. Embryos of some marsupials additionally form placenta-like organs that connect them to the uterine wall, although it is not certain that they transfer nutrients from  the mother to the embryo. Pregnancy is very short, typically 4 to 5 weeks, and the embryo is born at a very young stage of development.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl]
The evolution of reproduction in marsupials, and speculation about the ancestral state of mammalian reproduction, have engaged discussion since the end of the 19th century. Both sexes possess a cloaca, which is connected to a urogenital sac used to store waste before expulsion. The bladder of marsupials functions as a site to concentrate urine and empties into the common urogenital sinus in both females and males.

====Male====

Most male marsupials, [tpl]citation needed span|except for the two largest species of kangaroo, the eastern grey kangaroo and red kangaroo|date=April 2014[/tpl], have a bifurcated penis, separated into two columns, so that the penis has two ends corresponding to the females' two vaginas.Biggers, J.

====Female====

Female marsupials have two lateral vaginas, which lead to separate uteri, but both open externally through the same orifice. A third canal, the median vagina, is used for birth. This canal can be transitory or permanent. The definitive placenta in all marsupials is generated by the yolk sac.Luckett, W.P. 1977. Ontogeny of amniote fetal membranes and their application to phylogeny. Major patterns in Vertebrate Evolution. New York, London: Plenum Publishing Corporation. p 439-516 Among three fetal membranes in mammals, the yolk sac, allantois, and amnion, only the first two form a placenta.[tpl]cite journal|last=Freyer|first=Claudia|coauthors=Renfree, Marilyn B.|title=The mammalian yolk sac placenta|journal=Journal of Experimental Zoology Part B: Molecular and Developmental Evolution|year=2009|volume=312B|issue=6|pages=545–554|doi=10.1002/jez.b.21239[/tpl]  The evolution of placentation in vertebrates is linked to the evolution of viviparity, a reproductive system in which the females retain their eggs to give birth to their young. Marsupials give birth at a very early stage of development (about four to five weeks); after birth, newborn marsupials crawl up the bodies of their mothers and attach themselves to a nipple, which is located on the underside of the mother either inside a pouch called the marsupium or open to the environment. To crawl to the nipple and attach to it, the marsupial must have well-developed forelimbs and facial structures.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2009.00690.x|last1=Sears|first1=K. E.|year=2009|title=Differences in the Timing of Prechondrogenic Limb Development in Mammals: The Marsupial-Placental Dichotomy Resolved|url= |journal=Evolution|volume=63|issue= 8|pages=2193–2200|pmid=19453378[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1046/j.1469-7580.2001.19910121.x|last1=Smith|first1=K.

There they remain for a number of weeks, attached to the nipple. The offspring are eventually able to leave the marsupium for short periods, returning to it for warmth, protection, and nourishment.

==Characteristics==

Marsupials are characterized by giving birth to relatively undeveloped young. They lack a complex placenta to protect the embryo from its mother's immune system. They have a front pouch containing multiple nipples for protection and sustenance of the young.
Some common structural features can be found among marsupials. Ossified patellae are absent in most modern marsupials, though a small number of exceptions are reported.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl] Epipubic bones are present. Marsupials (and also monotremes) also lack a gross communication (corpus callosum) between the right and left brain hemispheres.

==Taxonomy==

Taxonomically, the two primary divisions of Marsupialia are: American marsupials and the Australian marsupials.[tpl]MSW3 Gardner|pages=3–21[/tpl][tpl]MSW3 Groves|pages=22–70[/tpl] The order Microbiotheria (which has only one species, the monito del monte) is found in South America, but is believed to be more closely related to the Australian marsupials. There are many small arboreal species in each group. The term 'opossums' is properly used to refer to the American species (though 'possum' is a common diminutive), while similar Australian species are properly called 'possums'.
