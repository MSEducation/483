In 2014, 18-year-old senior Robert Marucci, who had performed in several videos on a gay pornography website, was briefly suspended from the school.  Marucci stated that he had been suspended because of his adult-film performances; school authorities denied this, asserting that they were responding to allegations that Marucci had threatened students who had taunted him for his after-school job.  Several students staged a protest at the school and on social media, demanding that Marucci be allowed to return.DeJohn, Irving.  "Florida teenage gay porn star will return class after suspension".

==Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test (FCAT) problems==

At the end of the 2005-2006 school year, Brevard Public School District conducted an internal investigation of Cocoa High which resulted in the removal of four of the school's principals. The administration at the school inaccurately reported its FCAT information. The District found that the school's principal, and three assistant principals, were involved in the scandal. All four administrators were removed from their positions.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.tampabays10.com/news/education/article.aspx?storyid=34535 |title=High school principal retires over FCAT scandal |publisher=Tampa Bay 10 |date=2006-07-01 |accessdate=2014-04-22[/tpl]
