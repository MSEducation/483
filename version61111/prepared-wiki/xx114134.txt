De La Salle Collegiate High School is an all-boys Catholic high school run by the De La Salle Christian Brothers.  Founded in 1926, the school was located on the east side of Detroit before moving to its current location in Warren, Michigan in 1982. The school is dedicated to the Catholic education of its diverse students, including the poor and disadvantaged.  It is a college preparatory school inspired by the spirit and tradition of St. John Baptist de La Salle, where learning takes place in the presence of God. Each student is encouraged to develop his faith, character, intellect, and morality.  This mission is embodied in the school’s motto:  “Builders of Boys, Makers of Men.”
The school's most notable rivals in terms of athletics are Brother Rice High School in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, Detroit Catholic Central High School in Novi, Michigan, Saint Mary's Preparatory in Orchard Lake, Michigan, and U of D Jesuit High School in Detroit, Michigan.

==History of De La Salle Collegiate==

The school first opened in 1926 across from a river called Conner Creek, but Detroit City Airport opened soon after the building of the school. The airplanes taking off would often cause the building to shake, later necessitating a change in location. The first class graduated in 1929.

==Sports==

De La Salle Collegiate is a Class A MHSAA-member school, as well as a member of the Catholic League Central Division in all sports with an enrollment of approximately 790 students from nearly 50 Metro Detroit communities and nearly 100 schools.

==Symbols==

The school’s seal is used in relation to academics.  It was redesigned in 2002 for the third time.
The school’s DLS logo was designed in the late 1960s by Sam Viviano, Class of 1971, current Art Director for Mad Magazine. It is primarily used by the sports teams.
When the school first opened in 1926, a riverboat pilot (captain) was the school's mascot. In 1937, the school changed its mascot from the riverboat pilot to the present day airplane pilot, designed by Matt Sikora.

==Student publications==

De La Salle produces an annual yearbook called The Pilot which recounts the year’s events, activities, sports and academic achievements.  It is usually distributed in the fall.
The student newspaper is called The Co-Pilot and is usually published by the journalism class.
The alumni newsletter is called The Collegiate and is published three times a year by the Office of Advancement.
