The mission of the DPS is providing physical protection of the leaders of the National Front and the monitoring of events or meetings of the party.

==1998 Parliamentary Commission on the acts of the DPS==

In 1998, a Parliamentary Commission, led by Socialist MP Bernard Grasset (Green MP Noël Mamère and conservative MP Patrick Devedjian were also part of it http://www.assembleenationale.fr/tribun/fiches_id/1124.asp), was created to investigate its acts, after several violent incidents during demonstrations and other occasions.National Assembly report The report was published on June 3, 1999, and pinpointed several cases of DPS member checking identity card of demonstrators instead of the police.[tpl]cite news | title=Un 1er Mai sous haute surveillance | publisher=France Info |date=2002-04-29|url=http://www.radiofrance.fr/chaines/france-info/chroniques/dossier/index.php?m=3&chro_diff_id=3439&imp=1[/tpl] It also pinpointed links with the Groupe Union Défense (GUD), former OAS members, mercenaries and private military contractors.Confidentiel.netNational Assembly The Parliamentary commission declared that the DPS should have been dissolved end of 1996, after the Montceau-les-Mines affair on October 25, 1996, when a DPS unit acted like an ordinary police order force, alike to the C.R.S. anti-riot units. After the creation of the Mouvement National Républicain (MNR) by Bruno Mégret, an offshoot from the FN, the DPS itself also split into two organizations, the DPS on one side and the DPA (Département Protection Assistance) on the other side.[tpl]cite news | title=DPS : trop tard pour dissoudre selon les députés | publisher=L'Humanité |date=1999-06-04 | url=http://www.humanite.fr/journal/1999-06-04/1999-06-04-290722[/tpl]

Some members of the DPS were present in covert operations in Zaire (1997 and 2001), Madagascar (in 2002, Didier Ratsiraka called for some mercenaries to resolve the political crisis http://www.meinung.vaovao.net/forum_show.php?id=343), Côte d'Ivoire (2001–2003)[tpl]cite news | title=En Afrique, une nouvelle génération de " chiens de guerre " | publisher=Le Monde Diplomatique |date=November 2004|url=http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/2004/11/LEYMARIE/11673[/tpl] (translations available in English and Persian) According to the Voltaire network, the DPS had been created with the help of Jacques Foccart and François de Grossouvre (leader of the French branch of Gladio, NATO's secret armies) after the dissolving of the Service d'Action Civique (SAC) http://membres.lycos.fr/kominform/autres/consensus.php & http://www.voltairenet.org/article7597.html.

==Bernard Courcelle's leadership until Bruno Mégret's scission==

DPS is equipped with helmets and shields, gas masks, tear gas launchers, guns that fire rubber bullets, bulletproof vests, clubs, and gloves with lead weights. DPS is alleged to have compiled computerized lists of journalists and antifascist activists with their names, addresses, and photos. They engage in punitive actions against their opponents but have, Dominique said, excellent relations with the police, including the police commissioners. They are organized in terms of military ranks such as colonel and captain. According to Liberation, the DPS now has 3,000 members. Since 1993, the group has been commanded  by Bernard Courcelle, who claims, "We only defend ourselves. We never attack the meetings of other groups." According to Reporters Sans Frontières, the DPS has records on journalists who follow the Front National's activities and, on several occasions, was responsible for the beating up of reporters.[tpl]cite news | title=Les violences de l’extrême droite contre la presse, un danger à prendre au sérieux | publisher=Reporters Sans Frontières |date=2002-06-21 | url=http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=2649[/tpl] After Bruno Mégret's split, Bernard Courcelle followed him with 1,700 men from the DPS, and Jean-Marie Le Pen named Marc Bellier to fill his place, and then Jean-Pierre Chabrut[tpl]cite news | title=Le chef du DPS ira à Marignane | publisher=L'Humanité |date=1999-01-22 | url=http://www.humanite.presse.fr/journal/1999-01-22/1999-01-22-441929[/tpl]
