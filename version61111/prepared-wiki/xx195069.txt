There is a reference to another Victor F.C. playing in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.April 28, 1915 The Globe  This team could be either the team in Camden or the one in Bethlehem as Camden and Philadelphia sit adjacent to each other in the Delaware Valley and Bethlehem teams frequently played in the Philadelphia leagues.  However, this is unlikely as both Victor F.C. of Philadelphia and Victor T.M. of Camden played in the 1914-1915 Allied League.March 3, 1915 The Globe
