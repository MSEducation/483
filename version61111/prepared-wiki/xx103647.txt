[[110th United States Congress]]

CATEGORIES: 110th United States Congress

The One Hundred Tenth United States Congress was the meeting of the legislative branch of the United States federal government, between January 3, 2007, and January 3, 2009, during the last two years of the second term of President George W. Bush. It was composed of the Senate and the House of Representatives. The apportionment of seats in the House was based on the 2000 U.S. census.
The Democratic Party controlled a majority in both chambers for the first time since the end of the 103rd Congress in 1995. Although the Democrats held fewer than 50 Senate seats, they had an operational majority because the two independent senators caucused with the Democrats for organizational purposes. No Democratic-held seats had fallen to the Republican Party in the 2006 elections.CBS News, Voters Usher Out Republicans Democrat Nancy Pelosi became the first woman Speaker of the House.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/01/04/congress.rdp/index.html |title=Pelosi becomes first woman House speaker| publisher=CNN.com |author=Deirdre Walsh |date=January 4, 2007 |accessdate=January 4, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070106022356/http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/01/04/congress.rdp/index.html  |archivedate = January 6, 2007[/tpl] The House also received the first Muslim (Keith Ellison)ruthholladay.com - Andre Carson on identity and beliefDAWN (Newspaper) and Buddhist (Hank Johnson and Mazie Hirono)[tpl]cite news|title = Washington Journal: Campaign 2006 In Review|date = November 24, 2006|accessdate = December 16, 2006 |publisher = AsianWeek|url = http://news.asianweek.com/news/view_article.html?article_id=ec058dc49ba86eafad5319127b1f4bc7|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071121101653/http://news.asianweek.com/news/view_article.html?article_id=ec058dc49ba86eafad5319127b1f4bc7|archivedate = 2007-11-21|last = Nash|first = Phil Tajitsu[/tpl] members of Congress.

===Support for the Iraq War===

Following President Bush's 2007 State of the Union Address, Congress debated his proposal to create a troop surge to increase security in Iraq. The House of Representatives passed a non-binding measure opposing the surge and then a $124 billion emergency spending measure to fund the war, which included language that dictated troop levels and withdrawal schedules. President Bush, however, vetoed the bill as promised, making this his second veto while in office.  Both houses of Congress subsequently passed a bill funding the war without timelines, but with benchmarks for the Iraqi government and money for other spending projects like disaster relief.
