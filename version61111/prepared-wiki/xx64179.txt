She began to seek film work in the United States in the late 1990s and, after appearing in small-scale dramas The Last Days of Disco (1998) and Brokedown Palace (1999), she had a break-out year in 2001 with starring roles in the war film Pearl Harbor and the romantic comedy Serendipity. She built on this success with appearances in the biopic The Aviator (2004) and the comedy Click (2006).
Beckinsale appeared in 2003's Underworld and has since starred in Van Helsing (2004), Underworld: Evolution (2006), Whiteout (2009), as well as Contraband, Underworld: Awakening, and Total Recall (all in 2012).

Beckinsale next starred in an ITV adaptation of Jane Austen's Emma, playing Emma to Mark Strong's Mr Knightley and Samantha Morton's Harriet Smith. "You shouldn't necessarily like Emma," Beckinsale has said of her character. "You do love her, but in the way the family of a teenage girl could be exasperated by her outrageous behaviour and still love her." The programme was aired in autumn 1996, just months after Gwyneth Paltrow had starred in a film adaptation of the same story.

Beckinsale rose to fame in 2001 with a leading role in the war film Pearl Harbor as a nurse torn between two pilots, played by Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett.

Beckinsale became known as an action star following an appearance as a vampire in 2003's Underworld.

Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times felt she played the role "with a white trash verve" and found that her character's "raw ache for that someone with money and respectability is palpable".[tpl]cite news |title=Its bits and pieces just don't fit |author=Betsy Sharkey |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/aug/07/entertainment/et-fragments7 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=7 August 2009 |accessdate=6 October 2011[/tpl] However, Dargis felt that Beckinsale and her cast mates have a "tough time filling out characters that are at best abstractions of grief and often just clichés".[tpl]cite news |title=Several Points of View on a Single, Cruel Event |author=Manohla Dargis |url=http://movies.nytimes.com/2009/07/31/movies/31fragments.html |newspaper=New York Times |date=30 July 2009 |accessdate=6 October 2011[/tpl] The film received a very limited theatrical release in New York and Los Angeles; it was released simultaneously on DVD.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/peace-arch-release-fragments-friday-87100 | work=The Hollywood Reporter | title=Peace Arch to release 'Fragments' on Friday | date=30 July 2009[/tpl] Also in 2008, Beckinsale starred in Nothing but the Truth as a journalist who refuses to reveal her source. The film, co‑starring Vera Farmiga and Matt Dillon, was inspired by the case of Judith Miller. As part of her research for the role, "I spent some time at The L.A. Times with some female reporters, and I spoke to Judith Miller about her experience...I really researched the hell out of that one and it was an amazingly fulfilling, brilliant experience." Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post asserted that Beckinsale and Farmiga played "two of the most fascinating female movie characters to hit screens in a long while, and they've been brought to life by two gifted actresses, each working at the top of her game".[tpl]cite news |title='Nothing but the Truth' Is Taut, Political Thriller |author=Ann Hornaday |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/27/AR2009042703360.html |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=28 April 2009 |accessdate=6 October 2011[/tpl] Beckinsale received a Critic's Choice Award nomination for her performance.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bfca.org/ccawards/2008.php  |title=The BFCA Critics' Choice Awards: 2008|accessdate=6 October 2011 |work= |publisher=Broadcast Film Critics Association [/tpl] The film never received a full theatrical release after the distributor filed for bankruptcy[tpl]cite web |url=http://popdose.com/the-popdose-interview-rod-lurie/ |title=The Popdose Interview |accessdate=6 October 2011 |work= |publisher=Popdose [/tpl] and the film has grossed just $186,702 worldwide.[tpl]cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=nothingbutthetruth08.htm |title=Nothing But the Truth |publisher=Box Office Mojo |date= |accessdate=19 May 2012[/tpl] "I have prayed – prayed – for film companies to go bankrupt on films I've made, and then this happens on the one I love," said Beckinsale.

In 2009, Beckinsale starred in the comic-book adaption Whiteout as a U.S. Marshal tasked with investigating a murder in Antarctica. It was filmed in Manitoba, Canada. She found the action scenes less physically demanding than those in Underworld because "three pairs of trousers and a parka gives you a bit more protection than the latex suit". The film was critically panned and a box office failure, failing to recoup its budget.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/10008655-whiteout/ |title=Whiteout |accessdate=6 October 2011 |work= |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes [/tpl] She also made a brief cameo in the prequel Underworld: Rise of the Lycans; she appeared in flashforwards composed of footage from 2003's Underworld.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.filmstalker.co.uk/archives/2009/01/beckinsale_is_in_underworld_3.html |title=Beckinsale is in Underworld 3 |accessdate=11 October 2011 |work= |publisher=Film Stalker [/tpl] Also in 2009, Beckinsale starred in the family drama Everybody's Fine alongside Robert De Niro, Drew Barrymore, and Rockwell, her Snow Angels co-star. Beckinsale was excited for the opportunity to work with De Niro whom she had first encountered "years and years ago when I just had Lily and he was putting together a reading of The Good Shepherd. I was in New York because Michael Sheen was doing Amadeus".

===Return to acting (2012)===

Beckinsale returned to acting in 2012 with appearances in three action films. Beckinsale first appeared in the action thriller Contraband. She had a supporting role as the wife of Mark Wahlberg's character, a former criminal who gets forced back into a life of crime after his family members are threatened. The film was directed by Baltasar Kormákur, who also starred in the Icelandic language version of the film, Reykjavík-Rotterdam.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=32109 |title=Trailer For Contraband Hits Online |accessdate=6 October 2011 |work= |publisher=Empire [/tpl] The San Francisco Chronicle felt Beckinsale was "stuck in a bit of a thankless role as the victimised wife, but she does try to infuse a harder edge to the character".[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2012/01/11/national/a125113S27.DTL|title=Review: Wahlberg does one last job in `Contraband'|author=Christy Lemire |date=11 January 2012 |publisher=SFGate |accessdate=17 January 2012[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] The Hollywood Reporter stated that "Beckinsale, her innate classiness calibrated down a few notches, has little to do but be supportive, worried and, eventually, besieged".[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/contraband-review-mark-wahlberg-280621|title=Contraband: Film Review|author=Todd McCarthy |date=11 January 2012 |work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=17 January 2012[/tpl] Entertainment Weekly felt that the "woman-in-peril stuff is second-rate, giving off a whiff of exploitation"[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20483133_20556653,00.html|title=Contraband (2012)|author=Owen Gleiberman |date=12 January 2012|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=17 January 2012[/tpl] while Variety found the repeated violence towards Beckinsale's character disturbing.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117946821?refcatid=31|title=Contraband|author=Justin Chang|date=11 January 2012|work=Variety|accessdate=17 January 2012[/tpl] The film had a production budget of $25 million and has grossed over $96 million worldwide.[tpl]cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=contraband.htm |title=Contraband (2012) |publisher=Box Office Mojo |date= |accessdate=19 May 2012[/tpl] Beckinsale next reprised her role as Selene in the fourth instalment of the vampire franchise Underworld: Awakening. The franchise was initially conceived of as a trilogy and Beckinsale was not "intending to do another one" but was convinced by the quality of the script.[tpl]cite web |url=http://collider.com/kate-beckinsale-underworld-4-awakening-interview/109777/ |title=Beckinsale |accessdate=6 October 2011 |work= |publisher=Collider [/tpl] The Hollywood Reporter noted that "when she’s not actually fighting, her performance consists of little more than striding purposefully toward or away from the camera".[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/underworld-awakening-review-kate-beckinsale-283605 | work=The Hollywood Reporter | first=Frank | last=Scheck | title=Underworld: Awakening: Film Review[/tpl] The Los Angeles Times remarked that she "finally manages to perfect the monotone delivery she'd been honing for the series' first two entries".[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-underworld-awakening-20120123,0,54079.story?track=rss | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Glenn | last=Whipp | title=Movie review: 'Underworld: Awakening' | date=23 January 2012[/tpl] The film had a production budget of $70 million and has grossed over $160 million worldwide.[tpl]cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=underworld4.htm |title=Underworld Awakening (2012) |publisher=Box Office Mojo |date= |accessdate=19 May 2012[/tpl] With adjustments for inflation, Underworld:Awakening is the lowest grossing Beckinsale-led film in the franchise.http://boxofficemojo.com/people/chart/?id=katebeckinsale.htm
Also in 2012, Beckinsale appeared as the villainess in the sci-fi action remake Total Recall, directed by her husband Len Wiseman.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=31644 |title=Exclusive: Colin Farrell On Total Recall |accessdate=6 October 2011 |work= |publisher=Empire [/tpl] She has said that Wiseman joined the project because he was unable to receive studio financing for an original sci-fi idea: "You’re constantly finding yourself having to defend doing a remake when you didn’t really want to make one in the first place." The film received mainly negative reviews.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/total_recall_2010/ |title=Total Recall |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |date=5 August 2012 |accessdate=21 August 2012[/tpl] Variety found her performance "one-note" while The Hollywood Reporter described her as "one-dimensional".[tpl]cite news|last=Chang |first=Justin |url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117947985?refcatid=31 |title=Variety Reviews – Total Recall – Film Reviews – New U.S. Release – Review by Justin Chang |publisher=Variety.com |date=1 August 2012 |accessdate=21 August 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/total-recall-film-review-colin-farrell-357781?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+thr%2Ffilm+%28The+Hollywood+Reporter+-+Movies%29&utm_content=Google+Reader |title=Total Recall: Film Review |publisher=The Hollywood Reporter |date=8 February 2012 |accessdate=21 August 2012 |first=Justin |last=Lowe[/tpl] USA Today remarked that she "spends much of the movie strutting down hallways and looking relentlessly, though blandly, nasty".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/reviews/story/2012-08-03/total-recall-colin-farrell-kate-beckinsale-jessica-biel/56720862/1?csp=34life&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+UsatodaycomMovies-TopStories+%28Life+-+Movies+-+Top+Stori |title=Rebel against this relentless 'Total Recall' remake – |publisher=Usatoday.com |date= 2 August 2012|accessdate=21 August 2012[/tpl] The New York Post asserted that Beckinsale "vastly overstays her welcome".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/movies/total_recoil_nfbehr1NMDgULWVeiupeTJ |title=Colin Farrell doesn’t have a shot at living up to Arnold Schwarzenegger in regrettable remake of 'Total Recall' |publisher=NYPOST.com |date=2 August 2012 |accessdate=21 August 2012 |first=Kyle |last=Smith[/tpl] The film has grossed $198 million from a production budget of over $200 million.[tpl]cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=totalrecall2012.htm |title=Total Recall (2012) (2012) |publisher=Box Office Mojo |date=3 August 2012 |accessdate=21 August 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Barnes |first=Brooks |url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/05/total-recall-remake-struggles-at-box-office/ |title='Total Recall' Remake Struggles at Box Office - NYTimes.com |publisher=Artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com |date=5 August 2012 |accessdate=21 August 2012[/tpl]

===Legal actions===

In July 2003, the Press Complaints Commission dismissed a complaint filed by Beckinsale. Beckinsale had claimed that the Daily Mail invaded her and her daughter's privacy by publishing photographs of the actress embracing and kissing her new partner Len Wiseman.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2003/jul/31/dailymail.pressandpublishing | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Ciar | last=Byrne | title=Mail did not invade Beckinsale's privacy | date=31 July 2003[/tpl] The article was headlined "Mummy's latest love scene leaves Lily unimpressed" and included a picture in which her four-year-old daughter appeared to be ignoring her mother's romantic actions. The Commission found that "the photographs had been taken in a public place and did not reveal any private details about Lily—such as her health or schooling—but were restricted to general observations about her apparent reaction to her surroundings". In August 2003, Beckinsale received a published apology from the Daily Mail after the newspaper reported that she had "spent time in a clinic" following her split from partner Michael Sheen.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2003/aug/22/dailymail.pressandpublishing?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487 | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Ciar | last=Byrne | title=Mail apologises to Pearl Harbor star | date=22 August 2003[/tpl] The apology was issued after the actress filed a complaint with the Press Complaints Commission.
