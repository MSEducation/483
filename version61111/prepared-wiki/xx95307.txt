Adobe Photoshop Elements is a raster graphics editor for hobbyists and consumers. It contains most of the features of the professional version but with fewer and simpler options. The program allows users to create, edit, organize and share images. It is a successor of Adobe Photoshop LE.
Originally introduced alongside Adobe Photoshop version 6, Photoshop Elements targets photography enthusiasts and thus lacks many features that make it useful in a proper print production environment.[tpl]cite journal | last = Barkey | first = Jonathan| |title = Editor's Choice 3.0: Software | journal = American Photo | volume = 12 | issue = 4| page = 92 | publisher = Hachette Filipacchi Magazines | date = July 2001 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=BJohcG6y9csC&pg=PA92| issn = 1046-8986[/tpl] For example, Photoshop Elements cannot export files in the CMYK color mode, supports a simplified color management system, and excludes detailed soft-proofing. It also includes a limited set of Photoshop plugins, and instead has a number of features aimed at non-experts (such as removing the red-eye effect or changing the skin tone in a picture). An example of a redesigned feature would be the Variations correction dialog. Some versions can, however, open, edit, and save PDFs.[tpl]Which|date=January 2014[/tpl]
