Montmartre Cemetery ([tpl]lang-fr|link=no|Cimetière de Montmartre[/tpl]) is a cemetery in the 18th arrondissement of Paris, France.

==History==

Cemeteries have been banned from Paris since the Cimetière des Innocents closed in 1786, as they created health hazards. In the early 19th century, new cemeteries located outside the precincts of the capital replaced all the Parisian ones: Montmartre in the north, Père Lachaise Cemetery in the east, Passy Cemetery in the west and Montparnasse Cemetery in the south.
Located west of the Butte, near the beginning of Rue Caulaincourt in Place de Clichy, the cemetery in the Montmartre quarter of Paris is built below street level in the hollow of an old quarry with its entrance on Avenue Rachel under Rue Caulaincourt.
A popular tourist destination, it is the final resting place of many famous artists who lived and worked in the Montmartre area.
