Victor Musgrave (1919â€“1984) was a British poet, art dealer and curator. Described by David Sylvester as a 'true pioneer' Musgrave was the first gallerist to show Bridget Riley and was a champion of Art Brut. He often bragged that he was the only art dealer who did not wear a tie.

In the 1950s he had several exhibits of work by Francis Newton Souza. He also gave the British artist Bridget Riley her first exhibition. Victor Musgrave was married to the internationally renown portrait photograper Ida Kar.
