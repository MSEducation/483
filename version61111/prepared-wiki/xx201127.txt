[[Holomatix Rendition]]

CATEGORIES: 3D graphics software, Global illumination software, Rendering systems

Holomatix Rendition was a raytracing renderer, which was broadly compatible with mental ray. Its rendering method was similar to that of FPrime in that it displayed a continuously refined rendered image until final production quality image was achieved. This differs to traditional rendering methods where the rendered image is built up block-by-block.
It was developed by Holomatix Ltd, based in London, UK. As of December 2011, the Rendition product has been retired and is no longer available or being updated. The product is no longer mentioned on the developer's web site, either. The successor is SprayTrace.
