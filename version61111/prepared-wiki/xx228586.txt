==Development==

Barry Hall's access to specialist 'virtual' motorcycle design centres and established UK vehicle production and engineering facilities enabled the company to progress from the initial vision to production of motorcycles in three years. The original design sketches were produced in July 2005 and test production began in September 2007. By December 2007 the range was on sale worldwide.
Megelli Motorcycles are designed and engineered in the UK using new bespoke tooling for the majority of components with final assembly in China. Approximately 75% of the components are from Taiwanese companies. This includes the engines with high specification ceramic coated cylinders from SYM and speedometer from KOSO. The main frame, swinging arm, sub frame and engine cradle, all forged components are also from Taiwanese based companies.

==Model range==

There are three bikes in the Megelli motorcycle range,http://www.megelli.com/megelli-motorbikes.shtml all featuring the same 125 cc, [tpl]convert|11|kW|bhp|abbr=on[/tpl], four-stroke engine, and frame. 
The Motard is a supermoto-styled road bike. The 125M has a seat height of [tpl]convert|860|mm|abbr=on[/tpl] and a wheelbase of [tpl]convert|1400|mm|abbr=on[/tpl], longer and higher than either of the street-styled bikes due to the length of the suspension and shocks. There is also the racing styled 125R, full faired with a split twin headlamp assembly. Seat height: [tpl]convert|800|mm|abbr=on[/tpl]. Wheelbase: [tpl]convert|1349.6|mm|abbr=on[/tpl]. Finally, the Naked 125S version is almost identical to the 125R all be it with significantly less aero parts and a single front light assembly. Seat height: [tpl]convert|800|mm|abbr=on[/tpl]. Wheelbase: [tpl]convert|1349.6|mm|abbr=on[/tpl].
All three bikes feature an under seat exhaust.
Megelli has finished working on a 250 cc engine version for the American, Asia and Australian markets. The bore and stroke was increased from [tpl]convert|56.5|×|49.5|mm|abbr=on[/tpl] to [tpl]convert|65.5|×|68|mm|abbr=on[/tpl]. Keeping with the single-cylinder four-stroke design has meant that horsepower was increased from 11 hp to around 26 hp. Weight was increased from [tpl]convert|110|to|112.5|kg|abbr=on[/tpl]. The 250 is available as in the same three configurations as the 125R/S/M.
