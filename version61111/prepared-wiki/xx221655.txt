In January 1996 Thomas moved again, this time to Gillingham. The Kent-based club was challenging for promotion from the Football League Third Division and manager Tony Pulis was looking to strengthen his team. Thomas remained with the "Gills" until the end of the 1997–98 season, but played only 30 matches,[tpl]cite book |   first=Tony|last= Brown |   title=The Definitive Gillingham F.C.: A Complete Record|   publisher=Soccerdata|   year=2003|   isbn=1-899468-20-X|pages=p126[/tpl] his opportunities being restricted by a succession of injuries. One such injury occurred in November 1996 as the team were training for an upcoming Football League Cup match against Ipswich Town of the First Division. Thomas jumped for the ball but lost his balance and stumbled into a nearby tree. A branch hit him in the face and he was taken to hospital where he required surgery to save his sight. Pulis commented that the player had come within an inch of losing his eye.[tpl]cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:LTIB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0F924AA134F4EC77&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D0CB57AB53DF815|title=Shooting star – Football|author=Simon Barnes|work=The Times|date=30 November 1996|accessdate=4 October 2008[/tpl]

His final match at a professional level was in October 1998, in a 3–1 defeat to Mansfield Town.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/players_details.sd?playerid=7879&seasonid=128|title=Games played by Glen Thomas in 1998/1999|publisher=Soccerbase|accessdate=4 October 2008[/tpl] He subsequently dropped into non-league football with Barking, and went on to play for several other clubs in the Isthmian League.
