In demonology Ziminiar or Zymymar is one of the four principal kings that have power on the seventy-two demons supposedly constrained by King Solomon (according to the Lesser Key of Solomon), and is not to be conjured except on great occasions. The other three kings are Amaymon, Corson and Gaap (although some translations of The Lesser Key of Solomon consider Belial, Beleth, Asmodai and Gaap, not giving detail on the cardinal point they rule).
