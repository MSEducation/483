==Political career==

Beaumier was first elected in 1993 in the riding of Brampton. In 1997, she was re-elected, this time in the newly created riding of Brampton West—Mississauga, where she won again on November 27, 2000.  During the federal election of 2004, she defeated former provincial Minister of Health Tony Clement in the newly created riding of Brampton West.  In 2006, she was again re-elected, her fifth such mandate.
As a Member of Parliament, she has remained a frequent spokesperson for human rights. At the 1995 global conference on the Inter-Parliamentary Union at the United Nations, she spoke on the dangers of global income disparities. In response to human rights violations uncovered during the Somali Inquiry, she authored a private member’s bill, Bill C-208, which increased transparency in the bureaucracy and established tougher penalties for the destruction of documents.
In 1999, Beaumier was criticized for firing a single mother working in her office. She said, "I'm not comfortable with the fact that she's a single mother." Carole-Anne Hoard chose to become artificially inseminated with her late husband's sperm. Beaumier informed Hoard of her decision just before she was to return from maternity leave. Hoard said, "I watched my husband die. I think I have gone through enough. I need to work. As you can imagine, I've been reeling from the events of my life." Beaumier defended her decision, saying that politics was too insecure a profession for someone in Hoard's position.[tpl]cite news |title='Uncomfortable' MP cuts single mom's job |last=McGregor |first=Glen |newspaper=Calgary Herald |date=April 4, 1999 |page=A8[/tpl]
