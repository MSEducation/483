==History==

The Izaro was on its way to Maryport with a cargo of iron ore when she ran aground on Tomlin Rocks, St Bees on 20 May 1907. The crew scrambled to safety, but the ship was stuck fast, with bow and stern on the rocks, but midships unsupported. The weight of her cargo caused the ship to split in two. The cargo was salvaged, but the ship was a total loss. The ironwork in the ship was salvaged as far as possible, and what couldn't be salvaged was dragged out to sea. Today, the remains of her boilers and keel can still be seen.
