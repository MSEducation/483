==Plot summary==

Victory Gundam is set in UC 0153, and succeeds the Federation and Crossbone Vanguard conflict of Gundam F-91.
The greatly weakened Earth Federation comes under attack by the forces of the spaceborn Zanscare Empire; only the AEUG-like League Militaire stands in their way. The mass-produced Victory Gundam is the League Militaire's secret weapon against the invading BESPA. However, BESPA's power continues to grow, using violent means, including public executions with guillotines, to strike fear into the Earth. Living peacefully on Earth, 13-year-old Uso Ewin and his childhood friend Shakti Kareen are soon thrown into the conflict when they encounter ace BESPA pilot Chronicle Asher. Soon, Uso finds himself joining forces with Marbet Fingerhut and the rest of the League Militaire, piloting the Victory Gundam against the BESPA, and soon discovering the horrors of war.

==Production and development==

Victory Gundam, the first of four Gundam television series that aired on TV Asahi in Japan sequentially from 1993 through 1996 and the second longest Gundam television show with 51 episodes (SD Gundam Force is the first with 52 episodes), also featuring the youngest protagonist in the Gundam franchise: the thirteen-year-old Uso Ewin. It is possibly the zenith of Yoshiyuki Tomino's "Kill 'em all"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoshiyukiTomino tendency, as the casualty rate of the main cast is extremely high on both sides of the conflict.
