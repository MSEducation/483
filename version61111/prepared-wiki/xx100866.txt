==Early life==

Born in Trinidad and Tobago, Haddaway moved to Washington, D.C. at the age of nine, where he grew up to the sounds of Louis Armstrong, which encouraged Haddaway to learn how to play trumpet at the age of 14.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.yme-entertainment.com/index.php/2013-06-18-21-02-51/haddaway|title=YMe: Haddaway (Biography)|publisher=YMe|accessdate=2013-12-09[/tpl] This eventually resulted in him forming his first group which he called Chances. Haddaway moved to Cologne, Germany in 1987 where he mostly worked in bars. Later, he formed his own company, Energy, which was involved in organizing fashion shows and photo-shoots.

==Musical career==

Haddaway's break came in 1992 when he was signed by German label Coconut Records.  His first single  "What Is Love" rapidly became popular across Europe, reaching number 2 in Germany and in the United Kingdom. In Germany, the single sold 900,000 copies, in the UK, it was certified Gold for shipment of 400,000 units.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bpi.co.uk/certifiedawards/search.aspx|title=BPI: Certified Awards Search |publisher=British Phonographic Industry|accessdate=2011-08-13[/tpl] It later reached number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was certified gold for shipments of 500,000 units. By the beginning of 1994, worldwide sales of "What Is Love" had already reached 2.6 million.
His second single "Life" hit number 2 in Germany, number 6 in the UK and number 41 in the USA, and its worldwide sales had reached 1.5 million by 1994. The follow-up singles "I Miss You" and "Rock My Heart" were also top 10 smashes across Europe and established him as a successful Eurodance artist. His first LP The Album was also a multi-million seller which reached Platinum status in Germany for shipments of 500,000,[tpl]cite certification|region=Germany|artist=Haddaway|accessdate=2011-08-13[/tpl] and Gold in the UK and France for shipment of 100,000 respectively.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.disqueenfrance.com/fr/page-259165.xml?year=1995&type=8|title=Les certifications: Certifications Albums Or - année 1995|publisher=Disque en France|accessdate=2011-08-13[/tpl]
In 1995, he released his second album The Drive, which spawned the UK top 20 hit "Fly Away", as well as "Catch a Fire" and "Lover Be Thy Name".
Subsequent albums are more soulful, but since 1998, Haddaway has struggled to repeat the mainstream commercial success of his early hits.
Haddaway appeared on the Comeback reality television show in Germany in 2004. He appeared on a similar UK show, Hit Me Baby One More Time, in 2005 and subsequently appeared on the U.S. version.  This exposure led to him scoring a moderate chart hit in Germany with the ballad "Spaceman".
"What Is Love" enjoyed a resurge in popularity as the theme music for the head-bobbing, nightclubbing-addicted Butabi brothers (Will Ferrell and Chris Kattan) on Saturday Night Live and the subsequent film A Night at the Roxbury.  The song was also featured in a 2008 PEPSI commercial (for diet Pepsi Max) which parodied the Leitmotif and included several stars including LL Cool J, Missy Elliott and Busta Rhymes, but not Haddaway.YouTube "
