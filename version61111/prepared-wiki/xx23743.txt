The pyramidal orchid, Anacamptis pyramidalis, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Genus Anacamptis of the family Orchidaceae. The scientific name Anacamptis derives from Greek ανακάμτειν 'anakamptein' meaning 'bend forward', while the Latin name pyramidalis refers to the pyramidal form of the inflorescence.

==Description==

This hardy plant reaches on average [tpl]convert|10|-|25|cm|in[/tpl] of height, with a maximum of [tpl]convert|60|cm|in[/tpl]. The stem is erect and unbranched. The basal leaves are linear-lanceolate with parallel venation, up to [tpl]convert|25|cm[/tpl] long, the cauline ones are shorter and barely visible on the stem. The arrangement of hermaphroditic flowers in a compact pyramidal shape is very distinctive and gives the orchid its common name. The colour of the flower varies from pink to purple, or rarely white, and the scent is described as "foxy".  The flowers have six tepals, being three small sepals and three petals. Two small petals are on the sides, while the third and lower (labellum)  is large and bilobate. At the back of the flower there is a tubular spur of about [tpl]convert|1.5|cm|in[/tpl] long, while the labellum bears two lateral small flaps. The flowering period extends from April through July.

==Reproduction==

The flowers are pollinated by butterflies and moths. To ensure the fertilization, their morphology is well adapted to the proboscis of Lepidoptera, especially Euphydryas, Melanargia, Melitaea, Pieris and Zygaena species. The mechanism by which its pairs of pollinia attach themselves to an insect's proboscis was discovered by Charles Darwin and described in his book on the Fertilisation of Orchids.[tpl]harvnb|Darwin|1862|pp=20–24, 37[/tpl]

==Distribution==

This orchid is native to southwestern Eurasia, from western Europe through the Mediterranean region eastwards to Iran. In Germany, it is rare and was declared Orchid of the Year in 1990 to heighten awareness of this plant.

==Habitat==

Anacamptis pyramidalis requires a sunny spot on diverse soils: loamy or clay. It can even grow on very alkaline soil. It can be found on meadows or dry and well exposed slopes, at an altitude of [tpl]convert|0|-|2000|m[/tpl] above sea level.

==Varieties==

There are some notable varieties, which are sometimes treated as subspecies – and as they seem to be limited to certain regions, this may be correct:
The variety alba can be found anywhere in the Pyramidal Orchid's range; its flowers are white.

==Medicinal uses==

The dried and ground tuber gives a fine white powder, called salep. This is a very nutritious sweet starchlike substance. It is used in drinks, cereals and in making bread. It is also used medicinally in diets for children and convalescents.

==Culture==

The pyramidal orchid was voted the County flower of the Isle of Wight in 2002 following a poll by the wild flora conservation charity Plantlife.Plantlife website County Flowers page
