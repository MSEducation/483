CATEGORIES: Orders of magnitude (length)

To help compare different orders of magnitude this page lists lengths between 10 and 100 kilometres (104 to 105 metres).  The myriametre (10,000 metres) is a deprecated unit name; the prefix myria- is obsolete, not included among the prefixes when the International System of Units was introduced in 1960.
