CATEGORIES: Lists of monarchs, German kings, Lists of political office-holders in Germany

It also includes the heads of the various German confederations after the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation in 1806.

==Note on titles==

The relationship between the title of "king" and "emperor" in the area that is today called Germany is just as complicated as the history and the structure of the Holy Roman Empire itself.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2012[/tpl] The Kingdom of Germany predates the Empire.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2012[/tpl]
Emperors are listed in bold. Rival kings, anti-kings, and junior co-regents are italicized.
