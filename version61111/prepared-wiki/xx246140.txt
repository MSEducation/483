==Relationship between arterial stiffness and pulse wave velocity==

The study of the basic scientific principles of the velocity of the pulse wave through the arterial tree dates back to 1808 with the work of Thomas Young.[tpl]cite journal |author=Young T |title=The Croonian Lecture: On the functions of the heart and arteries |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London |volume=99 |pages=1–31 |year=1809 |url=http://rstl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/99/1.2.full.pdf+html |doi=10.1098/rstl.1809.0001[/tpl] The relationship between pulse wave velocity (PWV) and arterial wall stiffness can be calculated from first principles from Newton's second law of motion;
Using some simplifying assumptions, the Moens–Korteweg equation can be derived,[tpl]cite web |author=Butlin M |title=Structural and function effects on large artery stiffness: an in-vivo experimental investigation |year=2007 |publisher=Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, University of New South Wales |url=http://unsworks.unsw.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unsworks:1432[/tpl][tpl]cite book |author=Milnor, William R. |title=Hemodynamics |publisher=Williams & Wilkins |location=Baltimore |year=1982 |isbn=0-683-06050-3 [/tpl] an equation that directly relates PWV and artery wall stiffness.

==Measuring pulse wave velocity==

===Using the velocity of the forward traveling wave===

This holds true for a system with zero wave reflections.  The transmission of the arterial pressure pulse does not give the true PWV as it is a sum of vectors of the incident and reflected waves.  Therefore, appropriate pressure and flow measurements must be made to estimate the characteristic impedance and to calculate the incident, or the reflected pressure wave at two separate locations a known distance apart (although there might be come conceptual problems with the term “wave reflection” in the arterial system).

===Using two simultaneously measured pressure waves===

An alternate method of measuring PWV utilizes the feature of the arterial waveform that during late diastole and early systole, there is no, or minimal, interference of the incident pressure wave by the reflected pressure wave.[tpl]cite journal |author=Bramwell JC, Hill AV |title=Velocity transmission of the pulse wave and elasticity of arteries  |journal=Lancet |volume=199 |pages=891–2 |year=1922 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(00)95580-6 |issue=5149 [/tpl] With this assumption, PWV can be measured between two sites a known distance apart using the pressure `foot' of the waveform to calculate the transit time.  Exactly locating the pressure waveform foot can be subjective and less than accurate. The advantage of foot-to-foot PWV measurement is the simplicity of measurement, requiring only two pressure wave forms recorded with invasive catheters, or mechanical tonometers or pulse detection devices applied non-invasively to the pulse across the skin, where the site of the two measurements are a known distance apart.[tpl]cite journal |author=Boutouyrie P, Briet M, Collin C, Vermeersch S, Pannier B |title=Assessment of pulse wave velocity |journal=Artery Research |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=3–8 |date=February 2009 |doi=10.1016/j.artres.2008.11.002 [/tpl]

===Using pressure and flow===

Bramwell & Hill[tpl]cite journal |author=Bramwell JC, Hill AV |title=The velocity of the pulse wave in man |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series B |volume=93 |pages=298–306 |year=1922 |doi= 10.1098/rspb.1922.0022|jstor=81045 |issue=652[/tpl] cited the Moens-Kortweg equation and proposed a series of substitutions relevant to observable haemodynamic measures. Quoting directly, these substitutions were:
A similarity between the Moens-Kortweg equation and Newton's equation for the wave speed in a material is evident and both the Moens-Kortweg and Bramwell-Hill equations can be derived from Newton's equation for wave speed using the substitution of the equation of the bulk modulus in terms of volumetric strain.
