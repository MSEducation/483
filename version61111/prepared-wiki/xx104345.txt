In this election, the Communist Party of Spain joined with other minor left parties to form the electoral coalition Izquierda Unida; in Catalonia they ran as the Catalan Left Union.

==Opinion polls==

Poll results are listed in the table below in reverse chronological order, showing the most recent first. The highest percentage figure in each polling survey is displayed in bold, and the background shaded in the leading party's colour. In the instance that there is a tie, then no figure is shaded but both are displayed in bold. The lead column on the right shows the percentage-point difference between the two parties with the highest figures. Poll results use the date the survey's fieldwork was done, as opposed to the date of publication. However, if such date is unknown, the date of publication will be given instead. Seat projections are included below the % estimation where available. "–" denotes no individual figure.
