==Early life==

Blinken was born in Yonkers, New York, to Jewish parents Judith and Donald Blinken. He attended Dalton School in New York City until 1971, when he moved to Paris, France, with his divorced mother and her new husband, Holocaust survivor and lawyer, Samuel Pisar. Pisar, who had survived both the Auschwitz and Dachau, strongly influenced his views.[tpl]cite web|title=Antony "Tony" Blinken|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/blinken.html|work=Jewish Virtual Library|accessdate=28 September 2013[/tpl] 
He attended Harvard University, where he edited the daily student newspaper and co-edited the weekly art magazine. After earning his Bachelors degree, Blinken compromised on his career interests and took an internship at The New Republic, an American commentary magazine focused on politics and culture. He then earned his J.D. at Columbia Law School, and soon after, Blinken became active in Democratic politics, helping his father fundraise for Michael Dukakis’ 1988 presidential campaign. All the while – during his academic pursuits and political activities – he played guitar in a band and organized film festivals.

==Career==

During the Clinton Administration in the 1990s, the then-assistant secretary of state for European and Canadian affairs hired Blinken, and White House speechwriter Robert Boorstin brought Blinken into the National Security Council.
