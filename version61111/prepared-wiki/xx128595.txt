The Footy Show is a Logie Award winning Australian sports television program, shown on the Nine Network and its affiliates.
The show, which is dedicated to the Australian Football League (AFL) and Australian rules football, made its debut on 24 March 1994 at the same time as the other version which relates to the National Rugby League (NRL) and rugby league. Although both programs are generally broadcast in the same time slot, as both are shown in distinct geographical regions according to areas where one or the other sport predominates, there is little confusion.

==Scheduling==

The AFL version of the show airs twice each week:
From 1994 to 2012, The Footy Show usually aired at 9.30 pm AEST, However, on 28 November 2012, Nine announced that the show would air at 8.30 pm AEST.

===Thursdays===

In Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia, the AFL version of The Footy Show is aired on Thursday nights at 8:30 pm during the AFL season, followed by the NRL version of The Footy Show later that night.
In 2008, the AFL version of The Footy Show could be seen live into most New South Wales and Queensland TV markets via the Nine HD channel. However, this was discontinued before the launch of GO! when Nine HD ceased breakaway programming. Since then, the AFL version airs straight after the NRL version of the show. In 2013, it has aired an hour later, starting at 11.30pm.

===Sundays===

A related program, The Sunday Footy Show, airs at 11:30 on Sunday mornings. The NRL version of the program is shown on GEM in the AFL regions.

==Origins and format==

The Footy Show had its origins in 1993 when a special Grand Final edition of The Sunday Footy Show aired on the Thursday night before the AFL Grand Final. The program was then extended and started as a regular program in 1994 hosted by former Network Ten reporter Eddie McGuire, former Geelong player Sam Newman and comedian Trevor Marmalade. They were usually joined by three current and former football players in a panel format.
The show is broadcast live from Melbourne with a large studio audience "warmed-up" each week by popular actor and comedian Jeremy Kewley. From 1994 to 2010 (Seasons 1 to 17) the show was broadcast from Studio 9 at GTV 9 in Richmond. Following GTV 9's relocation to Docklands at the start of 2011, from Season 18 the show was produced from Sound Stage 4 at Docklands Film Studios.
Over the years the show has also broadcast special live episode from locations including Geelong, Sydney, Perth, Adelaide, Hobart, London (2001 and 2004) and  Munich (2006). 
In 2006, after Eddie McGuire's appointment as CEO of the Nine Network, he stepped down as host of the program and was replaced by former Melbourne player Garry Lyon and North Melbourne Football Club director, later chairman, James Brayshaw, as co-hosts. In a bid to resurge the show[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl] in 2009, Trevor Marmalade was cut from the program to make way for former footballers Shane Crawford and Billy Brownless. In 2012 former Essendon player Matthew Lloyd was brought in with himself, Crawford and Brownless respctively rotating each week.
The panelists discuss any news stories which arise during the week, review the last round of matches and preview each match for the coming week, including showing the lineups. Before 2001 no footage of any AFL games could be aired by the show as the rival Seven Network held the broadcast rights and refused to allow the show to air footage in an attempt to stall the program's success. From 2002 until 2006, Nine had the rights to AFL broadcasts and footage was used liberally during the show. From 2007 they reverted to not using footage due to Nine having lost the rights to AFL broadcasting to the Seven Network and Network Ten until the end of the 2011 football season. Some footage of matches, however, has been used briefly since 2006.

The show includes the AFL Players Revue in which players dress up and dance to themes.  It has included performances and cameos from players such as Shane Crawford, Brodie Holland, Brendan Fevola, Aaron Davey and The Footy Show presenters, except for Eddie McGuire.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2009[/tpl]

==Controversies involving Sam Newman==

Sam Newman is the most controversial figure on The Footy Show, and has been the subject of many complaints to the Nine Network. In May 2008, the Nine Network removed Newman from the show indefinitely following a major controversy over allegedly sexist jokes. He was reinstated soon after.
Newman has also had a number of well-publicised off-screen incidents that are often brought up during the show.
