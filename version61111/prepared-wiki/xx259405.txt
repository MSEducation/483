==History==

The first well, Leviathan 1, was first drilled to a depth of [tpl]convert|5170|m[/tpl] where the deposit found was estimated to  contain [tpl]convert|16|e12cuft|abbr=off[/tpl] of natural gas.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.offshoreenergytoday.com/noble-energy-announces-significant-discovery-at-leviathan-offshore-israel/|title=Noble Energy announces significant discovery at Leviathan offshore Israel|date=30 December 2010|publisher=Offshore Energy Today|accessdate=31 December 2010[/tpl] The well was drilled by Homer Ferrington drilling rig. The second stage of drilling of the Leviathan 1 well was intended to reach a depth of [tpl]convert|7200|m|ft[/tpl] where the estimated natural gas reserve is an additional [tpl]convert|9|e12cuft|abbr=off[/tpl] and potentially 600 million barrels of oil.Leviathan partners to raise gas reserves estimate Globes, 22 April 12 13:22, Hillel Koren While the gas discovery at -5170m was made in the Tamar sands layer which was already known to contain gas in other geological formations of the same type in the region, the additional oil and gas potential exists in a deeper layer which dates back to the Mesozoic era and which to date has not been explored in the Levant basin. Noble has twice failed to reach the deeper layer due to technical challenges with drilling to the extreme depths involved. However, during drilling towards the intended target some tell-tale gas signs of possible thermogenic origin were detected and therefore Noble intends to return to the drill site after it obtains the necessary equipment to handle the extreme pressures it previously encountered.[tpl]cite press release |title= Noble Energy Provides Update On Leviathan Deep Well|url= http://investors.nobleenergyinc.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=669858|publisher= Noble Energy|date= 2 May 2012 |accessdate=17 June 2012[/tpl] A specialized ship under construction in South Korea will begin carrying out the oil exploration effort at Leviathan by the end of 2013.[tpl]cite news|last=Solomon|first=Shoshanna|title=Israel’s Deepest Well Targets 1.5 Billion Barrels of Oil|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-17/israel-s-deepest-well-targets-1-5-billion-barrels-of-oil.html|accessdate=19 July 2013|date=18 July 2013|agency=Bloomberg News[/tpl] While the probability of finding oil or gas in this unexplored layer is thought to be very small, were they to be found, it would also greatly increase the probability of finding additional hydrocarbon resources in similar ultra-deep geological formations located elsewhere in the region.
At the time of discovery, the Leviathan gas field was the largest find ever discovered in the under-explored area of the Mediterranean Sea and the largest discovery in the history of Noble Energy. Noble Energy operates Leviathan with a 39.66% working interest; Delek Drilling holds 22.67%; Avner Oil Exploration holds 22.67%; and Ratio Oil Exploration holds the remaining 15%.  In February 2014, Woodside Energy agreed to buy a 25% stake of the Leviathan field for up to US$2.55 billion.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/07/woodside-leviathan-idUSL3N0LB5KU20140207 | title=Israel takes step towards becoming a gas exporter | agency = Reuters | date=7 February | accessdate=8 February 2014[/tpl]

==Rights dispute==

Lebanon initially argued that the field extends into Lebanese waters. Lebanon’s Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri stated that Israel is “ignoring the fact that according to the maps the deposit extends into Lebanese waters,” Agence France-Presse reported on June 9.[tpl]cite news |last=Jonathan Ferziger and David Wainer|title=Landau Says Israel Could Use Force to Shield Gas Find|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-06-24/landau-says-israel-could-use-force-to-shield-gas-find.html|accessdate=2 January 2011|newspaper=businessweek|date=June 24, 2010[/tpl] Israeli Minister of National Infrastructures Uzi Landau responded “We will not hesitate to use our force and strength to protect not only the rule of law but the international maritime law,” in an interview. Robbie Sable, a professor of international law at Jerusalem’s Hebrew University, has stated that the claim may be complex due to Lebanon's border with Israel being indented, making it harder to establish where Israel’s sea boundary ends and Lebanese waters begin.
In August 2010, Lebanon submitted to the United Nations its official view regarding the maritime border, indicating that it considered the Tamar and Leviathan gas fields to be outside Lebanese territory (though it indicated other prospective fields in the region may be within Lebanese territory). The US expressed support for the Lebanon proposal.[tpl]cite news |author=Barak Ravid |title=U.S. backs Lebanon on maritime border dispute with Israel |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/u-s-backs-lebanon-on-maritime-border-dispute-with-israel-1.372377 |accessdate=2012-01-30 |newspaper=Haaretz |date=2011-07-10[/tpl]
