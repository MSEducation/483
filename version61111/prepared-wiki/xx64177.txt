Jeddah (sometimes spelled Jiddah or Jedda ; [tpl]IPAc-en|lang|pron|ˈ|dʒ|ɛ|d|ə[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-ar|جدة[/tpl] [tpl]transl|ar|DIN|Jiddah[/tpl] or [tpl]transl|ar|DIN|Jaddah[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-ar|ˈdʒɪddæ, ˈdʒæddæ|IPA[/tpl]) is a city in the Hijaz Tihamah region on the coast of the Red Sea and is the major urban center of western Saudi Arabia. It is the largest city in Makkah Province, the largest sea port on the Red Sea, and the second-largest city in Saudi Arabia after the capital city, Riyadh. With a population currently at 5.1 million, Jeddah is an important commercial hub in Saudi Arabia. It was devastated by floods in early 2011.
Jeddah is the principal gateway to Mecca, Islam's holiest city, which able-bodied Muslims are required to visit at least once in their lifetime. It is also a gateway to Medina, the second holiest place in Islam.
Economically, Jeddah is focusing on further developing capital investment in scientific and engineering leadership within Saudi Arabia, and the Middle East.http://ae.zawya.com/story.cfm/sidZAWYA20100727050049/comment Jeddah was independently ranked fourth in the Africa – Mid-East region in terms of innovation in 2009 in the Innovation Cities Index.[tpl]cite web|author=|url=http://www.innovation-cities.com/emerging-middle-east-africa-city-index/ |title=2thinknow Innovation Cities™ Emerging 11 Index 2009 - Middle East, Africa and Former USSR States | 2009|publisher=Innovation-cities.com |date=2009-11-12 |accessdate=2011-04-17[/tpl]
Jeddah is one of Saudi Arabia's primary resort cities and was named a Gamma world city by the Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network (GaWC).
Historically, Jeddah has been well known for its legendary money changers. The largest of said money changers at the time (the late Sheikh Salem Bin Mahfouz) eventually founded Saudi Arabia's first bank, the National Commercial Bank (NCB).

==Etymology and spelling==

There are at least two explanations for the etymology of the name Jeddah, according to Jeddah Ibn Helwaan Al-Qudaa'iy, the chief of the Quda'a clan. The more common account has it that the name is derived from جدة Jaddah, the Arabic word for "grandmother". According to eastern folk belief, the tomb of Eve ([tpl]Coord|21|29|31|N|39|11|24|E[/tpl]), considered the grandmother of humanity, is located in Jeddah.Jayussi, Salma; Manṣūr Ibrāhīm Ḥāzimī; ʻIzzat ibn ʻAbd al-Majīd Khaṭṭāb  Beyond the Dunes I B Tauris & Co Ltd (28 April 2006), p. 295.

Ibn Battuta(1304–1368), the Berber traveler, visited Jeddah during his world trip. He wrote the name of the city into his diary as "Juddah".Ibn Battota's Safari. Tuhfat Al-Nothaar Fe Gharaa'ib Al-Amsaar. Chapter: "From Cairo to Hejaz to Tunisia again". ISBN 9953-34-180-X
The British Foreign Office and other branches of the British government used to use the older spelling of "Jedda", contrary to other English-speaking usage, but in 2007 changed to the spelling "Jeddah".British Embassy website[tpl]Dead link|date=January 2010[/tpl]
T. E. Lawrence felt that any transcription of Arabic names into English was arbitrary. In his book Revolt in the Desert, Jeddah is spelled three different ways on the first page alone."Lost in translation." Brian Whitaker. Guardian (UK). 10 June 2002.
On official Saudi maps and documents, the city name is transcribed "Jeddah", which is now the prevailing usage.

==History==

===Pre-Islam===

Excavations in the old city suggest that Jeddah was founded as a fishing hamlet in 500 BC by the Yemeni Quda'a tribe (بني قضاعة), who left central Yemen to settle in MakkahHistory of Jeddah.

Other archaeological studies have shown that the area was settled earlier by people in the Stone Age, as some Thamudi scripts were excavated in Wadi Briman (وادي بريمان), west of the city, and Wadi Boweb (وادي بويب), northwest of the city. It was visited by Alexander The Great (356 BC - 323 BC).http://www.jeddahedu.gov.sa/jed.html[tpl]Dead link|date=January 2010[/tpl]

===Rashidun Caliphate===

Jeddah first achieved prominence around 647 AD, when the third Muslim Caliph, Uthman Ibn Affan (عثمان بن عفان), turned it into a port making it the port of Makkah instead of Al Shoaiba port south west of Mecca.[tpl]cite web|author=alalamonline|url=http://www.alalamonline.net/%D9%85%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B9_%D8%A8%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%AA%D9%88_%D8%B4%D8%B9%D9%8A%D8%A8%D8%A9_%D8%A8%D9%85%D9%83%D9%87_%D9%8A%D8%AA%D9%83%D9%84%D9%81_%D9%85%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A_%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B1.html |title=|publisher=alalamonline.net |date=2010-03-10 |accessdate=2013-08-13[/tpl]
Since then, Jeddah has been established as the main city of the historic Hijaz province and a historic port for pilgrims arriving by sea to perform their Hajj pilgrimage in Mecca. The city's strategic location as the gates of the Holy City and a port on the Red Sea has caused it to be conquered many times throughout its history. [tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]

===Fatimid Caliphate===

In the 969 AD the Fatimids from Algeria took control in Egypt from the Ikhshidid dynasty and expanded their empire to the surrounding regions, including The Hijaz and Jeddah. The Fatimids developed an extensive trade network in both the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean through the Red Sea. Their trade and diplomatic ties extended all the way to China and its Song Dynasty, which eventually determined the economic course of Tihamah during the High Middle Ages.

===Ayyubid Empire===

After Saladin's conquest of Jerusalem, in 1171 he proclaimed himself sultan of Egypt, after dissolving the Fatimid Caliphate upon the death of al-Adid, thus establishing the Ayyubid dynasty, which set conquests throughout the region Hejaz—including Jeddah—became a part of the Ayyubid Empire in 1177 during the leadership of Sharif Ibn Abul-Hashim Al-Thalab (1094–1201). During their relatively short-lived tenure, the Ayyubids ushered in an era of economic prosperity in the lands they ruled and the facilities and patronage provided by the Ayyubids led to a resurgence in intellectual activity in the Islamic world. This period was also marked by an Ayyubid process of vigorously strengthening Sunni Muslim dominance in the region by constructing numerous madrasas (Islamic schools) in their major cities. Jeddah attracted Muslim sailors and merchants from Sindh, Southeast Asia and East Africa, and other distant regions.

===Mamluk Sultanate===

In 1254, following events in Cairo and the dissolution of the Ayyubid Empire, Hijaz became a part of the Mamluk Sultanate. The Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama, having found his way around the Cape and obtained pilots from the coast of Zanzibar in 1497 CE, pushed his way across the Indian Ocean to the shores of Malabar and Calicut, attacked the fleets that carried freight and Muslim pilgrims from India to the Red Sea, and struck terror into the potentates all around. The Princes of Gujarat and Yemen turned for help to Egypt. Sultan Al-Ashraf Qansuh al-Ghawri accordingly fitted out a fleet of 50 vessels under his Admiral, Hussein the Kurd. Jeddah was soon fortified with forced labor as a harbor of refuge from the Portuguese, allowing Arabia and the Red Sea to be protected, parts of the city wall still survives today in the old city. Even though the Portuguese were successfully repelled from the city, the fleets in the Indian Ocean were at their mercy. This was evidenced by the Battle of Diu between the Portuguese and the Arab Mamluks. The Portuguese soldiers' cemetery is still found within the old city today and is referred to as the Christian Graves.[tpl]cite web|author=صحيفة عكاظ |url=http://www.okaz.com.sa/new/Issues/20110605/Con20110605424473.htm |title=صحيفة عكاظ - مقبرة النصارى |publisher=Okaz.com.sa |date=2012-06-05 |accessdate=2013-03-26[/tpl]

===Ottoman Empire===

In 1517, the Ottoman Turks conquered the Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt and Syria, during the reign of Selim I."History of Arabia." Britannica.com. As territories of the Mamluk Sultanate, the Hijaz, including Jeddah and the holy city of Mecca, passed into Ottoman possession. The Ottomans rebuilt the weak walls of Jeddah in 1525 following their victory over the Lopo Soares de Albergaria's Armada in the Red Sea. The new Turkish wall included six watchtowers and six city gates. They were constructed to defend against the Portuguese attack. Of the six gates, the Gate of Mecca was the eastern gate and the Gate of Al-Magharibah, facing the port, was the western gate. The Gate of Sharif faced south. The other gates were the Gate of Al-Bunt, Gate of Al-Sham (also called Gate of Al-Sharaf) and Gate of Medina, facing north.Makkah Gate in Jeddah. AsiaRooms.com. The Turks also built The Qishla of Jeddah, a small castle for the city soldiers. In the 19th century these seven gates were minimized into four giant gates with four towers. These giant gates were the Gate of Sham to the north, the Gate of Mecca to the east, the Gate of Sharif to the south, and the Gate of Al-Magharibah on the sea side.
Ahmed Al-Jazzar, the Ottoman military man mainly known for his role in the Siege of Acre, spent the earlier part of his career at Jeddah—where in 1750 he killed some seventy rioting nomads in retaliation for the killing of his commander, Abdullah Beg. It was this act which reportedly earned him the nickname "Jezzar" (butcher).

===First Saudi State and Ottoman–Saudi War===

In 1802, Nejdi forces conquered both Mecca and Jeddah from the Ottomans. When Sharif Ghalib Efendi informed Sultan Mahmud II of this, the Sultan ordered his Egyptian viceroy Muhammad Ali Pasha to retake the city. Muhammad Ali successfully regained the city in the Battle of Jeddah in 1813.

===World War I and the Hashemite Kingdom===

During World War I, Sharif Hussein bin Ali declared a revolt against the Ottoman Empire, seeking independence from the Ottoman Turks and the creation of a single unified Arab state spanning from Aleppo in Syria to Aden in Yemen.
King Hussein declared the Kingdom of Hejaz. Later, Hussein was involved in war with Ibn Saud, who was the Sultan of Nejd. Hussein resigned following the fall of Mecca, in December 1924, and his son Ali bin Hussein became the new king.

===Kingdom of Saudi Arabia===

A few months later, Ibn Saud, whose clan originated in the central Nejd province, conquered Medina and Jeddah via an agreement with Jeddans following the Second Battle of Jeddah. He deposed Ali bin Hussein, who fled to Baghdad, eventually settling in Amman, Jordan, where his descendants became part of its Hashemite royalty.
As a result, Jeddah came under the sway of the Al-Saud dynasty in December 1925. In 1926, Ibn Saud added the title King of Hejaz to his position of Sultan of Nejd. Today, Jeddah has lost its historical role in peninsular politics after Jeddah fell within the new province of Makkah, whose provincial capital is the city of Mecca.
From 1928 to 1932, the new Khuzam Palace was built as the new residence of King Abdul Aziz in Jeddah. The palace lies south of the old walled city and was constructed under the supervision of the engineer Muhammad bin Laden. After 1963 the palace was used as a royal guest house; since 1995 it has housed the Regional Museum of Archaeology and Ethnography.Leaflet for Khuzam Palace Jeddah, Deputy Ministry of Antiquities & Museums
What was left of the walls and gates of the old city was taken down in 1947. A fire in 1982 destroyed some ancient buildings in the old town center, called Al-Balad, but much is still preserved despite the commercial interest to tear down old houses (Naseef House, Gabil House) and build modern high-rise buildings. A house-by-house survey of the old districts was made in 1979, showing that some 1000 traditional buildings still existed, though the number of structures with great historic value was far less. In 1990 a Jeddah Historical Area Preservation Department was founded."Preserving Jeddah's Historic Buildings." Saudi Arabia, Winter 1999, Volume 15, Number 4. Information Office, Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia.The Biet Nassif in Jeddah at www.asiarooms.com
The modern city has expanded wildly beyond its old boundaries. The built-up area expanded mainly to the north along the Red Sea coastline, reaching the new airport during the 1990s and since edging its way around it toward the Ob'hur Creek some [tpl]convert|27|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] from the old city center.

==Geography==

Most of Saudi Arabia is desert. The central region consists of an eroded plateau, mostly arid and hot in the summer and mild in the winter. The western region is mountainous except on the coastal plain bordering the Red Sea called Tihamah, which includes the Jeddah area.
Jeddah is Geographicly in the Hijazi Tihama (Arabic: تهامة الحجاز) the region that lies in the lower the Hijaz mountains separated regionally from the Asir Tihama, and Yeman Tihama. However, in Historical political and cultural,  allegiance, such as territories, Vilayet, or Kingdoms, Jeddah was a major city of the Hejaz as it was described in most of Hijazi History Books.

===Climate===

Jeddah features an arid climate (BWh) under Koppen's climate classification. Unlike other Saudi Arabian cities, Jeddah retains its warm temperature in winter, which can range from [tpl]convert|15|C|F[/tpl] at dawn to [tpl]convert|28|C|F[/tpl] in the afternoon. Summer temperatures are extremely hot, often breaking the [tpl]convert|43|C|F[/tpl] mark in the afternoon and dropping to [tpl]convert|30|C|F[/tpl] in the evening. Rainfall in Jeddah is generally sparse, and usually occurs in small amounts in November and December. There have also been several notable incidents of hail. [tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl] Heavy thunderstorms are common in winter. The thunderstorm of December 2008 was the largest in recent memory, with rain reaching around [tpl]convert|3|in|cm[/tpl]. The lowest temperature ever recorded in Jeddah was [tpl]convert|3|C|F[/tpl] in January 1995.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl]. The highest temperature ever recorded in Jeddah was [tpl]convert|52|C|F[/tpl] on June 22, 2010.
Dust storms happen in summer and sometimes in winter, coming from the Arabian Peninsula's deserts or from North Africa.

==Economy==

Historically, and due to its proximity to the Red Sea, Jeddah functioned as a port city. Even before being designated port city for Mecca, the city of Jeddah had rooted itself in the local economy as an integral trading hub for the region. In the 19th century goods such as mother-of-pearl, tortoise shells, frankincense and various other spices and items were routinely exported from the city. Apart from this, many imports into the city were destined for further export to the Suez, Africa, or the European continent. As a result of this "re-export" of goods, many items exported from Jeddah were things that could not even be found in the city or even in Arabia.[tpl]cite book|last=Al-Sha'afi|first=Muhammad|title=Foreign Trade of Juddah: During the Ottoman Period 1840-1916|year=1990|publisher=King Saud University[/tpl]
The city's geographical location places it at the heart of the region covered by the Middle East and North Africa, with all their capitals within two hours flying distance, defining Jeddah as the second commercial center of the Middle East after Dubai.Commerce of Jeddah. Saudi Arabian Water & Power Forum.
Also, Jeddah's industrial district is the fourth largest industrial city in Saudi Arabia after Riyadh, Jubail and Yanbu.

===King Abdullah Street===

King Abdullah Street is one of the most important streets in Jeddah that starts at King Fahd road by the waterfront in the west of Jeddah and ends all the way at the eastern end of the city. It is famous for hosting numerous corporate offices and commercial developments. Due to the economic boom in this region, there is a central business district planned, which would be one of the biggest CBDs in the Middle East.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]

===Tahaliyah Street===

Tahaliyah Street is an important fashion and shopping street in the mid-town of Jeddah. It contains many upscale department shops and boutiques, such as Dolce & Gabbana, Gucci, Burberry, Chanel, Giorgio Armani, Versace, Massimo Dutti, and Tod's. It has been renamed to " Prince Mohammad bin Abdul Aziz Road". The street also has famous shops like Centre point.Home centre, and Pizza Hut.

==Culture==

===Religious significance===

Most citizens are Muslim, most of them being Sunni Muslims. The Government, Courts, Civil and Criminal law enforce a moral code established by Shari'ah. A very small minority of Saudi citizens are Shia Muslims, and there is also a large foreign workforce who are allowed to follow their non-Islamic religion in a private manner.
The city has over 1,300 mosques,Report about number of mosques. Al-Sharq Al-Awsat Newspaper. and the law does not allow for other religions to erect faith based buildings or to express their faith publicly. Religious books, icons and other materials not of the Islamic faith are also banned. However, private religious observance, which does not involve Muslims or offend public order or morality are sometimes tolerated.
Since the 7th century, Jeddah has hosted millions of Muslim pilgrims from all over the world on their way to Hajj. This merge with pilgrims has a major impact on the society, religion, and economy of Jeddah. It also brings an annual risk of illness, known by locals as the 'hajji disease', a general term for various viral maladies.

===Cultural projects and foundations with a branch in Jeddah===

===Cuisine===

Jeddah residents are a multi-ethnic mixture and this has had a major impact on Jeddah's traditional cuisine.
As in other Saudi cities, the Nejdi dish Kabsa is popular among the people of Jeddah, often made with chicken instead of lamb meat. The Yemeni dish Mandi is also popular as a lunch meal. Jeddah cuisine is popular as well and dishes like Mabshoor, Mitabbak, Foul, Areika, Hareisa, Kabab Meiroo, Shorabah Hareira (Hareira soup), Migalgal, Madhbi (chicken grilled on stone), Madfun (literally meaning "buried"), Magloobah, Kibdah, Manzalah (usually eaten at Eid ul-Fitr), Ma'asoob, Magliya (a local version of falafel), Saleeig (a local dish made of milk rice), hummus, Biryani, Ruz Kabli, Ruz Bukhari, and Saiyadyia can be acquired in many traditional restaurants around the city, such as Althamrat, Abo-Zaid, Al-Quarmooshi, Ayaz, and Hejaziyat.
Grilled meat dishes such as shawarma, kofta and kebab have a good market in Jeddah. During Ramadan, sambousak and ful are especially popular at the evening iftar meal. These dishes are found in Lebanese, Syrian, and Turkish restaurants.
Fast food is popular in the city. American fast-food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Domino's Pizza and KFC are widely distributed in Jeddah, as are more upscale chains like Fuddruckers and Chili's. The most popular local fast food chain, begun in 1986, is Al Baik, with branches in Jeddah and the neighbouring cities of Makkah, Madinah and Yanbu. Their main dish is broasted (broiled and roasted) chicken, commonly known by Jeddans as "Brost", and a variety of seafood.[tpl]cite web|url=http://albaik.com/index.htm |title=Al Baik fast food|publisher=Albaik.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-17[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=March 2013[/tpl] Other local fast food restaurants have sprung up, like Al Tazaj, which serves seasoned grilled chicken (called Farooj) and a side of Tahina with onion and spices. Foultameez serves Foul and Tameez as fast food; Kudu and Herfy serve Western fast food; Halawani serves local variants of Shawerma; and Shawermatak has pioneered drive-through sales of Shawerma. Another popular fast-food chain is Hot and Crispy, an Arabic franchise popular for their spiced curly fries.
Indian, Chinese, Japanese, and other Asian foods are also popular. Italian, French, and other European restaurants are found throughout the city.

===Open-air art===

During the oil boom in the late 1970s and 1980s, there was a focused civic effort to bring art to Jeddah's public areas. As a result, Jeddah contains a large number of modern open-air sculptures and works of art, typically situated in roundabouts, making the city one of the largest open-air art galleries in the world. Sculptures include works by a variety of artists, ranging from the obscure to international stars such as Jean/Hans Arp, César Baldaccini, Alexander Calder, Henry Moore, Joan Miró and Victor Vasarely. They often depict elements of traditional Saudi culture such as coffee pots, incense burners, palm trees, etc. The fact that Islamic tradition prohibits the depiction of living creatures, notably the human form, has made for some very creative, as well as bizarre, modern art. These include a mounted defunct propeller plane (which has been removed to make way for an underpass), a giant geometry set, a giant bicycle, and a huge block of concrete with several cars protruding from it at odd angles. A monumental sculpture by Aref Rayess is devoted to Allah (God).

===Museums and collections===

There may be about a dozen museums or collections in Jeddah, with a wide variety of educational aim and professionalism.Museums in Jeddah at www.asiarooms.com Some of these are the Jeddah Regional Museum of Archaeology and Ethnography run by the Deputy Ministry of Antiquities and Museums, the Jeddah Municipal Museum, the Nasseef House, the Humane Heritage Museum, the private Abdul Rauf Hasan Khalil Museum and the private Arts Heritage Museum.

===Media===

Jeddah is served by four major Arabic-language newspapers, Asharq Al-Awsat, Al Madina, Okaz, and Al Bilad, as well as two major English-language newspapers, the Saudi Gazette and Arab News. Okaz and Al-Madina are the primary newspapers of Jeddah and some other Saudi cities, with over a million readers; they focus mainly on issues that affect the city.
Jeddah represents the largest radio and television market in Saudi Arabia. Television stations serving the city area include Saudi TV1, Saudi TV2, Saudi TV Sports, Al Ekhbariya, the ART channels network and hundreds of cable, satellite and other specialty television providers.

===Sport===

Jeddah hosts the oldest sport clubs in Saudi Arabia. Football is the most popular sport in Jeddah. Al-Ittihad and Al-Ahli are well-known football clubs. They are major competitors in both the Saudi Premier League and the AFC Champions League. Al-Ittihad won the FIBA Asia Champions Cup.
Al-Ittihad was the first club in the country, established in 1927. Fans endowed Al-Ittihad with the nickname of "Tigers," showing the team's strength. Al-Ahli was established in 1937, and used to be called Al-Thagor club. Prince Sultan bin Abdulaziz would change the name to Al-Ahli. The club's nickname is "Alrage" which means "Upscale".
There are several public football stadiums in Jeddah:
Jeddah is also home of Saudi Arabia's leading rugby club started and developed since 1979, mainly run by a group of expat members of the local community over the years. The club has taken part in both regional and international matches and incites players from Jeddah to come and play. The last five years has shown a heavier interest from Saudi nationals who have also begun to bring rise to some local talents.

===Accent===

The Jeddah city area has a distinctive regional speech pattern called the Hejazi dialect, even though Jeddah is located in the Tihamah region and not the Hejaz region.Yaqut al-Hamawi, Mu'jam Al-Buldan, vol. 2, p. 219 It is often considered to be one of the most recognizable accents within the Arabic language.

As a result, King Abdullah, Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, has approved the King Abdullah Project for the Development of Public Libraries, and approximately SAR150 million is budgeted to be spent.[tpl]cite web|author=Saudi Gazette |url=http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&contentID=20110729106277 |title=King gives the go-ahead to develop public libraries |publisher=Saudi Gazette |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26[/tpl]

==Transport==

===Airport===

Jeddah is served by King Abdulaziz International Airport. The airport has four passenger terminals. One is the Hajj Terminal, a special outdoor terminal covered by large white tents, which was constructed to handle the more than two million pilgrims who pass through the airport during the Hajj season. The Southern Terminal is used for Saudia flights, while the Northern Terminal serves foreign and other national airlines. A plan for the extension of airport is being developed. The Royal Terminal is a special terminal reserved for VIPs, foreign kings and presidents, and the Saudi Royal Family. A portion of the airport, King Abdullah Air Base, was used by Coalition B-52 heavy bombers during Operation Desert Storm in 1991.

===Seaport===

The Jeddah Seaport is the 32nd busiest seaport in the world [tpl]asof|2008|lc=on[/tpl]. It handles the majority of Saudi Arabia's commercial movement.

===Roads and rails===

Highway 40, which begins in Jeddah, connects the city to Mecca, Riyadh and Dammam on the east coast. Jeddah does not have any rapid transit system, but a rail system connecting the city to Riyadh is now under construction. The Haramain High Speed Rail Project will provide a high-speed rail connection to Mecca and Medina.[tpl]cite news | title=Al Rajhi wins Makkah - Madinah civils contract | url =http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view//al-rajhi-wins-makkah-madinah-civils-contract.html | work =Railway Gazette International | date = 2009-02-09 [/tpl]
Modern streets connect the different areas of the city to each other. Jeddah's main highways run parallel to each other.

==Issues and challenges==

The city faces many challenges, such as pollution, Islamic extremism, terrorist activities, weak sewage systems, heavy traffic, epidemics, water shortages, and pollution issues.
Pollution and environment Air pollution is a problem for Jeddah, particularly on hot summer days. The city has experienced bush fires, landfill fires, and pollution from the two industrial zones in the north and the south of the metropolitan area. A water treatment factory and the seaport also contribute to water pollution. Much of the coast of the city, however, is considered to have a safe and relatively clean quality.
Terrorism  On 6 December 2004, a group of five men associated with the terrorist group Al-Qaeda (Al-Qaeda Organization in the Arabian Peninsula) conducted a daring, mid-day attack on the U.S. consulate. The group was led by Fayez ibn Awwad Al-Jeheni, a former member of Saudi religious police. Two other members were subsequently identified by the Saudi authorities as young men in their twenties, and residents of Jeddah's Al-Jamia suburb and other slums on Saudi Arabia's increasingly urbanised west coast. Buildings were attacked, hostages taken and used as human shields, and the U.S. and non-U.S. staff were under siege, although the chancery building itself was never penetrated.http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/jtic-briefing-jeddah-attack-underscores-fall-in-capabilities-of-saudi-milit Closed circuit video feeds documented that the Saudi security personnel assigned to protect the facility fled when the vehicle holding the terrorists pulled up to the front gate.http://diplopundit.net/2013/04/16/2005-jeddah-arb-recommended-remote-safe-areas-for-embassies-upgrades-coming-or-maybe-not/ Inside the compound, however, an armed Saudi security guard employed by the embassy shot and killed one terrorist before being immediately killed by small-arms fire himself.
After more than an hour, Saudi special forces made it through traffic and, along with others from their unit who arrived in a helicopter, began a fight to retake the compound.  Two of the terrorists were killed in the final fight, with another dying later in hospital and the final militant being captured alive. Four Saudi special forces and a further 10 hostages were wounded in the crossfire.http://www.rasheedsworld.com/wp/2005/12/1st-anniversary-of-attack-on-us-consulate/
While unsuccessful, the attack underscores the ongoing vulnerabilities of Westerners to threats and terrorist actions in Jeddah and environs. In a communiqué posted in online publications such as Sawt al-Jihad (Voice of Jihad) and Mu'askar al-Battar (Al-Battar Training Camp), Al-Qaeda hinted at the symbolic nature of the U.S. Consulate attack, stating: "Know that the Mujahideen are determined to continue on their path, and they will not be weakened by what has happened to them."
The period from 2004 to the present indicates a persistence of terrorist activities. These events include two in 2004: an unsuccessful shooting attack on a US Marine visiting the Saudi American Bank, and an attempt to simultaneously explode car bombs at Saudi American Bank and Saudi British Bank branches in Jeddah on the anniversary of the 2001 "9-11" terrorist attacks on the U.S.http://susris.com/timelines/terrorism-saudi-arabia/  On 26 August 2012, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry announced that terrorists were arrested in Jeddah who had been preparing explosives for attacks within the kingdom."LexisNexis News". LexisNexis. Retrieved 29 August 2012.
Traffic While the congested traffic is cause for concern in Jeddah, the Saudi Gazette reports that there is a plan in the works to tackle the traffic issue. A reported 3 billion Saudi Riyals will be put into constructing flyovers and underpasses in an effort to reduce traffic. The plan is scheduled to take about five years from its start to finish.[tpl]cite web|last=Al-Siqqiqui|first=Saoud|title=SR3b to tackle Jeddah traffic over five years|url=http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&contentID=2010072078614|publisher=Saudi Gazette|accessdate=11 April 2011[/tpl]
Sewage Prior to the construction of a waste treatment plant, Jeddah's waste water was disposed of by either discharge into the sea or via absorption into deep underground pits. As the city grew, a proper waste management plant was created and the built up part of the city was connected with a sewer system by the 1970s.  [tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl] However, even with the ever increasing population, there has not been much development to this original sewer system. The original plant cannot cope with the amount of waste inundating it daily. As a result, some untreated sewage is discharged directly into the sea and the entire northern part of the city remains unconnected to the sewage system at all, instead relying on septic tanks. This has been responsible for the large number of sewage tankers.
In late 2011, a storm drainage system has been built in the south Jeddah area (similar to that of the Los Angeles storm drain) to reduce the risk of floods.[tpl]cite journal|last=Vincent|first=Peter|title=Jeddah's Environmental Problems|doi=10.1111/j.1931-0846.2003.tb00039.x|publisher=The Geographical Review[/tpl]

===2011 Jeddah floods===

On 26 January 2011, again, heavy floods affected the city and other areas of Makkah Province. The cumulative rainfall exceeded the [tpl]convert|90|mm|1|abbr=on[/tpl] recorded in four hours during the 25 November 2009 flash floods. Streets including Palestine Street, Madinah Road and Wali Al-Ahad Street were either flooded or jammed with traffic. Cars were seen floating in some places. Meanwhile, eyewitnesses told local newspaper Arab News that East Jeddah was swamped and floodwater was rushing west towards the Red Sea, turning streets into rivers once again.
