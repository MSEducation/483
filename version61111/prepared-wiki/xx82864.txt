Australia Post provides postal services in Australia and its overseas territories. "Australia Post" is the trading name, Australian Postal Corporation (formerly the Australian Postal Commission) is the Australian Government-owned entity responsible for the services.

==History==

The first Postmaster of New South Wales was an ex-convict, Isaac Nichols, who took the post in 1809 operating from his home in George Street, Sydney. His main job was to take charge of letters and parcels arriving by ship, to avoid the chaos of people rushing onto the ships as soon as they arrived at Sydney's wharves.
The Postal Act of 1825 allowed the governor to fix postage rates and appoint Postmasters outside Sydney, enabling the first organised postal service.Australia Post 2003 Annual Report
Postal services grew throughout the Australian colonies as they were established.
A regular overland service between Sydney and Melbourne, Victoria began in 1838, as did embossed covers (the world's second, after William Dockwra established the London Penny Post in 1680) prepaid postage [tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2007[/tpl], and by 1849 uniform postal rates were established by agreement between the colonies.  Monthly steamship sea mail to the United Kingdom was established in 1856.  The separate colonies joined the Universal Postal Union in 1891.
In 1901, the colonial mail systems were merged into the Postmaster-General's Department (or PMG).  This body was responsible for telegraph and domestic telephone operations as well as postal mail.  The world's first large-scale mechanical mail sorting system was introduced in Australia (according to Australia Post), and operational in the Sydney GPO in 1967.  This coincided with the introduction of the current system of 4-digit Postcodes in Australia.Store Finder: History and Assignment of Postcodes
On 1 July 1975, separate government commissions were created to undertake the operational responsibilities of the PMG.  One of these was the Australian Postal Commission, trading as Australia Post.  It later changed its name to the Australian Postal Corporation on 1 January 1989 when it was corporatised, although it still trades as Australia Post.
Under amendments to the APC Act that came into effect in March 2008, quarantine inspection officers from a prescribed state or territory are authorised to request Australia Post to open for inspection packets and parcels sent from interstate which they believe may contain quarantine material. The legislation also authorised Australia Post to remove from the mail stream articles that are suspected of being scam mail.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dbcde.gov.au/post/australia_post/australia_post_history|title=History of Australia Post|publisher=Australian Government, Department of Broadband, Communications, and the Digital Economy|date=27 May 2011|accessdate=2011-06-09| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110706121712/http://www.dbcde.gov.au/post/australia_post/australia_post_history| archivedate= 6 July 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

==Current activities==

Over the last 15 years, Australia Post has broadened its product and service range and invested in major technology-based infrastructure programs. Today, it operates in three core areas: letters and associated services; retail merchandise and agency services; and parcels and logistics. It offers delivery services, retail products, financial services (such as bill payment and banking through its retail network), logistics and fulfilment services, and direct marketing and database management services. It also has a number of subsidiaries and joint ventures, including Sai Cheng Logistics International – a joint-venture logistics company established with China Post in 2005.
Australia Post operates normal mail delivery as well as an express/courier service through Messenger Post.Home
Australia Post is a government business enterprise. It is self-funding and uses its assets and resources to earn profits, which can be reinvested in the business or returned as dividends to its sole shareholder, the Commonwealth Government. Under its community service obligations, Australia Post is committed to providing an accessible, affordable and reliable letter service for all Australians wherever they reside. The corporation reaches more than 10 million Australian addresses; operates 6,990 postal outlets; and serves more than a million customers in postal outlets every business day.
Under the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989, letters up to 250 grams are reserved to Australia Post – other people and businesses can only carry them if they charge four times the basic postage rate. All of the other goods and services provided by Australia Post are sold in fully competitive markets and, in 2005–06, nearly 90 per cent of the corporation’s profit (from ordinary activities before net interest and tax) came from selling products and services in competitive markets.

==Facts and statistics==

Nationwide there are 7,950 postal routes serviced by 10,000 "posties". Motorcycles (like the iconic Honda CT110) are used for delivery for around 6,600 routes, bicycles for 350 routes and walking for 1,000 routes. Electric bikes are also being trialled.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/the-posties-pushie-returns-with-added-oomph-and-a-green-message-20110305-1bizs.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=The postie's pushie returns, with added oomph, and a green message[/tpl]  Cars are only used for the very longest routes. Until the 1960s the longest, and the world's longest, overland mail route was Meekatharra to Marble Bar, Western Australia. As there were few roads a round trip took seven days.  The current longest overland route is Norseman, Western Australia to Border Village, South Australia: [tpl]convert|1460|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl]. The longest air service delivers to remote communities in the outback covering [tpl]convert|1790|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] over two days.
The most isolated postbox is located on a dive platform on the Great Barrier Reef, Queensland.
The most isolated Post Office is located [tpl]convert|217|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] from Onslow, Western Australia, [tpl]convert|32|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] from the nearest customer.

==Products and services==

Australia Post operates in three core markets: letters and associated services; agency services and retail merchandise; and parcels and logistics that span both domestic and international markets.

===Letters and associated services===

Australia Post collects, processes and distributes letters for the entire Australian community and between Australia and other countries overseas. It also offers bulk mail delivery services for businesses and community organisations and provides research, advice, consumer list rental, and profiling and segmentation services to help businesses target their objectives and customers, along with other associated services.

====Postal services====

While postal services of letters and parcels are one of the original areas of Australia Post, it has also diversified its operations into the provision of other services including agency services, business-to-business integration and logistics and supply chain management (see below).

====Postage rate====

=====Basic domestic=====

The basic postage rate for a small letter has increased over the years due to inflation but influenced in recent years by a complex interplay between Australia Post's monopoly over small items, and need to provide service to all Australian addresses at the mandated basic rate.
In July 2009, Australia Post requested the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) to approve a stamp price rise in 2010 to 60 cents but the ACCC declined the approval of the price rise, however in April 2010, Australia Post resubmitted the proposed postal stamp rise. The ACCC approved this request on 28 May 2010 and it was published in the Government Gazette on 9 June 2010.[tpl]cite news |title=Australia Post seeks postage increase |first= |last= |publisher=Inside Retailing |date=24 July 2009 |url=http://www.insideretailing.com.au/Latest/tabid/53/ID/5858/Australia-Post-seeks-postage-increase.aspx  |accessdate=22 April 2010[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Australia Post wants to raise the cost of stamp by five cents |first=Elissa |last=Doherty |publisher=Herald Sun |date=13 April 2010 |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/australia-post-wants-to-raise-the-cost-of-stamp-by-five-cents/story-e6frf7jo-1225853202762 |accessdate=22 April 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web | title=Commonwealth Gazette, Edition 22, 2010 | page=1148 | date=9 June 2010 | url=http://www.ag.gov.au/portal/govgazonline.nsf/98624e1d72c56173ca256cf4001cc123/75817cba09061107ca25773d001d2c62!OpenDocument[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=August 2013[/tpl]
In December 2013, due to the heavy decline in mail usage due to competition from email, etc., Australia Post requested an increase in the base rate to 70c.The Australian, 26 December 2013, page 1

======Large letters======

Since about 2005, larger letters have been charged a round multiple of the base postage rate, which is helpful to customers if they do not have stocks of the more expensive stamps.

===Agency services and retail merchandise===

Agency services: Australia Post provides third-party agency services that connect consumers, businesses and government bodies such as bill payment services, banking services and identity services. Australia Post also offers personal finance products, such as car and travel insurance[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/breaking-news/australia-post-pushes-into-insurance/story-e6frg90f-1225768589736|accessdate=7 March 2012|newspaper=The Australian|date=2 September 2009|first=Richard|last=Gluyas|title=Australia Post pushes into insurance[/tpl]  and currency conversion.
Retail Merchandise: A variety of complementary products, packaging products, collectibles and post office boxes and locked bags are offer across the vast network of Australia Post outlets in Australia.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2012[/tpl]

===Parcels and logistics===

It also provides complete end-to-end supply chain capabilities, from manufacturer (domestic or international) to consumer with integrated logistics services and a broad range of distribution options to track and trace deliveries.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2012[/tpl]

===Digital Services===

In 2011 Australia Post announced the launch of its Digital Mailbox. The service will allow businesses, government entities and customers to communicate through a secure online portal. The service provides secure digital delivery service to see and action all their transaction mail.  The secure digital vault will allow consumers to store important documents and will be available on mobile and desktop. Australia Post Digital MailBox is announced to launch in October 2012 [tpl]cite web|url=http://auspost.com.au/about-us/australia-post-digital-mailbox-launch-october-2012.html|title=Media release: Australia Post Digital MailBox to launch in October 2012|publisher=Australia Post|accessdate=7 November 2012[/tpl]

===Criticism===

Australia Post has had a long and difficult relationship with the Communication Workers Union.  The union has claimed that contractors provide a poor parcel delivery service, with a newspaper reporting anecdotes of unsatisfactory performance during the peak Christmas period, including a propensity to insert "delivery failure" cards into mailboxes rather than attempting delivery of packages, thus requiring the customer to travel to their local post office to collect items personally.
However, these delivery drivers are usually contractors as opposed to actual auspost employees.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.smh.com.au/small-business/managing/stamp-out-illegal-posties-union-20120113-1pylz.html | title=Stamp out illegal posties: union | publisher=Sydney morning Herald | date=13 January 2012 | accessdate=13 January 2012 | author=Ham, Larissa[/tpl]

==Letter boxes==

Letter boxes for houses and units (condominium) are mostly standard items bought from hardware stores.
Letter boxes for farms and sparsely located rural houses are often made from say 44 gallon barrels, and decorated to look like animals and somesuch.  Such boxes used to numbered using the Rural Mail Box system, but they are now numbered according to distance travelled on a main road.  Rural letter boxes are located on the road and not the farm.
