Zolpidem (brand names Ambien, Ambien CR, Intermezzo, Stilnox, Stilnoct, Sublinox, Hypnogen and Zolsana) is a prescription medication used for the treatment of insomnia and some brain disorders.[tpl]cite journal | author = Du B, Shan A, Zhang Y, Zhong X, Chen D, Cai K | title = Zolpidem Arouses Patients in Vegetative State After Brain Injury | journal = The American Journal of the Medical Sciences | volume = 347 | issue = 3 | pages = 178 | year = 2014 | pmid = 23462249 | doi = 10.1097/MAJ.0b013e318287c79c [/tpl] It is a short-acting nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic of the imidazopyridine class[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2007/019908s022lbl.pdf | title = Prescribing Information | accessdate = 2011-08-29 | year = 2007 | format = PDF | publisher = sanofi-aventis[/tpl] that potentiates GABA, an inhibitory neurotransmitter, by binding to GABAA receptors at the same location as benzodiazepines.[tpl]cite journal | author = Lemmer B | title = The sleep-wake cycle and sleeping pills | journal = Physiol.

Zolpidem has not adequately demonstrated effectiveness in maintaining sleep, unless delivered in a controlled-release (CR) form. However, it is effective in initiating sleep.[tpl]cite journal | author = Rosenberg RP | title = Sleep maintenance insomnia: strengths and weaknesses of current pharmacologic therapies | journal = Ann Clin Psychiatry | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 49–56 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16517453 | doi = 10.1080/10401230500464711 [/tpl] Its hypnotic effects are similar to those of the benzodiazepine class of drugs, but it is molecularly distinct from the classical benzodiazepine molecule and is classified as an imidazopyridine. Flumazenil, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, which is used for benzodiazepine overdose, can also reverse zolpidem's sedative/hypnotic and memory-impairing effects.[tpl]cite journal | author = Patat A, Naef MM, van Gessel E, Forster A, Dubruc C, Rosenzweig P | title = Flumazenil antagonizes the central effects of zolpidem, an imidazopyridine hypnotic | journal = Clin Pharmacol Ther | volume = 56 | issue = 4 | pages = 430–6 | date = October 1994 | pmid = 7955804 | doi = 10.1038/clpt.1994.157 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Wesensten NJ, Balkin TJ, Davis HQ, Belenky GL | title = Reversal of triazolam- and zolpidem-induced memory impairment by flumazenil | journal = Psychopharmacology (Berl) | volume = 121 | issue = 2 | pages = 242–9 | date = September 1995 | pmid = 8545530 | doi = 10.1007/BF02245635 [/tpl]
As a muscle relaxant and anticonvulsant, the drug's effects are not evident until dosages 10 and 20 times those required for sedation, respectively, are reached.[tpl]cite journal | author = Depoortere H, Zivkovic B, Lloyd KG, Sanger DJ, Perrault G, Langer SZ, Bartholini G | title = Zolpidem, a novel nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic.

Such drastically increased doses are also more inclined to induce one or more of the drug's adverse side effects, including hallucinations and amnesia. Contrary to early studies, more recent research has indicated that zolpidem is in fact a potent anticonvulsant.[tpl]cite journal | author = Vlainić J, Pericić D | title = Zolpidem is a potent anticonvulsant in adult and aged mice | journal = Brain Research | volume = 1310 | pages = 181–8 | date = 15 January 2010 | pmid = 19914223 | doi = 10.1016/j.brainres.2009.11.018 [/tpl] The anticonvulsant effects are not realized until the normal dosage range has been surpassed (meaning sedation would still be a major side effect) but the threshold for this effect is now believed to be considerably lower than original estimates.
The United States patent for zolpidem was held by the French pharmaceutical corporation Sanofi-Aventis.[tpl]Ref patent | country = US | number = 4382938 | title = Imidazo1,2-a pyridine derivatives and their application as pharmaceuticals | pubdate = 1983-05-10 | gdate = 1984-07-17 | inventor = Kaplan J-P, George P | assign1 = Synthelabo [/tpl] On April 23, 2007, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved 13 generic versions of zolpidem tartrate.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/2007/ucm108897.htm | title = FDA Approves First Generic Versions of Ambien (Zolpidem Tartrate) for the Treatment of Insomnia | work =  | accessdate = 2010-01-24[/tpl] Zolpidem is available from several generic manufacturers in the UK, as a generic from Sandoz in South Africa and TEVA in Israel, as well as from other manufacturers such as Ratiopharm and Takeda GmbH (both Germany).
On 2012, a study published in the BMJ Open journal revealed that sleeping pills, including zolpidem, are associated with a higher risk of death and cancer diagnosis. Nevertheless, the study showed only a link, and did not prove the deaths were caused by the pills or by other symptoms related to insomnia.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2012/feb/27/sleeping-pills-increase-risk-death-study | title = Sleeping pills increase risk of death, study suggests | Science | publisher = The Guardian | date = 2012-02-27 | accessdate = 2014-01-31 | location=London | first=Sarah | last=Boseley[/tpl]
On January 10, 2013, the Food and Drug Administration announced it is requiring the manufacturer of Ambien and Zolpimist to cut the recommended dosage for women in half, after laboratory studies showed that the medicines can leave patients drowsy in the morning and at risk for car accidents. The FDA recommended that manufacturers extend the new dosage cuts to men as well, who process the drug at a faster rate; however, the reasons men and women metabolize the drugs at different rates are still unknown.[tpl]cite news | title = FDA tells drugmakers to lower doses for Ambien, other sleeping pills | url = http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-204_162-57563277/fda-tells-drugmakers-to-lower-doses-for-ambien-other-sleeping-pills/ | publisher = CBS News | accessdate = 10 January 2013[/tpl] In May 2013, the FDA approved label changes specifying new dosage recommendations for zolpidem products because of concerns regarding next-morning impairment.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.lawyersandsettlements.com/articles/personal_injury/Ambien-FDA-Dosing-changes-18721.html#.UZPs8St35cI | title = FDA Changes Dosing on Ambien, Ambien CR, Zolpidem and Edluar | publisher = Lawyersandsettlements.com | date = 2013-05-15 | accessdate = 2014-01-31[/tpl]

==Medical uses==

Clinicians prescribe zolpidem for short-term (usually about two to six weeks) treatment of insomnia.[ref][tpl]cite web | title = Ambien | url = http://www.drugs.com/monograph/ambien.html | work = The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists | accessdate = 3 April 2011[/tpl]
[/ref] Zolpidem has not proven effective in maintaining sleep, but addresses sleep-initiation problems. The effect over placebo is of marginal clinical benefit.

==Adverse effects==

Side effects may include:
Some users have reported unexplained sleepwalking[tpl]cite web | last = Weil | first = Ellery | url = http://thoughtcatalog.com/2011/an-account-of-sharing-an-ambien-with-a-girl-i-met-one-week-prior-at-a-party/ | title = An Account of Sharing an Ambien with a Girl I Met One Week Prior at a Party | publisher = Thought Catalog | date = 2011-01-17 | accessdate = 2014-01-31[/tpl][tpl]or|date=September 2012[/tpl] while using zolpidem, as well as sleep driving,  binge eating while asleep, and performing other daily tasks while sleeping. Research by Australia's National Prescribing Service found these events occur mostly after the first dose taken, or within a few days of starting therapy.NPS Position Statement: Zolpidem and sleep-related behaviours (2008). Available at http://nps.org.au/news_and_media/media_releases/repository/zolpidem_stilnox_info_for_prescribers Rare reports of sexual parasomnia episodes related to zolpidem intake have also been reported.[tpl]cite journal | author = Schenck CH, Arnulf I, Mahowald MW | title = Sleep and sex: what can go wrong? A review of the literature on sleep related disorders and abnormal sexual behaviors and experiences | journal = Sleep | volume = 30 | issue = 6 | pages = 683–702 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17580590 | pmc = 1978350 | doi =  [/tpl] Sleepwalkers can sometimes perform these tasks as normally as they might if they were awake. They can sometimes carry on complex conversations and respond appropriately to questions or statements, so much so that observers may believe them to be awake. This is in contrast to "typical" sleep talking, which can usually be identified easily and is characterised by incoherent speech that often has no relevance to the situation or that is so disorganised as to be completely unintelligible.
Those under the influence of this medication may seem fully aware of their environments, though they are still asleep. This can bring about concerns for the safety of the sleepwalkers and others. These side effects may be related to the mechanism that also causes zolpidem to produce its hypnotic properties.[tpl]cite journal | author = Dolder CR, Nelson MH | title = Hypnosedative-induced complex behaviours : incidence, mechanisms and management | journal = CNS Drugs | volume = 22 | issue = 12 | pages = 1021–36 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18998740 | doi = 10.2165/0023210-200822120-00005 | url =  [/tpl] It is unclear whether the drug is responsible for the behavior, but a class-action lawsuit was filed against Sanofi-Aventis in March 2006 on behalf of those who reported symptoms.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.newsweek.com/id/46980 | title = Perchance To ... Eat?[/tpl][tpl]incomplete title|date=February 2014[/tpl] Conversely, it is possible some users believed they were asleep during these events because they do not remember the events, due to the short-term memory loss and anterograde amnesia side-effects.
Residual 'hangover' effects, such as sleepiness and impaired psychomotor and cognitive function, may persist into the day following nighttime administration. Such effects may impair the ability of users to drive safely and increase risks of falls and hip fractures.[tpl]cite journal | author = Vermeeren A | title = Residual effects of hypnotics: epidemiology and clinical implications | journal = CNS Drugs | volume = 18 | issue = 5 | pages = 297–328 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15089115 | doi = 10.2165/00023210-200418050-00003 [/tpl]
The Sydney Morning Herald in Australia in 2007  reported a man who fell 30 meters to his death from a high-rise unit balcony may have been sleepwalking under the influence of Stilnox. The coverage prompted over 40 readers to contact the newspaper with their own accounts of Stilnox-related automatism, and [tpl]As of|March 2007|lc=yes[/tpl], the drug was under review by the Adverse Drug Reactions Advisory Committee.[tpl]cite news | first = Heath | last = Gilmore | title = Sleeping pill safety under federal review | url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/sleeping-pill-safety-under-federal-review/2007/03/10/1173478729115.html | publisher = the Sydney Morning Herald | date = 2007-03-11 | accessdate = 2007-03-11[/tpl][tpl]update inline|date=September 2013[/tpl]
In February 2008, the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration attached a boxed warning to zolpidem, stating that "Zolpidem may be associated with potentially dangerous complex sleep-related behaviors that may include sleep walking, sleep driving, and other bizarre behaviours.  Zolpidem is not to be taken with alcohol. Caution is needed with other CNS-depressant drugs.  Limit use to four weeks maximum under close medical supervision."

===Tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal===

A review medical publication found long-term use of zolpidem is associated with drug tolerance, drug dependence, rebound insomnia, and CNS-related adverse effects. It was recommended that zolpidem be used for short periods of time using the lowest effective dose. Zolpidem 10 mg is effective in treating insomnia when used intermittently no fewer than three and no more than five pills per week for a period of 12 weeks.[tpl]cite journal | author = Perlis ML, McCall WV, Krystal AD, Walsh JK | title = Long-term, non-nightly administration of zolpidem in the treatment of patients with primary insomnia | journal = The Journal of clinical psychiatry | volume = 65 | issue = 8 | pages = 1128–1137 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15323600 | doi=10.4088/jcp.v65n0816[/tpl] The 15-mg zolpidem dosage provided no clinical advantage over the 10-mg zolpidem dosage.[tpl]cite journal | author = Scharf MB, Roth T, Vogel GW, Walsh JK | title = A multicenter, placebo-controlled study evaluating zolpidem in the treatment of chronic insomnia | journal = The Journal of clinical psychiatry | volume = 55 | issue = 5 | pages = 192–199 | year = 1994 | pmid = 8071269 [/tpl]
Nonpharmacological treatment options (e.g. cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia), however, were found to have sustained improvements in sleep quality.[tpl]cite journal | author = Kirkwood CK | title = Management of insomnia | journal = J Am Pharm Assoc (Wash) | volume = 39 | issue = 5 | pages = 688–96; quiz 713–4 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10533351 | doi =  | url =  [/tpl][tpl]title missing|date=February 2014[/tpl] Animal studies of the tolerance-inducing properties have shown that in rodents, zolpidem has less tolerance-producing potential than benzodiazepines, but in primates the tolerance-producing potential of zolpidem was the same as that of benzodiazepines.[tpl]cite journal | author = Petroski RE, Pomeroy JE, Das R, Bowman H, Yang W, Chen AP, Foster AC | title = Indiplon is a high-affinity positive allosteric modulator with selectivity for alpha1 subunit-containing GABAA receptors | journal = J.

Tolerance  to the effects of zolpidem can develop in some people in just a few weeks. Abrupt withdrawal may cause delirium, seizures, or other severe effects, especially if used for prolonged periods and at high dosages.[tpl]cite journal | author = Harter C, Piffl-Boniolo E, Rave-Schwank M | title = of drug withdrawal delirium after dependence on zolpidem and zoplicone | language = German | journal = Psychiatr Prax | volume = 26 | issue = 6 | page = 309 | date = November 1999 | pmid = 10627964 | doi =  | url =  | trans_title = Development of drug withdrawal delirium after dependence on zolpidem and zoplicone [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author =  | title = Hypnotic dependence: zolpidem and zopiclone too | journal = Prescrire Int | volume = 10 | issue = 51 | page = 15 | date = February 2001 | pmid = 11503851 | doi =  | url =  [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Sethi PK, Khandelwal DC | title = Zolpidem at supratherapeutic doses can cause drug abuse, dependence and withdrawal seizure | journal = J Assoc Physicians India | volume = 53 | issue =  | pages = 139–40 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15847035 | doi =  | url = http://www.japi.org/february2005/CR-139.pdf | format = PDF [/tpl]
When drug tolerance and physical dependence to zolpidem has developed, treatment usually entails a gradual dose reduction over a period of months to minimise withdrawal symptoms, which can resemble those seen during benzodiazepine withdrawal. Failing that, an alternative method may be necessary for some patients, such as a switch to a benzodiazepine equivalent dose of a longer-acting benzodiazepine drug, such as diazepam or chlordiazepoxide, followed by a gradual reduction in dosage of the long-acting benzodiazepine. Sometimes for difficult-to-treat patients, an inpatient flumazenil rapid detoxification program can be used to detoxify from a zolpidem drug dependence or addiction.[tpl]cite journal | author = Quaglio G, Lugoboni F, Fornasiero A, Lechi A, Gerra G, Mezzelani P | title = Dependence on zolpidem: two case reports of detoxification with flumazenil infusion | journal = Int Clin Psychopharmacol | volume = 20 | issue = 5 | pages = 285–7 | date = September 2005 | pmid = 16096519 | doi = 10.1097/01.yic.0000166404.41850.b4 [/tpl]
Alcohol has cross tolerance with GABAA receptor positive modulators such as the benzodiazepines and the nonbenzodiazepine drugs. For this reason, alcoholics or recovering alcoholics may be at increased risk of physical dependency on zolpidem. Also, alcoholics and drug abusers may be at increased risk of abusing and or becoming psychologically dependent on zolpidem. It should be avoided in those with a history of alcoholism, drug misuse, physical dependency, or psychological dependency on sedative-hypnotic drugs.  Zolpidem has rarely been associated with drug-seeking behavior,[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl] the risk of which is amplified in patients with a history of drug or alcohol abuse.

===Overdose===

An overdose of zolpidem may cause excessive sedation, pin-point pupils, or depressed respiratory function, which may progress to coma, and possibly death. Combined with alcohol, opiates, or other CNS depressants, it may be even more likely to lead to fatal overdoses. Zolpidem overdosage can be treated with the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil, which displaces zolpidem from its binding site on the benzodiazepine receptor to rapidly reverse the effects of the zolpidem.[tpl]cite journal | author = Lheureux P, Debailleul G, De Witte O, Askenasi R | title = Zolpidem intoxication mimicking narcotic overdose: response to flumazenil | journal = Human & Experimental Toxicology | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 105–7 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2111156 | doi = 10.1177/096032719000900209 [/tpl]

===Detection in body fluids===

Zolpidem may be quantitated in blood or plasma to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients, provide evidence in an impaired driving arrest, or to assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma zolpidem concentrations are usually in a range of 30–300 μg/l in persons receiving the drug therapeutically, 100–700 μg/l in those arrested for impaired driving, and 1000–7000 μg/l in victims of acute overdosage. Analytical techniques, in general, involve gas or liquid chromatography.[tpl]cite journal | author = Jones AW, Holmgren A, Kugelberg FC | title = Concentrations of scheduled prescription drugs in blood of impaired drivers: considerations for interpreting the results | journal = Ther.

==Special precautions==

===Driving===

Use of zolpidem may impair driving skills with a resultant increased risk of road traffic accidents. This adverse effect is not unique to zolpidem but also occurs with other hypnotic drugs. Caution should be exercised by motor vehicle drivers.[tpl]cite journal | author = Gustavsen I, Bramness JG, Skurtveit S, Engeland A, Neutel I, Mørland J | title = Road traffic accident risk related to prescriptions of the hypnotics zopiclone, zolpidem, flunitrazepam and nitrazepam | journal = Sleep Med. | volume = 9 | issue = 8 | pages = 818–22 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 18226959 | doi = 10.1016/j.sleep.2007.11.011 | url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1389-9457(07)00424-8 [/tpl] Studies showed that eight hours after a bedtime dose of 10 mg, 15% of women and 3% of men would have blood levels that produce impaired driving skills; for an extended-release dose of 12.5 mg, the risk increased to 33% and 25%, respectively. As a consequence, the FDA recommended the dose for women be reduced and that prescribers should consider lower doses for men.[tpl]cite journal | title = FDA Requires Lower Dosing of Zolpidem | journal = The Medical Letter on Drugs and Therapeutics | volume = 55 | issue = 1408 | page = 5 | publisher = The Medical Letter | date = January 21, 2013 | url = http://secure.medicalletter.org/cannotaccess?ac=1&a=1408a&t=article&n=11758&p=tml&title=FDA%20Requires%20Lower%20Dosing%20of%20Zolpidem&i=1408 | accessdate = April 14, 2013[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal | title = FDA Drug Safety Communication: Risk of next-morning impairment after use of insomnia drugs; FDA requires lower recommended doses for certain drugs containing zolpidem (Ambien, Ambien CR, Edluar, and Zolpimist) | date = January 10, 2013 | publisher = FDA | url = http://www.fda.gov/drugs/drugsafety/ucm334033.htm | accessdate = April 14, 2013 | postscript = [tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl] [/tpl]

===Elderly===

The elderly are more sensitive to the effects of hypnotics including zolpidem. Zolpidem causes an increased risk of falls and may induce adverse cognitive effects.[tpl]cite journal | author = Antai-Otong D | title = The art of prescribing. Risks and benefits of non-benzodiazepine receptor agonists in the treatment of acute primary insomnia in older adults | journal = Perspect Psychiatr Care | volume = 42 | issue = 3 | pages = 196–200 | date = August 2006 | pmid = 16916422 | doi = 10.1111/j.1744-6163.2006.00070.x | url = http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118727940/abstract [/tpl]
An extensive review of the medical literature regarding the management of insomnia and the elderly found that there is considerable evidence of the effectiveness and durability of nondrug treatments for insomnia in adults of all ages, and  these interventions are underused. Compared with the benzodiazepines, the nonbenzodiazepine (including zolpidem) sedative-hypnotics appeared to offer few, if any, significant clinical advantages in efficacy or tolerability in elderly persons. Newer agents with novel mechanisms of action and improved safety profiles, such as the melatonin agonists, were found to hold promise for the management of chronic insomnia in elderly people. Long-term use of sedative-hypnotics for insomnia lacks an evidence base and has traditionally been discouraged for reasons that include concerns about such potential adverse drug effects as cognitive impairment (anterograde amnesia), daytime sedation, motor incoordination, and increased risk of motor vehicle accidents and falls. In addition, the effectiveness and safety of long-term use of these agents remain to be determined. More research is needed to evaluate the long-term effects of treatment and the most appropriate management strategy for elderly persons with chronic insomnia.[tpl]cite journal | author = Bain KT | title = Management of chronic insomnia in elderly persons | journal = Am J Geriatr Pharmacother | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 168–92 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16860264 | doi = 10.1016/j.amjopharm.2006.06.006 [/tpl]

===Gastroesophageal reflux disease===

Patients suffering from gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) had reflux events measured to be significantly longer when taking zolpidem than on placebo. The same trend was found for reflux events in patients without GERD. This is assumed to be due to suppression of arousal during the reflux event, which would normally result in a swallowing reflex to clear gastric acid from the esophagus.  Patients with GERD who take zolpidem, thus, experience significantly higher esophageal exposure to gastric acid, which increases the likelihood of their developing esophageal cancer.[tpl]cite journal | author = Gagliardi GS, Shah AP, Goldstein M, Denua-Rivera S, Doghramji K, Cohen S, Dimarino AJ | title = Effect of zolpidem on the sleep arousal response to nocturnal esophageal acid exposure | journal = Clin.

===Pregnancy===

Zolpidem has been assigned to pregnancy category C by the FDA. Animal studies have revealed evidence of incomplete ossification and increased postimplantation fetal loss at doses greater than seven times the maximum recommended human dose or higher; however, teratogenicity was not observed at any dose level. There are no controlled data in human pregnancy. In one case report, zolpidem was found in cord blood at delivery. Zolpidem is recommended for use during pregnancy only when benefits outweigh risks.

A meta-analysis of the randomised, controlled, clinical trials that compared benzodiazepines against nonbenzodiazepines such as zolpidem has shown few consistent differences between zolpidem and benzodiazepines in terms of sleep onset latency, total sleep duration, number of awakenings, quality of sleep, adverse events, tolerance, rebound insomnia, and daytime alertness.[tpl]cite journal | author = Dündar Y, Dodd S, Strobl J, Boland A, Dickson R, Walley T | title = Comparative efficacy of newer hypnotic drugs for the short-term management of insomnia: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Human psychopharmacology | volume = 19 | issue = 5 | pages = 305–22 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15252823 | doi = 10.1002/hup.594 [/tpl]

==Chemistry==

Three syntheses of zolpidem are common. 4-methylacetophenone is used as a common precursor. This is brominated and reacted with 2-amino-5-methylpyridine to give the imidazopyridine. From here the reactions use a variety of reagents to complete the synthesis, either involving thionyl chloride or sodium cyanide. These reagents are challenging to handle and require thorough safety assessments.[tpl]cite isbn|9780471752158[/tpl] Chapter 15, Section 2[tpl]Cite patent | inventor-last = Rawalnath | inventor-first = Sakhardande Rajiv | inventor2-last = Crasta Santosh | inventor2-first = Richard | inventor3-last = SAXENA | inventor3-first = ALOK | publication-date = 21-Dec-2005 | title = Process for the preparation of zolpidem | issue-date = 14-Feb-2011 | country-code = IN | patent-number = 246080 | postscript = [tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl][tpl]cite journal | last1 = Sumalatha | first1 = Y. | title = A simple and efficient synthesis of hypnotic agent, zolpidem and its related substances | journal = Arkivoc | volume = 2009 | issue = 2 | pages = 315–320 | year = 2009 | pmid =  | pmc =  | doi = 10.3998/ark.5550190.0010.230 [/tpl] Though such safety procedures are common in industry, they make clandestine manufacture difficult.

===Drug-drug interactions===

Notable drug-drug interactions with the pharmacokinetics of zolpidem include chlorpromazine, fluconazole, imipramine, itraconazole, ketoconazole, rifampicin, and ritonavir. Interactions with carbamazepine and phenytoin can be expected based on their metabolic pathways, but have not yet been studied. There does not appear to be any interaction between zolpidem and cimetidine or ranitidine.[tpl]cite journal | author = Hulhoven R, Desager JP, Harvengt C, Hermann P, Guillet P, Thiercelin JF | title = Lack of interaction between zolpidem and H2 antagonists, cimetidine and ranitidine | journal = International journal of clinical pharmacology research | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = 471–476 | year = 1988 | pmid = 3253224 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Wang JS, DeVane CL | title = Pharmacokinetics and drug interactions of the sedative hypnotics | journal = Psychopharmacol Bull | volume = 37 | issue = 1 | pages = 10–29 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14561946 | doi = 10.1007/BF01990373 | url = http://www.medworksmedia.com/psychopharmbulletin/pdf/12/010-029_PB%20W03_Wang_final.pdf | format = PDF | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070709230745/http://www.medworksmedia.com/psychopharmbulletin/pdf/12/010-029_PB%20W03_Wang_final.pdf | archivedate = 2007-07-09 [/tpl] However, it was noted in the same study that cimetidine did appear to prolong the hypnotic effects of Zolpidem beyond its typical 3 hour duration, which is indicative of some sort of metabolic interaction.

==Misuse==

===Recreational use===

Zolpidem has a potential for either medical misuse when the drug is continued long term without or against medical advice or recreational use when the drug is taken to achieve a "high".[tpl]cite journal | author = Griffiths RR, Johnson MW | title = Relative abuse liability of hypnotic drugs: a conceptual framework and algorithm for differentiating among compounds | journal = J Clin Psychiatry | volume = 66 Suppl 9 | issue =  | pages = 31–41 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16336040 | doi =  | url =  [/tpl] The transition from medical use of zolpidem to high-dose addiction or drug dependence can occur when used without a doctor's recommendation to continue using it, when physiological drug tolerance leads to higher doses than the usual 5 mg or 10 mg, when consumed through inhalation or injection, or when taken for purposes other than as a sleep aid. Misuse is more prevalent in those having been dependent on other drugs in the past, but tolerance and drug dependence can still sometimes occur in those without a history of drug dependence. Chronic users of high doses are more likely to develop physical dependence on the drug, which may cause severe withdrawal symptoms, including seizures, if abrupt withdrawal from zolpidem occurs.[tpl]cite journal | author = Barrero-Hernández FJ, Ruiz-Veguilla M, López-López MI, Casado-Torres A | title = seizures as a sign of abstinence from chronic consumption of zolpidem | language = Spanish; Castilian | journal = Rev Neurol | volume = 34 | issue = 3 | pages = 253–6 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12022074 | doi =  | url =  | trans_title = Epileptic seizures as a sign of abstinence from chronic consumption of zolpidem [/tpl]
One case history reported a woman detoxifying from a high dose of zolpidem experiencing a generalized seizure, with clinical withdrawal and dependence effects reported to be similar to the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome.[tpl]cite journal | author = Cubała WJ, Landowski J | title = Seizure following sudden zolpidem withdrawal | journal = Prog.

Nonmedical use of zolpidem is increasingly common in the U.S., Canada, and the UK.  Recreational users report that resisting the drug's hypnotic effects can in some cases elicit vivid visuals and a body high.[tpl]cite news | url = http://cbs11tv.com/investigators/Ambien.Sleeping.Medication.2.496959.html[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl][tpl]link note|note=contains additional text[/tpl] Some users have reported decreased anxiety, mild euphoria, perceptual changes, visual distortions, and hallucinations.[ref]

Other drugs, including the benzodiazepines and zopiclone, are also found in high numbers of suspected drugged drivers. Many drivers have blood levels far exceeding the therapeutic dose range suggesting a high degree of excessive-use potential for benzodiazepines, zolpidem and zopiclone.[tpl]cite journal | author = Jones AW, Holmgren A, Kugelberg FC | title = Concentrations of scheduled prescription drugs in blood of impaired drivers: considerations for interpreting the results | journal = Therapeutic drug monitoring | volume = 29 | issue = 2 | pages = 248–60 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17417081 | doi = 10.1097/FTD.0b013e31803d3c04 [/tpl]  U.S. Congressman Patrick J.

Zolpidem, along with the other benzodiazepine-like Z-drugs is a Schedule IV controlled substance in the U.S., according to the Controlled Substances Act, given its potential for abuse and dependence.

===Date-rape drug===

According to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, zolpidem (Ambien, Stilnox) is quickly overtaking illegal sedatives as the most common date-rape drug. Perpetrators of sexual assault have used zolpidem on unsuspecting victims.[tpl]cite journal | author = Kintz P | title = Bioanalytical procedures for detection of chemical agents in hair in the case of drug-facilitated crimes | journal = Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry | volume = 388 | issue = 7 | pages = 1467–1474 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17340077 | doi = 10.1007/s00216-007-1209-z [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Madea B, Musshoff F | title = Knock-out drugs: their prevalence, modes of action, and means of detection | journal = Deutsches Arzteblatt international | volume = 106 | issue = 20 | pages = 341–347 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19547737 | pmc = 2689633 | doi = 10.3238/arztebl.2009.0341 [/tpl] 

==Usage==

Zolpidem is one of the most common GABA-potentiating sleeping medications prescribed in the Netherlands, with a total of 582,660 prescriptions dispensed in 2008.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.gipdatabank.nl/ | title = Home | GIPdatabank | publisher = Gipdatabank.nl | date = 2013-11-15 | accessdate = 2014-01-31[/tpl]
The United States Air Force uses zolpidem as one of the hypnotics approved as "no-go pills" to help aviators and special duty personnel sleep in support of mission readiness (the other hypnotics used are temazepam and zaleplon during war time). "Ground tests" are required prior to authorization issued to use the medication in an operational situation.http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/AFSOCI48-101.pdf[tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl] [tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl]

==Research==

Zolpidem may provide short-lasting but effective improvement in symptoms of aphasia present in some survivors of stroke. The mechanism for improvement in these cases remains unexplained and is the focus of current research by several groups, to explain how a drug that acts as a hypnotic-sedative in people with normal brain function, can increase speech ability in people recovering from severe brain injury. Use of zolpidem for this application remains experimental at this time, and is not officially approved by any pharmaceutical manufacturers of zolpidem or medical regulatory agencies worldwide.[tpl]cite journal | author = Clauss R, Nel W | title = Drug induced arousal from the permanent vegetative state | journal = NeuroRehabilitation | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 23–8 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16720934 | doi =  | url =  [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Whyte J, Myers R | title = Incidence of clinically significant responses to zolpidem among patients with disorders of consciousness: a preliminary placebo controlled trial | journal = American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation / Association of Academic Physiatrists | volume = 88 | issue = 5 | pages = 410–8 | date = May 2009 | pmid = 19620954 | doi = 10.1097/PHM.0b013e3181a0e3a0 | url =  [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Hall SD, Yamawaki N, Fisher AE, Clauss RP, Woodhall GL, Stanford IM | title = GABA(A) alpha-1 subunit mediated desynchronization of elevated low frequency oscillations alleviates specific dysfunction in stroke--a case report | journal = Clinical Neurophysiology : Official Journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology | volume = 121 | issue = 4 | pages = 549–55 | date = April 2010 | pmid = 20097125 | doi = 10.1016/j.clinph.2009.11.084 | url =  [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Nyakale NE, Clauss RP, Nel W, Sathekge M | title = Clinical and brain SPECT scan response to zolpidem in patients after brain damage | journal = Arzneimittel-Forschung | volume = 60 | issue = 4 | pages = 177–81 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20486466 | doi = 10.1055/s-0031-1296269 | url =  [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Machado C, Estévez M, Pérez-Nellar J, Gutiérrez J, Rodríguez R, Carballo M, Chinchilla M, Machado A, Portela L, García-Roca MC, Beltrán C | title = Autonomic, EEG, and behavioral arousal signs in a PVS case after Zolpidem intake | journal = The Canadian Journal of Neurological Sciences.
