Allopurinol (Zyloprim, and generics) is a drug used primarily to treat hyperuricemia (excess uric acid in blood plasma) and its complications, including chronic gout.[tpl]cite journal |pages=87–114 |pmc=2233605 |doi=10.1124/pr.58.1.6 |title=Therapeutic Effects of Xanthine Oxidase Inhibitors: Renaissance Half a Century after the Discovery of Allopurinol |year=2006 |last1=Pacher |first1=P. |journal=Pharmacological Reviews |volume=58 |pmid=16507884 |last2=Nivorozhkin |first2=A |last3=Szabó |first3=C |issue=1[/tpl] It is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor which is administered orally.
It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, a list of the most important medication needed in a basic health system.[tpl]cite web|title=WHO Model List of EssentialMedicines|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/93142/1/EML_18_eng.pdf?ua=1|work=World Health Organization|accessdate=22 April 2014|date=October 2013[/tpl]

==Medical uses==

===Gout and hyperuricemia===

Subsequently the uric acid lowering capacity of allopurinol was noted and the drug went on to be developed for its more famous use: to treat hyperuricemia (excess uric acid in blood plasma) and its complications. Allopurinol does not alleviate acute attacks of gout,[tpl]cite journal|last=Taylor, MD|first=TH|coauthors=Mecchella JN, Larson RJ, Kerin KD, Mackenzie TA|title=Initiation of allopurinol at first medical contact for acute attacks of gout: a randomized clinical trial|journal=JAMA|date=November 2012|volume=125|issue=11|pages=1126–1134|pmid=23098865|doi=10.1016/j.amjmed.2012.05.025[/tpl] and there is currently controversy over the issue of whether it can actually make acute gout attacks worse initially, but is useful in chronic gout to prevent future attacks.

===Tumor lysis syndrome===

Allopurinol was also commonly used to treat tumor lysis syndrome in chemotherapeutic treatments as these regimes can rapidly produce severe acute hyperuricemia, although it has gradually been replaced by urate oxidase therapy.[tpl]cite journal |author= Jeha S. |title= Tumor lysis syndrome |journal= Semin Hematol.|volume= 38 |issue=4 Suppl 10 |pages=4–8 |year=2001 |pmid=11694945 |doi= 10.1016/S0037-1963(01)90037-X [/tpl]

===Thiopurine co-therapy===

Allopurinol can cause severe pancytopenia if given with full-dose  mercaptopurine or its pro-drug azathioprine, due to the inhibition of xanthine oxidase that metabolizes mercaptopurine.[tpl]cite journal |author= Evans WE. |title= Pharmacogenetics of thiopurine S-methyltransferase and thiopurine therapy |journal= Ther Drug Monit. |volume= 26 |issue=2 |pages=186–91 |year=2004 |pmid=15228163|doi= 10.1097/00007691-200404000-00018 |first2= EA |first3= H |first4= MT |first5= KA |first6= T |first7= P |first8= JM |first9= SA |first10= SR |first11= FF [/tpl] For this reason, allopurinol has been strongly contraindicated during thiopurine therapy in the past.
However, in recent years the use of allopurinol in combination with azathioprine or mercaptopurine has been revived. First, it was shown that an azathioprine/allopurinol combination significantly improved renal transplant graft survival.[tpl]cite journal |author= Chocair PR, Duley JA, Simmonds HA et al. |title= Low dose allopurinol, plus azathioprine/ cyclosporin/ prednisolone, a novel immunosuppressive regimen |journal= Lancet |volume= 342 |issue=8863 |pages=83–84 |year=1993 |pmid=8100914 |doi= 10.1016/0140-6736(93)91287-V [/tpl] More recently, it was discovered that this co-therapy greatly improves the outcome for patients that do not respond to thiopurine monotherapy when treating inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), specifically Crohn's disease.[tpl]cite journal |author= Sparrow MP, Hande SA, Friedman S et al. |title= Effect of allopurinol on clinical outcomes in inflammatory bowel disease nonresponders to azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine |journal= Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol. |volume= 5 |issue=2 |pages=209–214 |year=2007 |pmid=17296529 |doi=10.1016/j.cgh.2006.11.020[/tpl] Co-therapy has also been shown to greatly improve hepatoxicity side effects in treatment of IBD.[tpl]cite journal |author= Ansari AR, Patel N, Sanderson J, et al. |title= Low dose azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine in combination with allopurinol can bypass many adverse drug reactions in patients with inflammatory bowel disease |journal= Aliment Pharmacol Ther |volume= 31 |issue=6 |pages=640–647 |year=2010 |pmid=20015102 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2036.2009.04221.x[/tpl] Co-therapy invariably requires dose reduction of the thiopurine, usually to 1/3 of the standard dose depending upon the patient's genetic status for thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT).[tpl]cite journal |author= Ansari AR, Duley JA. |title= Azathioprine co-therapy with allopurinol for inflammatory bowel disease: trials and tribulations |journal= Rev Assoc Med Bras |volume=58 |issue=Suppl.1 |pages=S28–33 |date=March 2012 [/tpl]

===Reperfusion injury===

Other established indications for allopurinol therapy include ischemic reperfusion injury, kidney stones with a uric acid component (uric acid nephrolithiasis), and protozoal infections (Leishmaniasis).

===Renal disease, Heart failure and Angina===

Allopurinol can be used in patients with poor kidney function, but it may also help them. A study of allopurinol use in patients with chronic kidney disease suggested that "Allopurinol decreases C-reactive protein and slows down the progression of renal disease in patients with chronic kidney disease. In addition, allopurinol reduces cardiovascular and hospitalization risk in these subjects."[tpl]cite journal |pages=1388–93 |doi=10.2215/CJN.01580210 |pmc=2924417 |title=Effect of Allopurinol in Chronic Kidney Disease Progression and Cardiovascular Risk |year=2010 |last1=Goicoechea |first1=M. |last2=De Vinuesa |first2=S. G. |last3=Verdalles |first3=U. |last4=Ruiz-Caro |first4=C. |last5=Ampuero |first5=J. |last6=Rincón |first6=A. |last7=Arroyo |first7=D. |last8=Luño |first8=J. |journal=Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology |volume=5 |issue=8 |pmid=20538833[/tpl].
A mechanistic study in patients with chronic heart failure has shown that the actions of allopurinol may be due to its inhibition of xanthine oxidase rather than a urate-lowering effect. This study also showed for the first time that a high dose (600 mg) is significantly better at improving endothelial function compared to standard doses.[tpl]cite journal | pmid = 17130343 | year = 2006 | last1 = George | first1 = J | last2 = Carr | first2 = E | last3 = Davies | first3 = J | last4 = Belch | first4 = JJ | last5 = Struthers | first5 = A | title = High-dose allopurinol improves endothelial function by profoundly reducing vascular oxidative stress and not by lowering uric acid | volume = 114 | issue = 23 | pages = 2508–16 | doi = 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.651117 | journal = Circulation [/tpl]
A recent study has suggested that allopurinol may help reduce the effects of angina in ischaemic heart disease by reducing the workload on the heart.[tpl]Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/10254759.stm |title=Gout drug 'can prevent angina pain of heart disease' |work=BBC News |date=8 June 2010[/tpl]

===Epilepsy===

Allopurinol is used as an add-on drug for refractory epilepsy, because it is an adenosine agonist, which inhibits glutamine release from excitatory neurons, but does not change the plasma concentration of other epilepsy drugs.Drug-Resistant Epilepsy N Engl J Med 2011; 365:2238-2240December 8, 2011

===Blood pressure===

Allopurinol can decrease blood pressure reducing hypertension.[tpl]cite journal |pages=924–32 |doi=10.1001/jama.300.8.924 |laysummary=http://pediatrics.jwatch.org/cgi/content/full/2008/903/1 |laysource=Journal Watch |laydate=September 3, 2008 |title=Effect of Allopurinol on Blood Pressure of Adolescents with Newly Diagnosed Essential Hypertension: A Randomized Trial |year=2008 |last1=Feig |first1=D. I. |last2=Soletsky |first2=B. |last3=Johnson |first3=R. J. |journal=JAMA: the Journal of the American Medical Association |volume=300 |issue=8[/tpl]

==Side-effects==

Because allopurinol is not a uricosuric, it can be used in patients with poor kidney function.  However, allopurinol has two important disadvantages.
First, its dosing is complex.[tpl]cite journal |pages=391–5 |doi=10.1111/j.1525-139X.2007.00270.x |title=Allopurinol Dosing in Renal Impairment: Walking the Tightrope Between Adequate Urate Lowering and Adverse Events |year=2007 |last1=Dalbeth |first1=Nicola |last2=Stamp |first2=Lisa |journal=Seminars in Dialysis |volume=20 |issue=5 |pmid=17897242[/tpl] Second, some patients are hypersensitive to the drug,[tpl]cite journal |author= Tsai TF, Yeh TY. |title= Allopurinol in dermatology |journal= Am J Clin Dermatol. |volume= 11 |issue=4 |pages=225–232 |year=2010 |pmid=20509717 |doi=10.2165/11533190-000000000-00000[/tpl] therefore its use requires careful monitoring. Allopurinol has rare but potentially fatal adverse effects involving the skin. The most serious adverse effect is a hypersensitivity syndrome consisting of fever, skin rash, eosinophilia, hepatitis, worsened renal function, and, in some cases, allopurinol hypersensitivity syndrome. Allopurinol is one of the drugs commonly known to cause Stevens–Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TENS), two life-threatening dermatological conditions.[tpl]cite journal| author=Roujeau JC| title=Medication use and the risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis | journal=N Engl J Med | year= 1995 | volume= 333 | issue= 24 | pages= 1600–7 | pmid=7477195 | doi=10.1056/NEJM199512143332404 | pmc= | url=| author-separator=,| author2=Kelly JP| author3=Naldi L| author4=Rzany B| author5=Stern RS| author6=Anderson T| display-authors=6| last7=Auquier| first7=Ariane| last8=Bastuji-Garin| first8=Sylvie| last9=Correia| first9=Osvaldo| first10=Francesco| first11=Maja [/tpl] More common is a less-serious rash that leads to discontinuing this drug. 
Studies have found HLA-B*5801 allele as a genetic marker for severe cutaneous adverse reactions that include Steven Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrosis caused by allopurinol.[tpl]cite journal |pmid=15743917 |year=2005 |last1=Hung |first1=SI |last2=Chung |first2=WH |last3=Liou |first3=LB |last4=Chu |first4=CC |last5=Lin |first5=M |last6=Huang |first6=HP |last7=Lin |first7=YL |last8=Lan |first8=JL |last9=Yang |first9=LC |title=HLA-B*5801 allele as a genetic marker for severe cutaneous adverse reactions caused by allopurinol |volume=102 |issue=11 |pages=4134–9 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0409500102 |pmc=554812 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |last10=Hong |first10=H.-S. |last11=Chen |first11=M.-J. |last12=Lai |first12=P.-C. |last13=Wu |first13=M.-S. |last14=Chu |first14=C.-Y. |last15=Wang |first15=K.-H. |last16=Chen |first16=C.-H. |last17=Fann |first17=C. S. J. |last18=Wu |first18=J.-Y. |last19=Chen |first19=Y.-T.[/tpl]
More rarely, allopurinol can also result in the depression of bone marrow elements, leading to cytopenias, as well as aplastic anemia. Moreover, allopurinol can also cause peripheral neuritis in some patients, although this is a rare side effect. Another side effect of allopurinol is interstitial nephritis.[tpl]cite book|last=Marc E. De Broe, William M. Bennett, George A. Porter |first=|title=Clinical Nephrotoxins: Renal Injury from Drugs and Chemicals |url=http://books.google.com/?id=sLM8F-IBgNcC&pg=PA317&dq=interstitial+nephritis+allopurinol#v=onepage&q=interstitial%20nephritis%20allopurinol&f=false|year=2003|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media|quote=Acute interstitial nephritis has also been reported associated with by the administration of allopurinol.|isbn=9781402012778[/tpl]
It is suspected to cause congenital malformations in a newborn infant whose mother was on allopurinol treatment through the pregnancy, and should be avoided whenever possible by women trying to conceive or during pregnancy.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1002/ajmg.a.34139 |title=Potential teratogenic effects of allopurinol: A case report |year=2011 |last1=Kozenko |first1=Mariya |last2=Grynspan |first2=David |last3=Oluyomi-Obi |first3=Titi |last4=Sitar |first4=Daniel |last5=Elliott |first5=Alison M. |last6=Chodirker |first6=Bernard N. |journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics Part A |volume=155 |issue=9 |pages=2247–52 |pmid=21815259[/tpl]

==Mechanism of action==

Allopurinol is a purine analog; it is a structural isomer of hypoxanthine (a naturally occurring purine in the body) and is an inhibitor of the enzyme xanthine oxidase. Xanthine oxidase is responsible for the successive oxidation of hypoxanthine and xanthine, resulting in the production of uric acid, the product of human purine metabolism. In addition to blocking uric acid production, inhibition of xanthine oxidase causes an increase in hypoxanthine and xanthine. While xanthine cannot be converted to purine ribotides, hypoxanthine can be salvaged to the purine ribotides adenosine and guanosine monophosphates. Increased levels of these ribotides may cause feedback inhibition of amidophosphoribosyl transferase, the first and rate-limiting enzyme of purine biosynthesis. Allopurinol, therefore, decreases uric acid formation and may also inhibit purine synthesis.[tpl]cite journal |author= Cameron JS, Moro F, Simmonds HA. |title= Gout, uric acid and purine metabolism in paediatric nephrology |journal= Pediatr Nephrol.|volume= 7 |issue=1 |pages=105–118 |year=1993 |pmid=8439471 |doi= 10.1007/BF00861588 [/tpl]

==History==

Allopurinol was first synthesized and reported in 1956 by Roland K. Robins (1926-1992), in a search for antineoplasitic agents.[tpl]cite journal | author = R. K. Robins | journal = J. Amer. Chem. Soc. | volume = 78 | pages = 784 | year = 1956 | doi = 10.1021/ja01585a023 | title = Potential Purine Antagonists. I. Synthesis of Some 4,6-Substituted Pyrazolo \3,4-d] pyrimidines1 | issue = 4[/tpl]
Allopurinol inhibits the breakdown (catabolism) of the thiopurine drug mercaptopurine, and it was later employed by Gertrude Elion to enhance the action of mercaptopurine in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.[tpl]cite journal |author= Elion GB. |title= The purine path to chemotherapy (Nobel lecture in physiology or medicine - 1988) |journal= Science |volume= 244 |issue=4900 |pages=41–47 |year=1989 |pmid=2649979 |doi=10.1126/science.2649979[/tpl] However, no improvement in leukemia response was noted with mercaptopurine-allopurinol co-therapy, and this use of the drug was abandoned.

==Metabolism==

A common misconception is that allopurinol is metabolized by its target, xanthine oxidase, but this action is principally carried out by Aldehyde oxidase.[tpl]cite journal |author= Reiter S, Simmonds HA, Zöllner N, et al. |title= Demonstration of a combined deficiency of xanthine oxidase and aldehyde oxidase in xanthinuric patients not forming oxipurinol |journal= Clin Chim Acta |volume= 187 |issue=3 |pages=221–234 |year=1990 |pmid=2323062 |doi= 10.1016/0009-8981(90)90107-4 [/tpl] The active metabolite of allopurinol is oxypurinol, which is also an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase. Allopurinol is almost completely metabolized to oxypurinol within two hours of oral administration, whereas oxypurinol is slowly excreted by the kidneys over 18–30 hours. For this reason, oxypurinol is believed responsible for the majority of allopurinol's effect.[tpl]cite journal |author= Day RO, Graham GG, Hicks M, et al. |title= Clinical pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of allopurinol and oxypurinol |journal= Clin Pharmacokinet. |volume= 46 |issue=8 |pages=623–644 |year=2007 |pmid=17655371 |doi= 10.2165/00003088-200746080-00001 [/tpl]

==Brand names==

Allopurinol has been marketed in the United States since August 19, 1966, when it was first approved by FDA under the trade name of Zyloprim.http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/index.cfm  Allopurinol was marketed at the time by Burroughs-Wellcome. Allopurinol is now a generic drug sold under a variety of brand names including Allohexal, Allosig, Milurit, Alloril, Progout, Zyloprim, Zyloric, Zyrik and Aluron.http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/search.cfm?startswith=Allopurinol&x=0&y=0
