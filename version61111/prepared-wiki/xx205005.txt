thumb|widthpxThe TransAndalus is a 2000 km long mountain bike route which makes a complete circuit through the autonomous region of Andalusia and runs the length of its eight provinces.

==History==

This project began in the year 2000. Antonio C. Álvarez and Juan Manuel Muñoz, cyclists from Huelva and lovers of bicycle touring had the idea of creating a route for MTBs that passed through all of Andalucía, relying on the collaboration of volunteers who took charge of the documentation of each section.
In 2001 the project virtually disappeared, but in 2004 it was revived. A key figure was, and is, that of Fran Cortes, the project coordinator. Without his administrative skills the project would never have reached its present state. On its rebirth around ten Andalusian cyclists got into the act, and they each began to work on the zone which they had chosen. The route was mapped and put on online. The original website was www.i2-bike.com, later it was hosted at www.andalucia.mtbdigital.com. In 2005 a project name was selected along with its current web domain www.transandalus.org.

==Characteristics of the Route==

The basic project ideas are as follows:
It must be emphasised that the TransAndalus does not have an initial stage. The route is broken up into sections, with the intention being that the route should travel between two villages with at least minimal facilities for overnight accommodation. Thus every traveller can make the trip at their own pace, choosing where to begin and end, and selecting the length of each section made up of various stages.

==Roadbooks==

The basic information about the complete sections is available in the roadbooks, which consist of:

==About==

The TransAndalus is made and maintained by local cyclists who have each contributed their small part to this great project by sharing their knowledge of the roads and paths of Andalusia. Every collaborator that completes the documentation of their own segment will be recorded as the author of their own contribution, in recognition of their generous work, and they will be responsible, for better or worse, for the information that appears in that part.
