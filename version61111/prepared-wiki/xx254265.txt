The What A Summer Stakes is an American Thoroughbred horse race held annually in January at Laurel Park Racecourse in Laurel, Maryland. The What A Summer Stakes, is open to fillies and mares age four-years-old and up willing to race six furlongs on the dirt. It was the 26th running of the stakes race in 2010.
An ungraded stakes race, it offers a purse of $100,000. The race was previously restricted to Maryland-breds between 1978 and 1992. The race was run for fillies and mares from age three and up from 1978 through 1985 and was run under handicap conditions during that same time. The race was restricted to two year-olds from 1985 to 1992.
The race was named in honor of What A Summer, a gray mare by What Luck. She was an Eclipse Award winner and was named American Champion Sprint Horse in 1977. She was bred in Maryland by Milton Polinger. What A Summer was a foal in 1973 and won 18 of 31 starts in her career. Her most memorable race was perhaps her dominating performance in the defacto second leg of the filly Triple Crown, the Black-Eyed Susan Stakes. She also won the Fall Highweight Handicap twice (carrying 134 pounds each time), the Silver Spoon Handicap twice, the Maskette Handicap and four other stakes. In addition to her 18 wins she also placed nine times with earnings of $479,161. That record of 27 first or second finishes in 31 starts at 87% is among the best in history.2007 Maryland Jockey Club Media Guide, page 466 on March 3, 2007.
What A Summer was trained by Bud Delp while racing for Polinger. She was bought by Diana Firestone following Polinger's death in 1976. Mrs. Firestone turned the mare over to trainer Leroy Jolley. She was named Maryland-bred horse of the year in 1977 and twice was named champion older mare. What A Summer was retired in 1878 and as a broodmare she produced several graded stakes winners.
