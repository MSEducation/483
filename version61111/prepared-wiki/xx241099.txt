[[Don Salvio Pacheco Adobe]]

CATEGORIES: Houses in Contra Costa County, California

The Don Salvio Pacheco Adobe is a historic adobe house in Concord, California. In 1834, Salvio Pacheco was awarded the Rancho Monte del Diablo Mexican land grant, including what is now known as Concord and parts of Pleasant Hill. On June 24, 1835, he completed this two-story adobe, the first building to be erected in Diablo Valley. 
Pacheco gave the land surrounding this adobe to the refugees of the earthquake-flood of 1868, and the community—previously known as Todos Santos—became known as Concord.
