Puthandu ([tpl]lang-ta|புத்தாண்டு[/tpl]), or better known as Tamil New Year, is the celebration of the first day of the Tamil new year in mid-April by Tamils in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry in India, in Sri Lanka and by the Tamil population in Malaysia, Singapore, Réunion and Mauritius. On this day, Tamil people greet each other by saying "Puthandu Vazthukal" ([tpl]lang|ta| புத்தாண்டு வாழ்த்துக்கள் [/tpl]) or "Iniya Tamizh Puthandu Nalvaazhthukkal" ([tpl]lang|ta|இனிய தமிழ் புத்தாண்டு நல்வாழ்த்துக்கள்[/tpl]). The festive occasion is in keeping with the Hindu solar calendar.

==Origin and significance==

The Tamil New Year follows the Nirayanam vernal equinox and generally falls on 14 April of the Gregorian year. 14 April marks the first day of the traditional Tamil calendar and is a public holiday in both Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka. The Tropical vernal equinox falls around 22 March, and adding 23 degrees of trepidation or oscillation to it, we get the Hindu sidereal transition or Nirayana Mesha Sankranti (the Sun's transition into Nirayana Aries). 
Hence, the Tamil calendar begins on the same date observed by most traditional calendars in India as in Assam, West Bengal, Kerala, Manipur, Mithila, Odisha, Punjab, Tripura etc. not to mention Nepal, Bangladesh, Burma, Cambodia, Laos, Sri Lanka and Thailand. The 60-year cycle is ancient and is observed by most traditional calendars of India and China, and is related to 5 revolutions of Jupiter, or to 60-year orbit of Nakshatras (stars) as described in the Surya Siddhanta.
The 60 year cycle comes by 5 revolutions of Jupiter and 2 revolutions of Saturn. The relative position of Jupiter and Saturn in one particular year will be repeated after 60 years. The 60 year cycle was essentially conceived for predicting the climate of a particular year, as the relative position of the two major planets, Jupiter and Saturn, is recognized for its impact on climate. Indian Epigraphy, D.C. Sircar, TamilNet, Tamil New Year, 13.04.2008 
The traditional Tamil year starts on 14 April 2014, Kaliyuga 5116. Vikrama and Shalivahana Saka eras are also used. There are several references in early Tamil literature to the April new year. Nakkirar, the author of the Nedunalvaadai writes in the 3rd century that the Sun travels from Mesha/Chitterai through 11 successive Raasis or signs of the zodiac.Lines 160 to 162 of the Nedunalvaadai Kūdalūr Kizhaar in the 3rd century refers to Mesha Raasi/Chitterai as the commencement of the year in the Puranaanooru.Poem 229 of PuranaanooruProfessor Vaiyapuri Pillai, 'History of Tamil Language and Literature' Chennai, 1956, pages 35, 151 The Tolkaapiyam is the oldest surviving Tamil grammar that divides the year into six seasons where Chitterai marks the start of the Ilavenil season or summer. The 8th century Silappadikaaram mentions the 12 Raasis or zodiac signs starting with Mesha/Chitterai.Canto 26 of Silappadikaaram. Canto 5 also describes the foremost festival in the Chola country – the Indra Vizha celebrated in Chitterai The Manimekalai alludes to the Hindu solar calendar as we know it today. Adiyarkunalaar, an early medieval commentator or Urai-asiriyar mentions the 12 months of the Tamil calendar with particular reference to Chitterai. There were subsequent inscriptional references in Pagan, Burma dated to the 11th century CE and in Sukhothai, Thailand dated to the 14th century CE to South Indian, often Vaishnavite, courtiers who were tasked with defining the traditional calendar that began in mid-April.G.H.

==Celebration==

Tamil people celebrate Tamil new year on 14 April. This is the month of Chitterai, the first month of the Tamil solar calendar. On the eve of Puthandu, a tray arranged with three fruits (mango,banana and jack fruit), betel leaves and arecanut, gold/silver jewellery, coins/money, flowers and a mirror is placed. This is to be viewed upon waking in the morning. In the temple city of Madurai, the Chitterai Thiruvizha is celebrated in the Meenakshi Temple. A huge exhibition is held, called Chitterai Porutkaatchi. In some parts of Southern Tamil Nadu, it is called Chittirai Vishu. The day is marked with a feast in Tamil homes and entrances to the houses are decorated elaborately with kolams. In most parts of India, one can see neem trees blooming with their flowers and the first batch of mangoes hanging prominently. This day is celebrated by some communities with neem flowers and raw mangoes to symbolize growth and prosperity.
On the day of Tamil New Year, a big Car Festival is held at Tiruvidaimarudur near Kumbakonam. Festivals are also held at Tiruchirapalli, Kanchipuram and many other places.
Sri Lankan Tamils observe the traditional new year in April with the first financial transaction known as the 'Kai-vishesham' where elders gift money to the unmarried young, particularly children as a token of good luck. The event is also observed with the 'arpudu' or the first ploughing of the ground to prepare for the new agricultural cycle. The 'punya-kaalam' or auspicious time when the sun reportedly shifts from Meena raasi to Mesha raasi is considered ideal to commence new activities on a favorable note. Sri Lankan Tamils begin the year with a herbal bath with 'maruthu-neer' with ingredients for good health. The game of 'por-thenkai' or coconut wars between youth is played in villages through the Tamil north and east of the island while cart races are also held.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dailynews.lk/2008/04/12/fea04.asp |title=Features | Online edition of Daily News – Lakehouse Newspapers |publisher=Dailynews.lk |date=12 April 2008 |accessdate=18 October 2011[/tpl] The festive Puthandu season in April is a time for family visits and the renewal of filial bonds.Sivanandini Duraiswamy, Remembering Hindu Traditions, M.D. Gunasena and Co Ltd, 1997, pages 41-48. http://www.noolaham.net/project/30/2916/2916.pdf It coincides with the Sinhalese new year season.[tpl]cite web|url=http://tamilweek.com/news-features/archives/887 |title=tamilweek.com/news-features » April 14 is the Tamil New Year, not Sinhalese! |publisher=Tamilweek.com |accessdate=18 October 2011[/tpl]

==Controversy==

The previous Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK)-led Government of Tamil Nadu had declared in 2008 that the Tamil new year should be celebrated on the first day of Tamil month of Thai (14 January) coinciding with the harvest festival of Pongal. The Tamil Nadu New Year (Declaration Bill 2008) was introduced in the House by the Tamil Nadu Government on 29 January 2008.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tn.gov.in/tnassembly/Governors_address_Jan2008_2.htm |title=Bill on new Tamil New Year Day is passed unanimously |publisher=Tn.gov.in |accessdate=18 October 2011[/tpl] This bill of the DMK Administration was subsequently rescinded by a separate act of legislation in the Tamil Nadu Assembly on 23 August 2011.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/jaya-changes-dmks-calendar-tamil-new-year-in-april-now/836039/1 |title=Jaya changes DMK’s calendar, Tamil new year in April now |work=The Indian Express  |location=India |date=24 August 2011 |accessdate=18 October 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=24 August 2011 DC chennai |url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/channels/cities/chennai/jaya-reverses-karunanidhi%E2%80%99s-order-tamil-new-year-chithirai-1-943 |title=Jaya reverses Karunanidhi’s order; Tamil New Year on Chithirai 1 |work=Deccan Chronicle |location=India |date=24 August 2011 |accessdate=18 October 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|author=Special Correspondent |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/states/tamil-nadu/article2388749.ece |title=States / Tamil Nadu : Tamil New Year in Chithirai |work=The Hindu |location=India |date=23 August 2011 |accessdate=18 October 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://newstodaynet.com/newsindex.php?id=24468%20&%20section=6 |title=News Today – An English evening daily published from Chennai |publisher=Newstodaynet.com |date=23 August 2011 |accessdate=18 October 2011[/tpl]

All television channels in Tamil Nadu continued to telecast festive “Chithirai Tirunal Special Programs” on 14 April 2010. The leader of the AIADMK, Jayalalitha felicitated the people on the traditional Tamil New Year.

===Tiruvalluvar Era===

The 2006–2011 Government in Tamil Nadu also introduced the Tiruvalluvar era that begins with the purported birth of the Tamil literary figure Tiruvalluvar in the year 31 BCE. The literary evidence however may not indicate an early date for Tiruvalluvar. The syntax and grammar may indicate a subsequent date. Renowned Tamil Scholar Vaiyapuri Pillai was of the view that Tiruvalluvar lived around 600 CE, based on the internal evidence of his work and the significant influence of Sanskrit, Prakrit and Pali works in the Tirukkural.Vaiyapuri Pillai, History of the Tamil Language and Literature, 1956, pages 79–88 While not all may agree with Vaiyapuri Pillai's textual criticism and dating, several question the Tiruvalluvar era on the issue of its date.[tpl]cite web|url=http://vijayvaani.com/FrmPublicDisplayArticle.aspx?id=510 |title=Vijayvaani.com |publisher=Vijayvaani.com |accessdate=18 October 2011[/tpl] However, the Government of J. Jayalalitha in 2011 reverted the celebration of Puthandu to the original date of fourteenth of April.
