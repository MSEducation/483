War President is a photo mosaic of George W Bush, composed of photos of dead soldiers from the US-led coalition that invaded Iraq, created in 2004 by American artist, writer and software programmer Joe Wezorek.
Wezorek created War President as "a satirical commentary, informed by the whole project of using the dead as political props".http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3652171.stm The mosaic was originally published on his blog American Leftist.http://www.amleft.blogspot.com/archives/2004_04_01_amleft_archive.html
