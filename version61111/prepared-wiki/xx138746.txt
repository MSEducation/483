[[Percutaneous aortic valve replacement]]

CATEGORIES: Cardiac procedures

Percutaneous aortic valve replacement (PAVR), often transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) or transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), is the replacement of the aortic valve of the heart through the blood vessels (as opposed to valve replacement by open heart surgery). The 
replacement valve is delivered via one of several access methods: transfemoral (in the upper leg), transapical (through the wall of the heart), subclavian (beneath the collar bone) and direct aortic (through a minimally invasive surgical incision into the aorta).
The catheter procedure was developed in France, initially performed in 2002 on April 16 by Prof Alain Cribier in Hopital Charles Nicolle, in Rouen.[tpl]cite journal|last=Cribier|first=A|coauthors=Eltchaninoff H, Bash A, Borenstein N, Tron C, Bauer F, Derumeaux G, Anselme F, Laborde F, Leon MB|title=Percutaneous transcatheter implantation of an aortic valve prosthesis for calcific aortic stenosis.

It is effective in improving functioning in the patients with severe aortic stenosis. In the US, it received FDA approval in November 2011 for use in inoperable patients and in October 2012 for use in patients at high surgical risk.http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm278348.htm
In high-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis, transcatheter and surgical procedures for aortic-valve replacement had similar rates of survival at 1 year, although there were important differences in risks associated with the procedure.[tpl]cite journal | title = Transcatheter versus Surgical Aortic-Valve Replacement in High-Risk Patients | journal = N Engl J Med | date = 2 June 2011 | first = Craig R. | last = Smith | coauthors = et al. | volume = 364 | pages = 2187–2198| id = | url = http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1103510 | doi=10.1056/NEJMoa1103510 | pmid=21639811[/tpl][tpl]MEDRS|date=January 2014[/tpl]
In 2010 good results (20% better 1 year survival) were reported from a US trial on 358 patients.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/news/fullstory_103606.html |title=New Procedure for Aortic Valve Replacement Looks Promising |date=22 September 2010 [/tpl][tpl]MEDRS|date=January 2014[/tpl]

==Devices==

There are two current market leaders whose devices have earned CE Mark approval in Europe and are available to physicians for implantation in appropriate patients; the Medtronic CoreValve device (a self-expanding valve prosthesis consisting of a Nickel-titanium frame with a tri-leaflet valve fashioned out of porcine pericardium mounted within) and the SAPIEN device by Edwards Lifesciences (a balloon-expandable tubular metal stent with a tri-leaflet valve fashioned out of bovine pericardium mounted within). The Medtronic CoreValve received FDA approval on January 17, 2014.FDA Approves Medtronic's CoreValve Heart Device
