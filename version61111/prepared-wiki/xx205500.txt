The 1975 Haicheng earthquake measuring 7.3 on the Richter Scale occurred at 19:36 CST on February 4, 1975 in Haicheng, Liaoning, China, a city that at the time had approximately 1 million residents.
Local political leaders ordered evacuations a day before the earthquake took place. This successful evacuation saved many lives. However people still suffered greatly.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Wang |first1=K.|year=2006|title=Predicting the 1975 Haicheng Earthquake|url=http://www.sciencenet.cn/upload/blog/file/2008/6/200861418434216280.pdf|journal=Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America|publisher=Seismological Society of America|volume=96 |issue=3 |pages=757–795|bibcode=2006BuSSA..96..757W|doi=10.1785/0120050191|accessdate=6 November 2011 [/tpl] This was the only successful evacuation before a devastating earthquake in history. In the years, months and weeks leading up to the event various phenomena were reported which could be interpreted as precursors to an earthquake, including strange animal behavior.[tpl]cite conference|last1=Wu |first1=K.-T.|author2=et al.|year=1991|title=Case 2: Foreshocks to the Haicheng earthquake of 1975.
