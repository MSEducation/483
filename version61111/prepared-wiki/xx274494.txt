==Reception==

The Allmusic review by Jim Brenholts awarded the album 4 stars stating "Ocean is a set of acoustic ambient performances from Stephan Micus. He uses exotic instruments and techniques that give this disc electronic timbre... The natural sonorities of these devices create vast atmospheres with organic timbres. The soundscapes penetrate and enhance brainwave activity. This great CD will appeal to fans of Robert Rich, Klaus Wiese, and Riley Lee".Brenholts, J. Allmusic Review accessed September 26, 2011
