==Biography==

Although White's family were extremely poor, her parents had a great love of literature.  She was educated at small, badly resourced county schools, but praises her "excellent, caring teachers".[tpl]cite web |last=Stimmen|first=Jane|title=An interview with Ruth White, author of Little Audrey|url=http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2009/03/whit-m06.html|work=World Socialist Web Site |publisher=ICFI |date=March 6, 2009 |accessdate=2013-04-16[/tpl]
When she was six years old, her father, who was a coal miner, was killed in a brawl (and the attacker sent to prison for 20 years). Her mother moved to a place near the town of Whitewood, Virginia.  When White was in the eighth grade the family moved to Michigan, but she returned to Grundy to finish high-school while living with an aunt and uncle.  These incidents form part of the story in her book Sweet Creek Holler.
White's book Belle Prater's Boy was named a 1997 Newbery Honor book.  White and her sisters grew up in the coal-mining town of Whitewood, Virginia.  They played in the hills and creeks, enjoyed family read-alouds, and sang every song they heard.  White has been a teacher and a school librarian in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia.  For a while, she lived in Virginia Beach, but now she lives in Pennsylvania.
