==History==

The road linking Woodbury and Waterbury was originally laid out as a toll road in May 1823 and was known as the Woodbury and Waterbury Turnpike.It is sometimes erroneously referred to in some state documents as the "Woodbridge and Waterbury Turnpike". The Woodbury-Waterbury road was incorporated as part of New England Route 3 in 1922, which ran eastâ€“west across Connecticut and directly connected the cities of Danbury, Waterbury, Hartford, and Willimantic. In 1926, the U.S. Highway system was established and US 6 was co-signed along most of New England Route 3. For a few years between 1926 and 1929, the Woodbury to Waterbury route was signed as US 6. By 1930, US 6 was relocated to a more northerly alignment via Watertown, Thomaston, and Bristol. This left the Woodbury-Waterbury route signed only as Route 3. In the 1932 state highway renumbering, the New England Route 3 designation was deleted. Route 14 was created at the same time and incorporated the Woodbury-Waterbury route and continued eastward via Meriden, Middletown, and Willimantic to the Rhode Island state line in Sterling. In 1941, most of Route 14 (west of Willimantic) was re-designated as US 6A. In 1967, the US 6A designation was removed in Connecticut and broken into several smaller routes. Modern Route 64 is one of these routes that was created as a result of the renumbering of US 6A.Connecticut Routes, Route 64Connecticut Routes, US 6A
