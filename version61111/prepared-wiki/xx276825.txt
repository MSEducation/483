Riley Fox (March 31, 2001 – June 6, 2004) was an American three-year-old girl who was reported missing in Wilmington, Illinois.  Later that same day the girl was found dead in Forsythe Woods County Forest Preserve, a public park that was just a few miles from the family’s residence.  The girl was found face down in a creek in the park.  She had been bound, gagged, and sexually assaulted and then drowned.[tpl]cite news|title=Riley Fox Murder: Killer Left Signed Shoe At The Scene, Police Missed It For Six Years|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/06/16/riley-fox-murder-killer-l_n_614239.html|accessdate=24 September 2011|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=06/16/10[/tpl]

==Disappearance==

The night of the disappearance, Kevin, Riley's father, had picked up his kids from their grandmother's house around 1 A.M..  Too tired to carry his children up to bed, he laid Riley down on the couch and Tyler, Riley's older brother, down on the living room chair.  He then went to his room, watched TV and went to bed around 2:30, according to his statements to police.[tpl]cite web|last=Smith|first=Bryan|title=The Nightmare: A Look at the Riley Fox Case|url=http://www.chicagomag.com/core/pagetools.php?url=%2FChicago-Magazine%2FJuly-2006%2FThe-Nightmare%2F&mode=print|accessdate=25 September 2011[/tpl]  The next morning, Kevin Fox was awoken by Tyler.  Tyler informed him that Riley was gone, Kevin searched the entire house for Riley.  He noticed that the front door and screen were open.  Kevin went next door to a friend of Riley’s to see if they had seen the little girl.  When the neighbors had not seen Riley, he then called the police.

==The Case==

===Kevin Fox===

Kevin Fox, the girl's father, was initially charged in the young girl's murder, based almost solely on a videotaped confession that he had killed Riley. He spent eight months in prison before he was cleared of all charges due to DNA evidence and the confession was ruled out based on coercion.[tpl]cite news|last=Brooks|first=Marion|title=Cops "Dropped the Ball" in Riley Fox Case, Sheriff Says|url=http://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/riley-fox-investigation-paul-kaupas--96110909.html|accessdate=25 September 2011|date=Jun 10, 2010[/tpl]  The killer left a pair of mud-covered shoes at Forsythe Woods County Forest Preserve, which were collected by police.  But the police never followed up on this piece of evidence.  The shoes had the name Eby written on the inside, the last name of the actual culprit. They overlooked many other important case facts as well.  The same night as Riley's abduction another house on the same block was burglarized.  The Fox family later sued the state of Illinois and won $15 million in a federal civil rights lawsuit, which was later reduced to $8.5 million.[tpl]cite news|last=Sancho|first=Miguel|title=Exclusive: Riley Fo x's Parents Speak Out After Alleged Killer Found|url=http://abcnews.go.com/2020/riley-fox-parents-speak-scott-eby-charged-murder/story?id=10878773|accessdate=24 September 2011|date=June 11, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Horan|first=Deborah|title=DNA clears dad in girl's slaying|url=http://truthinjustice.org/kevin-fox.htm|work=Truth In Justice|publisher=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=12 October 2013|date=8 June 2005[/tpl]

===Scott Eby===

Scott Eby was later charged on five counts of first-degree murder and one count of predatory sexual assault after DNA evidence linked him to Riley. By the time the police caught up with Eby to charge him in connection with Riley's murder, he was serving two consecutive seven-year sentences.  Eby later confessed to killing Riley after first breaking into another home on the same block as the Foxes'.  Eby said he cut through the back screen door of the home and then pushed the door in.  He found Riley lying on the couch and decided to kidnap her when he saw that her father was asleep.  He said that he put Riley into his car and drove her to the park where he assaulted her on the floor of a restroom in the park.  Then he killed her by drowning her in a nearby creek within the park.  He subsequently pled guilty to Riley's murder and received a life sentence without the possibility of parole. Scott Eby was on parole and lived only about a mile from the Foxes' home at the time of Riley's murder.
