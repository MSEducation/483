</ref> This rule is not valid close to inner shell electron binding energies where there are abrupt changes in interaction probability, so called [[absorption edges]]. However, the general trend of high [[absorption coefficient]]s and thus short [[penetration depth]]s for low photon energies and high atomic numbers is very strong. For soft tissue photoabsorption dominates up to about 26 keV photon energy where Compton scattering takes over. For higher atomic number substances this limit is higher. The high amount of calcium (''Z''=20) in bones together with their high density is what makes them show up so clearly on medical radiographs.
A photoabsorbed photon transfers all its energy to the electron with which it interacts, thus ionizing the atom to which the electron was bound and producing a photoelectron that is likely to ionize more atoms in its path. An outer electron will fill the vacant electron position and the produce either a characteristic photon or an Auger electron. These effects can be used for elemental detection through X-ray spectroscopy or Auger electron spectroscopy.

===Compton scattering===

Compton scattering is the predominant interaction between X-rays and soft tissue in medical imaging.[ref]
