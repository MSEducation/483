Lake Nasser ([tpl]lang-ar|بحيرة ناصر[/tpl] [tpl]transl|arz|Boħēret Nāṣer[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-arz|boˈħeːɾet ˈnɑːsˤeɾ|lang[/tpl]) is a vast reservoir in southern Egypt, and northern Sudan, and is one of the largest man-made lakes in the world. Strictly, "Lake Nasser" refers only to the much larger portion of the lake that is in Egyptian territory (83% of the total), with the Sudanese preferring to call their smaller body of water Lake Nubia ([tpl]lang-arz|بحيرة نوبية[/tpl] [tpl]transl|arz|Boħēret Nubeyya[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-arz|boˈħeːɾet nʊˈbejjæ|[/tpl]). The area of Sudan-administered Wadi Halfa Salient was largely flooded by Lake Nasser.

==Description==

The lake is some [tpl]convert|550|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] long and [tpl]convert|35|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] across at its widest point, which is near the Tropic of Cancer.
It covers a total surface area of [tpl]convert|5250|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl] and has a storage capacity of some [tpl]convert|132|km3|cumi|abbr=on[/tpl] of water.
The lake was created as a result of the construction of the Aswan High Dam across the waters of the Nile between 1958 and 1971.  The lake is named after Gamal Abdel Nasser, one of the leaders of the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, and the second President of Egypt, who initiated the High Dam project.
Sportfishing among tourists, especially for Nile Perch, has become increasingly popular, both on the shore and from boats, as the west bank of the Lake contains more nutrients compared to the east bank. About 100 species of bird have been recorded in the lake.
