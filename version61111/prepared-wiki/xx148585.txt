[[Khabikki Lake]]

CATEGORIES: Lakes of Punjab, Pakistan

Khabikki Lake is a salt water lake in the southern Salt Range area in Khushab District, Punjab,  Pakistan. This lake is formed due to the absence of drainage in the range. 
The lake is one kilometer wide and two kilometres long. Khabikki is also the name of a neighboring village. Boats are also available and there is a rest house beside the lake. A hill gently ascended on the right side of the lake. The lake and the green area around provide a good scenery. This is a beautiful lake in the mountains and really paints a picture like northern area lakes of Pakistan in summers. Natural beauty is further augmented by rain fall in area. The local people term it a real life line as there is no canal system in the hilly area.
