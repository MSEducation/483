[[Road Home]]

CATEGORIES: Humanitarian aid

Road Home is a program funded by the U.S. government which has provided historical federal monies for helping Louisiana residents rebuild or sell houses severely damaged by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The Road Home is a federally funded grant program administered by the State of Louisiana. To date, according to their web site,https://road2la.org/Docs/HAP/Situation%20and%20Pipeline%20Reports/Week323%2009-11-2012.pdf as of September 2012, the program had disbursed a total of $9.0 billion in awards to 129,910 individual homeowners in the area cash grants averaging $68,983 each. These are cash grants, not low interest loans, and are received income tax free. They are on top of insurance awards, private or federal, which may have already been received. 
Additionally, the program has been extended to provide cash grants to facilitate the elevation of homes in flood prone areas. According to the Road Home site http://www.road2la.org/news_releases/elevation_payout_123108.htm: "So far, The Road Home has paid $543,608,113 in elevation funds to 18,914 homeowners through the program. Additionally, more than 4,400 applicants have been moved to closing."  
Like the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Road Home has been the target of criticism.See, e.g., the English Wikipedia article on the Times-Picayune''.
