[[Doolboong language]]

CATEGORIES: Jarrakan languages, Extinct languages of Australia

Doolboong (also Tulpung or Duulngari) is an extinct Australian Aboriginal language formerly spoken by the Doolboong people on the coast of the Cambridge Gulf in the Northern Territory.
There are no longer any speakers of Doolboong, and no written records of it exist. However, speakers of the nearby Gajirrabeng and Miriwoong languages say it was similar to Gajirrabeng.
