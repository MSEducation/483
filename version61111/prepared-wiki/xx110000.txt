[[Amanitaceae]]

CATEGORIES: Agaricales, Fungi families

The Amanitaceae are a family of fungi or mushrooms.  The family, also commonly called the amanita family, is in order Agaricales, gilled mushrooms.  The family consists primarily of the genus Amanita, but also includes the genera Catatrama and Limacella. 
Mycological works show great divergence in their definitions of families and the up-to-date and authoritative Index fungorum classifies these fungi as part of Pluteaceae. For a long time, they were placed in Agaricaceae.
The species are usually found in woodlands.  They emerge from an egg-like structure formed by the universal veil. 
This family contains several species valued for edibility and flavor, and other deadly poisonous ones.  More than half the cases of mushroom poisoning stem from members of this family.  The most toxic members of this group have names that warn of the poisonous nature, but others, of varying degrees of toxicity, do not.
