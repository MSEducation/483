Muddle (first name and dates unknown) was an English cricketer who played in major cricket matches for Kent in 1768.

==Career==

Muddle played in one major 11-a-side match in 1768 for Kent against the Caterham Cricket Club side which represented Surrey. The match took place on 10 June and Caterham won by 14 runs, Muddle making scores of 15 and 12 for Kent.Buckley, p.48.  Muddle was also named in a single wicket "fives" match played on 28 May at the Artillery Ground.  He played for Sir Horatio Mann's team, scoring 4 and 1 against one raised by the Duke of Dorset, the latter winning by 3 wickets.Buckley, p.47.
Muddle is only recorded on those two occasions and it is not known if he played regularly in earlier and later seasons. Players were rarely mentioned by name in contemporary reports and there are no other known references to Muddle.
