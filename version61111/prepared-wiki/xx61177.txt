The original campus was located in Goleta, California and in 1974, moved to the current 272 acre campus in Fairfield, Iowa. During the 1990s many older buildings were demolished and replaced using green technology and the principles of ancient Vedic architecture. The university features an academic "block system" (only one subject for four weeks) and a diverse, multi-national student body. It is said to offer a "whole-system approach" that aims to move beyond the library and classroom settings and engage students in a personal journey of evolution and growth through meditation and an organic, vegetarian food program.Dorfman, Josh (2007) Harry N. Abrams Inc., The Lazy Environmentalist: Your Guide to Easy, Stylish, Green Living, Chapter 21

==History==

The concept for a university came out of a "series of International symposia on Science of Creative Intelligence" (SCI) attended by notable academics.Jefferson, William (1976) Pocket Books, The Story of The Maharishi, pp118-123 It was established in 1971 by Nat Goldhaber.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/24/business/business-technology-apple-ibm-venture-chief-is-named.html |title=NY Times, September 30, 1992, "Business Technology" Laurence Fisher |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1992-06-24 |accessdate=2012-06-29[/tpl] It was created with the belief that a school that incorporated the "philosophy and techniques of Transcendental Meditation" would create an "unusual contribution to higher education". Its founding principles were to develop the full potential of the individual, realize the highest ideal of education, improve governmental achievements, solve the age-old problem of crime and all behavior that brings unhappiness to our world family, bring fulfillment to the economic aspirations of individuals and society, maximize the intelligent use of the environment, and, achieve the spiritual goals of humanity in this generation.Maharishi International Bulletin (1979-1981)
It was inaugurated by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, and Robert Keith Wallace assumed his position as the first university president in 1973.  Its first location was an apartment complex in Goleta, California. The university enrolled 700 students during its first year of operation. In August 1974, the university purchased the campus of the bankrupt Parsons College in Fairfield, Iowa for $2.5 million and relocated there.Engel, Allison, "Maharishi International University mixes meditation and education", Change Vol 7 No 4 (May 1975) p. 19Nelson, Bryce (July 9, 1973)  "The Death of a College -- Grand Idea That Failed",  The Los Angeles Times, The college trustees asked for protection of the federal court under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Act. In his order, the federal bankruptcy judge, Richard Stageman, admitted "the affection and esteem" in which Iowans held the college but said that it was irretrievably insolvent"
In 1975, the freshman and sophomore years consisted of interdisciplinary studies, and were organized in a modular format, with each course lasting a few weeks or months. All students, regardless of their previous education, were required to attend 24 interdisciplinary courses, some of which consisted of pre-recorded video tapes of "resident faculty" who were not on campus while graduate students and teaching assistants played the video tapes and conducted discussions. Nobel Prize winner Melvin Calvin said that, even though he participated in a symposium on SCI, the use of his name in the MIU catalogue was "perilously close to false advertising". John Lewis, a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) who created video taped lectures for MIU, was more supportive, saying that TM "unblocks the student's pathways to education". During this period, an open admissions policy was instituted, and transfer students were welcomed regardless of their academic history.  In 1975 the University held its first commencement exercise awarding 13 Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies degrees and 38 Masters degrees.1975 Yearbook - Graduation, MUM, 1975.
In 1976, the accreditation evaluation team from the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools said the 19 senior and 20 assistant faculty were "creative in their vision for higher education and eminently qualified", and the university was granted "candidate for accreditation" status. At that time, faculty and administrators were paid "approximately the same base salary of $275 per month", with additional compensation "on a sliding scale for those with spouses and children", plus free housing in university dormitories.Maeroff, Gene I., "College in Iowa flourishes on meditation", New York Times (May 18, 1976) p 16 Reprinted http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=g3U0AAAAIBAJ&sjid=DhMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4095,3494892&dq=maharishi+salaries+faculty&hl=en On campus, drugs and alcohol were "shunned" and a "strong sense of community" was said to pervade the institution.
Bevan Morris was appointed president and chairman of Maharishi International University's board of trustees in 1979. The following year, the university received accreditation through the doctoral level by the Higher Learning Commission, and became a member of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools (NCACS), "the oldest and largest accrediting body in the U.S.".Kapur, Kamlesh (2010) Sterling Publishers, History Of Ancient India (Portraits Of A Nation), pp 462-463Gidley, Jennifer (2000) Greenwood Publishing Group, The University in Transformation: Global Perspectives on the Futures of the University, pp 215-217 1981 saw the completion of two, 20,000 square foot, meditation buildings called Golden Domes, that were built on campus for daily group practice of the Transcendental Meditation and TM-Sidhi programs.Magician Mixes Marriage and Meditation; The Hour (Associated Press) Norwalk, CT, December 2, 1981 By this time the Henn Mansion, Trustee Gymnasium and Ballard Hall buildings, built in the early 1900s, showed rapid deterioration. These buildings were scheduled to be demolished but instead the university spent $500,000 to rebuild Henn Mansion and nominated the six other buildings for the National Historic Register.Goff, Rory and Rena (November 2012) Remembering Barhydt Chapel, Iowa Source, page F-1
In July 1983, The Argus-Press reported that competing meditation seminar teacher, Robin Woodsworth Carlsen, had criticized and ridiculed the university in a full page ad placed in a local newspaper and had filed a law suit against the university. As a result, "many students" who were distributing Carlsen's literature on campus were asked to leave the campus and several were suspended and their meditation dome, admission privileges were revoked.Munns, Roger, "Upstart stirring up the karma", Owosso Argus-Press (Associated Press) (July 21, 1983) In December 1983, the university hosted a three-week "Taste of Utopia" conference with more than 7,000 participants and practitioners of the TM-Sidhi program "from around the world". MIU president Morris, later reported that research data indicated the conference had reduced violence in war torn areas and inspired an increase in the Dow Jones stock index via the Maharishi Effect.[tpl]cite news|title=Power of TM [tpl]![/tpl] Followers take credit for upsurge in U.S.|first=Noel|last=Osment|work=The San Diego Union|date=June 9, 1984|page=A-21[/tpl](November 2010)James McCartney to make American debut in Fairfield The Gazette, retrieved April 5, 2012 By 1992, the university had 800 students from more than 70 countries, paying approximately $10,000 a year for their tuition and board.
In 1995, Maharishi International University changed its name to Maharishi University of Management (MUM) to emphasize that gaining deep experience and deep knowledge had a profound practical value in enabling a student to "fully manage" their life. As part of its master plan to rebuild and expand the campus using natural materials and Maharishi Sthapatya Veda design principles, many of the Parsons College buildings which had high maintenance costs, were demolished, including Foster Hall and Henn Mansion.

===Consciousness-Based Education===

MUM is committed to achieving the university's goals through Consciousness-Based Education (CBE) which aims to unfold "creative potential" and create life in harmony with the laws of nature. CBE includes traditional subjects while simultaneously cultivating the student's potential from within. As a component of Consciousness-Based education, students and faculty practice the Transcendental Meditation technique twice daily. Both Consciousness-Based education and Science of Creative Intelligence (SCI) are said to include the personal experience and intellectual understanding of consciousness. Classes at MUM present subjects such as art, economics, physics, literature, and psychology in the context of these universal principles of consciousness.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5rcVFLiTn|title=Consciousness-Based Education at Maharishi University of Management |publisher=Mum.edu |accessdate=2009-11-16[/tpl][tpl]Cite book| last = Stark | first = Rodney | authorlink = Rodney Stark | coauthors = William Sims Bainbridge |title = The Future of Religion: Secularization, Revival, and Cult Formation | year = 1986 | publisher = University of California Press |location = Berkeley | isbn = 0-520-05731-7 | page = 289[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|title=Maharishi U|first=James|last=Atlas|authorlink=James Atlas|work=The New Republic|date=April 22, 1985[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5rcVg4JRr |title=Degree Academic Programs at Maharishi University of Management |publisher=Mum.edu |accessdate=2009-11-16[/tpl] Before 2009 MUM freshmen and transfer students began their first semester with the 33 lesson SCI course.Schmidt-Wilk, Jane, Heston, Dennis & Steigard, David, "Higher education for higher consciousness: Maharishi University of Management as a model for spirituality in management education", Journal of Management Education Vol. 24, No. 5, 580-611 (2000) [tpl]doi|10.1177/105256290002400505[/tpl][tpl]Cite book| edition = 24th ed.| publisher = Barron's ;;Hi Marketing| isbn = 978-0-7641-7294-6| last = Barron's Educational Series, Inc.| title = Profiles of American colleges| location = Hauppauge N.Y.  ;London| year = 2000[/tpl] but it has since been replaced by a course called Science and Technology of Consciousness.[tpl]cite web|title=Catalog 2009-2010 of Maharishi University of Management: DEPARTMENT OF MAHARISHI VEDIC SCIENCE|url=http://www.mum.edu/pdf_catalog/mvs.pdf|accessdate=Jun 16, 2010[/tpl] The university president, Morris, has credited the knowledge and principles of SCI with contributing to the success of its graduates and[tpl]Cite news|page=18|work=The HAWK EYE |date=May 23, 1982|title=Maharishi bucks 'Guru U' image|first=Alice|last=Noble[/tpl] SCI degrees have been awarded to Morris,[tpl]Cite news|title=Election 1992: Somewhere over the rainbow|first=Robert|last=Shrimsley|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London (UK)|date=April 4, 1992|page=5[/tpl] Doug Henning,[tpl]Cite news|title=Will squadron of yogic flyers be our best line of defence?|first=Jamie|last=Lamb|work=The Vancouver Sun|date=October 1, 1993|page=A.3[/tpl] Mike Tompkins,[tpl]Cite news|title=Natural Law Party joins race|first=Edward T|last=McHugh|work=Telegram & Gazette|location=Worcester, Mass.|date=August 29, 1992|page=A.3[/tpl] Benjamin Feldman the Finance Minister for Global Country of World Peace,[tpl]Cite news| work=Institutional Investor International Edition|date = March 2003|volume=28|issue=3|pages=8–11|title=The maharishi and transcendental disintermediation[/tpl] best-selling author John Gray,[tpl]Cite news|title=Mars and Venus at work; Critics aim to bring Gray back down to Earth|first=Lauren|last=Murphy|work=Washington Times|date=February 14, 2002|page=A.02[/tpl] and "Invincible Defense Technology" expert David R.

===Views on research===

Lola Williamson, who practiced the TM-Sidhi program until 1981,http://books.google.com/books?id=OxD1SYaelLAC&dq=enrollment+%22TM+movement%22&q=tm+movement#v=onepage&q=sidhi&f=false wrote a book called Transcendent in America: Hindu-Inspired Meditation Movements as New Religion. In the book, she cites two former professors who in the late 1980's "testified against the research practices conducted at the university". In the book, she writes that former MUM professor of economics and business law Anthony DeNaro alleged in 1986 that there was "a very serious and deliberate pattern of fraud...designed to misrepresent the TM movement as a science (not a cult), and fraudulently claim and obtain tax exempt status with the IRS". Williamson writes in her book that Dennis Roark, former Dean of Faculty and chair of the physics department in the 1970s, was a "witness to routine suppression of negative data" and that Roark wrote in a 1987 letter that it was his "belief that the many scientific claims both to the factual evidence of unique, beneficial effects of T.M. and physics are not only without any reasonable basis, but in fact in many ways fraudulent". Roark said "he had questioned" MIU faculty member Michael Dillbeck regarding his studies of brain wave coherence using EEG measurements during practice of the TM-Sidhi program, and that Dilbeck confirmed that it was impossible to make EEG measurements while the subjects are moving. Williamson writes in her book that Roark questioned other investigators "regarding the alleged reduction in crime if enough people practice TM or the TM-Sidhi program" and they "confirmed that they had suppressed negative evidence".[tpl]Cite book| publisher = NYU Press| isbn = 978-0-8147-9450-0| last = Williamson| first = Lola| title = Transcendent in America| date = 2010-01-01|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=OxD1SYaelLAC|pages=100–103[/tpl] The EEG research referred to by Roark, which required researchers to make EEG measurements during the TM-Sidhi program, was subsequently published in two separate studies in the International Journal of Neuroscience.[ref]

==Reception==

MUM has received both criticism and acclaim. Author Samuel Schuman reports that while many in the higher education community did not take the university seriously when it began in 1974, the college has "persisted cheerfully" for more than three decades and its achievements and results are "incontestably impressive". Some members of the local community were initially against the university with 540 residents signing a petition protesting the local school board for allowing four MIU students to visit the public schools as observers. However, author William Jefferson reports that by 1976, 200 local people had "taken up Transcendental Meditation themselves" and compared to the "wild and woolly" students of the prior college, "nearly all the residents now agree that they students are nice people to have around".
A 1976 article in the New York Times described the campus as a "cheerful, optimistic place where people smile a lot and tend to be considerate and trusting". In 1992 the New York Times reported that the university was a place where all students and faculty meditate, and all the Maharishi's teachings are woven into mathematics, physics and every other subject, similar to colleges with strong religious affiliations, while noting it is "an accredited university with grant-winning faculty members and competitive students who mix transcendental meditation" and through "serious academics studies" hope to create "their own new world".   The article goes on to say that even as the university gains research grants and subsequent credibility, it also faces controversy. For example, one critic, 1979 alumnus Curtis Mailloux, called the campus a "coercive environment" with a "propensity for fraudulent research".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/29/news/university-s-degree-comes-with-a-heavy-dose-of-meditation-and-skepticism.html?pagewanted=all|last=DePalma|first=Anthony|title=University's degree comes with a heavy dose of meditation (and skepticism)|work=New York Times|date=April 29, 1992[/tpl] Accreditation officials say they are aware of these accusations and "have been aggressive in checking Marahishi [tpl]sic[/tpl] International's academic freedom". The deputy director of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools (NCACS), Steven D. Crow, says "Every move the university's made has been monitored" and MIU's library, faculty, academic mission and classroom space have been deemed appropriate. At the same time John W. Patterson, a professor at Iowa State University has harshly criticized The North Central Association's evaluation, saying it "does nothing more than to lend credibility to these crackpots". The article also reports that many non-students have moved to the city of Fairfield "so they can meditate in the meditation domes".
In 1986, seven "former devotees" filed a fraud suit against the Maharishi saying they paid thousands of dollars for lessons at Maharishi International University that were designed to reduce stress, improve memory, reverse aging, and develop clairvoyance and levitation. One plaintiff said that after ten years he had not acquired any of the special abilities that were promised.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.icsahome.com/logon/elibdocview_new.asp?Subject=TM+Lawsuit+to+Open+%26+TM+School+Gets+Most+Federal+Grants |title=TM Lawsuit to Open |work=London Sunday Times |date=November 30, 1986[/tpl] "A fraud suit brought against Transcendental Meditation founder Maharishi Mahesh Yogi by seven former devotees was set to go to trial Dec. 10.The plaintiffs claim they paid thousands of dollars to Maharishi International University in Fairfield, Iowa, for lessons the school said would improve memory, reduce stress, promote perfect health, increase academic ability, expand awareness, reverse the aging process, and facilitate world peace."...
