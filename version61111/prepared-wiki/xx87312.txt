==Underground club scene==

Alig moved to New York to attend college at Fordham University from which he later dropped out. He began working at Danceteria in 1983 as a bus boy.  A natural at throwing parties with little or no resources he soon began to rise in New York's party scene.  Alig was mentored by socialite James St. James and club owner Peter Gatien while rising in popularity and prominence in the national underground club scene. Alig was also influential in the early promotion of his then boyfriend DJ Keoki[tpl]cite web |date=March 26, 2002|url = http://www.villagevoice.com/nyclife/0213,musto,33375,15.html|title = NYC Life|publisher = villagevoice| accessdate = 2008-03-22 | last=Michael Musto |quote=Alig and his then boyfriend, Keoki,[/tpl] who studied under DJ Brian Telfair, top DJ at the time in Alig's and Gatien's clubs, most notably the New York club The Limelight, owned by Gatien and designed by Ari Bahat.[tpl]cite news |date=August 25, 1989|url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE0DD1038F936A1575BC0A96F948260|title =  Ari Bahat, Architect, 48|publisher = New York Times| accessdate = 2008-03-22 | last= |quote=[/tpl]  In Sept 1995 the Limelight was closed by the police on suspicion of drug trafficking,Fenton Bailey, Randy Barbato; (1998) Format:Documentary Party Monster: The Shockumentary [tpl]IMDb title|id=0141716|title=Party Monster (1998)[/tpl] but subsequently reopened several times during the 1990s.[tpl]cite news |date=November 22, 1998|url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980DE7DF1330F931A15752C1A96E958260|title = A Fallen Club King Tries a Comeback|publisher = New York Times| accessdate = 2008-05-22 | last=ANDREW JACOBS |quote=The born-again Limelight, he predicts, will usher in a new era of clubbing ...Although the club has operated sporadically since last summer, it is still a work in progress.

===Alig's Club Kids===

Alig's other protégés included Gitsie, Jennytalia, Robert "Freez" Riggs, Richie Rich, Charlie "Dash" Prestano, Amanda Lepore, RuPaul, and many other Club Kid personalities [tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2011[/tpl]. The Club Kids' outrageousness resulted in their appearing on the news and the television talk show circuit—they appeared on the Geraldo Rivera show five times.

==Murder of Angel Melendez==

Andre "Angel" Melendez worked at the Limelight, and after the bar's closure by federal agents, Melendez was fired.  With no job he moved into Alig's apartment.  Increasingly affected by substance abuse, Alig and his friend Robert "Freeze" Riggs murdered Melendez after an argument over many things including a long-standing drug debt.[tpl]cite web |year=2007 |url = http://www.thesmokinggun.com/longhand/riggs1.html|title = Robert "Freeze" Riggs written confession|publisher = The Smoking Gun| accessdate = 2008-03-22 | last= |quote=[/tpl] Alig has claimed many times that he was so high on drugs that the events are quite cloudy. On December 9, 1996, Riggs confessed to police that on March 17, 1996:
Then according to Riggs he hit Melendez a total of three times on the head. Then Alig grabbed a pillow and tried to smother him.  When Melendez was unconscious Riggs went to the other room and when he came back he noticed a broken syringe on the floor. However, Alig's story was that he injected Melendez with Drano, while Riggs claims that Alig poured it down Melendez's throat and duct-taped his mouth closed. Since Alig and Riggs did not know what to do with the body they put it in the bath tub that they filled with ice. They kept the body from rotting, but after a few days the corpse began to smell. After discussing what to do next (and who should do it), Alig injected himself with heroin. He then cut the legs off the corpse, put them in a garbage bag and stuffed the rest in a box. Afterwards he threw the corpse into the Hudson River.

==Investigation of the disappearance==

While Alig was in rehab, rumors of Alig's involvement in Melendez's death were reported in the Village Voice by Michael Musto. Although no names were used, Musto's reports included the details of the murder. Musto had previously reported on Alig's firing from the Limelight and noted the buzz about a missing club person. On April 27, 1996, the New York Post's "Page Six" column ran a lead item about the murder mystery, citing Musto's reporting as well as a New York magazine piece quoting an evasive Alig. Over the coming weeks, the Village Voice continued to report and make accusations about Melendez's murder; however the police department was not that concerned about the disappearance of a Colombian drug dealer.[tpl]cite web |date=August 16, 1999|url = http://www.metroactive.com/papers/sfmetro/08.16.99/discobloodbath-9931.html|title = Clubland Horrorcoaster|publisher = metroactive| accessdate = 2008-03-22 | last=Michelle Goldberg |quote=One of the most poignant scenes in this story occurs when Angel's brother appears on the scene and is baffled by the callousness and indifference both of the police and of the people Angel considered friends.[/tpl]
Through September, the police had still not questioned Alig about the murder; they were focused on his business partner Peter Gatien, wanting Alig to testify against him.[tpl]Cite episode |title= Dancing, Drugs, and Murder|episodelink= |url= http://www.tvguide.com/detail/tv-show.aspx?tvobjectid=194507&more=ucepisodelist&episodeid=2405366|accessdate= November 11, 2010|series= American Justice|serieslink= http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/american-justice/194507|credits= Bill Kurtis, Host|network= A&E Network|city= New York City|airdate= 2000|seriesno= 126[/tpl] Since several months had passed many people believed Alig would get away with it, until a dismembered torso was pulled from the waters off Staten Island.[tpl]cite news |date= September 11, 1997|url = http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/1997/09/11/1997-09-11_nightclub_pals_own_up_to__96.html|title = Nightclub Pals Own Up to '96 Killing|publisher = New York Daily News| accessdate = 2008-03-23 | last= Ross |first = Barbara |quote=They left the body in a bathtub for a week, then cut the legs off and dumped the pieces into the Hudson River.

In the fall of 1996, to escape the scrutiny of the media, Alig fled New York.  He and some of his close friends took a road trip to Denver, Colorado, stopping in Chicago and his hometown, South Bend.  While in South Bend, he saw his mother for the first time in three years.  Once in Denver he missed New York too much and moved back into the city, trying to make a comeback at another midtown night club by hosting a new party night, called Honey Trap.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/celebrity/michael_alig/13.html|title= Michael Alig: The Life and Death of the Party|author= Tricia Romano|publisher= TruTV Crime Library: Notorious Murders: Celebrity Crimes|accessdate=12 November 2010[/tpl]
In November 1996, the coroner reported the body had been identified as Melendez. Every rumor was confirmed by the appearance of Melendez's body and the police could not ignore it.  Alig fled New York, staying in a hotel in New Jersey with boyfriend Brian McCauly before the police surrounded the location. In December 1997, Alig and his accomplice Robert Riggs pleaded guilty to manslaughter and were sentenced to 10 to 20 years in prison for Melendez's death.
While in prison, Alig told Musto, "I know why I blabbed. I must have wanted to stop me. I was spinning out of control.
