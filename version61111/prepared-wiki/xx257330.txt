Alberto Franceschini (born  26 October 1947) is an Italian former terrorist,  a founder and leading member of the Italian left-wing militant organization, the Red Brigades (Brigate Rosse), along with Renato Curcio, Margherita Cagol and Mario Moretti.

==Biography==

Franceschini was born in Reggio Emilia into a communist family. His father had been arrested for anti-fascist activities in the 1930s, and his grandfather was one of the founders of the Italian Communist Party. At a young age he became a member of the Italian Communist Youth Federation.
The Red Brigades were formed in the second half of 1970 as a result of the merger of Renato Curcio's Proletarian Left and a radical student and worker group. They went completely underground and organized the Red Brigades and spent the next three years, from 1972 to 1975, engaging in a series of bombings and kidnappings of prominent figures. Franceschini was captured and imprisoned in 1974. He was released in 1992.Interview with Renato CurcioSee Giovanni Fasanella and Alberto Franceschini (with an afterword by judge Rosario Priore, who investigated Aldo Moro's death), Che cosa sono le BR ("Brigades Rouges.
