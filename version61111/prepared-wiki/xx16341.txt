Georg Hackl (born 9 September 1966) is a German former luger who was three time Olympic and World Champion. He is known affectionately as Hackl-Schorsch or as the Speeding Weißwurst a reference to what he looks like in his white bodysuit coming down the luge at fast speeds.
Hackl was born in Berchtesgaden, Bavaria. 
He won his first Winter Olympic Games luge medal in 1988 in Calgary, when he finished second in the singles event, while placing fourth in the doubles. Four years later, he improved his performance to win the gold, a feat he repeated in 1994 and 1998. In 1998, he won the gold by clocking the fastest time in all four runs, the first in Olympic history in the men's singles to do so (Vera Zozula of the Soviet Union did that feat in the women's singles event at the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York.). Hackl won the silver medal again in the 2002 Games, becoming the first Winter Olympian to win a medal in five consecutive Winter Olympics. Most recently, he placed 7th in the 2006 Winter Olympics. Hackl has retired from active participation and got involved in coaching after the 2006 Winter Olympics. Lugers coached by Hackl include Felix Loch, Natalie Geisenberger, Tobias Wendl and Tobias Arlt.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/11/us-olympics-luge-women-idUSBREA1A1TU20140211 |title=Geisenberger wins gold but team discord evident |last1=Palmer |first1=Justin |date=11 February 2014 |website=reuters.com|accessdate=11 February 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nbcolympics.com/news/americans-hoping-upset-germans-luge-dynasty |title=Americans hoping to upset German's luge dynasty |last1=Doyle |first1=Amanda |date=18 July 2013 |website=NBC Olympics |accessdate=12 February 2014[/tpl]
