The Bhutan People's Unity Party, also called Druk People's Unity Party (PUP), is a former Bhutanese political party. It was founded by regional and national cadres (chimi and Royal Advisory Councilors) serving in Bhutan's pre-democratic government.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kuenselonline.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=8370 |title=BPUP Approaches Lyonpo Yeshey Zimba |publisher=Kuensel online |first=Ugyen |last=Penjore |date=2007-04-25 |accessdate=2011-09-24[/tpl] Led by former lyonpo (assemblyman) Yeshey Zimba, the largely dysfunctional PUP merged with the stronger All People's Party (APP), headed by former and future prime minister Jigme Y. Thinley; the two parties unified as the Bhutan Peace and Prosperity Party on July 25, 2007.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kuenselonline.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=8726 |title=Another Merger |first=Ugyen |last=Penjore |publisher=Kuensel online |date=2007-07-11 |accessdate=2011-09-24[/tpl] Both the PUP and APP had been registered with the Election Commission.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kuenselonline.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=8798 |title=Druk Phuensum Tshogpa, the New Party in Town |publisher=Kuensel online |date=2007-07-35 |first=Ugyen |last=Penjore |accessdate=2011-05-22| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110610225909/http://www.kuenselonline.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=8798| archivedate= 10 June 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kuenselonline.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=8248 |title=The Race is On |publisher=Kuensel online |date=2007-03-24 |first=Ugyen |last=Penjore |accessdate=2011-05-22| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110610225559/http://www.kuenselonline.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=8248| archivedate= 10 June 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bugDAAAAMBAJ |journal=Pratiyogita Darpan |title=First General Elections in Bhutan |volume=2 |issue=24 |page=169 |date=September 2008 |accessdate=2011-09-24[/tpl]
The PUP was briefly revived as a breakaway faction from September to November 2007 under the leadership of Sigay Dorji.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kuenselonline.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=9467 |publisher=Kuensel online |title=BPUP is Out of the Game |first=Kencho |last=Wangdi |date=2007-11-28 |accessdate=2011-09-24[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kuenselonline.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=9057 |title=BPUP Back in the Fray? |first=Ugyen |last=Penjore |publisher=Kuensel online |date=2007-09-15 |accessdate=2011-09-24[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.southasiaanalysis.org/%5Cnotes5%5Cnote433.html |title=Bhutan: Election Eve – Update No. 69 |author=S. Chandrasekharan |date=2008-03-19 |publisher=South Asia Analysis Group (SAAG)[/tpl] In November 2007, the Election Commission rejected the PUP's registration, preventing its candidates from participating in Bhutan's first partisan election. Amid allegations that over 75% of the PUP's membership consisted of school dropouts, the Election Commission found the party lacked "credible leadership of the calibre that is needed to run and manage the affairs of the nation or even the management of the group itself,"[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.hindu.com/fline/fl2508/stories/20080425250804900.htm |title=All the King's Men |journal=The Hindu online |first=S.D. |last=Muni |volume=25 |issue=08 |date=2008-04-12 – 2008-04-25 |accessdate=2011-09-24[/tpl] and that it lacked "the capacity to fulfill ... national aspirations, visions, and goals."[tpl]cite book|title=Freedom in the World 2009: The Annual Survey of Political Rights & Civil Liberties |series=Information and Interdisciplinary Subjects |first=Aili |last=Piano |editor=Arch Puddington, Katrina Neubauer |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |year=2009 |isbn=1-4422-0122-3 |page=92 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hZVhuV7h5hwC |accessdate=2011-09-24[/tpl] The elimination of the PUP reduced the anticipated two-stage electoral process into a single-election contest.
