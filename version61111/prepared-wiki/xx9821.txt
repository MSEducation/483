During the Permian period synapsids, including the ancestors of mammals, may have dominated land environments, but the Permian–Triassic extinction event [tpl]ma|251[/tpl] came very close to wiping out complex life. The extinctions were apparently fairly sudden, at least among vertebrates.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Ward |first1=P.D. |last2=Botha |first2=J. |last3=Buick |first3=R. |last4=Kock |first4=M.O. |last5=Erwin |first5=D.H. |last6=Garrisson |first6=G.H. |last7= Kirschvink |first7=J.L. |last8= Smith |first8=R. |year=2005 |title= Abrupt and gradual extinction among late Permian land vertebrates in the Karoo Basin, South Africa |journal= Science |volume=307 |pages=709–714 |doi=10.1126/science.1107068 |pmid=15661973 |issue=5710|bibcode = 2005Sci...307..709W [/tpl] During the slow recovery from this catastrophe a previously obscure group, archosaurs, became the most abundant and diverse terrestrial vertebrates. One archosaur group, the dinosaurs, were the dominant land vertebrates for the rest of the Mesozoic, and birds evolved from one group of dinosaurs.[tpl]Cite book|last=Padian |first=Kevin. |year=2004 |chapter=Basal Avialae |editor=Weishampel, David B.; Dodson, Peter; & Osmólska, Halszka (eds.) |title=The Dinosauria |edition=Second |location=Berkeley |publisher=University of California Press |pages=210–231 |isbn=0-520-24209-2[/tpl] During this time mammals' ancestors survived only as small, mainly nocturnal insectivores, but this apparent set-back may have accelerated the development of mammalian traits such as endothermy and hair.[tpl]Cite journal| author=Ruben, J.A., and Jones, T.D. | title=Selective Factors Associated with the Origin of Fur and Feathers | journal=American Zoologist | year=2000 | volume=40 | issue=4 | pages=585–596 |doi=10.1093/icb/40.4.585 | url=http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/40/4/585[/tpl] After the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event [tpl]ma|65[/tpl] killed off the non-avian dinosaurs – birds are the only surviving dinosaurs – mammals increased rapidly in size and diversity, and some took to the air and the sea.
Fossil evidence indicates that flowering plants appeared and rapidly diversified in the Early Cretaceous, between [tpl]ma|130[/tpl] and [tpl]ma|90[/tpl]. Their rapid rise to dominance of terrestrial ecosystems is thought to have been propelled by coevolution with pollinating insects. Social insects appeared around the same time and, although they account for only small parts of the insect "family tree", now form over 50% of the total mass of all insects.
Humans evolved from a lineage of upright-walking apes whose earliest fossils date from over [tpl]ma|6[/tpl]. Although early members of this lineage had chimp-sized brains, about 25% as big as modern humans', there are signs of a steady increase in brain size after about [tpl]ma|3[/tpl]. There is a long-running debate about whether modern humans are descendants of a single small population in Africa, which then migrated all over the world less than 200,000 years ago and replaced previous hominine species, or arose worldwide at the same time as a result of interbreeding.

===Mass extinctions===

Life on earth has suffered occasional mass extinctions at least since [tpl]ma|542[/tpl]. Although they are disasters at the time, mass extinctions have sometimes accelerated the evolution of life on earth. When dominance of particular ecological niches passes from one group of organisms to another, it is rarely because the new dominant group is "superior" to the old and usually because an extinction event eliminates the old dominant group and makes way for the new one.
The fossil record appears to show that the rate of extinction is slowing down, with both the gaps between mass extinctions becoming longer and the average and background rates of extinction decreasing. However, it is not certain whether the actual rate of extinction has altered, since both of these observations could be explained in several ways:

==History of paleontology==

Although paleontology became established around 1800, earlier thinkers had noticed aspects of the fossil record. The ancient Greek philosopher Xenophanes (570–480 BC) concluded from fossil sea shells that some areas of land were once under water. During the Middle Ages the Persian naturalist Ibn Sina, known as Avicenna in Europe, discussed fossils and proposed a theory of petrifying fluids on which Albert of Saxony elaborated in the 14th century. The Chinese naturalist Shen Kuo (1031–1095) proposed a theory of climate change based on the presence of petrified bamboo in regions that in his time were too dry for bamboo.
In early modern Europe, the systematic study of fossils emerged as an integral part of the changes in natural philosophy that occurred during the Age of Reason. At the end of the 18th century Georges Cuvier's work established comparative anatomy as a scientific discipline and, by proving that some fossil animals resembled no living ones, demonstrated that animals could become extinct, leading to the emergence of paleontology. The expanding knowledge of the fossil record also played an increasing role in the development of geology, particularly stratigraphy.
The first half of the 19th century saw geological and paleontological activity become increasingly well organized with the growth of geologic societies and museums and an increasing number of professional geologists and fossil specialists. Interest increased for reasons that were not purely scientific, as geology and paleontology helped industrialists to find and exploit natural resources such as coal.
This contributed to a rapid increase in knowledge about the history of life on Earth and to progress in the definition of the geologic time scale, largely based on fossil evidence. In 1822 Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blanville, editor of Journal de Phisique, coined the word "palaeontology" to refer to the study of ancient living organisms through fossils. As knowledge of life's history continued to improve, it became increasingly obvious that there had been some kind of successive order to the development of life. This encouraged early evolutionary theories on the transmutation of species.[tpl]Cite book|author=Buckland W & Gould SJ|title=Geology and Mineralogy Considered With Reference to Natural Theology (History of Paleontology)|year=1980|publisher=Ayer Company Publishing|isbn=978-0-405-12706-9[/tpl]
After Charles Darwin published Origin of Species in 1859, much of the focus of paleontology shifted to understanding evolutionary paths, including human evolution, and evolutionary theory.
