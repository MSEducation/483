[[Normal lens]]

CATEGORIES: Photographic lenses

In photography and cinematography, a normal lens is a lens that reproduces a field of view that generally looks "natural" to a human observer under normal viewing conditions, as compared with lenses with longer or shorter focal lengths which produce an expanded or contracted field of view that distorts the perspective when viewed from a normal viewing distance.[ref]

Lenses of shorter focal length are called wide-angle lenses, while longer-focal-length lenses are referred to as long-focus lensesBruce Warren, Photography, page 71 (with the most common of that type being the telephoto lenses).
For still photography, a lens with a focal length about equal to the diagonal size of the film or sensor format is considered to be a normal lens; its angle of view is similar to the angle subtended by a large-enough print viewed at a typical viewing distance equal to the print diagonal; this angle of view is about 53° diagonally. For cinematography, where the image is normally viewed at a greater distance, a lens with a focal length of roughly double the film or sensor diagonal is considered 'normal'.
The term normal lens can also be used as a synonym for rectilinear lens.  This is a completely different use of the term.

==Typical normal focal lengths for different formats==

===Film still===

Typical normal lenses for various film formats for photography are:
For a 35 mm camera with a diagonal of 43 mm, the most commonly used normal lens is 50 mm, but focal lengths between about 40 and 58 mm are also considered normal.  The 50 mm focal length was chosen by Oskar Barnack, the creator of the Leica camera.
Note that the angle of view depends on the aspect ratio as well; a "normal" lens on 35mm does not have the same view as a "normal" lens on 645, for example.

===Digital still===

In digital photography, the sensor "type" is not the sensor diameter:

===Cinema===

In cinematography, a focal length roughly equivalent to twice the diagonal of the image projected within the camera is considered normal, since movies are typically viewed from a distance of about twice the screen diagonal.Anton Wilson, Anton Wilson's Cinema Workshop, American Cinematographer, 2004 (Page 100) online.
