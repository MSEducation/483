[[Saint Helena Airport]]

CATEGORIES: Proposed airports, Airports in Saint Helena

Saint Helena Airport is an airport under construction since early 2012 in the British Overseas Territory of Saint Helena, a remote island in the South Atlantic Ocean. The airport is scheduled to open in February 2016, which is when the ship serving the island is to be retired.

==Rationale==

Saint Helena is located more than 2,000 kilometres (1,200 mi) from the nearest major landmass, and it can currently only be reached by ship. This takes 5 days from Cape Town, with departure once per 3 weeks, making Saint Helena one of the most remote populated places on earth, measured as travel time from major cities.

==History==

The first considerations for an airport on St Helena were made in 1943 by the South African Air Force which undertook a survey on Prosperous Bay Plain from October 1943 until January 1944 but concluded that while technically feasible, an airport was not a practical proposition.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dfid.gov.uk/documents/consultations/sthelena/consult-sthele-annexes-apr09.pdf |title=DFID Consultation Document – Annex A – Summary of cost/benefit analysis and financial costs |publisher=DFID |date=16 April 2009 |page=12[/tpl]
From the 1960s, there was an idea to build an airport on the St Helena Island. In 1999, this was taken up by the island government. After a long period of rumour and consultation, the British government announced plans to construct an airport in Saint Helena in March 2005 and the airport was originally expected to be completed by 2010. However constant delays by the British government not least due to inaction by Prime Minister Gordon Brown who insisted on reviewing the paperwork himself[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/26/gordonbrown.labourconference | title=Salvaged with a kiss? Maybe, but Brown's woes run deep | first= Martin | last=Kettle | newspaper= The Guardian | date=26 September 2008 [/tpl] meant an approved bidder, the Italian firm Impregilo, was not chosen until 2008. Then the project was put on hold in November 2008, allegedly due to new financial pressures brought on by the credit-crunch.
By January 2009, construction had not commenced and no final contracts had been signed, and the then Governor Andrew Gurr departed for London in an attempt to speed up the process and solve the problems. On 22 July 2010, the new British government agreed to help pay for the new airstrip using taxpayer money.Saint Helena to get airstrip It was only on 3 November 2011 that the new Island Governor Mark Capes announced construction contracts were signed."Airport Approved" The St Helena Herald, Volume XI Number 28, 4 November 2011, p.4
The airport is expected to open in 2016, by which time the RMS Saint Helena, the only regular ship to call at St Helena, will be retired. Its advocates hope the airport will bring growth to the isolated island economy through the tourism sector which, in the long term, is expected to lead to financial self-sustainability and an end to UK budgetary aid.

===Funding===

A total amount of £201.5 million has been funded for design and construction which will be carried out by South African engineering group Basil Read (Pty) Ltd. Additional funds of up to £10 million in shared risk contingency, and £35.1 million for ten years of operation by South-African airport operator Lanseria Airport have also been granted by the UK Government. According to the St Helena government this represents a saving of more than 20% in real terms from the 2008 price, taking into account inflation and the value of the pound. The airport will be the largest single investment ever made in the island.

==Location and dimensions==

The airport is due to be built on Prosperous Bay Plain, on the east side of Saint Helena entailing a concrete runway of 1,550 m (5,085 ft)[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.shbc.sh/L3_news_120723_airport_runway_extension.html |title=First Variation of Runway Works |author=Darrin Henry |date=23 July 2012 |work=news article |publisher=The St Helena Broadcasting (Guarantee) Corporation Ltd., St Helena Island |accessdate=24 July 2012[/tpl] with taxiway and apron, approximately 8 million m³ rockfill embankment through which a 750m long reinforced concrete culvert will run, an airport terminal building of 3,500m² and support infrastructure, air traffic control and safety, bulk fuel installation for 6 million litres of diesel and aviation fuel, a 14 km airport access road from Rupert's Bay to the airport, and all related logistics."Basil Read awarded contract to construct airport on St Helena Island" Basil Read company website, 4 November 2011, retrieved 2011-DEC-24

===Aircraft compatibility===

Given its dimensions the airport will be capable of accommodating up to two"Application Drawings, CI-01-1001 - General Runway Layout" Airport Development Application, 2004 twinjet passenger aircraft up to the size of the Airbus A319, Boeing 737 and also the Boeing 757-200. Following the decision for a shorter runway of 1,550 m the previously planned use of Boeing 737-800 aircraft had been ruled out in the first instance. Instead the airport was to be designed to receive Boeing 737-700 aircraft.[tpl]cite news  | last = Olsson | first = Mikael | title = Editorial | pages = 2 | newspaper = The St Helena Independent | location = Jamestown | volume = VII | issue = 10 | date = 20 January 2012 | url = http://www.independent.co.sh/20120120.pdf[/tpl] However on 17 July 2012 the St Helena Government and Basil Read agreed to a change to the runway design which includes widening the embankment over an additional 40m at the southern end, paving an additional 100m of the runway with concrete, providing larger turning circles at the runway ends, and increasing the size of the apron.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sainthelenaaccess.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/St-Helena-Airport-update-No13.pdf |title=FIRST PROJECT VARIATION ORDER SIGNED - Additional Runway Works to Allow for Future Expansion |publisher=St Helena Government Access Office |date=23 July 2012 |work=press release |issue=No: 13[/tpl] In contrast to the 2011 Reference Design for the airport it will now have a full 240m Runway End Safety Area (RESA) at the southern end of the runway instead of the originally planned Engineered Material Arresting System (EMAS). The intention is to add an EMAS designed for Boeing 737-800 at a later date butting onto the southern end of the paved runway to increase the declarable Landing Distance Available (LDA) to 1,650m,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sainthelenaaccess.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/St-Helena-Airport-update-No-13.pdf |title=St Helena Airport Update |issue=13 |date=12 July 2012 |author=St Helena Government |accessdate=18 June 2012 |work=press release |publisher=St Helena Government[/tpl]
which will then allow receiving larger aircraft such as the Boeing Boeing 737-800 and Airbus A320.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sainthelena.gov.sh/news.php/624/additional-runway-works-to-allow-for-future-expansion |title=Additional runway works to allow for future expansion |author=St Helena Government |date=23 July 2012 |work=press release |publisher=St Helena Government |accessdate=24 July 2012[/tpl]
The additional earthworks and concrete will increase duration of construction by 12 weeks so works are now expected to be completed by 25 February 2016. Extending the embankment once the airport is operational would have involved prohibitive costs as heavy equipment would have needed to be brought back to the island and huge quantities of rock from another site to be moved, while now material excavated from Prosperous Bay Plain will be used to fill Dry Gut.
In June 2013 the St Helena Government announced it was again assessing changes that can be made to the design of the runway to cater for operations of a wider range of aircraft, in particular the Lockheed C-130 Hercules and the Boeing 757-200, the latter enabling direct flights to Europe, which are believed to be crucial for the island's tourism plans.[tpl]cite news  | last = Pipe | first = Simon | title = Doubt over eco-resort as Shelco seeks direct flights to Europe | newspaper = St Helena Online | location = Jamestown | date = 8 November 2012 | url = http://sthelenaonline.org/2012/11/08/doubt-over-eco-resort-as-shelco-seeks-direct-flights-to-europe/[/tpl][tpl]cite news  | last = Pipe | first = Simon | title = No flights from London?

In October 2013 a formal agreement was signed for the proposed design changes.[tpl]cite news  | last = Olsson | first = Mikael | title = Editorial | pages = 3 | newspaper = The St Helena Independent | location = Jamestown | volume = IX | issue = 1 | date = 6 December 2013 | url = http://www.saint.fm/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/20131206.pdf[/tpl] These enhancements will also make it possible for the Lockheed C-130 Hercules to operate to and from St Helena, though the runway is unlikely to be able to accommodate larger Code D aircraft, such as the Boeing 767.
The upgrade will be funded from cost savings on other parts of the project, particularly by a simplified runway drainage system.

===Potential routes===

Flights may potentially operate services to London and Cape Town, and possibly Johannesburg. A link to Ascension Island is still subject to negotiation between the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the US Defense Department since the Wideawake Airfield at Ascension island is closed to commercial air traffic. Therefore it also cannot be listed by an airline as an alternate aerodrome; although situated 800 miles north-northwest from St Helena it is the closest alternative airport.
This leaves Lubango Airport in Angola at a distance of 1,300 miles as the next best diversion option for which every inbound aircraft must carry enough fuel reserve, limiting its load capacity.

===Cargo===

It is believed that reductions in ticket prices can be obtained by utilising spare payload capacity on flight to and from St Helena to carry air freight (e.g. agricultural products, coffee, fish).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sainthelenaaccess.com/application/documents/Feasibility/03_Appendices_Final_Vol_2_v2.pdf  |title=St Helena Access Feasibility Study |page=3 |publisher=WS Atkins plc |author=WS Atkins plc |date=October 2004[/tpl] At 70% passenger load factor a B737-800 operating, on an average day, into St Helena would have a spare payload capacity of some 4,000 kg. The extra income possible per in-bound flight from cargo could be as high as the income equivalent of 19 passengers. This would give an effective load factor of 88% and could reduce ticket prices.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sainthelenaaccess.com/application/documents/Feasibility/03_Appendices_Final_Vol_2_v2.pdf  |title=St Helena Access Feasibility Study |page=4 |publisher=WS Atkins plc |author=WS Atkins plc |date=October 2004[/tpl]

===Issues===

Due to the short runway and the long distance to South Africa a Boeing 737-700 flying to Cape Town or Johannesburg will not be able to use its full seat and cargo capacity. Only flights to and from Namibian and Angolan destinations would allow using a Boeing 737-700 near its full load capacity.
[tpl]As of|2012|1[/tpl] TAAG Angola Airlines is the only airline in Southern Africa operating aircraft that would be appropriate for flights to and from St Helena (fleet of 4 Boeing 737-700).
If Wideawake Airfield on Ascension Island was open for commercial (i.e. non-military) flights, it could be listed as an alternate aerodrome; this would mean that the load capacity of an inbound Boeing 737-700 could be increased as less fuel reserves would be required.
