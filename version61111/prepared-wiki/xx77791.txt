</ref><ref name=BBC201002>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/newsnight/susanwatts/2010/02/new_flaws_in_chip_and_pin_syst.html BBC: New flaws in chip and pin system revealed, 11 February 2010]</ref> A stolen card is connected to an electronic circuit and to a fake card which is inserted into the terminal ("[[man-in-the-middle attack]]"). Any 4 digits are typed in and accepted as a valid PIN. A team from the BBC's [[Newsnight]] programme visited a Cambridge University cafeteria (with permission) with the system, and were able to pay using their own cards (a thief would use stolen cards) connected to the circuit, inserting a fake card and typing in "0000" as the PIN. The transactions were registered as normal, and were not picked up by banks' security systems. A member of the research team said, "Even small-scale criminal systems have better equipment than we have. The amount of technical sophistication needed to carry out this attack is really quite low." The announcement of the vulnerability said, "The expertise that is required is not high (undergraduate level electronics) ... We dispute the assertion by the banking industry that criminals are not sophisticated enough, because they have already demonstrated a far higher level of skill than is necessary for this attack in their miniaturized PIN entry device skimmers." It is not known if this vulnerability has been exploited.
EMVCo disagreed and published a response saying that, while such an attack might be theoretically possible, it would be extremely difficult and expensive to carry out successfully, that current compensating controls are likely to detect or limit the fraud, and that the possible financial gain from the attack is minimal while the risk of a declined transaction or exposure of the fraudster is significant.[ref]

When approached for comment, several banks[tpl]Which|date=September 2010[/tpl] each said that this was an industry-wide issue, and referred the Newsnight team to the banking trade association for further comment. According to Phil Jones of the Consumers' Association, chip and PIN has helped to bring down instances of card crime, but many cases remain unexplained "What we do know is that we do have cases that are brought forward from individuals which seem quite persuasive."
Because the submission of the PIN is suppressed, this is the exact equivalent of a merchant performing a PIN bypass transaction, such transactions will never succeed offline as a card will never generate an offline authorisation without a successful PIN entry. As a result of this, the transaction ARQC must be submitted online to the issuer who will know that the ARQC was generated without a successful PIN submission (since this information is included in the encrypted ARQC) and hence would be very likely to decline the transaction if it were for a high value, out of character or otherwise outside of the typical risk management parameters set by the issuer.
Originally bank customers had to prove that they had not been negligent with their PIN before getting redress, but UK regulations in force from 1 November 2009 placed the onus firmly on the banks to prove that a customer has been negligent in any dispute, with the customer given 13 months to make a claim.Telegraph - Card fraud: banks now have to prove your guilt, 12 February 2010 Murdoch said that "banks should look back at previous transactions where the customer said their PIN had not been used and the bank record showed it has, and consider refunding these customers because it could be they are victim of this type of fraud."

===2011: CVM downgrade allows arbitrary PIN harvest===

At the CanSecWest conference in March 2011, Andrea Barisani and Daniele Bianco presented research uncovering a vulnerability in EMV which would allow arbitrary PIN harvesting despite the Cardholder verification configuration of the card, even when the supported CVMs data is signed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://dev.inversepath.com/download/emv/emv_2011.pdf|title=Chip & PIN is definitely broken|author=Adam Laurie, Andrea Barisani, Daniele Bianco and Zac Franken[/tpl]
The PIN harvesting can be performed with a chip skimmer as a tampered CVM list, which downgrades the cardholder verification method to offline PIN, is still honoured by POS terminals despite its signature being invalid.[tpl]cite web|url=http://dev.inversepath.com/download/emv/blackhat_df-whitepaper.txt|title=CVM downgrade attack|author=Adam Laurie, Andrea Barisani, Daniele Bianco and Zac Franken[/tpl]

==EMV implementation==

In many countries of the world, debit card and/or credit card payment networks have implemented liability shifts.  Normally, the card issuer is liable for fraudulent transactions.  However, after a liability shift is implemented, if the ATM or merchant's point of sale terminal does not support EMV, then the ATM owner or merchant will be liable for the fraudulent transaction.
