New Trier High School (also known as New Trier Township High School or NTHS) is a public four-year high school, with its main campus for sophomores through seniors located in Winnetka, Illinois, USA, and a freshman campus in Northfield, Illinois, with freshman classes and district administration. Founded in 1901, the school is known for its large spending per student, academic excellence, and its athletic, drama, visual arts, and music programs. New Trier's primary campus in Winnetka is used by sophomores, juniors, and seniors, while the freshmen attend classes at the Northfield campus. The school serves the Chicago North Shore suburbs of Wilmette, Kenilworth, Winnetka, Glencoe, most of Northfield, and parts of Glenview and Northbrook.High School District 203 Map
The school is named after the city of Trier, Germany, and New Trier's logo depicts the Porta Nigra, symbol of that city; the athletic teams are known as the Trevians, which comes from the Treves, the French name for Trier.

==History==

New Trier Township High School was founded in 1901 in Winnetka, Illinois, with seventy-six students and seven faculty members.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl] Chicago's north shore communities had decided to build a school that would enable parents to educate their children without sending them to college preparatory schools on the Eastern seaboard.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]
The school has been marked by a series of firsts and other notable events. In 1912, New Trier became the first high school in America with an indoor swimming pool.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]  During World War I, New Trier became a training ground for soldiers.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]  A student fundraising drive at the time led to the purchase of a field ambulance.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]  In 1928, New Trier began its advisory system, the first such in American public secondary education, in which each student meets with one faculty adviser and the same fellow advisory students every morning throughout his or her career.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]  Students sold tax warrants door-to-door in the 1930s to keep the school operating as the flow of property tax funds dwindled in the Great Depression.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]  During World War II, students sold bonds to finance both a B-17 (The Spirit of New Trier) and a B-29.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]
In the 1950s, New Trier became the first American high school with an educational, non-commercial FM broadcast license for a radiated station (WNTH, 88.1 FM).[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]  By 1970 New Trier was home to the nation's first public high school-based CCTV instructional station, ITV, which broadcast educational programming to township elementary schools via microwave signals.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]  Students operated WNTH under a faculty advisor, ITV was operated by students under professional television technical and programming staff.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]
By 1962, student enrollment was more than 4,000.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]  Some 20 "temporary" trailer classrooms lined the rear of the building, which had been designed for 3,000.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]  To accommodate the growing baby boom student body, voters approved a referendum for New Trier to purchase forty-six acres in Northfield.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]  Chicago architecture firm Perkins and Will was selected to design a campus of curricular buildings clustered around a central library and administration building.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]  The resulting modernist design was widely noted in secondary education architecture literature and practice, and emulated by Winnetka's Carleton Washburne junior high school several years later.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]
"New Trier West" opened to freshmen and sophomores in 1965.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]  What had been "New Trier," at 385 Winnetka Avenue in Winnetka, became "New Trier East."[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]  In 1967, New Trier West was dedicated as a separate four-year high school.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]  U.S. Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare John Gardner keynoted the dedication, which was also attended by U.S. Senator Charles Percy ('37), and Congressman Donald Rumsfeld ('50).[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]
Enrollment reached an all-time peak of 6,558 students in 1972.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]  By 1981, enrollment had dropped significantly. As a result, the school board decided to combine the East and West schools and convert New Trier West into the freshman-only campus.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]  The division of freshmen (at the former New Trier West) from upperclassmen (at the former New Trier East) lasted from September 1981 until June 1985.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]  By then enrollment had declined enough for the board to bring all students under one roof, close the former New Trier West, and convert the Northfield campus into a community recreation space.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]  The campus later housed a senior center, corporate dormitories, a public swimming pool, and an alternative high school program known as West Center Academy.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]
Jonathan Kozol wrote a book called Savage Inequalities in 1991 that discussed the harsh conditions in the poorest school districts in the United States, making a correlation between inequality and racial separation and segregation.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl] In the book, Kozol contrasted New Trier High School's spending per student to impoverished schools within Chicago.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]
New Trier was featured in the December 9, 1996, issue of Time in an article entitled "High Times at New Trier High."[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl] Among other claims, the article stated that "New Trier kids who smoke pot" were "by all accounts more than three-fifths of the student body," compared with national averages at the time closer to 33%.[tpl]cite news |last=Graff |first=James L. |title=High Times at New Trier High |work=Time |date=1996-12-09 |url=http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,985657,00.html |accessdate=2007-05-22 [/tpl]  However, on the school's WNTH's radio program, the writer acknowledged that the "three-fifths" claim had been inadvertently rewritten during the editing process in such a way that seemed to imply that more than 60% of New Trier students may be regular users of marijuana, whereas that figure should have been clearly labeled as the portion of students who had ever used marijuana, including many who had used it only once or twice.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]
In 2001, due to increasing enrollment, the Northfield campus reopened.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]  The decision to make it a freshman-only campus was a compromise from a stalemate between plans to either increase capacity at the Winnetka campus or reopen the Northfield campus as a separate school.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]  The Northfield campus also houses the administrative offices of the New Trier Township High School District.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]
In February 2008, a student broke into the school computer database, using his personal computer to obtain unauthorized access to the network. He took a faculty member's password and gained access to the student information system, obtaining grades for the then-current and last three graduating classes. The student also obtained ACT test scores for the class of 2008. The administration took disciplinary action against the student and he was later arrested by Winnetka police.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-student-charged-webmay08,0,2033130.story | work=Chicago Tribune | title=New Trier senior charged with hacking into school files | first=Emily S | last=Achenbaum | date=2008-05-08[/tpl]
In the summer of 2008, Illinois state senator James Meeks made a public plea for parents of Chicago public school students to assist their children in skipping the first day of school (September 2), and instead attend a protest at New Trier that involved attempting to mass enroll students there.  The protest was over inequities in school funding between schools in Chicago and New Trier.  New Trier administrators were supportive of the protest.New Trier vs. CPS: Meeks plans protest July 28, 2008, Vivian Huang Chicago Sun Times[tpl]dead link|date=July 2013[/tpl]Meeks Plans Student Protest On First Day Of School @cbs2chicago.com[tpl]dead link|date=July 2013[/tpl] Students were greeted by cheerful parent volunteers to register at the Northfield Campus. After a relatively quick and peaceful registration, the buses left.

===Master planning process===

New Trier High School recently invested in an extensive campus expansion and modification plan for its two campuses, called the "Master Planning Process".  The process took input, in roughly equal shares, from (1) faculty, (2) staff and administration, (3) students and (4) community at large when formulating the plan (though only the Board of Education made the final decision).  The proposed project has cost of over $174M, paid by a massive bond issue that is set to increase township property taxes for the next 20+ years.http://lovenewtriervoteno.org/?page_id=320http://www.newtrierchoices.org/NewTrierChoices/Taxes.html A referendum to authorize the issuance of $174 million in bonds to finance the Winnetka campus renovation was placed on the February 2, 2010 ballot; it was defeated 63% to 37%.http://results.cookcountyclerk.com/febresults/Detail.aspx?eid=020210&rid=500&vfor=1
The School Board reviewed a Long Range Facility Plan for the district, including a recommendation for a Project One that will demolish and rebuild portions of the campus on its west and east sides on On April 6, 2009. After their decision, the school's administration began a campaign in support of the re-construction plan for the Winnetka Campus.http://www.newtrier.k12.il.us/media/files/content/New_Trier_Web_Site/Administration/Facilities_Planning/CEC_6Month_Action_Plan_Nov08_2.pdf[tpl]dead link|date=July 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/education/1049230,CST-NWS-newtrier10.article | work=Chicago Sun-Times | title=Board weighs $400 million overhaul at New Trier | first=ERIC JOHNSON | last=Pioneer | date=2008-07-10[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=July 2013[/tpl]

The school was also identified as "quite possibly the best public school in America" by Town & Country, in a six-page article on New Trier that cited the "rich" and "demanding" curriculum, extensive arts and activities, strong participation in athletics, and faculty of the caliber typically found teaching at good colleges.Maeroff, Gene I. (June, 1986). "Let's Hear it for New Trier". Town and Country Monthly, p. 147. Life also recognized New Trier as one of the best high schools in America with cover stories in 1950 and 1998.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.life.com/Life/covers/1950/cv101650.html |title=LIFE Cover for 10/16/1950 |accessdate=2007-05-22 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070929083738/http://www.life.com/Life/covers/1950/cv101650.html |archivedate = 2007-09-29[/tpl]

The article also points out that 92% of the school's funding comes from the high property taxes of its affluent surroundings.  The degree to which the school's performance is actually high given its resources is not addressed.
New Trier ensembles or individuals have received 39 awards in the Downbeat Student Music Awards program. A record-setting 7 of these were achieved in 2007 alone.New Trier High School Jazz: About Us: Jazz Ensemble I More than 1,100 students participate in the music department.

===Subject levels===

New Trier has practiced subject-level grouping for over fifty years.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.newtrier.k12.il.us/information/pub/ntprofile05_06.pdf |title=New Trier High School 2006–2007 Profile |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-05-22 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070927235305/http://www.newtrier.k12.il.us/information/pub/ntprofile05_06.pdf |archivedate = 2007-09-27[/tpl] In this system, up to four different levels of difficulty are offered for each academic subject. Level 2E is considered a general level. Levels 2, 3 and 4 are college preparatory, accelerated, and honors levels, respectively. Level 5 was reserved for Advanced Placement classes and other college-level classes, such as multivariable calculus and linear algebra, but the level was phased out beginning with the class of 2011.  (All 5-level courses are currently counted as 4-level.)  Students may work at different levels in different subjects.
New Trier offers both unweighted and weighted grade point averages (GPA), and plus and minus grades are reported on transcripts. In calculating a weighted GPA, grades in a student's coursework are given different values depending on the level in which the grade is earned.  For example, an A in a 2-level course is weighted at 4.00, while in levels 3 and 4 the values are 4.67 and 5.33, respectively (an "A" in a 5-level AP class is worth 5.67). In 2009 New Trier announced that for the 2010-2011 school year the "5 level" will be eliminated. A.P. classes will be weighted to level 4 
Since the late 1990s, the Board of Education has been examining how to encourage students to pursue a strong academic career without having them focus too much on their class rank.  The first step taken by the administration was to eliminate the process of reporting class rank and to switch to decile ranking.  Around the same time, the scale for weighted GPA calculations was modified and plus and minus grades were implemented. In 2008, New Trier eliminated the reporting of ranks in class entirely.

===Athletics===

New Trier's mascot is the Trevian, named after soldiers from the city of Trier, Germany during the Roman Empire. The Trevian mascot was chosen in recognition that the Grosse Pointe area of Wilmette was largely settled by immigrants from Trier, Germany. From 1901 to 1948, the school's sports teams were known as the "Terriers" and "Green Wave." During the 1948-49 school year they were renamed "Indians", reflecting the school's location in the Indian Hill section of Winnetka. When the new campus in the western part of the district opened in 1965, the new school's sports team was known as the "Cowboys". The year before the two schools merged in 1981, a number of student forums were held on both the East and West campuses, giving students the opportunity to provide feedback on potential school colors and nicknames.  After a series of votes of the student body, the school adopted "Trevians" as a team name and green, blue, and gray as the school colors (East having previously been green and gray, while West was blue, gray, and white). During the 2004–2005 school year the mascot was named "Trevius Maximus" after conducting a poll among the students.
New Trier's biggest conference rival is Evanston Township High School. The rivalry between their football teams is one of the oldest uninterrupted sports rivalries in the history of high school sports, dating back over 100 years. Both schools compete in the Central Suburban League conference. The two annual basketball games New Trier plays against Evanston draw so many people that since 2001 they have been held at Northwestern University's larger Welsh-Ryan Arena.  New Trier's biggest non-conference rival is Loyola Academy, which is located in Wilmette, just down the road from the Northfield campus.
With more than 120 state championships, New Trier High School currently has more than any other high school in Illinois.http://www.ihsa.org/records/titles/records.htm  New Trier also leads the state in both boys' and girls' state titles.

====Philanthropy====

Each of the four official class governments (Sophomore and Junior Steering Committees and the Freshman and Senior Senates) makes significant annual donations to various philanthropic causes throughout the community, state, country, and world. Every year since 2001, the Senior Senate has fully funded the construction of a house in conjunction with Habitat for Humanity of Lake County, Illinois, a non-profit organization that fights homelessness and substandard housing. Recently the campaign was 10 houses in 10 years and the class of 2010 fulfilled that goal. New Trier is the only school so far to build 10 houses with Habitat. Many fund raisers contribute to this and various other causes over the course of the academic year. The New Trier Tsunami Relief Committee donated more than $18,000 to relief organizations to save people that were affected by the tsunami and also helped victims of the Indian Ocean Tsunami in December 2004.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.newtrier.k12.il.us/activities/wnth/radiothon.html |title=WNTH Radio-thon |publisher=WNTH |accessdate=2007-05-22 [/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=July 2013[/tpl]

====Frank Mantooth Jazz Festival====

The jazz festival began in 1983 and takes place on the first Saturday of February.

The high school groups attend clinics with respected jazz educators and composers from around the country. Seminars are also held throughout the day on improvisation, transcription, and music business, as well as instrument masterclasses. A featured jazz combo and college big band perform in the afternoon, while the evening concert features a renowned professional big band. Past groups have included the Buddy Rich Big Band (led by Dave Weckl), the Woody Herman Orchestra, the Count Basie Orchestra, the Artie Shaw Orchestra, the Duke Ellington Orchestra, the Toshiko Akiyoshi-Lew Tabackin Jazz Orchestra, the Vanguard Jazz Orchestra, the Chicago Jazz Ensemble (led by Jon Faddis),  the Bob Mintzer Big Band, Gordon Goodwin's Big Phat Band, the Mingus Big Band, Maynard Ferguson, and Dizzy Gillespie.New Trier High School Jazz: Jazz Festival: Past Performers The festival was renamed in 2005 after Frank Mantooth when the legendary jazz musician, educator, and composer passed away just days before the 2004 festival.http://mobile.ljworld.com/news/2007/jan/05/late_mantooth_inducted_jazz_hall_fame/[tpl]dead link|date=July 2013[/tpl]

====In The Movies====

Scenes from Home Alone,[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,318804,00.html |title=Home Alone's Macaulay Culkin |accessdate=2009-01-03 | work=Entertainment Weekly |first1=Margot |last1=Dougherty |first2=Melina |last2=Gerosa |date=1990-12-07[/tpl] Ferris Bueller's Day Off, and Uncle Buck were shot at the high school's west campus in Northfield, and scenes from Sixteen Candles were shot outside the high school's east campus in Winnetka. The Breakfast Club's title comes from the nickname invented by students and staff for morning detention at New Trier High School, the school attended by the son of one of John Hughes' friends. Thus, those who were sent to detention before school starting time were designated members of "The Breakfast Club".
