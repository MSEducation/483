==History==

The Bristol Packet was founded in 1973 by Nick and Corrina Gray.[tpl]cite news|last=Staff|title=Waterborne Taxi Service|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/uk/nexis/results/docview/docview.do?docLinkInd=true&risb=21_T17960005065&format=GNBFI&sort=BOOLEAN&startDocNo=1&resultsUrlKey=29_T17959926948&cisb=22_T17960005067&treeMax=true&treeWidth=0&csi=166254&docNo=2|accessdate=14 August 2013|newspaper=Bristol Evening Post, archived at Lexis-Nexis|date=26 August 2003|format=subscription required[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Staff|title=Couple's harbour boat trips, and their booze cruises|url=http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/Couple-s-harbour-boat-trips-booze-cruises/story-17018147-detail/story.html#axzz2bNNdwnnx|work=This is Bristol|publisher=Local World|accessdate=8 August 2013[/tpl] At that time there were no passenger boats operating in the city docks or on the river Avon, the last services had been offered by the Kingstonian in the 1960s. The docks were semi-derelict and there were few visitors. Trips were initially offered around the docks on the narrowboat Redshank, which along with her accompanying butty Greenshank, had been brought from the Midlands by the Grays. Nick offered "interesting, anecdotal commentaries which added some depth and interest to the trips", according to the Bristol Post.
In 1976 the river launch Tower Belle was brought to Bristol enabling trips upstream to Hanham and downstream to the Avon Gorge. Avon Gorge trips had not been available to the public since the demise of P & A Campbells in the 1970s.[tpl]cite news|last=Staff|title=Sailing down memory lane on a tour around the harbour|url=http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/Sailing-memory-lane-tour-harbour/story-17147789-detail/story.html#axzz2bTJZ20y9|accessdate=9 August 2013|newspaper=Bristol Post|date=22 October 2012[/tpl] The Grays eventually sold the company in 1980. Tickets for boat trips were sold from a 1910 showman's wagon at Wapping Wharf.
In 1995, The Bristol Packet commenced operations on the Flower of Bristol, enabling a further extension of the evening charter business. The most recent addition, in 2002, to the company's fleet was Amsterdam built sightseeing boat Bagheera.[tpl]cite news|last=Brown|first=Rosee|title=Sail in style on the Bagheera; River boat refit costs a packet|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/uk/nexis/results/docview/docview.do?docLinkInd=true&risb=21_T17959926943&format=GNBFI&sort=BOOLEAN&startDocNo=176&resultsUrlKey=29_T17959926948&cisb=22_T17960032576&treeMax=true&treeWidth=0&csi=166254&docNo=178|accessdate=14 August 2013|newspaper=Bristol Evening Post, archived at Lexis-Nexis|date=5 September 2002|format=subscription required[/tpl]
