==Writing and release==

When speaking to NME, lead singer Kelly Jones said the song is "about finding some hope in life. It's about those moments in life when you feel a bit lost and stuck and you don't know how to get out of it and then there's a glimmer of hope that helps you pull through it. It's quite a spiritual song."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nme.com/news/stereophonics/66988 |title=Stereophonics give away new single 'In A Moment' as a free download â€“ listen |publisher=NME |date=4 November 2013 |accessdate=29 July 2013[/tpl]

The music video for "In a Moment" was directed by lead singer Kelly Jones[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dropoutuk.com/music/9056/video-stereophonics-in-a-moment.html |title=VIDEO: Stereophonics 'In A Moment' |last=Kuscher |first=Oli |publisher=Drop Out |date=19 November 2012 |accessdate=29 July 2013[/tpl] and stars Liam Browne as a man stuck in a moment and Charlie Carter as a homeless man.[tpl]cite AV media |people=Kelly Jones (Director), Stereophonics |year=2012 |title=Stereophonics - In A Moment (making of) |medium=Music Video |language=English |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AXR5xx6ovk |accessdate=29 July 2013[/tpl] It features a character (Browne) who tries to give money to homeless people but they refuse, wanting the food he's got instead. One of the homeless men (Carter) he offered money to helps assist the character in taking his own life by burying him in the sand. The homeless man leaves the shovel in arms reach for the character in case he changes his mind and he also leaves the food he was given.[tpl]cite AV media |people=Kelly Jones (Director), Stereophonics |year=2012 |title=Stereophonics - The Making of Violins and Tambourines |medium=Music Video |language=English |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLOOsGovIPs |accessdate=29 July 2013[/tpl] As the character is about to drown, he then sees his good and bad memories and realises his life is relevant and will get better, so he digs himself out before it's too late.
For the scene in which the character is buried in the sand, Browne's body was placed in a wooden box under the sand to prevent him from being physically buried and the top of the box was covered with sand, leaving his head above the sand and creating the illusion he's been physically buried. In the later scene when he gets out the sand, Browne was buried in the sand horizontally.
