==History of Texas' seventh district==

Texas received a seventh congressional district through reapportionment in 1881 as a result of population growth reflected in the 1880 Census and in 1883, Thomas P. Ochiltree, an Independent, was elected its first representative.  From 1882-1902 the district was located in North Central Texas and was represented by Wacoan Robert L. Henry. After the redistricting of 1902, the district shifted eastward and was represented Congressmen from Palestine and Galveston.  After 1952, the district again shifted to Waco.
The district was redrawn mid-decade in 1966 after the Supreme Court ruled in Wesberry v. Sanders two years earlier that congressional district populations had to be equal or close to equal in population.  As a result, Houston, which had been located entirely in District 8, was divided into three districts, one of which was District 7.  Prior to 1966, the district was represented by a Wacoan, John Dowdy.  From 1885-1966, the seventh congressional district elected only Democratic representatives to Congress.
Since the district has been located in Houston, it has only elected Republican representatives, including former President George H.W. Bush.
Famous residents include former President George H. W. Bush.

==2012 redistricting==

After the 2012 redistricting process, the 7th district lost some of its territory to the newly-drawn 2nd district. The district lost most of the portion north of Jersey Village, while expanding farther west and south, so that it goes in an easterly direction bordering Interstate 10 to the south. The district now includes parts of unincorporated Harris County and Sharpstown east of the Southwest Freeway. The district lost Memorial Park, Montrose, Spring Branch and Rice University to the 2nd district.http://gis1.tlc.state.tx.us/
