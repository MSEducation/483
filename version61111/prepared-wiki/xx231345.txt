Borderline intellectual functioning, also called borderline mental retardation, is a categorization of intelligence wherein a person has below average cognitive ability (generally an IQ of 70-85),[tpl]cite journal |pmid=20537050|title=Working memory and executive function profiles of individuals with borderline intellectual functioning|author=TP Alloway|date=May 2010|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2788.2010.01281.x|volume=54|issue=5|pages=448â€“56[/tpl] but the deficit is not as severe as intellectual disability (70 or below). It is sometimes called below average IQ (BAIQ). This is technically a cognitive impairment; however, this group is not sufficiently mentally disabled to be eligible for specialized services. Additionally, the DSM-IV-TR codes borderline intellectual functioning as V62.89,[tpl]cite book |author= |title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-IV |publisher=American Psychiatric Association |location=Washington, DC |year=2000 |pages= |isbn=0-89042-025-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=[/tpl] which is generally not a billable code, unlike the codes for mental retardation.
During school years, individuals with borderline intellectual functioning are often "slow learners."The Best Test Preparation for the Advanced Placement Examination in Psychology, Research & Education Association. (2003), p. 99  Although a large percentage of this group fails to complete high school and can often achieve only a low socioeconomic status, most adults in this group blend in with the rest of the population. Persons who fall into this categorization have a relatively normal expression of affect for their age, although their ability to think abstractly is rather limited.  Reasoning displays a preference for concrete thinking. They are usually able to function day to day without assistance, including holding down a simple job and the basic responsibilities of maintaining a dwelling.
