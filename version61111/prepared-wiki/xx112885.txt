The Malta national rugby union team are governed by the Malta Rugby Football Union (MRFU). Although Malta has yet to qualify for the Rugby World Cup, the island state has made remarkable progression since its first international in 2000. It is currently competing in the European Division 2A and recently maintained its status with a win over Sweden.

==History==

Malta's national team played their first match on November 18 in 2000, against Moldova in Chişinău, which Moldova won 58-8. They played a subsequent match against Belgium that same year in Marsa, which Belgium won 26-0. Malta played four matches in 2001, and they recorded their first win in the fourth of them, against Monaco in Marsa. This was followed by a draw 10-10 with Norway, defeating Lithuania, Austria, Luxembourg, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia-Montenegro, Latvia and Hungary. They then played Moldova in 2004.
Malta then proceeded to enter the 2007 Rugby World Cup European qualification tournament where they were grouped in Pool D of the second round. After finishing third in their pool with two wins from four pool games, Malta entered a play-off along with Denmark, Andorra and Sweden to enter round three. Malta were successful and entered Pool B of round three.
The team is currently ranked 41st in the International Rugby Board world rankings, their highest ever position. They are coached by Welshman Damian Neill, a former Number 8 in the Welsh Premiership with Aberavon RFC and Maesteg RFC.
Their most notable player is Luke "boom time" Watts. Luke is known for bullocking runs and big shots in D, and although not able to establish himself in Otley's 1st or 2nd team, is still big on the International scene
