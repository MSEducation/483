[[Breast milk]]

CATEGORIES: Breast, Breastfeeding, Body fluids, Breast milk

Breast milk is the milk produced by the breasts (or mammary glands) of a human female for her infant offspring. Milk is the primary source of nutrition for newborns before they are able to eat and digest other foods; older infants and toddlers may continue to be breastfed, either exclusively or in combination with other foods.

==Benefits==

The baby nursing from its own mother is the most common way of obtaining breast milk, but the milk can be pumped and then fed by baby bottle, cup and/or spoon, supplementation drip system, and nasogastric tube. Breast milk can be supplied by a woman other than the baby's mother; either via donated pumped milk (generally from a milk bank or via informal milk donation), or when a woman nurses a child other than her own at her breast, a practice known as wetnursing.
The World Health Organization recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life, with solids gradually being introduced around this age when signs of readiness are shown. Supplemented breastfeeding is recommended until at least age two and then for as long as the mother and child wish.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/exclusive_breastfeeding/en/ |title=WHO | Exclusive breastfeeding |publisher=Who.int |date=2011-01-15 |accessdate=2011-10-26[/tpl]
Breastfeeding offers health benefits to mother and child even after toddlerhood. These benefits include: A twenty-seven percent of normal risk of SIDS for feeding only human milk,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/media/media_40135.html|title=WHO and UNICEF call for renewed commitment to breast-feeding[/tpl][tpl]cite pmid|21669892[/tpl] increased intelligence,Breastfeeding Associated With Increased Intelligence, Study Suggests decreased likelihood of contracting middle ear infections,[tpl]cite pmid|6409579[/tpl] cold and flu resistance,[tpl]cite pmid|22926635[/tpl] a tiny decrease in the risk of childhood leukemia,[tpl]cite pmid|22863497[/tpl] lower risk of childhood onset diabetes,[tpl]cite pmid|23304866[/tpl] decreased risk of asthma and eczema,[tpl]cite pmid|23372130[/tpl] decreased dental problems decreased risk of obesity later in life,[tpl]cite pmid|23371390[/tpl] and a decreased risk of developing psychological disorders, including in adopted children.[tpl]Citation|url=http://www.internationalbreastfeedingjournal.com/content/1/1/5|title=Mental health, attachment and breastfeeding: implications for adopted children and their mothers|journal=International Breastfeeding Journal|year=2006[/tpl][tpl]cite pmid|23306004[/tpl]
Breastfeeding also provides health benefits for the mother. It assists the uterus in returning to its pre-pregnancy size and reduces post-partum bleeding, as well as assisting the mother in returning to her pre-pregnancy weight. Breastfeeding also reduces the risk of breast cancer later in life.[tpl]cite web|title=Breast-Feeding Might Cut Risk for Tough-to-Treat Breast Cancer: Study|url=http://www.womenshealth.gov/news/headlines/669591.cfm|accessdate=18 October 2012|author1=Alyssa Gillego, M.D |author2=Stephanie Bernik, M.D[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Levin|first=Roy J.|title=The breast/nipple/areola complex and human sexuality|journal=Sexual & Relationship Therapy|date=May 2006|volume=21|issue=2|pages=237–249[/tpl]
Though it now is almost universally prescribed, in some countries in the 1950s the practice of breastfeeding went through a period where it was out of vogue and the use of infant formula was considered superior to breast milk.  However, it is now universally recognized that there is no commercial formula that can equal breast milk. In addition to the appropriate amounts of carbohydrate, protein, and fat, breast milk provides vitamins, minerals, digestive enzymes,[tpl]cite pmid|21091243[/tpl] and hormones. Breast milk also contains antibodies and lymphocytes from the mother that help the baby resist infections.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1792611/ |title=Lymphocytes bearing the T cell receptor gamma delta in human breast milk |publisher=ncbi.nlm.nih.gov |date=1990-11-01 |accessdate=2012-12-01[/tpl] The immune function of breast milk is individualized, as the mother, through her touching and taking care of the baby, comes into contact with pathogens that colonize the baby, and, as a consequence, her body makes the appropriate antibodies and immune cells.The Newborn Immune System and Immunological Benefits of Breastmilk
Breast milk contains less iron than formula, because it is more bioavailable as lactoferrin, which carries more safety for mothers and children than ferrous sulphate.[tpl]cite pmid|24590680[/tpl] At around four to six months of age, the internal iron supplies of the infant, held in the hepatic cells of the liver, are exhausted, hence this is the time that complementary feeding is introduced.Breastfeeding Answers Made Simple - Breastfeeding Reporter - Do Breastfeeding Babies Need Extra Iron at 4 Months?First AAP recommendations on iron supplementation include directive on universal screening

==Production==

Under the influence of the hormones prolactin and oxytocin, women produce milk after childbirth to feed the baby.  The initial milk produced is referred to as colostrum, which is high in the immunoglobulin IgA, which coats the gastrointestinal tract.  This helps to protect the newborn until its own immune system is functioning properly. It also creates a mild laxative effect, expelling meconium and helping to prevent the build-up of bilirubin (a contributory factor in jaundice).
Actual inability to produce enough milk is rare, with studies showing that mothers from developing countries experiencing nutritional hardship still produce amounts of milk of similar quality to that of mothers in developed countries.Prentice, A.M., Paul, A., Prentice, A., Black, A., Cole, T., & Whitehead, R. (1986). Cross - cultural differences in lactational performance. In Maternal Environmental Factors in Human Lactation. Human Lactation 2, pp. 13 = 44 [Hamosh, M., & Goldman, A.S. (eds). New York: Plenum Press. There are many reasons a mother may not produce enough breast milk. Some of the most common reasons are an improper latch (i.e., the baby does not connect efficiently with the nipple), not nursing or pumping enough to meet supply, certain medications (including estrogen-containing hormonal contraceptives), illness, and dehydration.  A rarer reason is Sheehan's syndrome, also known as postpartum hypopituitarism, which is associated with prolactin deficiency: This syndrome may require hormone replacement.
The amount of milk produced depends on how often the mother is nursing and/or pumping; the more the mother nurses her baby, or pumps, the more milk is produced.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/breast-feeding/FL00120 |title=Breast-feeding: Pumping and maintaining your milk supply |publisher=MayoClinic.com |date=2010-03-13 |accessdate=2011-10-26[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.llli.org/FAQ/increase.html |title=How Can I Increase My Milk Supply? |publisher=LLLI |date=2011-06-21 |accessdate=2011-10-26[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.askdrsears.com/html/2/T022800.asp |title=Increasing Your Milk Supply | Ask Dr. Sears® |publisher=Askdrsears.com |date=2011-05-20 |accessdate=2011-10-26[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://parenting.ivillage.com/newborn/nbreastfeed/0,,456z,00.html |title=Breast milk: Increasing supply - iVillage |publisher=Parenting.ivillage.com |date=2010-01-01 |accessdate=2011-10-26[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.babies.sutterhealth.org/breastfeeding/bf_production.html |title=How Breast Milk is Produced |publisher=Babies.sutterhealth.org |accessdate=2011-10-26[/tpl] It is very helpful to nurse on demand - to nurse when the baby wants to nurse rather than on a schedule. If pumping, it is helpful to have an electric high-grade pump so that all of the milk ducts are stimulated. Some mothers try to increase their milk supply in other ways - by taking the herb fenugreek, used for hundreds of years to increase supply[tpl]cite web|url=http://pediatrics.about.com/library/breastfeeding/blbreastfeedingza.htm |title=Breastfeeding: Treatments for Problems II |publisher=Pediatrics.about.com |date=2010-06-17 |accessdate=2011-10-26[/tpl] ("Mother's Milk" teas contain fenugreek as well as other supply-increasing herbs); there are also prescription medications that can be used, such as Domperidone (off-label use) and Reglan, however the American Academy of Pediatrics considers Reglan a “drug whose effect on nursing infants is unknown but may be of concern."Low Milk Supply - Metoclopramide There are concerns over the use of Domperidone as well.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]

==Composition==

If nutrient supply is found lacking, content is obtained from the mother's bodily stores.  The exact composition of breast milk varies from day to day, depending on food consumption and environment, meaning that the ratio of water to fat fluctuates.
During the first few days after delivery, the mother produces colostrum. This is a thin yellowish fluid that is the same fluid that sometimes leaks from the breasts during pregnancy. It is rich in protein and antibodies that provide passive immunity to the baby (the baby's immune system is not fully developed at birth). Colostrum also helps the newborn's digestive system to grow and function properly.
Colostrum will gradually change to become mature milk.  In the first 3–4 days it will appear thin and watery and will taste very sweet; later, the milk will be thicker and creamier.  Human milk quenches the baby's thirst and hunger and provides the proteins, sugar, minerals, and antibodies that the baby needs.
In the 1980s and 1990s, lactation professionals (De Cleats) used to make a differentiation between foremilk and hindmilk.  But this differentiation causes confusion as there are not two types of milk.  Instead, as a baby breastfeeds, the fat content very gradually increases, with the milk becoming fattier and fattier over time.Mohrbacher, https://breastfeedingusa.org/content/article/worries-about-foremilk-and-hindmilk
The level of Immunoglobulin A (IgA) in breast milk remains high from day 10 until at least 7.5 months post-partum.Rechtman, DJ and Ferry, B. and Lee, ML and Chapel, H.  2002. International Journal of Infectious Diseases 6, pS58.
Human milk contains 0.8% to 0.9% protein, 4.5% fat, 7.1% carbohydrates, and 0.2% ash (minerals).Belitz, H Food Chemistry, 4th Edition, p.501 table 10.5 Carbohydrates are mainly lactose; several lactose-based oligosaccharides have been identified as minor components.
The fat fraction contains specific triglycerides of palmitic and oleic acid (O-P-O triglycerides), and also lipids with trans bonds (see: trans fat). The lipids are vaccenic acid, and Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) accounting for up to 6% of the human milk fat.Precht, D and J.Molkentin C18:1, C18:2, and C8:3 trans and cis fatty acid isomers including conjugated cis delta 9, trans delta 11 linoleic acid (CLA) as well as total fat composition of German human milk lipids, Nahrung 1999 43(4) 233-244Friesen, R, and S.M. Innis, Trans Fatty acids in Human milk in Canada declined with the introduction of trans fat food labeling, J. Nut 2006, 136 2558-2561
The principal proteins are alpha-lactalbumin, lactoferrin (apo-lactoferrin), IgA, lysozyme, and serum albumin. In an acidic environment such as the stomach, alpha-lactalbumin unfolds into a different form and binds oleic acid to form a complex called HAMLET that kills tumor cells. This is thought to contribute to the protection of breastfed babies against cancer.[ref]

Non-protein nitrogen-containing compounds, making up 25% of the milk's nitrogen, include urea, uric acid, creatine, creatinine, amino acids, and nucleotides.[tpl]cite journal| author=Jenness R| title=The composition of human milk|date=July 1979| journal=Seminars in Perinatology| volume=3| issue=3| pages=225–239| pmid=392766[/tpl][tpl]cite journal| author=Thorell L|author2=Sjöberg LB|author3=Hernell O| title=Nucleotides in human milk: sources and metabolism by the newborn infant|date=December 1996| journal=Pediatric Research| volume=40| issue=6| pages=845–852| pmid=8947961| doi=10.1203/00006450-199612000-00012[/tpl]  Breast milk has circadian variations; some of the nucleotides are more commonly produced during the night, others during the day.[ref]

Mother's milk has been shown to supply a type of endocannabinoid (the natural neurotransmitters that marijuana simulates), 2-Arachidonoyl glycerol.[ref]

At one time it was thought that breast milk was sterile, however it is now known that it contains as many as 600 different species of various bacteria, including beneficial Bifidobacterium breve, B. adolescentis, B. longum, B. bifidum, and B. dentium.[ref]
