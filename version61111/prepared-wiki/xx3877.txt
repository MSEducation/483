The Hawar Islands ([tpl]lang-ar|جزر حوار[/tpl]; transliterated: Juzur Ḩawār) is an archipelago of desert islands owned by Bahrain.  They are situated off the west coast of Qatar in the Gulf of Bahrain of the Persian Gulf.

==Description==

Despite their proximity to Qatar (they are only about [tpl]convert|1|nmi|km[/tpl] from the Qatari mainland whilst being about [tpl]convert|10|nmi|km[/tpl] from the main islands of Bahrain),[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4EOcBE6VIikC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=International Maritime Boundaries~: Vol. IV |work=American Society of International Law |date=2002 |isbn=904111954X |page=2844[/tpl] the islands belong to Bahrain, having been a part of a dispute between Bahrain and Qatar which was resolved in 2001.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/87/7027.pdf |title=Case Concerning Maritime Delimitation and Territorial Questions between Qatar and Bahrain |work=ICJ |date=16 March 2001 |page=81[/tpl] The islands were formerly coincident with municipality or Minţaqat Juzur Ḩawār (مِنْطَقَة جُزُر حَوَار) and are now administered as part of the Southern Governorate of Bahrain. The land area of the islands is approximately 52 km².[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.hawar-islands.com/iucn_evaluation.html |title=IUCN Evaluation of Nominations of Natural and Mixed Properties to the World Heritage List |work=Hawar-Islands.com |date=2004[/tpl]
The islands were listed as a Ramsar site in 1997.[tpl]cite book |url=http://www.adias-uae.com/publications/Hawar-MP.pdf |title=Hawar Islands Protected Area: Management Plan |date=January 2003[/tpl]  In 2002, the Bahraini government applied to have the islands recognised as a World Heritage Site due to their unique environment and habitat for endangered species;[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.hawar-islands.com/Hawar_application.htm |title=Nomination file: The Hawar Archipelago |work=Government of Bahrain |date=11 June 2002[/tpl] the application was ultimately unsuccessful.  This site is home to many bird species, notably Socotra Cormorants. There are small herds of Arabian oryx and  Sand gazelle on Hawar island and the seas around support a large population of Dugong.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ramsar.org/pdf/regional-initiatives/UAE_Workshop_Files_May2011/Fujairah_Workshop_May2011/All%20PDF%20documents%20Fujaira/BAHRAIN.pdf |title=Bahrain |work=Ramsar Convention |page=12[/tpl]
Although there are 36 islands in the group, many of the smaller islands are little more than sand or shingle accumulations on areas of exposed bedrock moulded by the ongoing processes of sedimentation and accretion. The WHS application named 8 major islands (see table below), which conforms to the description of the islands when first surveyed as consisting of 8 or 9 islands.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/87/5483.pdf |title=Case concerning Maritime Delimitation and Territorial Questions between Qatar and Bahrain |work=ICJ |date=13 June 2000 |page=12[/tpl] It has often been described as an archipelago of 16 islands.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/87/5479.pdf |title=Case Concerning Maritime Delimitation and Territorial Questions between Qatar and Bahrain |work=ICJ |date=9 June 200 |page=28[/tpl]  Janan island, to the south of Hawar island, is not legally considered to be a part of the group and is owned by Qatar.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/87/7027.pdf |title=Case Concerning Maritime Delimitation and Territorial Questions between Qatar and Bahrain |work=ICJ |date=16 March 2001 |page=54[/tpl]
The islands used to be one of the settlements of the Bahraini branch of the Dawasir who settled there in the early 19th century.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/87/7027.pdf |title=Case Concerning Maritime Delimitation and Territorial Questions between Qatar and Bahrain |work=ICJ |date=16 March 2001 |page=44[/tpl] The islands were first surveyed in 1820, when they were called the Warden’s Islands, and two villages were recorded.  They are now uninhabited, other than a police garrison and a hotel on the main island; access to all but Hawar island itself is severely restricted.  Local fishermen are allowed to fish in adjacent waters and there is some recreational fishing and tourism on and around the islands.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ramsar.org/pdf/regional-initiatives/UAE_Workshop_Files_May2011/Fujairah_Workshop_May2011/All%20PDF%20documents%20Fujaira/BAHRAIN.pdf |title=Bahrain |work=Ramsar Convention |page=11[/tpl] Fresh water has always been scarce; historically it was obtained by surface collection and even today, with the desalinisation plant, additional supplies have to be brought in.

==List of islands==

===Hawar archipelago===

By far the largest island is Hawar, which accounts for more than 41 km² of the 52 km² land area. Following in size are Suwād al Janūbīyah, Suwād ash Shamālīyah, Rubud Al Sharqiyah, Rubud Al Gharbiyah and Muhazwarah (Umm Hazwarah).
The following were not considered as part of the Hawar islands in the ICJ judgment, being located between Hawar and the Bahrain Islands and not disputed by Qatar, but have been included in the Hawar archipelago by the Bahrain government as part of the 2002 World Heritage Site application.[tpl]cite book |url=http://www.adias-uae.com/publications/Hawar-MP.pdf |title=Hawar Islands Protected Area: Management Plan |date=January 2003 |page=10 (map)[/tpl]

===Janan island===

Janan island, a small island south of Hawar island, was also considered in the 2001 ICJ judgment.  Based on a previous agreement when both Qatar and Bahrain were under British protection, it was judged to be separate from the Hawar islands and so considered by the court separately. It was awarded to Qatar.
