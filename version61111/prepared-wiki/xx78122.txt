[[Flag of Ecuador]]

CATEGORIES: National symbols of Ecuador, National flags, Flags of Ecuador

The flag of Ecuador, which consists of horizontal bands of yellow (double width), blue and red, was first adopted on 1835 and later on September 26, 1860. The design of the current flag was finalized in 1900 with the addition of the coat of arms in the center of the flag. Before using the yellow, blue and red tricolor, Ecuador used white and blue flags that contained stars for each province of the country. The design of the flag is very similar to that of Colombia and Venezuela, which are also former constituent territories of Gran Colombia. All three are based on a proposal by Venezuelan General Francisco de Miranda, which was adopted by Venezuela in 1811 and later Gran Colombia with some modifications. There is a variant of the flag that does not contain the coat of arms that is used by the merchant marine. This flag matches Colombia's in every aspect, but Colombia uses a different design when her merchant marine ships are at sail.

==Design==

The Ecuadorian National Secretariat of Communication (Secretaría Nacional de Comunicación) issued regulations describing the applications and proportions of the national flag, coat of arms, and other national symbols in November 2009.
The national flag has a length of 2.20 meters and a width of 1.47 m, a ratio of 2 by 3. The field is split into three horizontal colored bands, a yellow band of one-half the flag's width, a blue band of one-quarter the width, and a red band of one-quarter the width. All three bands extend the full length of the flag. The flag is charged with the Ecuadorian coat of arms, one-half the width of the flag and one half its height, centered in the field.[tpl]Harvnb|Instructivo de uso de los Símbolos Patrios[/tpl] The coat of arms itself is constructed in a rectangle with proportions 12 by 10. The national standard has the same design as the national flag, but is square, with length 0.9 m and width 0.9 m.[tpl]Harvnb|Norma Que Establece Los Requisitos de Diseno, Caracteristicas de Confeccion y Modo de Empleo de Los Emblemas Patrios|pp=Annex A.[/tpl] When used by military units and organizations, lettering can encircle the coat of arms with a diameter of 55 centimeters. The lettering must be 4 cm in height, 3 cm in width, gold-colored Roman font, embroidered with gold thread. The only other regulated size is a table flag (banderola) where the flag is 200 mm wide and 300 mm long. When manufacturing the national flag, sellers to the public must include the name of their company, along with the year of manufacture, by placing a 20x10 mm tag on the reverse side of the flag on the sleeve.[tpl]Harvnb|Norma Que Establece Los Requisitos de Diseno, Caracteristicas de Confeccion y Modo de Empleo de Los Emblemas Patrios|pp=6.1[/tpl]

===Coat of arms===

In the background of the oval shield is the mountain Chimborazo, while the river originating from its base represents the Guayas. Chimborazo is also the highest mountain in Ecuador and is part of the Andes Range. The steamboat on the river is named Guayas as well. The ship was built in Guayaquil and was the first seaworthy steamship built in both Ecuador and in all of South America. It was first put into service on October 9, 1841. The ship has the features of a Caduceus representing trade and economy. This kind of mast has two wings surrounding a pole with two snakes encircling it.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.ecuador.org/nuevosite/informacionecuador_escudo_e.php | title = The Flag and The Coat of Arms | accessdate = 2010-07-27 | publisher = Embassy of the Republic of Ecuador in the United States[/tpl] On top a golden sun surrounded by the Zodiac astrological signs for Aries, Taurus, Gemini and Cancer representing the months March to July to symbolize the duration of the March Revolution of 1845 that ousted General Juan José Flores.
The condor on top of the shield stretches his wings to symbolize power, greatness and strength of Ecuador. The condor also represents the idea that it will always be ready to attack any enemy. The shield is flanked by four national flags. The laurel on the left represents the victories of the republic.Other descriptions attribute it to the symbolism of the glory of the heroes of independence. The palm leaf on the right side is a symbol of the martyrs of the fight for independence and liberty. The Fasces below the shield represents the republican dignity. The final design of the coat of arms was completed in 1900.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.presidencia.gov.ec/ecuador/simbolos-patrios | title = Símbolos Patrios | accessdate = 2010-07-27 | publisher = Presidencia de la República del Ecuador | language = [tpl]es icon[/tpl][/tpl]
In the 1989 specifications issued to the Ecuadorian Military, the coat of arms has only eight colors that are used on the flag. The eight colors are yellow, blue, red (all from the national flag), sky blue, green, grey, silver and gold.[tpl]Harvnb|Norma Que Establece Los Requisitos de Diseno, Caracteristicas de Confeccion y Modo de Empleo de Los Emblemas Patrios|pp=Annex E.[/tpl] There is also a nine piece instruction on how to draw the coat of arms,[tpl]Harvnb|Norma Que Establece Los Requisitos de Diseno, Caracteristicas de Confeccion y Modo de Empleo de Los Emblemas Patrios|pp=Annex C.[/tpl] followed by a full color drawing and a black and white drawing of the arms.[tpl]Harvnb|Norma Que Establece Los Requisitos de Diseno, Caracteristicas de Confeccion y Modo de Empleo de Los Emblemas Patrios|pp=Annex D.[/tpl] No size specifications have been laid out for the coat of arms except for when it is used on the national flag.

===Symbolism===

Miranda ascribed the colours he chose for his flag to Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's theory of primary colours. In a letter written to Count Semyon Romanovich Vorontsov in 1792, Miranda described a late-night conversation which he had with Goethe at a party in Weimar, Germany during the winter of 1785. Fascinated with Miranda's account of his exploits in the American Revolutionary War and his travels throughout the Americas and Europe, Goethe told him that, "Your destiny is to create in your land a place where primary colours are not distorted.” He proceeded to clarify what he meant:
The first time the yellow, blue and red flag was flown by Miranda was in 1806 on the ship Leander when trying to face the Spanish forces off of the coast of Haiti.[tpl]cite web | url = http://minci.gob.ve/reportajes/2/5534/la_bandera_nacional.html | title = La Bandera Nacional | accessdate = 2010-08-02 | last = Isabel Cerón | first = María | date = 2005-03-12 | publisher = Ministerio del Poder Popular para la Comunicación y la Información (Venezuela) | language = [tpl]es icon[/tpl][/tpl] The colors of the modern Ecuadorian flag evolved from those of the flag of the nation of Gran Colombia, which encompassed the territories of modern-day Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela. The colors have the following meanings:

==History==

After the territory of Ecuador was conquered by Sebastián de Benalcázar, the emblems of the Spanish Empire flew over the newly founded city of Quito.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.diariocorreo.com.ec/archivo/2007/09/26/historia-de-nuestra-bandera  | title = Historia de nuestra bandera | accessdate = 2010-07-28 | last = Alfredo Andaluz Prado | first = José | date = 2007-09-26 | work = Diario Correo | language = [tpl]es icon[/tpl] |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080822052558/http://www.diariocorreo.com.ec/archivo/2007/09/26/historia-de-nuestra-bandera |archivedate = 2008-08-22[/tpl]
The first calls for independence from the Spanish crown came on August 10, 1809; a plain red flag was flown by the rebels.[tpl]Harvnb|MDN Regulations|2006|pp=28.[/tpl] The independence movement was defeated in November 1812 at the hands of Spanish officer Juan Sámano. On October 9, 1820, a new flag, a blue and white bicolour, with five horizontal alternating stripes, and three white stars in the middle stripe, was raised for the first time. The three stars represent Guayaquil, Portoviejo and Machala. This flag was later adopted by the Guayas Province.
Gabriel García Moreno, upon assuming power two days after the Battle of Guayaquil in September 1860, the yellow, blue and red triband was returned to use; its reinstatement on September 26 is commemorated during Ecuador's national flag day.[tpl]cite news | title = El Ecuador celebra el Día de la Bandera | date = 2008-09-26 | url = http://www.hoy.com.ec/noticias-ecuador/tricolor-celebra-108-anos-307849.html | work = HOY.com.ec | accessdate = 2010-07-28 | language = [tpl]es icon[/tpl][/tpl] Previously, a vertical white, blue and white flag was used. In the middle of the blue stripe, there were white stars placed to signify the number of provinces in Ecuador. The highest star total was seven before this flag was abandoned. In 1900, the flag was made the definitive national standard, and was charged with the coat of arms for official national government use while the plain flag was reserved for the merchant marine.Decree of December 5, 1900

==Pledge and hymn==

Students and military cadets in Ecuador are required to recite a pledge to the flag, known as the "Juramento a la Bandera" or "Pledge to the Flag." This pledge is usually stated during national holiday or important school functions, such as graduations.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.midena.gov.ec/sitios_wrapper/fuerzas_armadas/tradiciones/tradicionesmilitaresjuramento.htm | title = Tradiciones Militares — Juramento a la Bandera | accessdate = 2010-07-28 | publisher = Ministry of National Defense of Ecuador | language = [tpl]es icon[/tpl] | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20100615060024/http://www.midena.gov.ec/sitios_wrapper/fuerzas_armadas/tradiciones/tradicionesmilitaresjuramento.htm  | archivedate = 2010-06-15[/tpl] There is also a patriotic song called the "Himno a la Bandera" ("Hymn to the Flag") that is after the "Juramento a la Bandera" or before flag retirement ceremonies.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.midena.gov.ec/sitios_wrapper/fuerzas_armadas/tradiciones/tradicionesmilitaresbandera.htm | title = Tradiciones Militares — Incineración de la Bandera | accessdate = 2010-07-28 | publisher = Ministry of National Defense of Ecuador | language = [tpl]es icon[/tpl][/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

==Variants==

According to [tpl]lang|es|Registro Oficial[/tpl] No. 1272, a decree signed into law on December 5, 1900, there are two official designs of the national flag. Article Two established the national banner as the tricolor with the yellow stripe doubling the size of the blue and red stripes. Article Three establishes the national flag charged with the coat of arms and is directed to be used by the military, government offices and diplomatic agents outside of Ecuador. While this law establishes the flag with the coat of arms as the state flag, it did not forbid the civilian population from using the flag. The only restriction is stated in Article Six where the merchant marine is restricted to using the flag without the coat of arms. Because of this, this has been construed to be the civil flag as it was practiced in other South American countries, such as Peru, Bolivia and Argentina. Unlike Ecuador, several of these South American countries forbade the civilian population from using the national flag with the coat of arms or, in the case of Argentina until 1985, the national flag charged with the Sun of May in the middle.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.santotome.gov.ar/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=61&Itemid=61 | title = Ceremonial de la Bandera | accessdate = 2010-07-24 | year = 2009 | publisher = City of Santo Tome | language = [tpl]es icon[/tpl][/tpl] Peru and Bolivia still restricts the usage of the state flag to just the government bodies and institutions and reserves the plain flags for national celebrations or as directed by law.D.L. 11323 del 31 de Marzo de 1950[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.mindef.gov.bo/mindef/node/165 | title = Bandera Nacional | accessdate = 2010-07-24 | publisher = Ministry of Defense of Bolivia | language = [tpl]es icon[/tpl][/tpl] However, in practice the flag with the coat of arms is often used in place of the plain flag, especially when it is important to distinguish the latter from the flag of Colombia. In the case when Colombian merchant marine ships are at sea, the Colombian national flag is charged with a red and blue oval with a white star in the center.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.vicepresidencia.gov.co/asiescolombia/bandera.html | title = Historia de la Bandera | accessdate = 2010-07-25 | year = 2008 | publisher = Vice President of the Republic of Colombia | language = [tpl]es icon[/tpl][/tpl] For city governments, Article 4 in the 1900 decree forbids them from using the national flag with the coat of arms. A special flag was created for the city governments to use; it is a plain national flag charged with white stars that are placed in a circle pattern. The number of white stars will correspond to the number of provinces in Ecuador. However, this flag is identical to Venezuela's flag from 1905 until 1930, and similar to Venezuela's current flag (the stars are now in a semi circle pattern).[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.gobiernoenlinea.gob.ve/venezuela/perfil_evolucion_bandera.html | title = Evolución Histórica de la Bandera Nacional | accessdate = 2010-07-24 | year = 2006 | publisher = President of the Bolivar Republic of Venezuela | language = [tpl]es icon[/tpl][/tpl]

==Derivatives==

Palestina Canton uses the national flag on their flag. Placed in the canton, the Ecuador flag is shown with three even stripes, while the rest of the flag is colored olive green. The use of the Ecuador flag was described by the Palestina government as "unity with the motherland" and olive green represents progress.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.municipiopalestina.gov.ec/site/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=13&Itemid=41&lang= | title = Símbolos | accessdate = 2010-07-26 | date = 2005-10-27 | publisher = Canton of Palestina | language = [tpl]es icon[/tpl][/tpl] Loja Province adopted a flag in 1963 that copied the design of the national flag. This was done by the creator of the flag to show his "honor and admiration" to the homeland.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.lojaturistico.com/?q=node/35 | title = Bandera | accessdate = 2010-07-26 | publisher = Tourism Loja | language = [tpl]es icon[/tpl][/tpl] Another province, Napo, chose their flag that copied the design of the national flag without the coat of arms.

==Resemblance to other flags==

The flags of Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela, can all trace their roots to the flag of the nation of Gran Colombia (1819–1830), the short-lived republic that encompassed the territories of all three. The Gran Colombian flag in turn was inspired by the flag of the First Republic of Venezuela, the first independent government of that nation. The flag of the Venezuelan Republic was modeled on the one created earlier by General Francisco de Miranda during his attempts to gain Venezuelan independence and which first flew over the port of La Vela in Santa Ana de Coro, Venezuela, in 1806.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.banrep.gov.co/blaavirtual/revistas/credencial/julio2001/labande.htm | title = LA BANDERA COLOMBIANA | accessdate = 2010-07-27 | last = Rodríguez | first = Roberto | date = July 2001 | work = Credencial Historia | publisher = Biblioteca Virtual del Banco de la República | language = [tpl]es icon[/tpl][/tpl]
As of 2006, the Ecuadoran flag still shares some similarity with the flags of Colombia and Venezuela. All three flags use the yellow, blue and red tricolor, but that is where the similarities end. In a decree passed in Colombia in 1934, the ratio of the stripes were set at 2:1:1 and the flag ratio was set at 2:3, similar to the present Ecuador flag. However, the coat of arms is only charged in the middle of the flag when it is used by government officials or by military forces.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.presidencia.gov.co/prensa_new/historia/bandera2.htm | title = HISTORIA DE LA BANDERA | accessdate = 2010-07-24 | year = 2006 | publisher = President of the Republic of Colombia | language = [tpl]es icon[/tpl][/tpl] For Venezuela, the basic design was to have all three strips even vertically, unlike those of Colombia and Ecuador. Since 1863, Venezuela decided to charge their flag with white stars instead of a coat of arms. A coat of arms was not added to the national flag 1954, then changed again in 2006 to add another star and alter the coat of arms. The position of the coat of arms on the Venezuelan flag also differs from Ecuador and Colombia by placing the arms at the very top hoist (left) side of the flag instead of in the center.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.gobiernoenlinea.gob.ve/venezuela/perfil_evolucion_bandera.html | title = Evolución Histórica de la Bandera Nacional | accessdate = 2010-07-24 | year = 2006 | publisher = President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela | language = [tpl]es icon[/tpl][/tpl]
