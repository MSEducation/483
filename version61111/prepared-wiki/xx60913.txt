Vincent Jen Chin[tpl]cite court|litigants=Henry Yee and the Estate of Vincent Chin (deceased) vs. Ronald Ebens, Michael Nitz, and Fancy Pants lounge  |vol=83-309788 CZ  |court=Mich 3rd Cir  |year=1983[/tpl] ([tpl]zh|t=[tpl]linktext|陳|果|仁[/tpl]|s=[tpl]linktext|陈|果|仁[/tpl]|p=Chén Guǒrén[/tpl]; May 18, 1955 – June 23, 1982) was a Chinese American severely beaten in the enclave of Highland Park in the Greater Detroit area of Michigan state, in the United States, that led to his death in June 1982.
The perpetrators were Chrysler plant superintendent Ronald Ebens and his stepson, Michael Nitz. The lenient sentencing of these two men in a plea bargain generated public outrage over the murder attack, which included blows to the head from a baseball bat and possessed attributes consistent with hate crimes. Many of the layoffs in Detroit's auto industry, including Nitz's in 1979, had been due to the increasing market share of Japanese automakers, leading to allegations that Vincent Chin received racially charged comments attributing to the layoffs while being beaten.
The case became a rallying point for the Asian American community, and Ebens and Nitz were put on trial for violating Chin's civil rights. Because the subsequent Federal prosecution was a result of public pressure from a coalition of many Asian ethnic organizations, Vincent Chin's murder is often considered the beginning of a pan-ethnic Asian American movement.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.asianweek.com/061397/feature.html |author=Alethea Yip|publisher=Asian Week |title=Remembering Vincent Chin |accessdate=2007-03-14[/tpl]

==Early life==

Born in Guangdong province, China, in 1955, Vincent Chin was the only child of Bing Hing Chin ([tpl]zh|t=陳炳興|s=陈炳兴|p=Chén Bǐngxīng[/tpl]; a.k.a. C.W. Hing) and Lily Chin ([tpl]zh|t=陳余瓊芳|s=陈余琼芳|p=Chén Yú Qióngfāng[/tpl]). His father earned the right to bring a Chinese bride into the United States through his service in World War II. After Lily suffered a miscarriage in 1949, the couple adopted Vincent from a Chinese orphanage in 1961.
Throughout most of the 1960s, Vincent grew up along Woodward Avenue in Highland Park. In 1971, after the elderly Hing was mugged, the family moved out to Oak Park, Michigan. Vincent graduated from Oak Park High School in 1973, going on to study at Control Data Institute. At the time of his death, he was employed as an industrial draftsman at Efficient Engineering, an automotive supplier, as well as working weekends as a waiter at the former Golden Star restaurant in Ferndale, Michigan. He was engaged, and the wedding date set for June 27, 1982.[tpl]cite book|title=Asian American Dreams|author=Helen Zia|publisher=Farrar, Straus & Giroux|isbn=0-374-14774-4|year=2000[/tpl]

==Homicide==

On the night of June 19, 1982, a fight ensued at the Fancy Pants strip club on Woodward Avenue in Highland Park where Chin was having his bachelor party.  The group was thrown out and after a heated exchange of words subsequently parted ways.  Ebens allegedly instigated the incident by declaring, "It's because of you little motherfuckers that we're out of work!" referring to U.S. auto manufacturing jobs being lost to Japan, despite the fact that Chin was not Japanese.
Chin taunted Ebens to keep fighting after they were all thrown out.http://www.huffingtonpost.com/emil-guillermo/ronald-ebens-vincent-chin-murder_b_1632427.html  Ebens and Nitz searched the neighborhood for 20 to 30 minutes and even paid another man 20 dollars to help look for Chin,Bedi, Sheila (2003).

Chin was struck at least four times with the bat, including blows to the head. When rushed to Henry Ford Hospital, he was unconscious and died after four days in a coma on June 23, 1982.

==Legal history==

===State criminal charges===

Ronald Ebens was arrested and taken into custody at the scene of the murder by two off-duty police officers who had witnessed the beating.[tpl]Cite news|last=Weingarten|first=Paul|title=Deadly Encounter|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date =July 31, 1983|postscript=[/tpl]  Ebens and Nitz were convicted in a county court for manslaughter by Wayne County Circuit Judge Charles Kaufman, after a plea bargain brought the charges down from second-degree murder. They served no jail time, were given three years probation, fined $3,000 and ordered to pay $780 in court costs. In a response letter to protests from American Citizens for Justice, Kaufman said, "These weren't the kind of men you send to jail... You don't make the punishment fit the crime; you make the punishment fit the criminal."

===Federal civil rights charges===

The verdict angered the Asian American community in the Detroit area and around the country.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.asian-nation.org/racism.shtml|author=C.N. Le|publisher=Asian-Nation|title=Asian-Nation: Anti-Asian Racism|accessdate=2007-03-14[/tpl]  Journalist Helen Zia and lawyer Liza Chan ([tpl]zh|t=陳綽薇|s=陈绰薇|p=Chén Chuòwēi|first=t[/tpl]) led the fight for federal charges, which resulted in the men being accused of two counts of violating Chin's civil rights, under section 245 of title 18 of the United States Code. For these charges, it was not enough that Ebens had injured Chin, but that "a substantial motivating factor for the defendant's actions was Mr. Chin's race, color, or national origin, and because Mr. Chin had been enjoying a place of entertainment which serves the public." Defendant's Requested Jury Instruction No. 30, U.S. v. Ebens Because of possible mitigating factors that could lead to reasonable doubt, such as intoxication leading to the defendant's inability to form the specific intent,Defendant's Requested Jury Instruction No. 18, U.S. v. Ebens the prosecution's proving the evidence of uttered racial slurs were not self-sufficient for conviction.Defendant's Requested Jury Instruction No. 31, U.S. v. Ebens In addition, the defense found Racine Colwell, the witness who overheard the "It's because of you motherfuckers we're out of work" remark, to have received some clemency on a jail sentence for a prostitution charge, which suggested that the government may have tried to cut a deal for her testimony.U.S. vs. Ebens transcript, Tuesday, June 19, 1984, p.209-211
The 1984 federal civil rights case against the men found Ebens guilty of the second count and sentenced him to 25 years in prison; Nitz was acquitted of both counts. After an appeal, Ebens' conviction was overturned in 1986—a federal appeals court found an attorney improperly coached prosecution witnesses.[tpl]cite court|litigants=US. v. Ebens|vol=800|reporter=F.2d |opinion=1422|court=U.S. App. 6th Cir.|year=1986[/tpl]
After a retrial that was moved to Cincinnati, Ohio due to the publicity the case had received in Detroit, a jury cleared Ebens of all charges in 1987.[tpl]cite court|litigants=US. v. Ebens|vol=654|reporter=F. Supp.|opinion=144|court=E.D. Mich.|year=1987[/tpl]

===Civil suits===

A civil suit for the unlawful death of Vincent Chin was settled out of court on March 23, 1987. Michael Nitz was ordered to pay $50,000 in $30 weekly installments over the following 10 years. Ronald Ebens was ordered to pay $1.5 million, at $200/month for the first two years and 25% of his income or $200/month thereafter, whichever was greater. This represented the projected loss of income from Vincent Chin's engineering position, as well as Lily Chin's loss of Vincent's services as laborer and driver. However, the estate of Vincent Chin would not be allowed to garnish social security, disability, or Ebens' pension from Chrysler, nor could the estate place a lien on Ebens' house.
In November 1989, Ebens was forced to reappear in court for a creditor's hearing, where he detailed his finances and reportedly pledged to make good on his debt to the Chin estate.[tpl]Cite news | last=Finkelstein  | first=Jim | title=The Man Convicted In Chin Case Pledges To Make Good On Debt | newspaper=Detroit Free Press  |pages=1B | date=November 30, 1989 | postscript=[/tpl] However, in 1997,[tpl]cite court|litigants=Paul Dufault, Temporary Person Representative of the Estate of Vincent Jen Chin, Deceased, vs. Ronald M. Ebens  |vol=97-727321-CZ  |court=Mich 3rd Cir  |year=1997[/tpl] the Chin estate was forced to renew the civil suit, as it was allowed to do every ten years. With accrued interest and other charges, the adjusted total became $4,683,653.89.

==Aftermath==

Chin was interred at Detroit's Forest Lawn Cemetery.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl]
Sometime after the murder, the Fancy Pants strip club closed, and was subsequently torn down.13300 Woodward, Detroit Cross-Index Directory 1984, 1987
In September 1987, Chin's mother, Lily Chin, moved from Oak Park back to her hometown of Guangzhou, China, to avoid being reminded of the tragedy. She returned to the United States for medical treatment in late 2001, and died on June 9, 2002. Prior to her death, Lily Chin had established a scholarship in Vincent's memory, to be administered by American Citizens for Justice.[tpl]cite web|url=http://iis.stat.wright.edu/AAC-Dayton/news_reported/memorial_LilyChin.htm |publisher=Organization of Chinese Americans |title=OCA Mourns Death of Lily Chin |accessdate=2007-03-14[/tpl]

==Legacy==

The attack was considered by many a hate crime,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tolerance.org/news/article_hate.jsp?id=552|author=William Wei|title=An American Hate Crime: The Murder of Vincent Chin|publisher=Tolerance.org|date=2002-06-14|accessdate=2007-03-14[/tpl] but pre-dated hate crime laws in the United States.  Nevertheless, during a 1998 House of Representatives hearing on the Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 1997, Congressman John Conyers, Jr. suggested that the problem in making people sufficiently aware of the causes for and injustices of the Vincent Chin case was that it was a political "hot potato" that did not get picked up for "political reasons" with respect to the automobile industry.[tpl]cite web|url=http://commdocs.house.gov/committees/judiciary/hju57839.000/hju57839_0.HTM |publisher= U.S. Government Printing Office |author=United States House of Representatives |title=Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 1997.

Chin's case has been cited by some Asian Americans to support the idea that they are seen as not fully citizens or "perpetual foreigners" compared to "real" Americans.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.modelminority.com/article676.html|author=Frank H.

What kind of justice? This happened because my son is Chinese. If two Chinese killed a white person, they must go to jail, maybe for their whole lives...
