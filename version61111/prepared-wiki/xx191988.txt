[[NER Class 3CC]]

The NER Class 3CC (LNER Class D19) was a 4-4-0 steam locomotive designed by Wilson Worsdell for the North Eastern Railway and built in 1893.  Only one was built (number 1619) and it was a compound expansion version of the simple expansion NER Class M1.  The 3CC was originally classified M but was re-classified 3CC in 1914, at the same time as the M1 was re-classified M.

==Overview==

Number 1619 was built as a Worsdell-von Borries compound with two inside cylinders.  In 1898, it was rebuilt as a three-cylinder compound with one inside high-pressure cylinder and two outside low-pressure cylinders, as a test-bed for the development of Walter Mackersie Smith's ideas.

==Classification==

Aside from its compound expansion, the 3CC was similar to several other NER classes and they are summarised here:

==Legacy==

Number 1619 was a one-off but W. M. Smith went on to develop a four-cylinder compound system in the NER Class 4CC (LNER Class C8) 4-4-2 locomotive.  Number 1619 was withdrawn in 1930 and was not preserved.
Smith's three-cylinder compound system was also used in the Great Central Railway classes 8D and 8E (LNER Class C5) 4-4-2s and achieved its greatest success in the Midland Railway 1000 Class and the LMS Compound 4-4-0. The Great Northern Railway (Ireland)'s class V was also a Smith compound.
