[[Massachusetts Route 1A]]

CATEGORIES: Numbered routes in Massachusetts, U.S. Route 1

Route 1A is a southâ€“north state highway in Massachusetts. It is an alternate route to U.S. 1 with three signed sections and two unsigned sections where the highway is concurrent with its parent. Due to the reconfiguration of tunnel interchanges brought on by the completion of the Big Dig, Route 1A is discontinuous in the downtown Boston area. Vehicles entering Downtown Boston via the Sumner Tunnel must take I-93 north to the exit for Government Center and make a U-turn to access the entrance ramp to I-93 south (which silently carries Route 1A south as well) and vice versa.Executive Office of Transportation - Office of Transportation Planning Roads - June 2008 The older tunnels to and from East Boston have interchanges with I-93 and surface roads north of the point at which unsigned Route 1A "exits" Route 1 in downtown Boston. Unsigned Route 1A along the Fitzgerald Expressway does not directly connect to those tunnels; a direct connection requires using I-90 and the newer Ted Williams Tunnel, which is not concurrent with Route 1A at any point.

==Route description==

===Attleboro===

A short segment of Route 1A, [tpl]convert|1.8|mi|km[/tpl] in length, in Attleboro runs from U.S. Route 1A at the Rhode Island border through a junction with Interstate 95, before heading north and merging with Route 1.  The entire length of this segment is known as Newport Avenue.

===North Attleborough to Dedham===

This segment of Route 1A extends roughly north from North Attleborough to Dedham, passing through the towns of Plainville, Wrentham, Norfolk, Walpole, Norwood and Westwood on the way.  Prior to its realignment along I-95 and I-93, Route 1 continued north along the Providence Highway towards Boston at the junction of Route 1A and that road.

===Boston to Salisbury===

This segment of Route 1A extends from Boston, Massachusetts to Salisbury, Massachusetts.
The highway starts from US 1 (which is on the Central Artery with I-93 and Route 3) at the former Government Center/Logan Airport interchange. It passes through the Callahan Tunnel (outbound/northbound, no toll) and Sumner Tunnel (inbound/southbound, toll), becoming the East Boston Expressway past Logan Airport.  The East Boston Expressway was the first freeway built in the city. Immediately beyond Logan Airport, Interstate 90 ends at Route 1A.
The road continues as a divided highway through Revere.  It is a limited access highway through Revere, passing Suffolk Downs and the Wonderland Greyhound Park (which is across the street from the outer terminus of the MBTA's Blue Line), before running through the isolated Point of Pines neighborhood and exiting Revere over the General Edwards Bridge into Lynn.  For the first mile and a half in Lynn, it is concurrent with the Lynnway, and is a high-traffic retail area. After the Lynnway portion, the route becomes concurrent with Route 129 for a mile, before crossing into Swampscott as Paradise Road.  At Vinnin Square, it passes into Salem as Loring Avenue, passing by Salem State University. The route turns left onto Lafayette Street and is concurrent with Route 114. At the intersection with Derby Street, notable for the large fire station, the route turns right. At the next stop sign, the route turns left onto Hawthorne Boulevard passing Salem Common and the Salem Witch Museum before turning left onto Winter Street. At the end of Winter Street, the route turns right onto Bridge Street crossing the Veterans Memorial Bridge into Beverly.  It follows two of the main streets of downtown Beverly, before heading north, passing through Wenham and Hamilton (through this section the road is occasionally signed as a US Route) before becoming the main road through the town of Ipswich, crossing the historic Choate Bridge over the Ipswich River.  While in Ipswich, much of the route runs concurrently with Route 133 until just over the town line into Rowley.  It passes through the main village of Rowley, as well as the central villages of Newbury.  In Newburyport, Massachusetts, it merges with Route 1, signed with its parent highway over the Merrimack River and into the town center of Salisbury. It then heads east from the Salisbury town center before turning north and ending in Salisbury Beach at the New Hampshire border.  New Hampshire Route 1A continues north from this point.
