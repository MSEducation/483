The Centre for Research and Information on Canada is an organization established in 1996 by the Canadian Unity Council to manage its research and communications activities.
The organization is divided in two branches, one destined to research on Canada (CRIC Research) and the other destined to inform Canadian citizens of the research's findings (CRIC Information).
The research office is located in Ottawa and is responsible to conduct studies, polls and draft special publications.
A Communications and Citizen Participation Office oversees the activities of three regional offices, the Ontario and Atlantic Canada Regional Office (Toronto), the Western and Northern Regional Office (Calgary) and the Quebec Regional Office (Quebec City).
The CRIC published a weekly newsletter called Opinion Canada.
It was noted on August 09, 2010 that The Centre for Research and Information on Canada and the Canadian Unity Council are no longer available on the Internet.
