[[Biathle]]

CATEGORIES: Multisports, Modern pentathlon

Biathle or Modern biathlon is a sub-sport of modern pentathlon invented to create opportunities for training the run and swim parts of pentathlon in real race conditions. It can also be seen as a sport in its own right. It bears close resemblance to aquathlon which also contains swimming and running but comes from triathlon sport. It should not be confused with biathlon.

==Sport==

Biathle is an event that involves a run, swim, and run.  It is a world class sport but not an Olympic one. The legs are raced with continuous transitions like triathlon. The race length is usually 200 m swim and 3 km run, which is shorter than aquathlon usually is. A variant is Winter Biathle which has indoor swimming and does not have continuous transitions.

==Biathle World Championships==

The Biathle World Championships have been held in September or October annually since 1999. The first event was held in Monaco, and returned there every two years between 2003 and 2009. Approximately 500 athletes have competed at each edition of the championships, representing some 50 countries.
