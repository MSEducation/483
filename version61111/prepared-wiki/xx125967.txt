== Quotes == 
"Nailing him was like trying to thread a needle in a high wind."
- Jack Dempsey about Tommy Gibbons bout in 1923
"Dempsey could beat anybody he could hit. The only reason that he couldn't do anything with fellows like Tunney or Greb or myself was he couldn't hit us."
- Tom Gibbons in a radio interview in 1949
"For the first and only time, I was more worried about getting hurt by the crowd than by the guy I was fighting. I got a pretty good blast when introduced. The crowd was hollering and raising hell. I looked around for my bodyguard, a colorful New York character named Wild Bill Lyons, who packed two pearl-handled pistols and used to talk a lot about his days in the West. Wild Bill was under the ring, hiding."
- Jack Dempsey about being introduced to the crowd at the Dempsey/Gibbons fight in Shelby, Montana July 4, 1923
"I could have licked him in Shelby if I had been 30, but I was 32.  I'll never forget that day.  I never got so tired of man in my life."  
- Tommy Gibbons discussing his World Championship bout with Jack Dempsey.
"People couldn't seem to understand how I could take so much from Dempsey.  They said I was as Iron Man (a name I always wanted to avoid), when really all I did was slip this way and that as the occasion required.  Brother Mike was a past master at that.  I never saw anyone to equal him at all.  He taught it to me."
