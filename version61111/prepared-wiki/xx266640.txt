==Summary==

The game is the spiritual 2D ancestor to Namco’s We Ski, released in 2008. There are time trials and eight slopes available from all over Japan. The story begins with a fox (or rabbit if the player chooses the female character) wanting to become human so he/she can ski. During the story mode, the player has different tasks in each chapter.
