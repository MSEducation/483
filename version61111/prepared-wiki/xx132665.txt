[[Philippine Basketball Association All-Star Weekend]]

CATEGORIES: Philippine Basketball Association All-Star Weekend

The Philippine Basketball Association All-Star Weekend is the annual gathering of the best players of the Philippine Basketball Association playing for various events such as the 3-point shootout, skills competition such as Obstacle and Trick-shot challenges, Rookies vs. Sophomores  Blitz Game, Slam Dunk competition, Shooting stars, Legends 3-point challenge and culminated by the All-Star Game.  It is patterned after the All-Star Weekend of the National Basketball Association.
The annual All-Star Game was instituted in 1989 and has already evolved into different types of competition such as the Rookies, Sophomores & Juniors (RSJ) vs. Veterans (presently adopted), North vs. South match-up, Commissioners All-Stars vs. Governors All-Stars, etc.  The manner by which players to the All-Star Game were selected has also been changed as the same was again patterned before the NBA type of selection.  Originally, the two coaches tapped to lead the two All-Star teams were the ones who selected their players but over the years the starting five are now selected through fan voting and the reserves would now be the ones chosen by the coaches.  For the 2005-2006 season, fans from the host city or province were given the choice to select the sixth man of each team.  After each game, an All-Star Most Valuable Player (MVP) was chosen by writers covering the annual event.
Vergel Meneses had clearly stamped his mark on this mid-year festivities as he remains to be the only four-time All-Star MVP awardee bagging the award in 1995, 1998, 2000 and 2003.  In its entire history, four players have been named multiple winners of the All-Star MVP award namely, Meneses, Benjie Paras (1994 and 1999), Asi Taulava (2004 and 2006), and Jayjay Helterbrand (2005 and 2007).
Alvin Patrimonio and Asi Taulava currently holds the record number of All-Star Game appearances with 12 each.
