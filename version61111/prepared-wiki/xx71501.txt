[[Gustavo A. Madero, D.F.]]

CATEGORIES: Boroughs of the Mexican Federal District, Populated places established in 1563

Gustavo A. Madero is one of the 16 delegaciones (boroughs) into which Mexico's Federal District is divided.

==Origins==

Founded as "Villa de Guadalupe" in 1563, it became the city of "Villa de Guadalupe Hidalgo" in 1828, and finally a delegación in 1931; as such, it was named after Gustavo A. Madero, the brother and fellow revolutionary of President Francisco I. Madero.

==Characteristics==

The area houses the Basílica de Guadalupe, the shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe at the foot of Tepeyac Hill, where Roman Catholics believe the Virgin Mary appeared to the indigenous Mexican Juan Diego Cuauhtlatoatzin  in 1531.
Being the northern-most borough, the Northern Central Bus Station (Terminal Central del Norte) is located here, providing constant bus runs to all major cities in the northern and western part of the country.

==History==

The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, ending the Mexican-American War of 1846–48 was signed here.
