The plot of 8-Bit Theater is loosely based on that of the video game Final Fantasy, in which four adventurers, the Light Warriors, must save the world by defeating four powerful demons that represent the four elements, thus relighting four magical orbs tied to the same elements, and, finally, defeating the personification of evil, Chaos.[tpl]cite web|url=http://adayinthemindof.wordpress.com/2008/08/28/8-bit-theater/|title=8-bit theater|last=Moore|first=Kyle E.|date=August 28, 2008|work=A Day in the Mind Of...|publisher=WordPress.com|accessdate=December 25, 2009[/tpl] However, while many of the original plot points and characters are present, the way they come about is often radically different. The Light Warriors themselves tend to cause far more harm than good on their travels and mostly have to be blackmailed, bribed, or threatened into accepting quests.
The comic is also not a serious epic; the protagonists and many of the supporting characters are based on and a parody of exaggerated role-playing video game stereotypes[tpl]cite web|url=http://everything2.com/title/8-Bit+Theater|title=8-Bit Theater|last=Triune & Dialogue|date=September 24, 2001|publisher=Everything2|accessdate=December 25, 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100206151229/http://everything2.com/title/8-Bit+Theater| archivedate= February 6, 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] to the point where many characters are actually named after their character classes, and much of the humor displayed in 8-Bit Theater is derived from the ineptitude of characters[tpl]cite web|url=http://webcomicoverlook.com/2007/10/25/the-webcomic-overlook-17-8-bit-theater/|title=#17: 8-Bit Theater|last=El Santo|date=October 25, 2007|publisher=The Webcomic Overlook|accessdate=December 25, 2009[/tpl] as well as from the interactions between four protagonists who are travelling together but do not actually like each other very much. The range of comedic devices 8-Bit Theater employs includes droll humor, running gags, word play, and slapstick, and another significant portion of the humor results from creating reader anticipation for dramatic moments which fail to come. Clevinger has stated that "his favorite comics are the ones where the joke is on the reader."[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.nuklearpower.com/2004/04/03/teaser/|title=Teaser!|last=Clevinger|first=Brian|authorlink=Brian Clevinger|date=April 3, 2004|accessdate=December 24, 2009|accessdate=April 5, 2010[/tpl]
8-Bit Theater was originally intended to parody a variety of classic 8-bit video games, like Metroid or River City Ransom.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nuklearforums.com/showpost.php?p=303169&postcount=10|title=What game should Brian spoof next?|author=Brian Clevinger (Kurosen) |publisher=Nuklear Power Forums|accessdate=December 24, 2009[/tpl] The popularity of the Final Fantasy comic convinced Clevinger to abandon this idea, although 8-Bit Theater does contain occasional references to other video games as well as comic books, television shows and movies, such as thinly veiled superhero parodies Arachna-Dude and The Sulk.

==Characters==

Final Fantasy allowed players to pick their own four-person party from six character classes and name them individually. 8-Bit Theater features six characters that each represent one of the six classes; four of these characters make up the comic's protagonists, the Light Warriors.

Returning to the task of retrieving the elemental orbs, the Light Warriors travel to the cities of Gaia and Onrac and use a submarine provided by Sarda to reach the Sea Shrine, where they meet the Doom Cultists a second time. After defeating them, they accidentally summon the third Fiend, Ur (known in the game as Kraken). The Light Warriors kill Ur, retrieve the Water Orb and travel on to Lefein in search of the Air Orb, where they meet Dragoon, the last Dragon Knight, and the evil dragon Muffin, the fourth Fiend, who guards the Orb of Air. During a battle in Muffin's Sky Castle she is killed by Dragoon. The Sky Castle itself explodes after Fighter and Black Mage take the Air Orb.
Upon presenting the final orb to Sarda, he dismissively orders the Light Warriors to return to the Temple of Fiends, where they find that the Dark Warriors have made the temple their base of operations. During the night, Drizz'l summons the Four Fiends from Hell and has them confront the Light Warriors. Black Mage, using evil energy he absorbed from his doppelgänger, kills the fiends, absorbs their evil energies as well and turns on the other Light Warriors. Sarda interrupts the fight and reveals his intent to destroy the Light Warriors himself.
Sarda explains himself to be the grown-up version of a child that suffered great harm as a result of the Light Warrior's actions around the world.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.nuklearpower.com/2003/06/14/episode-295-why-would-he-write-that/| title = Episode 295: Why Would He Write That| work = 8-Bit Theater|date=June 14, 2003|last=Clevinger|first=Brian| accessdate =April 5, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web| url = http://www.nuklearpower.com/2004/11/18/episode-483-clue-waynes-world-and-rashomon/| title = Episode 483: Clue, Wayne's World, and Rashomon| work = 8-Bit Theater|date=November 18, 2004|last=Clevinger|first=Brian| accessdate =April 5, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web| url = http://www.nuklearpower.com/2005/04/23/episode-544-taking-aim/| title = Episode 544: Taking Aim| work = 8-Bit Theater|date=April 23, 2005|last=Clevinger|first=Brian| accessdate =April 5, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web| url = http://www.nuklearpower.com/2005/04/26/episode-545-pattern-recognition/| title = Episode 545: Pattern Recognition| work = 8-Bit Theater|date=April 26, 2005|last=Clevinger|first=Brian| accessdate =April 5, 2010[/tpl] Young Sarda became so focused on revenge that he studied to be a great wizard and travelled back in time to the beginning of the universe to remake it without the Light Warriors; after discovering that changing the past was impossible even for him, he decides to settle for making the Light Warriors into the warriors of legend, for no other reason than to further humiliate them in defeat. Sarda absorbs the orbs' magic energy as well as Black Mage's evil energy and easily unmakes not only the Light Warriors' class changes, but also removes their original abilities. Sarda's power quickly becomes erratic and unstable, and Chaos, the King of Demons, takes the opportunity to possess Sarda's body and announce his plans to annihilate the universe.
However, before a final battle between the Light Warriors and Chaos can begin, he is destroyed off-panel by a group of four White Mages, a party combination that was dismissed in one of the earliest episodes as ineffectual for the game, and all credit for saving the world goes to a group of bystanders, the Dark Warriors. The Epilogue picks up three years later. White Mage visits Red Mage and Dragoon at a restaurant, where they have started up an extremely unsuccessful support group for sole survivors of ancient sects. Afterward, White Mage visits King Thief in Elfland, who has been trying to locate Black Mage and Fighter, in an effort to obtain more riches from their adventure. Black Mage and Fighter find themselves poor and out of work in a remote town, trying to make money by taking job postings in the town square. The epilogue ends with Fighter suggesting that they resume their search for the "Armor of Invincibility" that Fighter has been searching for since the beginning of the comic.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.nuklearpower.com/2010/06/01/the-epilogue/| title= Epilogue| work= 8-Bit Theater|date=June 1, 2010|last=Clevinger|first=Brian| accessdate=June 1, 2010[/tpl]

==Art==

As a sprite comic, much of the art in 8-Bit Theater is sampled from video games, particularly Final Fantasy I and Final Fantasy III.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thewebcomiclist.com/p/17/8bit-theatre|title=8-bit Theatre|publisher=The Webcomic List|accessdate=December 25, 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091202112028/http://www.thewebcomiclist.com/p/17/8bit-theatre| archivedate= December 2, 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.webcomicz.com/webcomics/10/8-bit-theater.html|title=8-bit Theater|publisher=WebcomicZ|accessdate=December 25, 2009[/tpl] Some art is also obtained from public clip art sites and unspecified Google image search results. Original artwork is created by Lydia Tyree and Kevin Sigmund, who contribute hand drawn art and custom sprites respectively. The comic itself is assembled by Clevinger in Adobe Photoshop.
The Epilogue, however, was handdrawn by Matt Speroni, who is also drawing the artwork for Brian Clevinger's newer webcomic, How I Killed Your Master, as well as his own webcomic, The Dreadful.
