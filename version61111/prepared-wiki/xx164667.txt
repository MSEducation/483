==Description==

Adults do not usually grow to more than [tpl]convert|60|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] in length. The greatest length recorded for a specimen is [tpl]convert|72.4|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl]. The tail is relatively long, representing 11-14.8% of the total length of adult male snakes and 9.8-12.5% in females. Klauber (1940) suggested, since the rattle is tiny, it is probably not audible. A very rare species, it is known only from about 12 specimens.

==Geographic range and habitat==

It is found in western Mexico in the mountains and foothills of eastern Sinaloa, western Durango and probably northern Nayarit, between [tpl]convert|500|and|1200|m|ft[/tpl] in altitude. The type locality given is "Plumosas Plomosas, Sinaloa, Mexico". It occurs in pine-oak forest, subtropical dry forest and tropical deciduous forest.

==Conservation status==

This species is classified as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species with the following criteria: B1ab(iii) (v3.1, 2001).[tpl]Redlist species|no=64333|genus=Crotalus|species=stejnegeri|date=13 September|year=2007[/tpl] A species is listed as such when the best available evidence indicates its extent of occurrence is estimated to be less than 20,000 km2 (7,720 mi2), estimates indicate it is severely fragmented or known to exist at no more than 10 locations, and a continuing decline has been observed, inferred, or projected in its area, extent, and/or quality of habitat. Therefore, it is considered to be facing a high risk of extinction in the wild. The population trend was down when assessed in 2007.[tpl]Redlist CC2001|date=13 September|year=2007[/tpl]
