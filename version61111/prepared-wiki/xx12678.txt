The concept of stereoregularity in polymer chains is illustrated in the picture above with polypropylene. Stereoregular poly(1-alkene) can be isotactic or syndiotactic depending on the relative orientation of the alkyl groups in polymer chains consisting of units −CH2-CHR−, like the CH3 groups in the figure.  In the isotactic polymers, all stereogenic centers CHR share the same configuration.  The stereogenic centers in syndiotactic polymers alternate their relative configuration.  A polymer that lacks any regular arrangement in the position of its alkyl substituents (R) is called atactic. Both isotactic and syndiotactic polypropylene are crystalline, whereas atactic polypropylene, which can also be prepared with special Ziegler–Natta catalysts, is amorphous.  The stereoregularity of the polymer is determined by the catalyst used to prepare it.

==Classes of Ziegler–Natta catalysts==

===Heterogeneous catalysts===

The first and dominant class of Ti-based catalysts (and some V-based catalysts) for alkene polymerization can be roughly subdivided into two subclasses, (a) catalysts suitable for homopolymerization of ethylene and for ethylene/1-alkene copolymerization reactions leading to copolymers with a low 1-alkene content, 2–4 mol.% (LLDPE resins), and (b) catalysts suitable for the synthesis of isotactic 1-alkenes.  The overlap between these two subclasses is relatively small because the requirements to the respective catalysts differ widely.
Commercial catalysts are supported, i.e. bound to a solid with a high surface area. Both TiCl4 and TiCl3 give active catalysts.Hill, A.F. Organotransition Metal Chemistry Wiley-InterScience: New York, 2002: pp. 136–139.Kissin, Y.V. ''Alkene Polymerization Reactions with Transition Metal Catalysts" Elsevier: Amsterdam, 2008; Chapter 4. The support in the majority of the catalysts is MgCl2. A third component of most catalysts is a carrier, a material that determines the size and the shape of catalyst particles.  The preferred carrier is microporous spheres of amorphous silica with a diameter of 30–40 mm. During the catalyst synthesis, both the Ti compounds and MgCl2 are packed into the silica pores.  All these catalysts are activated with organoaluminum compounds such as Al(C2H5)3.
All modern supported Ziegler–Natta catalysts designed for polymerization of propylene and higher 1-alkenes are prepared with TiCl4 as the active ingredient and MgCl2 as a support.  Another component of all such catalysts is an organic modifier, usually an ester of an aromatic diacid or a diether.  The modifiers react both with inorganic ingredients of the solid catalysts as well as with organoaluminum cocatalysts.  These catalysts polymerize propylene and other 1-alkenes to highly crystalline isotactic polymers.

===Homogeneous catalysis===

A second broad class of Ziegler–Natta catalysts are soluble in the reaction medium.  Traditionally such homogeneous catalysts are derived from metallocenes but the structure of active catalysts have been significantly broadened.

====Metallocene catalysts====

These catalysts are metallocenes together with a cocatalyst, typically MAO, [−O–Al–CH(CH3-)n.  The idealized metallocene catalysts have the composition Cp2MCl2 (M = Ti, Zr, Hf) such as titanocene dichloride.  Typically, the organic ligands are derivatives of cyclopentadienyl.  In some complexes, the two cyclopentadiene (Cp) rings are linked with bridges, like −CH2−CH2− or >SiPh2.,Bochmann, M. Organometallics 1, Complexes with Transition Metal-Carbon σ-Bonds Oxford University Press, New York, 1994: pp. 69–71. Depending of the type of their cyclopentadienyl ligands, for example by using an Ansa-bridge, metallocene catalysts can produce either isotactic or syndiotactic polymers of propylene and other 1-alkenes.,Bochmann, M.

====Non-metallocene catalysts====

Ziegler–Natta catalysts of the third class, non-metallocene catalysts, use a variety of complexes of various metals, ranging from scandium to lanthanoid and actinoid metals, and a large variety of ligands containing oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur.  The complexes are activated using MAO, as is done for metallocene catalysts.
Most Ziegler–Natta catalysts and all the alkylaluminium cocatalysts are unstable in air, and the alkylaluminium compounds are pyrophoric. The catalysts, therefore, are always prepared and handled under an inert atmosphere.

==Mechanism of Ziegler-Natta polymerization==

The structure of active centers in Ziegler–Natta catalysts is firmly established only for metallocene catalysts.  A metallocene complex Cp2ZrCl2 reacts with MAO and is transformed into a metallocenium ion Cp2Zr+-CH3. A polymer molecule grows in length by numerous insertion reactions of C=C bonds of 1-alkene molecules into the Zr–C bond in the ion:
Many thousands of alkene insertion reactions occur at each active center resulting in the formation of long polymer chains attached to the center.  On occasion, the polymer chain is disengaged from the active centers in the chain termination reaction:
Another type of chain termination reaction called β-hydrogen elimination reaction also occurs periodically:  
Polymerization reactions of alkene with  solid Ti-based catalysts occur at special Ti centers located on the exterior of the catalyst crystallites.  Some titanium atoms in these crystallites react with organoaluminum cocatalysts with the formation of Ti–C bonds.  The polymerization reaction of alkenes occurs similarly to the reactions in metallocene catalysts: 
The two chain termination reactions occurs quite rarely in Ziegler–Natta catalysis and the formed polymers have a too high molecular weight to be of commercial use.  To reduce the molecular weight, hydrogen is added to the polymerization reaction:
The Cossee-Arlman mechanism describes the growth of stereospecific polymers,.Reference 2, Chapter 6.Elschenbroich, C.; Salzer, A.; Organometallics: a Concise Introduction VCH Verlagsgesellschaft mbH, New York, 1992, p. 423-425. This mechanism states that the polymer grows through alkene coordination at a vacant site at the Ti atom, which is followed by insertion of the C=C bond into the Ti-C bond at the active center.
