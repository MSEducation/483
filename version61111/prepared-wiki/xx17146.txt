 |title= Saint Sebastian Interceding for the Plague Stricken}}</ref> The Walters Art Museum.]]Dating back to pre-Roman times, the town of Pavia, then known as [[Ticinum]], was a municipality and an important military site (a [[castrum]]) under the [[Roman Empire]]. It was said by [[Pliny the Elder]] to have been founded by the [[Laevi]] and [[Marici (Ligures)|Marici]], two [[Ligures|Ligurian]] tribes, while [[Ptolemy]] attributes it to the [[Insubres]]. The Roman city most likely began as a small military camp, built by the [[consul]] [[Publius Cornelius Scipio]] in 218 BC to guard a wooden bridge he had built over the [[river]] Ticinum, on his way to search for [[Hannibal]], who was rumoured to have managed to lead an army over the [[Alps]] and into [[Italy]]. The forces of Rome and [[Carthage]] ran into each other soon thereafter, and the Romans suffered the first of many crushing defeats at the hands of Hannibal, with the consul himself almost losing his life. The bridge was destroyed, but the fortified camp, which at the time was the most forward Roman military outpost in the [[Po Valley]], somehow survived the long [[Second Punic War]], and gradually evolved into a garrison town.
Its importance grew with the extension of the Via Aemilia from Ariminum (Rimini) to the Po River (187 BC), which it crossed at Placentia (Piacenza) and there forked, one branch going to Mediolanum (Milan) and the other to Ticinum, and thence to Laumellum where it divided once more, one branch going to Vercellae - and thence to Eporedia and Augusta Praetoria - and the other to Valentia - and thence to Augusta Taurinorum (Turin).

===Late Antiquity / Early Medieval Ages===

It was at Pavia in 476 AD that the reign of Romulus Augustulus (r. 475-476), the last emperor of the Western Roman Empire ended and Roman rule ceased in Italy.[tpl]cite book|last=Thompson|first=E. A.|title=Romans and Barbarians The Decline of the Western Empire|year=1982|publisher=The University of Wisconsin Press|location=Madison, Wisconsin|pages=61–63[/tpl] Romulus Augustulus, while considered the last emperor of the Western Roman Empire was actually a usurper of the imperial throne; his father Flavius Orestes having dethroned the previous emperor, Julius Nepos, and raised the young Romulus Augustulus to the imperial throne at Ravenna in 475.[tpl]cite book|last=Thompson|title=Romans and Barbarians|pages=61–63[/tpl] Though being the emperor, Romulus Augustulus was simply the mouthpiece for his father Orestes, who was the person who actually exercised power and governed Italy during Romulus Augustulus’s short reign.[tpl]cite book|last=Thompson|title=Romans and Barbarians|pages=61–63[/tpl] Ten months after Romulus Augustulus’s reign began, Orestes’s soldiers under the command of one of his officers named Odoacer, rebelled and killed Orestes in the city of Pavia in 476.[tpl]cite book|last=Thompson|title=Romans and Barbarians|pages=64[/tpl] The rioting that took place as part of Odoacer’s uprising against Orestes sparked fires that burnt much of Pavia to the point that Odoacer as the new king of Italy, had to suspend the taxes for the city for five years so that it could finance its recovery.[tpl]cite book|last=Thompson|title=Romans and Barbarians|pages=64[/tpl] Without his father Romulus Augustulus was powerless. Instead of killing Romulus Augustulus, Odoacer pensioned him off at 6,000 solidi a year before declaring the end of the Western Roman Empire and himself king of the new Kingdom of Italy.[tpl]cite book|last=Thompson|title=Romans and Barbarians|pages=64[/tpl]
Odoacer’s reign as king of Italy did not last long, because in 488 the Ostrogothic peoples led by their king Theoderic invaded Italy and waged war against Odoacer.[tpl]cite book|last=Moorhead|first=John|title=Theoderic in Italy|year=1992|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|pages=19[/tpl] After fighting for 5 years Theoderic defeated Odoacer and on March 15, 493 assassinated Odoacer at a banquet meant to negotiate a peace between the two rulers.[tpl]cite book|last=Moorhead|title=Theoderic|pages=26[/tpl] With the establishment of the Ostrogoth kingdom based in northern Italy, Theoderic began his vast program of public building.

Pavia played an important role in the war between the Eastern Roman Empire and the Ostrogoths that began in 535.[tpl]cite book|last=Thompson|title=Romans and Barbarians|pages=95[/tpl] After the Eastern Roman general Belisarius’s victory over the Ostrogothic leader Wittigis in 540 and the loss of most of the Ostrogoth lands in Italy, Pavia was among the last centres of Ostrogothic resistance that continued the war and opposed Eastern Roman rule.[tpl]cite book|last=Thompson|title=Romans and Barbarians|pages=95–96[/tpl] After the capitulation of the Ostrogothic leadership in 540 more than a thousand men remained garrisoned in Pavia and Verona dedicated to opposing Eastern Roman rule.[tpl]cite book|last=Thompson|title=Romans and Barbarians|pages=96[/tpl] The resilience of Ostrogoth strongholds like Pavia against invading forces allowed pockets of Ostrogothic rule to limp along until finally being defeated in 561.[tpl]cite book|last=Wickham|title=Early Medieval Italy|pages=ix[/tpl]
Pavia and the peninsula of Italy didn’t remain long under the rule of the Eastern Roman Empire for in 568 a new people invaded Italy. This new invading people in 568 were the Lombards (otherwise called the Longobards).[tpl]cite book|last=Christie|first=Neil|title=The Lombards The Ancient Longobards|year=1995|publisher=Basil Blackwell Inc.|location=Cambridge, Mass.|pages=xxii[/tpl] In their invasion of Italy in 568, the Lombards were led by their king Alboin (r. 560-572), who would become the first Lombard king of Italy.[tpl]cite book|last=Christie|title=The Lombards|pages=xxv[/tpl] Alboin captured much of northern Italy in 568 but his progress was halted in 569 by the fortified city of Pavia.[tpl]cite book|last=Christie|title=The Lombards|pages=79[/tpl] Paul the Deacon’s History of the Lombards written more than a hundred years after the Siege of Ticinum provides one of the few records of this period: “The city of Ticinum (Pavia) at this time held out bravely, withstanding a siege more than three years, while the army of the Langobards remained close at hand on the western side. Meanwhile Alboin, after driving out the soldiers, took possession of everything as far as Tuscany except Rome and Ravenna and some other fortified places which were situated on the shore of the sea.”[tpl]cite book|last1=Paul the Deacon|title=History of the Lombards|year=2003|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |location=Philadelphia|pages=80|author2=William Dudley Foulke|editor=Edward Peters[/tpl] The Siege of Ticinum finally ended with the Lombards capturing the city of Pavia in 572.[tpl]cite book|last=Hodgkin|first=Thomas|title=Italy and Her Invaders 553 Volume V The Lombard Invasion|year=1895|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|pages=162–163[/tpl] Pavia’s strategic location and the Ostrogoth palaces located within it would make Pavia by the 620s the main capital of the Lombards’ Kingdom of Pavia[tpl]cite book|last=Arnaldi|first=Girolamo|title=Italy and Its Invaders|year=2005|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|pages=31[/tpl] and the main residence for the Lombard rulers.[tpl]cite book|last=Christie|title=The Lombards|pages=147[/tpl]
Under Lombard rule many monasteries, nunneries, and churches were built at Pavia by the devout Christian Lombard monarchs. Even though the first Lombard kings were Arian Christians, sources from the period such as Paul the Deacon have recorded that the Arian Lombards were very tolerant of their Catholic subjects’ faith and that up to the 690s Arian and Catholic cathedrals coexisted in Pavia.[tpl]cite book|last=Christie|title=The Lombards|pages=188[/tpl] Lombard kings, queens, and nobles would engage in building churches, monasteries, and nunneries as a method to demonstrate their piety and their wealth by extravagantly decorating these structures which in many cases would become the site of that person’s tomb: as in the case of Grimoald (r. 662-671) who built San Ambrogio in Pavia and buried there after his death in 671.[tpl]cite book|last=Christie|title=The Lombards|pages=100[/tpl] Perctarit (r. 661-662, 672-688) and his son Cunicpert (r.679-700) built a nunnery and a church at Pavia during their reigns’.[tpl]cite book|last=Christie|title=The Lombards|pages=xxv, 101[/tpl] Lombard churches were sometimes named after those who commissioned their construction, such as San Maria Theodota in Pavia.[tpl]cite book|last=Wickham|title=Early Medieval Italy|pages=84[/tpl] The monastery of San Michele alla Pusterla located at Pavia was the royal monastery of the Lombard kings.[tpl]cite book|last=Christie|title=The Lombards|pages=200[/tpl]

The city of Pavia played a key role in the war between the Lombard Kingdom of Pavia and the Franks led by Charlemagne.

===Medieval Period===

The Hungarians burned Pavia from sometime during 889 to 955 AD. Pavia remained the capital of the Italian Kingdom and the centre of royal coronations until the diminution of imperial authority there in the 12th century. In 1004 Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor bloodily suppressed a revolt of the citizens of Pavia, who disputed his recent crowning as King of Italy.
In the 12th century Pavia acquired the status of a self-governing commune. In the political division between Guelphs and Ghibellines that characterizes the Italian Middle Ages, Pavia was traditionally Ghibelline, a position that was as much supported by the rivalry with Milan as it was a mark of the defiance of the Emperor that led the Lombard League against the emperor Frederick Barbarossa, who was attempting to reassert long-dormant Imperial influence over Italy. The city also had a reputation as a place to have a "good time," as witness the Archpoet's famous comments of 1163.Quis in igne positus, igne non uratur? Quis Papiae demorans, castus habeatur? Ubi Venus digito juvenes venatur, oculis illaqueat, facie praedatur? Si ponas Hippolytum hodie Papiae, non erit Hippolytus in sequenti die. Veneris in thalamos "ducunt omnes viae." Non est in tot turribus turris Alethiae.
In the following centuries Pavia was an important and active town.
Under the Treaty of Pavia, Emperor Louis IV granted during his stay in Italy the Electorate of the Palatinate to his brother Duke Rudolph's descendants. Pavia held out against the domination of Milan, finally yielding to the Visconti family, rulers of that city in 1359; under the Visconti Pavia became an intellectual and artistic centre, being the seat from 1361 of the University of Pavia founded around the nucleus of the old school of law, which attracted students from many countries.

===Early Modern===

The Battle of Pavia (1525) marks a watershed in the city's fortunes, since by that time, the former cleavage between the supporters of the Pope and those of the Holy Roman Emperor had shifted to one between a French party (allied with the Pope) and a party supporting the Emperor and King of Spain Charles V. Thus during the Valois-Habsburg Italian Wars, Pavia was naturally on the Imperial (and Spanish) side. The defeat and capture of king Francis I of France during the battle ushered in a period of Spanish occupation which lasted until 1713 at the conclusion of the War of the Spanish Succession. Pavia was then ruled by the Austrians until 1796, when it was occupied by the French army under Napoleon. During this Austrian period the University was greatly supported by Maria Theresa of Austria and saw a great renaissance that eventually led to a second renaissance due to the presence of leading scientists and humanists like Ugo Foscolo, Alessandro Volta, Lazzaro Spallanzani, Camillo Golgi among others.
In 1815, it again passed under Austrian administration until the Second War of Italian Independence (1859) and the unification of Italy one year later.
