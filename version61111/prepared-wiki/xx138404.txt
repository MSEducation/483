===Origins===

In 1984, the chairman of CITIC group at the time, Rong Yiren, requested to the Chinese government that a banking division be created under his company, in order to fully embody the needs for foreign exchange. This move was approved by the People's Bank of China, and a banking division was created under CITIC group in April 1985. At this point, the bank was based on the original finance department, expanding its operations regarding external financing, foreign exchange transactions, loans, international settlement, finance leases and deposits. In April 1987, the bank was formally established as a separate legal entity, following approval from the People's Bank of China and the Chinese State Council.CITIC Bank Introduction 51Credit.com (Chinese)
