[[Canon de 120mm L mle 1931]]

CATEGORIES: World War II artillery of Belgium, 120 mm artillery

The Canon de 12 cm L mle 1931 was a medium field gun used by Belgium in World War II. Captured guns were taken into Wehrmacht service after the surrender of Belgium in May 1940 as the 12 cm K 370(b) where it was generally used on coast defense duties. 
It was rather heavy for its size, but had a good range. The split trail had large spades that had to be pounded into the ground to anchor the weapon in place.
