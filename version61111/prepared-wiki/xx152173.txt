[[Tuilik]]

CATEGORIES: Canoeing and kayaking equipment, Inuit clothing

A Tuilik is a traditional Greenland paddling jacket, used when paddling a kayak. It is a jacket and a spray shirt integrated into one piece of clothing, which is sealed at the face, at the wrists and around the cockpit coaming. In this way the paddler can do an eskimo roll without getting wet, and without getting any water into his kayak. The tuilik is also well insulated, to protect against cold weather.[tpl]cite web|last=Carroll|first=Tom|title=THE TUILIK - THEN and NOW|url=http://www.seacanoe.org/tuilik.htm|work=Seacanoe.org|accessdate=26 June 2012[/tpl] Traditionally, a tuilik was made from seal-skin, although, outside Greenland, the modern tuilik is made from neoprene or from waterproof, breathable fabric.
In summer months, an akuilisaq may be used instead.
