Castration (also known as neutering or gonadectomy) is any action, surgical, chemical or otherwise, by which a biological male loses use of the testes. (Orchiectomy specifically refers to surgical removal of one or both testes.) This causes sterilization (i.e., prevents them from reproducing); it also greatly reduces the production of certain hormones, such as testosterone.
The term "castration" is sometimes also used to refer to the removal of the ovaries in the female, otherwise known as an oophorectomy or, in animals, spaying. Estrogen levels drop precipitously following oophorectomy, and long-term effects of the reduction of sex hormones are significant throughout the body.Prophylactic oophorectomy in pre-menopausal women and long term health – a review
Castration of non-human animals is intended for favouring a desired development of the animal or of his habits, or preventing overpopulation.

==Punishment==

Castration may be performed on humans variously as a punishment, or to decrease the libido of sex offenders as a prevention attempt. This has been done in the Americas,  China and Vietnam.

==History==

The practice of castration has its roots before recorded human history.[ref]

[/ref] Castration was frequently used for religious or social reasons in certain cultures mainly South Asia, Africa, and East Asia. After battles in some cases, winners castrated their captives or the corpses of the defeated to symbolize their victory and seize their "power". Castrated men — eunuchs – were often admitted to special social classes and were used particularly to staff bureaucracies and palace households: in particular, the harem. Castration also figured in a number of religious castration cults. Other religions, such as Judaism, were strongly opposed to the practice. The Leviticus Holiness code, for example, specifically excludes eunuchs or any males with defective genitals from the priesthood, just as castrated animals are excluded from sacrifice.
Eunuchs in China had been known to usurp power in many eras of Chinese history, most notably in the Later Han, late Tang and late Ming Dynasty. There are similar recorded Middle Eastern events.
In ancient times, castration often involved the total removal of all the male genitalia. This involved great danger of death due to bleeding or infection and, in some states, such as the Byzantine Empire, was seen as the same as a death sentence. Removal of only the testicles had much less risk.
Either surgical removal of both testicles or chemical castration may be carried out in the case of prostate cancer.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.malecare.com |title=MaleCare.com |publisher=MaleCare.com |date=23 February 2011 |accessdate=5 February 2012[/tpl] Testosterone-depletion treatment (either surgical removal of both testicles or chemical castration) is used to slow down the cancer, greatly reduce sex drive or interest in those with sexual drives, obsessions, or behaviors, or any combination of those that may be considered deviant. Castration in humans has been proposed, and sometimes used, as a method of birth control in certain poorer regions.
Male-to-female transsexuals often undergo orchiectomy, as do some other transgender people. Orchiectomy may be performed as part of a more general sex reassignment surgery, either before or during other procedures. It may also be performed on someone who does not desire, or cannot afford, further surgery.
Involuntary castration appears in the history of warfare, sometimes used by one side to torture or demoralize their enemies. It was practiced to extinguish opposing male lineages and thus allow the victor to sexually possess the defeated group's women.

===Europe===

Edward Gibbon's famous work Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire reports castration of defeated foes at the hands of the Normans during their invasions of Sicily and Italy. Castration has been used in modern conflicts, such as the Janjaweed militiamen currently ([tpl]As of|2005|alt=as of 2005[/tpl]) attacking citizens of the Darfur region in Sudan, often castrating villagers and leaving them to bleed to death.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A48943-2005Mar19.html |title=In Darfur, My Camera Was Not Nearly Enough |work=The Washington Post |date=20 March 2005 |accessdate=5 February 2012[/tpl]

Another famous victim of castration was the medieval French philosopher, scholar, teacher, and (later) monk Pierre Abélard. He was castrated by relatives of his lover, Héloïse.
Bishop Wimund, a 12th-century English adventurer and invader of the Scottish coast, was castrated.
In medieval England those found guilty of high treason were hanged, drawn and quartered, which often included emasculation or removal of the genitalia.
William Wallace, the Scottish resistance leader, was castrated as part of his execution, for resistance to English rule.
Wim Deetman has been criticised by the Dutch parliament for failing to include evidence of castrationTime for the truth about Catholic sex abuse in the Netherlands in his report on sexual abuse by the Roman Catholic Church, when children were 'punished' by castration in the 1950s for reporting sexual abuse by Roman Catholic priests.
Chemical castration has been and is used as part of sentencing in criminal cases. At present it is employed by nine US states as well as other countries.
In 1952, Alan Turing, the father of computer science and also the inventor of Turing machine was criminally prosecuted for homosexual acts and chose chemical castration as an alternative to a period of imprisonment.

===China===

According to legend, during the reign of the legendary Emperor Shun and Yu in China, in 2281 BC castration was passed into law as a punishment, which remained so until the reign of Gaozu of Tang (589–600 AD). However, it was still practiced after his reign.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=xJESoip9wZEC&pg=PA3&dq=the+five+punishments+are+adopted+branding+cutting+off+the+nose+feet+castration+and+death+emperor+wen+kao+tsu#v=onepage&q=the%20five%20punishments%20are%20adopted%20branding%20cutting%20off%20the%20nose%20feet%20castration%20and%20death%20emperor%20wen%20kao%20tsu&f=false|title=Chronological handbook of the history of China: a manuscript left by the late Rev.

At the end of the Ming Dynasty, there were about 70,000 eunuchs (宦官 huànguān, or 太監 tàijiàn) employed by the emperor, with some serving inside the Imperial palace.

====Non-Han peoples====

Many of the non-Han Chinese peoples who founded states in China after invading originally did not have eunuchs as part of their culture, but adopted it from the Han Chinese.
The Khitan people adopted the practice of using eunuchs from the Chinese and the eunuchs they used were non-Khitan prisoners of war. The Khitan were a nomadic Mongolic people and originally did not have eunuchs as part of their culture.祝建龙 (Zhu Jianlong), 二〇〇九年四月 (April 2009), 12.(Page 18 on online document viewer, Page 12 on actual document) When the Khitan founded the Liao Dynasty they developed a harem system with concubines and wives and adopted eunuchs as part of it. The eunuchs were not Khitan and they came from two sources, all of their eunuchs were captured ethnic Chinese from the Central Plains. The Khitan captured Chinese people who were already eunuchs at the Jin court when they invaded of the Later Jin. Another source was during their war with the Chinese Song dynasty, the Khitan would raid China, capture Han Chinese boys as prisoners of war and emasculate them to become eunuchs. The emasculation of captured Chinese boys guaranteed a continuous supply of eunuchs to serve in the Liao Dynasty harem. The Empress Dowager Chengtian played a large role in the raids to capture and emasculate the boys.祝建龙 (Zhu Jianlong), 二〇〇九年四月 (April 2009), 13.(Page 19 on online document viewer, Page 13 on actual document)
The Khitan Empress Dowager Xiao Chuo (Chengtian) of the Khitan Liao state took power at age 30 in 982 as a regent for her son. She personally led her own army against the Song Chinese in 986 and defeated them in battle,Peterson(2000), 259.Derven(2000), 199.Bauer(2010), 569.Wang(2013).Keay(2010). fighting the retreating Chinese army. She then ordered the castration of around 100 ethnic Chinese boys she had captured in China, supplementing the Khitan's supply of eunuchs to serve at her court, among them was Wang Ji'en. The boys were all under ten years old and were selected for their good looks.McMahon(2013), 261.McMahon(2013), 269.[ref]*The Eunuchs and Sinicization in the Non-Han Conquest Dynasties of China

During the Qing (Manchu) dynasty (1644-1911 CE), the sons and grandsons of the rebel Yaqub Beg in China were all castrated. Surviving members of Yaqub Beg's family included his 4 sons, 4 grandchildren (2 grandsons and 2 granddaughters), and 4 wives.

===Korea===

The eunuchs of Korea, called Naesi (내시, 內侍), were officials to the king and other royalty in traditional Korean society. The first recorded appearance of a Korean eunuch was in Goryeosa ("History of Goryeo"), a compilation about the Goryeo period. In 1392, with the founding of the Joseon Dynasty, the Naesi system was revised, and the department was renamed the "Department of Naesi" (내시부, 內侍府).[tpl]ko[/tpl] 내시 - 네이버 백과사전
The Naesi system included two ranks, those of Sangseon (상선, 尙膳, "Chief of Naesi"), who held the official title of senior second rank, and Naegwan (내관, 內官, "Common official naesi"), both of which held rank as officers. 140 naesi in total served the palace in Joseon Dynasty period. They also took the exam on Confucianism every month. The naesi system was repealed in 1894 following Gabo reform.
According to legend, castration consisted of daubing a boy's genitals with human feces and having a dog bite them off.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=U-fc5X0cUjwC&pg=PA280&dq=Korean+eunuchs,+however,+had+it+worst+of+all.+In+ancient+times+they+were+castrated+by+having+their+genitals+smeared+with+human+feces+and+then+being+exposed+to+packs+of+hungry+dogs#v=onepage&q=Korean%20eunuchs%2C%20however%2C%20had%20it%20worst%20of%20all.%20In%20ancient%20times%20they%20were%20castrated%20by%20having%20their%20genitals%20smeared%20with%20human%20feces%20and%20then%20being%20exposed%20to%20packs%20of%20hungry%20dogs&f=false|title=Manthropology: The Science of Why the Modern Male Is Not the Man He Used to Be|author=Peter McAllister|year=2010|publisher=Macmillan|location=|isbn=0-312-55543-1|page=280|pages=|accessdate=2011-01-11[/tpl] During the Yuan Dynasty, eunuchs became a desirable commodity for tributes, and dog bites were replaced by more sophisticated surgical techniques.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=S3Y2PTI_vYYC&pg=PA137&dq=korean+castrated+dog+bite#v=onepage&q=korean%20castrated%20dog%20bite&f=false|title=Children in slavery through the ages|author=Gwyn Campbell, Suzanne Miers, Joseph Calder Miller|year=2009|publisher=Ohio University Press|location=|isbn=0-8214-1877-7|page=137|pages=|accessdate=2011-01-11[/tpl]

===Vietnam===

The Vietnamese adopted the eunuch system and castration techniques from China. Records show that the Vietnamese created eunuchs through castration in a painful procedure by removing the entire genitalia with both penis and testicles being cut off with a sharp knife or metal blade. The procedure was agonizing since the entire penis was cut off.[tpl]cite news |title=Chuyện 'tịnh thân' hãi hùng của thái giám Việt xưa |author= |url=http://vietbao.vn/Suc-khoe/Chuyen-tinh-than-hai-hung-cua-thai-giam-Viet-xua/2131549871/70/ |newspaper=Viet Bao |date=Thứ sáu, 05 Tháng mười 2012, 14:00 GMT+7 |accessdate=27 July 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title= Chuyện 'tịnh thân' hãi hùng của thái giám Việt xưa|others= Theo Đất Việt|url=http://ngoisao.net/tin-tuc/thoi-cuoc/24h/chuyen-tinh-than-hai-hung-cua-thai-giam-viet-xua-2621880.html |newspaper=Ngôi sao |date= Thứ năm, 4/10/2012 11:16 GMT+7|accessdate=27 July 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title= Thê lương chuyện 'của quý' của thái giám Việt xưa|others= Báo Đất Việt|url= http://www.baomoi.com/The-luong-chuyen-cua-quy-cua-thai-giam-Viet-xua/139/9058145.epi|newspaper= Báo Mới|date= 05/08/2012 19:25|accessdate=27 July 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title= Thê lương chuyện ‘của quý’ của thái giám Việt xưa|others=Theo Đất Việt |url= http://2sao.vn/p0c1048n20120808152150734/the-luong-chuyen-'cua-quy'-cua-thai-giam-viet-xua.vnn|newspaper=2sao|date= Thứ tư, 08/08/2012 15:15|accessdate=27 July 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title= Thê lương chuyện 'của quý' của thái giám Việt xưa|others= ĐVO|url=http://www.treonline.com/the-luong-chuyen-cua-quy-cua-quai-giam-viet-xua.htm |newspaper=Treonline |date= |accessdate=27 July 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title= Hành trình đau khổ của những hoạn quan thời xưa|others= Theo Báo Đất Việt|url= http://giadinh.net.vn/the-gioi/hanh-trinh-dau-kho-cua-nhung-hoan-quan-thoi-xua-20110824020430125.htm|newspaper= Báo Gia đình & Xã hội|date=Thứ Tư, 24/08/2011 14:25 (GMT+7)|accessdate=27 July 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title= Bí mật về thái giám trong cung triều Nguyễn|others= Theo Công An Nhân Dân|url= http://news.zing.vn/xa-hoi/bi-mat-ve-thai-giam-trong-cung-trieu-nguyen/a336065.html|newspaper=Zing News |date=18/07/2013 lúc 09:04 |accessdate=27 July 2013[/tpl] The young man's thighs and abdomen would be tied and others would pin him down on a table.

In the Lê Dynasty the Vietnamese Emperor Lê Thánh Tông was aggressive in his relations with foreign countries including China. A large amount of trade between Guangdong and Vietnam happened during his reign. Early accounts recorded that the Vietnamese captured Chinese whose ships had blown off course and detained them. Young Chinese men were selected by the Vietnamese for castration to become eunuch slaves to the Vietnamese. It has been speculated by modern historians that the Chinese who were captured and castrated by the Vietnamese were involved in trade between China and Vietnam instead of actually being blown off course by the wind and they were punished as part of a crackdown on foreign trade by Vietnam.[tpl]cite web|title=明代广东海上丝绸之路的高度发展|url=http://eco.guoxue.com/article.php/15591/8|publisher=國學網－－中國經濟史論壇(China Economic History Forum)|date=2008-03-16|author=黄啟臣|accessdate=26 July 2013[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=明代广东海上丝绸之路的高度发展|url=http://www.zhgpl.com/crn-webapp/cbspub/secDetail.jsp?bookid=3222&secid=3254|publisher=中國評論學術出版社(China Review Academic Publishers Unlimited)|accessdate=26 July 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.zhgpl.com/crn-webapp/cbspub/secDetail.jsp?bookid=3222&secid=3257 |title=中国评论学术出版社 |deadurl=no |accessdate=6 September 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.zhgpl.com/crn-webapp/doc/docDetailCreate.jsp?coluid=56&kindid=1201&docid=100107474&mdate=0911123624 |title=中国评论新闻：郑和下西洋与广东商人的海外移民 |deadurl=no |accessdate=6 September 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.chinareviewnews.com/doc/1001/0/7/4/100107474.html |title=鄭和下西洋與廣東商人的海外移民|publisher=中國評論新聞網 (www.ChinaReviewNews.com)|accessdate=2013年7月26日 星期五 (26 July 2013) |date=2006-03-08 |page=1[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.zhgpl.com/crn-webapp/doc/docDetailCreate.jsp?coluid=6&kindid=30&docid=100107474 |title=中国评论新闻：郑和下西洋与广东商人的海外移民 |deadurl=no |accessdate=6 September 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.chinareviewnews.com/doc/1001/0/7/4/100107474.html?coluid=56&kindid=1201&docid=100107474&mdate=0911123624 |title=中國評論新聞 |deadurl=no |accessdate=6 September 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.chinareviewnews.com/crn-webapp/doc/docDetailCNML.jsp?coluid=55&kindid=1160&docid=100107474 |title=鄭和下西洋與廣東商人的海外移民 |deadurl=no |accessdate=6 September 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.chinareviewnews.com/crn-webapp/doc/docDetailCNML.jsp?coluid=56&kindid=1201&docid=100151090 |title=明代廣東海上絲綢之路的高度發展 |deadurl=no |accessdate=6 September 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.chinareviewnews.com/doc/1001/5/1/0/100151090.html?coluid=56&kindid=1201&docid=100151090&mdate=0911123624 |title=中國評論新聞 |deadurl=no |accessdate=6 September 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.chinareviewnews.com/crn-webapp/doc/docDetailCreate.jsp?coluid=56&kindid=1201&docid=100107474&mdate=0911123624 |title=中國評論新聞：鄭和下西洋與廣東商人的海外移民 |deadurl=no |accessdate=6 September 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=郑和下西洋与广东商人的海外移民人文历史|url=http://life.dayoo.com/edu/200910/20/75163_11076680.htm|publisher=广州日报大洋网(www.dayoo.com)|date=2009-10-20  |accessdate=26 July 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=貿易、移殖與文化交流:15-17 世紀廣東人與越南|url=http://www.lib.cuhk.edu.hk/conference/occ/liqingxin.pdf|publisher=廣東省社會科學院歷史研究所 南開大學中國社會歷史研究中心|accessdate=5 January 2013|author=李慶新|page=12|quote=此外,沿海平民在海上航行或捕撈漁獵,遇風漂流至越南者時有發生。如成化十三年, 廣東珠池奉御陳彜奏:南海縣民遭風飄至安南被編入軍隊及被閹禁者超過 100 人。5成化中, 海南文昌人吳瑞與同鄉劉求等 13 人到欽州做生意,遇風飄至安南,當局將他們"俱發屯田, 以瑞獨少,宮之"。6... 6《明孝宗實錄》卷一百五十三,弘治十二年八月辛卯。[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=貿易、移殖與文化交流:15-17 世紀廣東人與越南|url=http://wenku.baidu.com/view/fc9a0cdd50e2524de5187e89.html|publisher=廣東省社會科學院歷史研究所 南開大學中國社會歷史研究中心|accessdate=5 January 2013|author=李慶新|page=12[/tpl]

A 1499 entry in the Ming Shilu recorded that thirteen Chinese men from Wenchang including a young man named Wu Rui were captured by the Vietnamese after their ship was blown off course while traveling from Hainan to Guangdong's Qin subprefecture (Qinzhou), after which they ended up near the coast of Vietnam, during the Chenghua Emperor's rule (1447 - 1487). Twelve of them were enslaved to work as agricultural laborers, while the youngest, Wu Rui (吳瑞) was selected for castration since he was the only young man and he became a eunuch attendant at the Vietnamese imperial palace in Thang Long. After years of service, he was promoted at the death of the Vietnamese ruler in 1497 to a military position in northern Vietnam. A soldier told him of an escape route back to China and Wu Rui escaped to Longzhou. The local chief planned to sell him back to the Vietnamese, but Wu was rescued by the Pingxiang magistrate and then was sent to Beijing to work as a eunuch in the palace.Lary (2007), p. 91 [tpl]Google books|pFzhWyoYG_wC|The Chinese State at the Borders|page=91[/tpl][tpl]cite book |title=The Chinese State at the Borders|year=2007|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=0774813334|url=http://www.history.ubc.ca/faculty/lshin/research/pdf/07_shin_ubcp.pdf|author=Leo K.

===Iran===

Aqa Mohammad Khan Qajar, who established the Qajar Dynasty in Iran (in 18th century), was a victim of castration by officers of the previous kingdom. When he conquered Lotf Ali Khan, the last king of the Zand Dynasty, Qajar had  Lotf Ali Khan castrated in revenge.

Early on in Korea, castration consisted of daubing a boy's genitals with human feces and having a dog bite them off.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=U-fc5X0cUjwC&pg=PA280&dq=Korean+eunuchs,+however,+had+it+worst+of+all.+In+ancient+times+they+were+castrated+by+having+their+genitals+smeared+with+human+feces+and+then+being+exposed+to+packs+of+hungry+dogs#v=onepage&q=Korean%20eunuchs%2C%20however%2C%20had%20it%20worst%20of%20all.%20In%20ancient%20times%20they%20were%20castrated%20by%20having%20their%20genitals%20smeared%20with%20human%20feces%20and%20then%20being%20exposed%20to%20packs%20of%20hungry%20dogs&f=false|title=Manthropology: The Science of Why the Modern Male Is Not the Man He Used to Be|author=Peter McAllister|year=2010|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=0-312-55543-1|page=280|accessdate=11 January 2011[/tpl] During the Yuan Dynasty, eunuchs became a desirable commodity for tributes, and dog bites were replaced by more sophisticated surgical techniques.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=S3Y2PTI_vYYC&pg=PA137&dq=korean+castrated+dog+bite#v=onepage&q=korean%20castrated%20dog%20bite&f=false|title=Children in slavery through the ages|author=Gwyn Campbell, Suzanne Miers, Joseph Calder Miller|year=2009|publisher=Ohio University Press|isbn=0-8214-1877-7|page=137|accessdate=11 January 2011[/tpl]
In the over 13 centuries of Arab slave trade in Africa at least 28 million Africans were enslaved and shipped to the Middle East. While it is claimed by some that a vast majority of the male black slaves, estimated around 80%, were castrated, this makes little sense as slaves were a commodity and used for breeding purposes in order to increase slave owner's stock as they would with cattle.
In circumstances by which slaves were castrated, this was often "based on the assumption that the blacks had an ungovernable sexual appetite," but European slaves were also usually castrated, often by non-Muslims to bypass Islamic prohibitions. European "castration centers" existed in Central Europe and other areas beyond Islamic rule, from which eunuchs were then imported.
'The Calipha in Baghdad at the beginning of the 10th Century had 7,000 black eunuchs and 4,000 white eunuchs in his palace."[tpl]cite book |url=http://www.amazon.com/Islams-Black-Slaves-Other-Diaspora/dp/0374527970/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1333217684&sr=1-1-fkmr0 |title=Islam's Black Slaves: The Other Black Diaspora |deadurl=no |accessdate=6 September 2013[/tpl] The Arab slave trade typically dealt in the sale of castrated male slaves. Black boys at the age of eight to twelve had their scrotum and penis completely amputated. Around 9 out of 10 bled to death during the procedure, but the high price brought by eunuchs on the market made the practice profitable.

===Trafficking of boys for prostitution in modern times===

An article in the Gulf Times revealed in 2005 a major sex trade in mostly Nepalese boys who were lured to India and sold to brothels in Mumbai, Hyderabad, New Delhi, Lucknow and Gorakhpur. One victim was lured from Nepal at the age of 14, sold into slavery, locked up, beaten, starved, and forcibly castrated. He reported that he was held in a brothel with 40 to 50 other boys, many of whom were also castrated. He escaped and made his way back to Nepal. Two non-governmental organizations, one that works with homosexuals in Nepal, and one that works to rescue and rehabilitate trafficked women and children, were co-operating to help and rescue these boys.[ref]

==Preventive measure==

"Voluntary" chemical or surgical castration has been in practice in many countries — reports are available from American and European countries in particular for over eighty years (chemical for circa thirty)— as an option for treatment for people who have broken laws of a sexual nature, allowing them to return to the community from otherwise lengthy detentions.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2007[/tpl] The effectiveness and ethics of this treatment are heavily debated.
A temporary chemical castration has been studied and developed as a preventive measure and punishment for several repeated sex crimes, such as rape or other sexually related violence.[tpl]cite web|url=http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/biology/b103/f02/web1/kamlin.html|title=Chemical Castration: The Benefits and Disadvantages Intrinsic to Injecting Male Pedophiliacs with Depo-Provera|author=Katherine Amlin|accessdate=13 June 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://archive.southcoasttoday.com/daily/04-97/04-27-97/a09wn032.htm|title='Chemical castration' OK'd for Montana inmates|publisher= N.Y.

In modern times, the Czech Republic practices surgically castrating convicted sex offenders.

==Music==

In Europe, when women were not permitted to sing in church or cathedral choirs in the Roman Catholic Church, boys were castrated to prevent their voices breaking at puberty and to develop a special high voice. The first documents mentioning castrati are Italian church records from the 1550s.John Rosselli, "Castrato" article in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 2001. In the baroque and classical music eras these singers were highly appreciated by opera composers as well. Mozart's Exultate Jubilate, Allegri's Miserere and other famous pieces from this period now sung by sopranos and countertenors were written for castrati. Some of the alto parts of Handel's Messiah were first sung by a castrato. Famous castrati include Farinelli, Senesino, Carestini, and Caffarelli. The last castrato was Alessandro Moreschi (1858–1922) who served in the Sistine Chapel Choir."All Mouth and No Trousers" from The Guardian, 5 August 2002[tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl]. It was not until the late 19th century that the Roman Catholic Church officially condemned the production of castrati.

==Religion==

A number of religions have included castration as a central theme of their practice. These include:

===Hinduism===

===Christianity===

Castration is not a major theme of Christianity. While [tpl]bibleverse-lb||Deuteronomy|23:1|[/tpl] expels castrated men from the assembly of Israel, [tpl]bibleverse-lb||Isaiah|56:3|[/tpl] gives a much more accepting view of eunuchs, and in [tpl]bibleverse||Acts|8:34–8:39|KJV[/tpl], a eunuch is baptized. Notwithstanding, the first canon of the First Council of Nicea[tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl] in 325 AD suspended clergy members who practiced voluntary castration.
Well-known Christian eunuchs (or alleged eunuchs) include:

===Judaism===

Orthodox JudaismLeviticus 22:24, Talmud Shabbos 110b forbids the castration of either humans or animals.
In ancient Judaism, castrated animals were deemed unfit for sacrifice in the Temple ([tpl]bibleverse||Lev|22:24|[/tpl]). Castrated members of the priestly caste were forbidden to enter certain parts of the temple, to approach the altar, or to make sacrifices, although they could eat their share of the offerings (Lev. 21:16–24).

===Others===

==Medical consequences==

A subject of castration who is altered before the onset of puberty will retain a high voice, non-muscular build, and small genitals. He may well be taller than average, as the production of sex hormones in puberty — more specifically, estrogen via aromatization of testosterone — stops long bone growth. The person may not develop pubic hair and will have a small sex drive or none at all.
Castrations after the onset of puberty will typically reduce the sex drive considerably or eliminate it altogether. Castrated people are automatically sterile, because the testes (for males) and ovaries (for females) produce sex cells needed for sexual reproduction. Once removed the subject is infertile. The voice does not change. Some castrates report mood changes, such as depression or a more serene outlook on life, although this might not be due to chemical changes but instead emotional changes due to the implications of the procedure. Body strength and muscle mass can decrease somewhat. Body hair may sometimes decrease. Castration prevents male pattern baldness if it is done before hair is lost. However, castration will not restore hair growth after hair has already been lost due to male pattern baldness.[tpl]cite pmid|13711016[/tpl]
Historically, many eunuchs who additionally underwent a penectomy reportedly suffered from urinary incontinence associated with the removal of the penis.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.medspe.fr/site/templates/template.php?identifiant_article=2166&surlignage=2&PHPSESSID=bd0a2427de5e5665b9c541ca8a6ecc71 |title=The various types of eunuch in the Byzantine state: their role and symbolic meaning |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071113171516/http://www.medspe.fr/site/templates/template.php?identifiant_article=2166&surlignage=2&PHPSESSID=bd0a2427de5e5665b9c541ca8a6ecc71 |archivedate=2007-11-13 |accessdate=6 September 2013[/tpl]
Without hormone replacement therapy (HRT), typical symptoms (similar to those experienced by menopausal women) include hot flashes, gradual bone-density loss resulting in osteopenia or osteoporosis, and potential weight gain or redistribution of body fat to the hips/chest. Replacement of testosterone in the form of gel, patches, or injections can largely reverse these effects, although breast enlargement has also been reported as a possible side effect of testosterone usage.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.healthandage.com/public/health-center/28/article/3047/gm=20!gid2=2824 |title="HRT for Men Is Risky, Too" by Robert W.

==Psychoanalysis and literary theory==

The concept of castration plays an important role in psychoanalysis; see, for example, castration anxiety.
Castration (as a metaphor) also plays an important role in psychoanalytically-influenced literary theory, for example Harold Bloom's The Anxiety of Influence.
In Mexican thriller La Casa del Pelícano, castration is shown as being connected to the Oedipus complex.

==Chemical castration==

In the case of chemical castration, ongoing regular injections of anti-androgens are required. Chemical castration does not actually remove the testicles or ovaries of the subject,"Can Castration Be a Solution for Sex Offenders?

==Veterinary practice==

Castration is commonly performed on domestic animals not intended for breeding.
Domestic animals are usually castrated to avoid unwanted or uncontrolled reproduction; to reduce or prevent other manifestations of sexual behaviour such as territorial behavior or aggression (e.g. fighting between groups of entire (uncastrated) males of a species); or to reduce other consequences of sexual behavior that may make animal husbandry more difficult, such as boundary/fence/enclosure destruction when attempting to get to nearby females of the species.
Male horses are usually castrated (gelded) using emasculators, because stallions are rather aggressive and troublesome. The same applies to male mules, although they are sterile. Male cattle are castrated to improve fattening and docility in feedlots or for use as oxen.
Breeding individuals are kept entire and used for breeding: they may fetch higher prices when sold.
Livestock may be castrated when used for food to increase growth or weight or both of individual male animals[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2010[/tpl] and because of the undesirable taste and odor of the meat from sexually mature males. In domestic pigs the taint, called boar taint, is caused by androstenone and skatole concentrations stored in the fat tissues of the animal after sexual maturity.Genetics of Boar Taint: Implications for the Future Use of Intact Males Boar taint is only found in a small minority of pigs and can be controlled through breeding selection, diet and management.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sugarmtnfarm.com/blog/2007/08/hi-tech-vs-boar-taint.html |title=Evaluation of High Tech vs Low Tech Boar Taint Controls |publisher=Sugarmtnfarm.com |date=12 August 2007 |accessdate=5 February 2012[/tpl] It is released when the fat is heated and has a distinct odor and flavor that is widely considered unpalatable to consumers.Genetic Inhibition of Boar Odor in Meat[tpl]dead link|date=February 2012[/tpl] Consequently, in commercial meat production, male pigs are either castrated shortly after birth or slaughtered before they reach sexual maturity. Recent research in Brazil has shown that castration of pigs is unnecessary because most pigs do not have the 'boar taint'. This is due to many breeds of pigs simply not having the heredity for the boar taint and the fact that pigs are normally slaughtered at a young market weight.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sugarmtnfarm.com/blog/2005/11/to-cut-or-not.html |title=Sugar Mountain Farm: To Cut or Not? |publisher=Sugarmtnfarm.com |date=11 November 2005 |accessdate=5 February 2012[/tpl]
In the case of pets, castration is usually called neutering, and is encouraged to prevent overpopulation of the community by unwanted animals, and to reduce certain diseases such as prostate disease and testicular cancer in male dogs (oophorectomy in female pets is often called spaying). Testicular cancer is rare in dogs, but prostate problems are somewhat common in unaltered male dogs when they get older.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2010[/tpl] Neutered individuals have a much lower risk of developing prostate problems in comparison.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2010[/tpl] Unaltered male cats are more likely to develop an obstruction in their urethra, preventing them from urinating to some degree[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl]; however, neutering does not seem to make much difference statistically because many neutered toms also have the problem.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2010[/tpl]  A specialized vocabulary has arisen for neutered animals of given species:
An incompletely castrated male in livestock species (horse and cattle) is known as a rig.
The term stag is used for a male animal castrated after the secondary sex characteristics have developed to such a point as to give him the appearance of sexual maturity.
Methods of veterinary castration include instant surgical removal, the use of an elastrator tool to secure a band around the testicles that disrupts the blood supply, the use of a Burdizzo tool or emasculators to crush the spermatic cords and disrupt the blood supply, pharmacological injections and implants and immunological techniques to inoculate the animal against his own sexual hormones.
Certain animals, like horses and swine, are usually surgically treated with a scrotal castration (which can be done with the animal standing while sedated and after local anesthetic has been applied), while others, like dogs and cats, are anesthetised and recumbent when surgically castrated with a pre-scrotal incision in the case of dogs, or a pre-scrotal or scrotal incision used for cats.
In veterinary practice an "open" castration refers to a castration in which the inguinal tunic is incised and not sutured. A "closed" castration refers to when the procedure is performed so that the inguinal tunic is sutured together after incision.

==Parasitic infection==

Some parasitic nematodes chemically castrate their hosts. For example, Microphallus pseudopygmaeus chemically castrates its host, the snail Onoba aculeus, and causes it to grow larger than normal.
