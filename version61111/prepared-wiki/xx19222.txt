Hugo Rafael Chávez Frías ([tpl]IPA-es|ˈuɣo rafaˈel ˈtʃaβes ˈfɾi.as[/tpl]; 28 July 1954[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]5 March 2013) was a  Venezuelan politician and the President of Venezuela from 1999 until his death in 2013. He was the leader of the Fifth Republic Movement from its foundation in 1997 until 2007, when it merged with several other parties to form the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV), which he led until 2012.
Following Chavismo, his own political ideology of Bolivarianism and Socialism of the 21st Century, he focused on implementing social reforms in the country as a part of a social project known as the Bolivarian Revolution. He implemented the 1999 Venezuelan Constitution, participatory democratic councils, the nationalization of several key industries, and increased government funding of health care and education and made significant reductions in poverty with oil revenues.[tpl]cite web|author=Ian James|url=http://news.yahoo.com/venezuela-vote-puts-chavismo-critical-test-172039207.html|title=Venezuela vote puts 'Chavismo' to critical test|publisher=Yahoo |date=4 October 2012|accessdate=2 February 2013[/tpl] The Bolivarian Missions have entailed the construction of thousands of free medical clinics for the poor,[tpl]cite web|title=Estrategia de Cooperación de OPS/OMS con Venezuela 2006-2008|url=http://www.ops-oms.org.ve/site/pwr/docs/CCS_MS_OPS-OMS.pdf|format=PDF|pages=p. 54|publisher=Pan American Health Organization|date=June 2006|accessdate=31 December 2006[/tpl] [tpl]es icon[/tpl] the institution of educational campaigns that have made more than one million adult Venezuelans literate,[tpl]cite web|last=Márquez|first=Humberto|title=Venezuela se declara libre de analfabetismo|publisher=Inter Press Service|url=http://ipsnoticias.net/nota.asp?idnews=35621|date=28 October 2005|accessdate=29 December 2006[/tpl] [tpl]es icon[/tpl] and the enactment of food[tpl]cite web|last=Barreiro C.|first=Raquel|title=Mercal es 34% más barato|publisher=El Universal|url=http://www.eluniversal.com/2006/03/04/eco_art_04206A.shtml|date=4 March 2006|accessdate=29 December 2006[/tpl] [tpl]es icon[/tpl] and housing subsidies.[tpl]cite web|publisher=El Universal|title=Banco de la Vivienda transfirió 66 millardos para subsidios|url=http://www.eluniversal.com/2006/11/10/eco_art_64504A.shtml|date=10 November 2006|accessdate=29 December 2006[/tpl] [tpl]es icon[/tpl] Additionally, poverty decreased from about 50% to roughly 25% during his presidency.

Born into a working-class family in Sabaneta, Barinas, Chávez became a career military officer, and after becoming dissatisfied with the Venezuelan political system, he founded the secretive Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement-200 (MBR-200) in the early 1980s to work towards overthrowing it. Chávez led the MBR-200 in an unsuccessful coup d'état against the Democratic Action government of President Carlos Andrés Pérez in 1992, for which he was imprisoned. Released from prison after two years, he founded a socialist political party, the Fifth Republic Movement, and was elected president of Venezuela in 1998. He was re-elected in 2000. During his second presidential term, he introduced the system of Bolivarian Missions, Communal Councils, and worker-managed cooperatives, as well as a program of land reform, while also nationalizing various key industries. He was re-elected in 2006 with over 60% of the vote. On 7 October 2012, Chávez won his country's presidential election for a fourth time, defeating Henrique Capriles, and was elected for another six-year term.[tpl]cite news|title=Venezuela's Chávez re-elected to extend socialist. rule|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/08/venezuela-election-idUSL1E8L70WK20121008|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=8 October 2012|date=8 October 2012|first=Andrew|last=Cawthorne[/tpl]
Closely aligning himself with the Marxist-Leninist governments of Fidel and then Raúl Castro in Cuba and the socialist governments of Evo Morales in Bolivia, Rafael Correa in Ecuador, and Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua, his presidency was seen as a part of the socialist "pink tide" sweeping Latin America. Along with these governments, Chávez described his policies as anti-imperialist, being a prominent adversary of the United States's foreign policy as well as a vocal critic of US-supported neoliberalism and laissez-faire capitalism.Ellner 2002 He compared US president George W. Bush to a donkey[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-20712033 |title=Hugo Chavez: Memorable moments|publisher=BBC News |date=6 March 2013 |accessdate=14 March 2013[/tpl] and the devil.Chavez calls bush Satan He has described himself as a Marxist.http://en.ria.ru/world/20100116/157569985.htmlhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/mundo/america_latina/2010/01/100123_chavez_marx_amab.shtmlhttp://www.noticias24.com/actualidad/noticia/139693/yo-asumo-el-cristianismo-como-el-marxismo/http://www.abc.es/20100116/internacional-iberoamerica/chavez-declara-marxista-201001162021.htmlhttp://edant.clarin.com/diario/2010/01/16/elmundo/i-02120928.htm He supported Latin American and Caribbean cooperation and was instrumental in setting up the pan-regional Union of South American Nations, the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas, the Bank of the South, and the regional television network TeleSur. Chávez was a highly controversial and divisive figure both at home and abroad.

Chávez used habilitating laws, which allowed him to perform functions normally reserved to the Venezuelan Congress, on four occasions: starting in 1999 for 6 months, in 2000 for 12, in 2007 for 18 and in 2010 for 12 months.Leyes habilitantes (Correo del Orinoco) The use of such habilitating laws was heavily criticized by the opposition.Enabling laws in The Economist

==Early life==

===Childhood===

Hugo Chávez was born on 28 July 1954 in his paternal grandmother Rosa Inéz Chávez's home, a modest three-room house located in the rural village Sabaneta, Barinas State. The Chávez family were of Amerindian, Afro-Venezuelan, and Spanish descent.Beaumont 2006. His parents, Hugo de los Reyes Chávez and Elena Frías de Chávez, were working-lower middle class schoolteachers who lived in the small village of Los Rastrojos.
Hugo was born the second of seven children, including their eldest, Adán Chávez.Marcano and Tyszka 2007. pp. 7–8, 247.Jones 2007. p. 21. The couple lived in poverty, leading them to send Hugo and Adán to live with their grandmother Rosa,Marcano and Tyszka 2007. pp. 08–09. whom Hugo later described as being "a pure human being... pure love, pure kindness."Chávez quoted in Jones 2007. pp. 22, 25. She was a devout Roman Catholic, and Hugo was an altar boy at a local church.Jones 2007. p. 24. Hugo described his childhood as "poor...very happy", and experienced "humility, poverty, pain, sometimes not having anything to eat", and "the injustices of this world."Chávez quoted in Jones 2007. pp. 23, 25–26.
Attending the Julián Pino Elementary School, Chávez's hobbies included drawing, painting, baseball and history. He was particularly interested in the 19th-century federalist general Ezequiel Zamora, in whose army his own great-great-grandfather had served.Marcano and Tyszka 2007. p. 11.Jones 2007. pp. 23–24, 26–27. In the mid-1960s, Hugo, his brother and their grandmother moved to the city of Barinas so that the boys could attend what was then the only high school in the rural state, the Daniel O'Leary High School.Marcano and Tyszka 2007. pp. 07, 24–26.

===Military Academy: 1971–1975===

Aged seventeen, Chávez studied at the Venezuelan Academy of Military Sciences in Caracas. At the Academy, he was a member of the first class that was following a restructured curriculum known as the Andrés Bello Plan. This plan had been instituted by a group of progressive, nationalistic military officers who believed that change was needed within the military. This new curriculum encouraged students to learn not only military routines and tactics but also a wide variety of other topics, and to do so civilian professors were brought in from other universities to give lectures to the military cadets.Cannon 2009. p. 55.Marcano and Tyszka 2007. p. 30.Jones 2007. p. 38. Living in Caracas, he saw more of the endemic poverty faced by working class Venezuelans, something that echoed the poverty he had experienced growing up, and he maintained that this experience only made him further committed to achieving social justice.Jones 2007. pp. 49–50.Marcano and Tyszka 2007. p. 31. He also began to get involved in local activities outside of the military school, playing both baseball and softball with the Criollitos de Venezuela team, progressing with them to the Venezuelan National Baseball Championships. Other hobbies that he undertook at the time included writing numerous poems, stories and theatrical pieces, paintingMarcano and Tyszka 2007. p. 35. and researching the life and political thought of 19th-century South American revolutionary Simón Bolívar.Jones 2007. pp. 40–47. He also became interested in the Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara (1928–67) after reading his memoir The Diary of Che Guevara, although he also read books by a wide variety of other figures.Marcano and Tyszka 2007. pp. 29–30.
In 1974, he was selected to be a representative in the commemorations for the 150th anniversary of the Battle of Ayacucho in Peru, the conflict in which Simon Bolívar's lieutenant, Antonio José de Sucre, defeated royalist forces during the Peruvian War of Independence. In Peru, Chávez heard the leftist president, General Juan Velasco Alvarado (1910–1977), speak, and inspired by Velasco's ideas that the military should act in the interests of the working classes when the ruling classes were perceived as corrupt,Marcano and Tyszka 2007. p. 36. he "drank up the books had written, even memorising some speeches almost completely."Chávez quoted in Jones 2007. p. 40-47. Befriending the son of Panamanian President Omar Torrijos (1929–1981), another leftist military general, Chávez subsequently visited Panama, where he met with Torrijos, and was impressed with his land reform program that was designed to benefit the peasants. Being heavily influenced by both Torrijos and Velasco, he saw the potential for military generals to seize control of a government when the civilian authorities were perceived as serving the interests of only the wealthy elites.Jones 2007. pp. 52–53. In contrast to military presidents like Torrijos and Velasco however, Chávez became highly critical of Augusto Pinochet, the right-wing general who had recently seized control in Chile with the aid of the American CIA.Jones 2007. p. 54. Chávez later related that "With Torrijos, I became a Torrijist. With Velasco I became a Velasquist. And with Pinochet, I became an anti-Pinochetist."Chávez quoted in Marcano and Tyszka 2007. pp. 36–37. In 1975, Chávez graduated from the military academy, being rated one of the top graduates of the year (eight out of seventy five).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cidob.org/en/documentacio/biografias_lideres_politicos/america_del_sur/venezuela/hugo_chavez_frias |title=Hugo Chávez Frías / Venezuela / América del Sur / Biografías Líderes Políticos / Documentation / CIDOB home page |publisher=Cidob.org |date=23 March 2012 |accessdate=14 April 2012[/tpl]Jones 2007. pp. 54–56.Marcano and Tyszka 2007. p. 37.

===Early military career: 1976–1981===

Following his graduation, Chávez was stationed as a communications officer at a counterinsurgency unit in Barinas,Marcano and Tyszka 2007. p. 38. although the Marxist-Leninist insurgency which the army was sent to combat had already been eradicated from that state, leaving the unit with much spare time. Chávez himself played in a local baseball team, wrote a column for the local newspaper, organized bingo games and judged at beauty pageants.Jones 2007. pp. 57–59. At one point he found in an abandoned car riddled with bullet holes a stash of Marxist literature that apparently had belonged to insurgents many years before. He went on to read these books, which included titles by such theoreticians as Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin and Mao Zedong, but his favourite was a work entitled The Times of Ezequiel Zamora, written about the 19th-century federalist general whom Chávez had admired as a child.Jones 2007. p. 59. These books further convinced Chávez of the need for a leftist government in Venezuela, later remarking that "By the time I was 21 or 22, I made myself a man of the left."Chávez, quoted in Jones 2007. p. 59.
In 1977, Chávez's unit was transferred to Anzoátegui, where they were involved in battling the Red Flag Party, a Marxist-Hoxhaist insurgency group.Marcano and Tyszka 2007. p. 39. After intervening to prevent the beating of an alleged insurgent by other soldiers,Marcano and Tyszka 2007. p. 41. Chávez began to have his doubts about the army and their methods in using torture. At the same time, he was becoming increasingly critical of the corruption in both the army and in the civilian government, coming to believe that despite the wealth being produced by the country's oil reserves, Venezuela's poor masses were not receiving their share, something he felt to be inherently un-democratic. In doing so, he began to sympathise with the Red Flag Party and their cause, if not their violent methods.Chávez, quoted in Jones 2007. pp. 60–64.
In 1977, he founded a revolutionary movement within the armed forces, in the hope that he could one day introduce a leftist government to Venezuela: the Venezuelan People's Liberation Army (Ejército de Liberación del Pueblo de Venezuela, or ELPV), was a secretive cell within the military that consisted of him and a handful of his fellow soldiers. Although they knew that they wanted a middle way between the right wing policies of the government and the far left position of the Red Flag, they did not have any plans of action for the time being.Jones 2007. pp. 63–65.Wilpert 2007. p. 15. Nevertheless, hoping to gain an alliance with civilian leftist groups in Venezuela, Chávez then set about clandestinely meeting various prominent Marxists, including Alfredo Maneiro (the founder of the Radical Cause) and Douglas Bravo, despite having numerous political differences with them.Cannon 2009. p. 54.Jones 2007. pp. 65–77. At this time, Chávez married a working-class woman named Nancy Colmenares, with whom he would go on to have three children: Rosa Virginia (born September 1978), Maria Gabriela (born March 1980) and Hugo Rafael (born October 1983).Jones 2007. p. 634.

==Later military career and the Bolivarian Revolutionary Army-200: 1982–1991==

Five years after his creation of the ELPV, Chávez went on to form a new secretive cell within the military, the Bolivarian Revolutionary Army-200 (EBR-200), later redesignated the Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement-200 (MBR-200).Marcano and Tyszka 2007. pp. 48–49, 56.Wilpert 2007. p. 16. Taking inspiration from three Venezuelans whom Chávez deeply admired, Ezequiel Zamora (1817–1860), Simón Bolívar (1783–1830) and Simón Rodríguez (1769–1854), these historical figures became known as the "three roots of the tree" of the MBR-200.Gott 2005. pp. 23–24.Cannon 2009. p. 56. Later describing the group's foundation, Chávez would state that "the Bolivarian movement that was being born did not propose political objectives... Its goals were imminently internal. Its efforts were directed in the first place to studying the military history of Venezuela as a source of a military doctrine of our own, which up to then didn't exist."Chávez, quoted in Jones 2007. p. 80. However, he always hoped that the Bolivarian Movement would become politically dominant, and on his political ideas at the time, remarked that "This tree Bolívar, Zamora and Rodríguez has to be a circumference, it has to accept all kinds of ideas, from the right, from the left, from the ideological ruins of those old capitalist and communist systems."Chávez, quoted in Jones 2007. p. 81. Indeed, Irish political analyst Barry Cannon noted that the early Bolivarian ideology was explicitly capitalist, but that it "was a doctrine in construction, a heterogeneous amalgam of thoughts and ideologies, from universal thought, capitalism, Marxism, but rejecting the neoliberal models currently being imposed in Latin America and the discredited socialist and communist models of the old Soviet Bloc."
In 1981, Chávez, by now a captain, was assigned to teach at the military academy where he had formerly trained. Here he introduced new students in his so-called "Bolivarian" ideals, and recruited those whom he felt would make good members of the MBR-200, as well as organizing sporting and theatrical events for the students. In his recruiting attempts he was relatively successful, for by the time they had graduated, at least thirty out of 133 cadets had joined it.Jones 2007. pp. 83–85. In 1984 he met a Venezuelan woman of German ancestry named Herma Marksman who was a recently divorced history teacher. Sharing many interests in common, she eventually got involved in Chávez's movement and the two fell in love, having an affair that would last several years.Marcano and Tyszka 2007. pp. 51–53.Jones 2007. pp. 86–90. Another figure to get involved with the movement was Francisco Arias Cárdenas, a soldier particularly interested in liberation theology.Jones 2007. pp. 92–93. Cárdenas rose to a significant position within the group, although he came into ideological conflict with Chávez, who believed that they should begin direct military action in order to overthrow the government, something Cárdenas thought was reckless.Cárdenas, quoted in Jones 2007. pp. 92–93.
However, some senior military officers became suspicious of Chávez after hearing rumours about the MBR-200. Unable to dismiss him legally without proof, they re-assigned him so that he would not be able to gain any more fresh new recruits from the academy. He was sent to take command of the remote barracks at Elorza in Apure State,Marcano and Tyszka 2007. p. 50. where he got involved in the local community by organizing social events, and contacted the local indigenous tribal peoples, the Cuiva and Yaruro. Although they were distrustful due to their mistreatment at the hands of the Venezuelan army in previous decades, Chávez gained their trust by joining the expeditions of an anthropologist to meet with them. His experiences with them would later lead him to introduce laws protecting the rights of indigenous tribal peoples when he gained power many years later.Jones 2007. p. 98-102. While on holiday, he retraced on foot the route taken by his great-grandfather, the revolutionary Pedro Pérez Delgado (known as Maisanta), to understand his family history; on that trip, he met a woman who told Chávez how Maisanta had become a local hero by rescuing an abducted girl.Jones 2007. p. 103. In 1988, after being promoted to the rank of major, the high-ranking General Rodríguez Ochoa took a liking to Chávez and employed him to be his assistant at his office in Caracas.Jones 2007. pp. 105, 108.

===Operation Zamora: 1992===

In 1989, Carlos Andrés Pérez (1922–2010), the candidate of the centrist Democratic Action Party, was elected President after promising to oppose the United States government's Washington Consensus and financial policies recommended by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Nevertheless, he opposed neither once he got into office, following instead the neoliberal economic policies supported by the United States and the IMF. He dramatically cut spending, and put prominent men in governmental posts. Pérez's policies angered much of the public.Cannon 2009. pp. 36–37.Kozloff 2006. pp. 43–44.Gibbs 2006. p. 270. In an attempt to stop the widespread protests and looting that followed his social spending cuts, Pérez ordered the violent repression and massacre of protesters, known as El Caracazo, which "according to official figures ... left a balance of 276 dead, numerous injured, several disappeared and heavy material losses. However, this list was invalidated by the subsequent appearance of mass graves", indicating that the official death count was inadequate.Inter-American Court of Human Rights 1999.Pretel 2005.Kozloff 2006. pp. 46–47. Pérez had used both the DISIP political police and the army to orchestrate El Caracazo. Chávez did not participate in the repression because he was then hospitalized with chicken pox, and later condemned the event as "genocide".Marcano and Tyszka 2007. p. 55.Jones 2007. pp. 122–123, 126.
Disturbed by the Caracazo, rampant government corruption, the domination of politics by what he viewed as "the Venezuelan oligarchy" through the Punto Fijo Pact, and what he called "the dictatorship of the IMF", Chávez began preparing for a military coup d'état,Cannon 2009. pp. 55–56. known as Operation Zamora.Marcano and Tyszka 2007. p. 64. Initially planned for December, Chávez delayed the MBR-200 coup until the early twilight hours of 4 February 1992. On that date, five army units under Chávez's command moved into urban Caracas with the mission of overwhelming key military and communications installations, including the Miraflores presidential palace, the defense ministry, La Carlota military airport and the Military Museum. Chávez's immediate goal was to intercept and take custody of Pérez, who was returning to Miraflores from an overseas trip. Despite years of planning, the coup quickly encountered trouble. At the time of the coup, Chávez had the loyalty of less than 10% of Venezuela's military forces,Gott 2005. p. 64. and, because of numerous betrayals, defections, errors, and other unforeseen circumstances, Chávez and a small group of rebels found themselves hiding in the Military Museum, without any means of conveying orders to their network of spies and collaborators spread throughout Venezuela.Gott 2005. p. 63. Furthermore, Chávez's allies were unable to broadcast their prerecorded tapes on the national airwaves, during which Chávez planned to issue a general call for a mass civilian uprising against the Pérez government. Finally, Chávez's forces were unable to capture Pérez, who managed to escape from them. Fourteen soldiers were killed, and fifty soldiers and some eighty civilians injured during the ensuing violence.Sylvia and Danopolous 2003. p. 66.Gott 2005. p. 69.Jones 2007. pp. 131–155. Fighting during the coups resulted in the deaths of at least 143 people and perhaps as many as several hundred.Uppsala Conflict Data Program Conflict Encyclopedia, Venezuela, War and Minor Conflict, In depth, Hugo Chávez and the 1992 coup attempt, http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=167&regionSelect=5-Southern_Americas#
Realising that the coup had failed, Chávez gave himself up to the government. On the condition that he called upon the remaining active coup members to cease hostilities, he was allowed to appear on national television, something that he insisted on doing in his military uniform. During this address, he invoked the name of national hero Simón Bolívar and declared to the Venezuelan people that "Comrades: unfortunately, for now, the objectives we had set for ourselves were not achieved in the capital city. That is, those of us here in Caracas did not seize power. Where you are, you have performed very well, but now is the time for reflection. New opportunities will arise and the country has to head definitively toward a better future."Chávez quoted in Jones 2007. p. 157. Many viewers noted that Chávez had remarked that he had failed only "por ahora" (for now),Gott 2005. p. 23.Jones 2007. p. 157.Marcano and Tyszka 2007. p. 75.International Crisis Group 2007. p. 04. and he was immediately catapulted into the national spotlight, with many Venezuelans, particularly those from the poorer sections of society, seeing him as a figure who had stood up against government corruption and kleptocracy.Gott 2005. p. 67.O'Keefe 2005.Cannon 2009. p. 41.
Chávez was arrested and imprisoned at the San Carlos military stockade, where he remained wracked with guilt, feeling responsible for the coup's failure.Marcano and Tyszka 2007. pp. 75–77.International Crisis Group 2007. pp. 04–05. Indeed, pro-Chávez demonstrations that took place outside of San Carlos led to his being transferred to Yare prison soon after.Marcano and Tyszka 2007. pp. 91–92. The government meanwhile began a temporary crackdown on media supportive of Chávez and the coup.Jones 2007. pp. 161–165. A further attempted coup against the government occurred in November, which was once more defeated,Marcano and Tyszka 2007. p. 95. but then led to Pérez himself being impeached a year later for malfeasance and misappropriation of funds for illegal activities.Tarver and Frederick 2005. p. 167.Cannon 2009. p. 37.

==Political rise: 1992–1998==

While Chávez and the other senior members of the MBR-200 were in prison, his relationship with Herma Marksman broke up in July 1993.Marcano and Tyszka 2007. pp. 104–105. She would subsequently become a critic of Chávez.Jones 2007. pp. 177–181. In 1994, Rafael Caldera (1916–2009) of the centrist National Convergence Party was elected to the presidency, and soon after taking power, freed Chávez and the other imprisoned MBR-200 members as per his pre-election pledge. Caldera had however imposed upon them the condition that they would not return to the military, where they could potentially organise another coup.Marcano and Tyszka 2007. pp. 107–108.Jones 2007. pp. 182–186. After being mobbed by adoring crowds following his release, Chávez went on a 100-day tour of the country, promoting his Bolivarian cause of social revolution.Jones 2007. pp. 187–188. Now living off a small military pension as well as the donations of his supporters, he continued to financially support his three children and their mother despite divorcing Nancy Colmenares around this period. On his tours around the country, he would meet Marisabel Rodríguez, who would give birth to their daughter shortly before becoming his second wife in 1997.Marcano and Tyszka 2007. pp. 235–236.Jones 2007. pp. 190–191, 219.
Travelling around Latin America in search of foreign support for his Bolivarian movement, he visited Argentina, Uruguay, Chile, Colombia, and finally Cuba, where the Communist leader Fidel Castro (1926–) arranged to meet him. After spending several days in one another's company, Chávez and Castro became friends with the former describing the Cuban leader as being like a father to him.Marcano and Tyszka 2007. pp. 214–215, 220. Returning to Venezuela, Chávez failed to gain mainstream media attention for his political cause. Instead, he gained publicity from small, local-based newspapers and media outlets.Jones 2007. pp. 192–195. As a part of his condemnation of the ruling class, Chávez became critical of President Caldera, whose neoliberal economic policies had caused inflation and who had both suspended constitutional guarantees and arrested a number of Chávez's supporters.Jones 2007. pp. 195–198. According to the United Nations, by 1997 the per capita income for Venezuelan citizens had fallen to US$ 2,858 from US$ 5,192 in 1990, while poverty levels had increased by 17.65% since 1980, and homicide and other crime rates had more than doubled since 1986, particularly in Caracas.Cannon 2009. pp. 35–36. Coupled with this drop in the standard of living, widespread dissatisfaction with the representative democratic system in Venezuela had "led to gaps emerging between rulers and ruled which favoured the emergence of a populist leader".Cannon 2009. p. 48.
A debate soon developed in the Bolivarian movement as to whether it should try to take power in elections or whether it should instead continue to believe that military action was the only effective way of bringing about political change. Chávez was a keen proponent of the latter view, believing that the oligarchy would never allow him and his supporters to win an election,Marcano and Tyszka 2007. p. 116. while Francisco Arias Cárdenas instead insisted that they take part in the representative democratic process. Cárdenas himself proved his point when, after joining the Radical Cause socialist party, he won the December 1995 election to become governor of the oil-rich Zulia State.Jones 2007. pp. 202–203. Subsequently changing his opinion on the issue, Chávez and his supporters in the Bolivarian movement decided to found their own political party, the Fifth Republic Movement (MVR – Movimiento Quinta República) in July 1997 in order to support Chávez's candidature in the Venezuelan presidential election, 1998.Marcano and Tyszka 2007. p. 119.Jones 2007. p. 204.Cannon 2009. p. 59.

===1998 election===

At the start of the election run-up, most polls gave Irene Sáez, then-mayor of Caracas' richest district, Chacao, the lead. Although an independent candidate, she had the backing of one of Venezuela's two primary political parties, Copei.Jones 2007. pp. 205–207. In opposition to her right-wing and pro-establishment views, Chávez and his followers described their aim as "laying the foundations of a new republic" to replace the existing one, which they cast as "party-dominated"; the current constitution, they argued, was no more than the "legal-political embodiment of puntofijismo", the country's traditional two-party patronage system."Chávez's constitutional reform; A hard look at the rationale & proposals", Latin America Weekly Report, 12 January 1999, Venezuela; Politics; WR-99-02; P. 18 This revolutionary rhetoric gained Chávez and the MVR support from a number of other leftist parties, including the Patria Para Todos (Motherland for All), the Partido Comunist Venezolano (Venezeuelan Communist Party) and the Movimiento al Socialismo (Movement for Socialism), which together fashioned a political union supporting his candidacy called the Polo Patriotic (Patriotic Pole).Jones 2007. p. 214.
Chávez's promises of widespread social and economic reforms won the trust and favor of a primarily poor and working class following. By May 1998, Chávez's support had risen to 30% in polls, and by August he was registering 39%.[tpl]cite web|last=Trinkunas|first=Harold|coauthors=Jennifer McCoy|title=Observation of the 1998 Venezuelan Elections: A Report of the Council of Freely Elected Heads of Government|date=February 1999|publisher=Carter Center|pages=p. 49|format=PDF|accessdate=30 December 2006|url=http://www.cartercenter.org/documents/1151.pdf[/tpl] Much of his support came from his 'strong man' populist image and charismatic appeal.Sylvia and Danopolous 2003. p. 67. This rise in popularity worried Chávez's opponents, with a part of the media proceeding to attack him with a series of allegations, which included the claim – which he dismissed as ridiculous – that he was a cannibal who ate children.Jones 2007. p. 218. With his support increasing, and Sáez's decreasing, both the main two political parties, Copei and Democratic Action, put their support behind Henrique Salas Römer, a Yale University-educated economist who represented the Project Venezuela party.Jones 2007. pp. 220–223.
Chávez won the election with 56.20% of the vote. Salas Römer came second, with 39.97%, while the other candidates, including Irene Sáez and Alfaro Ucero, gained only tiny proportions of the vote.Jones 2007. p. 223. Academic analysis of the election showed that Chávez's support had come primarily from the country's poor and the "disenchanted middle class", whose standard of living had decreased rapidly in the previous decade,Wilpert 2007 pp. 18–19. although at the same time much of the middle and upper class vote had instead gone to Salas Römer.Cannon 2009. pp. 41–42. Following the announcement of his victory, Chávez gave a speech in which he declared that "The resurrection of Venezuela has begun, and nothing and no one can stop it."

==Presidency: 1999–2013==

===First presidential term: 2 February 1999 – 10 January 2001===

Chávez's presidential inauguration took place on 2 February 1999, and during the usual presidential oath he deviated from the prescribed words to proclaim that "I swear before my people that upon this moribund constitution I will drive forth the necessary democratic transformations so that the new republic will have a Magna Carta befitting these new times."Marcano and Tyszka 2007. p. 127.Jones 2007. p. 226. He subsequently set about appointing new figures to a number of government posts, including promoting various leftist allies to key positions; he for instance gave one of the founders of MBR, Jesús Urdaneta, the position in charge of the secret police; and made one of the 1992 coup leaders, Hernán Grüber Ódreman, governor of the Federal District of Caracas.Jones 2007. p. 229.
Chávez also appointed some conservative, centrist and centre-right figures to government positions as well, reappointing Caldera's economy minister Maritza Izaquirre to that same position and also appointing the businessman Roberto Mandini to be president of the state-run oil company Petroleos de Venezuela.Jones 2007. p. 230. His critics referred to this group of government officials as the "Boliburguesía" or "Bolivarian bourgeoisie",Marcano and Tyszka 2007. p. xx.Romero 2010. and highlighted the fact that it "included few people with experience in public administration." He also made several alterations to his presidential privileges, scrapping the presidential limousine, giving away his entire presidential wage of $1,200 a month to a scholarship fund,Jones 2007. p. 234. and selling off many of the government-owned airplanes, although alternately many of his critics accused him of excessive personal expenses for himself, his family and friends.Marcano and Tyszka 2007. pp. 151–153, 250–251. The involvement of a number of his immediate family members in Venezuelan politics has also led to accusations of nepotism, something Chávez denies.Marcano and Tyszka 2007. pp. 250–255. Meanwhile, in June 2000 he separated from his wife Marisabel, and their divorce was finalised in January 2004.Marcano and Tyszka 2007. p. 243.
Although he publicly used strong revolutionary rhetoric from the beginning of his presidency, the Chávez government's initial policies were moderate, capitalist and centre-left, having much in common with those of contemporary Latin American leftists like Brazil's president Lula da Silva.Wilpert 2007 p. 03.Ellner 2005. Chávez initially believed that capitalism was still a valid economic model for Venezuela, but that it would have to be Rhenish capitalism that would be followed rather than the neoliberalism which had been implemented under former governments with the encouragement of the United States.Sackur and Chávez 2010. He followed the economic guidelines recommended by the International Monetary Fund and continued to encourage foreign corporations to invest in Venezuela,Marcano and Tyszka 2007. pp. 148–149. even visiting the New York Stock Exchange in the United States in an attempt to convince wealthy investors to do so.Kozloff 2006. p. 61.Jones 2007. pp. 234–236. To increase his visibility abroad, Chávez spent fifty-two days of his first year as president outside of Venezuela, travelling the world meeting various national leaders, such as American President Bill Clinton, Governor of Texas George W. Bush and Chinese Premier Jiang Zemin.Marcano and Tyszka 2007. p. 154.
While he was remaining fiscally conservative, he introduced measures in an attempt to alleviate the poverty of the Venezuelan working class. Chávez immediately set into motion a social welfare program called Plan Bolívar 2000, which he organised to begin on 27 February 1999, the tenth anniversary of the Caracazo massacre. According to the United States Department of State, Chávez wanted to "send the message that the military was not a force of popular repression, but rather a force for development and security". The State Department also commented that this happened "only 23 days after his inauguration" and that he wanted to show his closest supporters "that he had not forgotten them".[tpl]cite web|title=VENEZUELAN SOLDIERS LEAVE THEIR BARRACKS . . . TO IMPLEMENT CHAVEZ'S CIVIL-MILITARY PUBLIC WORKS PROGRAM|url=http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/143547.pdf|publisher=United States Department of State|accessdate=23 April 2014[/tpl] Chávez said he would set aside $20.8 million for the plan but some state that the program costed $113 million. Plan Bolívar 2000 involved 70,000 soldiers, sailors and members of the air force going out into the streets of Venezuela where they would repair roads and hospitals, remove stagnant water that offered breeding areas for disease carrying mosquitoes, offer free medical care and vaccinations, and sell food at cheap prices.Gott 2005. pp. 178–179.Kozloff 2006. pp. 83–84.Marcano and Tyszka 2007. p. 138. Chávez himself described the Plan by saying that "Ten years ago we came to massacre the people. Now we are going to fill them with love. Go and comb the land, search out and destroy poverty and death. We are going to fill them with love instead of lead."Chávez quoted in Jones 2007. p. 231. 
In order to explain his latest thoughts and plans to the Venezuelan people, in May of 2000, he also launched his own Sunday morning radio show, Aló Presidente (Hello, President), on the state radio network, as well as a Thursday night television show, De Frente con el Presidente (Face to Face with the President). He followed this with his own newspaper, El Correo del Presidente (The President's Post), founded in July, for which he acted as editor-in-chief, but which was later shut amidst accusations of corruption in its management.Marcano and Tyszka 2007. pp. 193–195. In his television and radio shows, he answered calls from citizens, discussed his latest policies, sang songs and told jokes, making it unique not only in Latin America but the entire world.Jones 2007. p. 237.

====Constitutional reform====

Chávez then called for a public referendum – something virtually unknown in Venezuela at the time – which he hoped would support his plans to form a constitutional assembly, composed of representatives from across Venezuela, as well as from indigenous tribal groups, which would be able to rewrite the nation's constitution. The referendum went ahead on 25 April 1999, and was an overwhelming success for Chávez, with 88% of voters supporting the proposal.Marcano and Tyszka 2007. p. 130.Jones 2007. p. 238.
Following this, Chávez called for an election to take place on 25 July, in which the members of the constitutional assembly would be voted into power.Jones 2007. p. 239. Most jurists believed that the new constitutional assembly became the country's "supreme authority" and that all other institutions were subordinate to it.[tpl]cite book|last=Gott|first=Richard|title=Hugo Chávez and the Bolivarian revolution|date=2005|publisher=Verso|location=London u.a.|isbn=978-1844675333|page=147|edition=New ed.[/tpl] Of the 1,171 candidates standing for election to the assembly, over 900 of them were opponents of Chávez, but despite this, his supporters won another overwhelming electoral victory, taking 125 seats (95% of the total), including all of those belonging to indigenous tribal groups, whereas the opposition were voted into only 6 seats.Jones 2007. p. 240.International Crisis Group 2007. p. 05. On 12 August 1999, the new constitutional assembly voted to give themselves the power to abolish government institutions and to dismiss officials who were perceived as being corrupt or operating only in their own interests. While supporters of the move believed that it could force reforms that had been blocked by corrupt politicians and judicial authorities for years, many opponents of the Chávez regime argued that it gave Chávez and the Bolivarians too much power at the expense of their political opponents, and was therefore dictatorial.Jones 2007. p. 241.Belos 1999. 
On August 25 Chávez declared a "judicial emergency" and created a commission with nine members given powers to "dismiss the Supreme Court". Eight of fifteen members of the Supreme Court agreed with the decree but Cecilia Sosa, then president of the Supreme Court, resigned saying that "the Supreme Court was now dead" and that "the country's democratic system was in danger". Arguments grew after Sosa's resignation from existing politicians. On August 27, the existing politicians called an emergency session with the newly created Constitutional Assembly and Chávez calling this session "provocative". National Guardsmen then tried to prevent congressmen from entering the parliamentary building in Caracas which resulted in violent protests. After talking with church leaders, those who were opposed the new measures agreed with Chávez. Chávez then traveled seeking support from other countries and returned finding that the Constitutional Assembly was approving articles involving the freedom of press and the right to life (which included abortion), two articles Chávez did not agree with. The Constitutional Assembly also rejected Chávez's suggestion of renaming the country's name to the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.
The elected members of the constituent assembly put together a new constitution, and a referendum on the issue of whether to adopt it was held in December 1999; the referendum saw an abstention vote of over 50%, although amongst those voting, 72% approved the new constitution's adoption.Kozloff 2006. p. 94.Cannon 2009. pp. 61–62. The new constitution included increased protections for indigenous peoples and women, and established the rights of the public to education, housing, healthcare and food. It added new environmental protections, and increased requirements for government transparency. It increased the presidential term from five to six years, allowed people to recall presidents by referendum, and added a new presidential two-term limit. It converted the bicameral legislature, a Congress with both a Senate and a Chamber of Deputies, into a unicameral one comprising only a National Assembly.Wilpert 2007. pp. 31–41.Wilpert 2003.[tpl]cite web|year = 2000| title=Bolivarian Constitution of Venezuela|url= http://www.embavenez-us.org/constitution/intro.htm|accessdate =30 December 2006|publisher=Embassy of Venezuela in the US[/tpl]International Crisis Group 2007. pp. 05–06. The constitution gave greater powers to the president, not only by extending their term but also by giving them the power to legislate on citizen rights as well as the economic and financial matters that they were formerly unable to do.International Crisis Group 2007. p. 06. It also gave the military a role in the government by providing it with the mandated role of ensuring public order and aiding national development, something it had been expressely forbidden from doing under the former constitution. As a part of the new constitution, the country, which was then officially known as the Republic of Venezuela, was renamed the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (República Bolivariana de Venezuela) at Chávez's request, thereby reflecting the government's ideology of Bolivarianism and the influence of Simón Bolívar on the nation as a whole.

===Second presidential term: 10 January 2001 – 10 January 2007===

Under the new constitution, it was legally required that new elections be held in order to re-legitimize the government and president. This presidential election in July 2000 would be a part of a greater "megaelection", the first time in the country's history that the president, governors, national and regional congressmen, mayors and councilmen would be voted for on the same day.Marcano and Tyszka 2007. p. 140.Kozloff 2006. p. 88.Cannon 2009. p. 63. For the position of president, Chávez's closest challenger proved to be his former friend and co-conspirator in the 1992 coup, Francisco Arias Cárdenas, who since becoming governor of Zulia state had turned towards the political centre and begun to denounce Chávez as autocratic.Cannon 2009. p. 42. Although some of his supporters feared that he had alienated those in the middle class and the Roman Catholic Church hierarchy who had formerly supported him, Chávez was re-elected with 59.76% of the vote (the equivalent of 3,757,000 people), a larger majority than his 1998 electoral victory,Marcano and Tyszka 2007. p. 141.Ramírez 2005. p. 79. again primarily receiving his support from the poorer sectors of Venezuelan society.Cannon 2009. pp. 42–44.
That year, Chávez helped to further cement his geopolitical and ideological ties with the Cuban government of Fidel Castro by signing an agreement under which Venezuela would supply Cuba with 53,000 barrels of oil per day at preferential rates, in return receiving 20,000 trained Cuban medics and educators. In the ensuing decade, this would be increased to 90,000 barrels a day (in exchange for 40,000 Cuban medics and teachers), dramatically aiding the Caribbean island's economy and standard of living after its "Special Period" of the 1990s.Kozloff 2008. pp. 23–24. However, Venezuela's growing alliance with Cuba came at the same time as a deteriorating relationship with the United States: in late 2001, just after the American-led invasion of Afghanistan in retaliation for 11 September attacks against the U.S. by Islamist militants, Chávez showed pictures of Afghan children killed in a bomb attack on his television show. He commented that "They are not to blame for the terrorism of Osama Bin Laden or anyone else", and called on the American government to end "the massacre of the innocents. Terrorism cannot be fought with terrorism." The U.S. government responded negatively to the comments, which were picked up by the media worldwide.Marcano and Tyszka 2007. pp. 208–209.
Meanwhile, the 2000 elections had led to Chávez's supporters gaining 101 out of 165 seats in the Venezuelan National Assembly, and so in November 2001 they voted to allow him to pass 49 social and economic decrees.Marcano and Tyszka 2007. p. 143. This move antagonized the opposition movement particularly strongly.
At the start of the 21st century, Venezuela was the world's fifth largest exporter of crude oil, with oil accounting for 85.3% of the country's exports, therefore dominating the country's economy.Kozloff 2008. pp. 18–23.Cannon 2009. p. 32. Previous administrations had sought to privatise this industry, with U.S. corporations having a significant level of control, but the Chávez administration wished to curb this foreign control over the country's natural resources by nationalising much of it under the state-run oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela S.A. (PdVSA). In 2001, the government introduced a new Hydrocarbons Law through which they sought to gain greater state control over the oil industry: they did this by raising royalty taxes on the oil companies and also by introducing the formation of "mixed companies", whereby the PdVSA could have joint control with private companies over industry. By 2006, all of the 32 operating agreements signed with private corporations during the 1990s had been converted from being primarily or solely corporate-run to being at least 51% controlled by PdVSA.

====Opposition and the CD====

During Chávez's first term in office, the opposition movement had been "strong but reasonably contained, with complaints centring mainly on procedural aspects of the implementation of the constitution". However, the first organized protest against the Bolivarian government occurred in January 2001, when the Chávez administration tried to implement educational reforms through the proposed Resolution 259 and Decree 1.011, which would have seen the publication of textbooks with a heavy Bolivarian bias. The protest movement, which was primarily by middle class parents whose children went to privately run schools, marched to central Caracas shouting out the slogan "Don't mess with my children." Although the protesters were denounced by Chávez, who called them "selfish and individualistic," the protest was successful enough for the government to retract the proposed education reforms and instead enter into a consensus-based educational program with the opposition.Marcano and Tyszka 2007. pp. 143–145. That year, an organization known as the Coordinadora Democrática de Acción Cívica (CD) was founded, under which the Venezuelan opposition political parties, corporate powers, most of the country's media, the Venezuelan Federation of Chambers of Commerce, the Frente Institucional Militar and the Central Workers Union all united to oppose Chávez's regime.International Crisis Group 2007. p. 07.Ramírez 2005. p. 80. The prominent businessman Pedro Carmona (1941–) was chosen as the CD's leader. They received support from various foreign sources.thumb|right|Chávez visiting the USS Yorktown, a US Navy ship docked at Curaçao in the Netherlands Antilles, in 2002
The CD and other opponents of Chávez's Bolivarian government accused it of trying to turn Venezuela from a democracy into a dictatorship by centralising power amongst its supporters in the Constituent Assembly and granting Chávez increasingly autocratic powers. Many of them pointed to Chávez's personal friendship with Cuba's Fidel Castro and the one-party socialist government in Cuba as a sign of where the Bolivarian government was taking Venezuela. Others did not hold such a strong view but still argued that Chávez was a "free-spending, authoritarian populist" whose policies were detrimental to the country.Cannon 2009. p. 01. For instance, Venezuelan lawyer and academic Allan R. Brewer-Carías, a prominent and vocal opponent of Chávez, made the claim that under his regime the country had "suffered a tragic setback regarding democratic standards, suffering a continuous, persistent and deliberate process of demolishing institutions and destroying democracy, which has never before been experienced in the constitutional history of the country."Brewer-Carías 2010. p. i. Other academics have argued that the opposite was true, and that "the Chávez government is in fact more democratic than previous ones" because of the increased checks and balances introduced by the 1999 constitution and the introduction of workers' councils.Ramírez 2005. p. 83. See for example López 2003 and Wilpert 2007.
The pro-Chávez political analyst Gregory Wilpert argued, in his study of the Bolivarian administration, that the opposition movement was dominated primarily by members of the middle and upper classes. He further argued that this wealthy elite was particularly furious at the Bolivarian government because they themselves had lost much of their dominance over Venezuelan politics with the introduction of the 1999 constitution and the relegitimization of all areas of government that it required.Wilpert 2007. pp. 04–05. He went on to argue that this wealthy elite subsequently used its control of the country's mass media to create an anti-Chávez campaign aimed primarily at the middle classes, stirring up the latent racism and classism that existed in Venezuelan culture.Wilpert 2007. p. 20.The role of racism and classism in Venezuela is explored in Cannon 2009. pp. 38–41. One of the most prominent examples of this was through the popularization of the racist term ese mono ("that monkey"), which began to be applied to Chávez by his opponents,Marcano and Tyszka 2007. p. 260. who would also often accuse him of being "vulgar and common".Cannon 2009. p. 45. Both Venezuelan and Western opposition media also characterized Chávez's supporters, who were known as the Chávistas, as being "young, poor, politically unsophisticated, antidemocratic masses" who were controlled, funded and armed by the state,Ramírez 2005. p. 81. and they were regularly referred to as "hordes" in opposition media discourse, which also commonly referred to the Bolivarian Circles as "terror circles".Cannon 2009. p. 46. Such descriptions have been refuted by certain academics, such as Cristóbal Valencia Ramírez, who, after studying Chavista groups, have argued that they consist of people from many classes of society and are educated and largely non-violent.Ramírez 2005. p. 84. Chavista-run organizations have since claimed to have been the target of violent attacks from opposition groups: for instance, the Ezequiel Zamora National Farmers' Coordinator estimated that 50 Chavista leaders involved in the land-reform program had been assassinated during 2002 and 2003.Ramírez 2005. pp. 83–84.

====Coup, strikes and the recall referendum====

On 11 April 2002, mass protests took place in Caracas against the Bolivarian government, during which guns were fired, and violence ensued involving both pro- and anti-Chávez supporters, the police, and the army.Marcano and Tyszka 2007. pp. 171–172. Twenty people were killed, and over 110 were wounded.Marcano and Tyszka 2007. p. 168. A group of high-ranking anti-Chávez military officers, likely supported by figures in the business community, media, and certain political parties,[tpl]which|date=October 2012[/tpl] had been planning to launch a coup against Chávez and used the civil unrest as an opportunity.Marcano and Tyszka 2007. pp. 170–171. After the plotters gained significant power, Chávez agreed to be detained and was transferred by army escort to La Orchila, and although he requested to be allowed to leave the country, he refused to officially resign from the presidency at the time. Nonetheless, the wealthy business-leader Pedro Carmona declared himself president of an interim government.Marcano and Tyszka 2007. pp. 175–184. Carmona abolished the 1999 constitution and appointed a small governing committee to run the country. Protests in support of Chávez along with insufficient support for Carmona's regime, which many felt was implementing totalitarian measures, led to Carmona's resignation, and Chávez was returned to power on 14 April.Marcano and Tyszka 2007. pp. 181–185.
Chávez's reaction to the coup attempt was to moderate his approach, implementing a new economic team that appeared to be more centrist and reinstated the old board of directors and managers of the state oil company Petróleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA), whose replacement had been one of the reasons for the coup.Marcano and Tyszka 2007. pp. 185.Wilpert 2007. p. 24. At the same time, the Bolivarian government began preparing for potential future uprisings or even a US invasion by increasing the country's military capacity, purchasing 100,000 AK-47 assault rifles and several helicopters from Russia, as well as a number of Super Tucano light attack planes from Brazil. Troop numbers were also increased, with Chávez announcing in 2005 the government's intention to increase the number of military reserves from 50,000 to 2,000,000.Kozloff 2008. p. 71.
In December 2002, Chávez made political allies heads of PDVSA including Ali Rodriguez, a former Marxist guerrilla who he made president of PDVSA, replaced the company's board of directors with loyalists who had "little or no experience in the oil industry" and fired executives who complained.[tpl]cite news|last=Kahn|first=Jeremy|title=Pumping Trouble A strike in Venezuela has raised temperatures in Caracas and oil prices around the world.|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2003/02/03/336466/|accessdate=21 April 2014|newspaper=CNN|date=3 February 2003[/tpl] Chávez then faced a two-month management strike at the PDVSA when he initiated these management changes. Those involved in the strike said that the new management was "inexperienced and did not earn their jobs through the established merit-based promotion system, but were appointed only because they were Chavez allies."[tpl]cite news|last=Ceaser|first=Mike|title=Venezuelans hit by oil crisis|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1913893.stm|accessdate=21 April 2014|newspaper=BBC|date=5 April 2002[/tpl] However, pro-Chávez political analyst Gregory Wilpert noted that "While the opposition labelled this action a 'general strike', it was actually a combination of management lockout, administrative and professional employee strike, and general sabotage of the oil industry."Wilpert 2007. p. 25. The Chávez government's response was to fire about 19,000 striking employees for illegally abandoning their posts and then employing retired workers, foreign contractors, and the military to do their jobs instead. The Miami Herald reported from local officials in Venezuela that in the month following the replacement of workers, there were "at least 60 industrial accidents" including oil spills, at least 4,500 barrels of oil spilled, seven fires, the sinking of barges and the death of a worker. Firefighters and loss prevention experts for PDVSA reported that conditions were too hazardous and later joined the strike.[tpl]cite news|last=Robles|first=Frances|title=Oil accidents mount in Venezuela - Novice stand-ins blamed for chaos|accessdate=21 April 2014|newspaper=Miami Herald|date=21 January 2003[/tpl] Energy Security Analysis Inc (ESAI) claimed that after the strike, "the oil sector has struggled with inexperienced replacement workers and the burden of funding Chavez’ wide ranging populist initiatives" and that there were "stories of crumbling facilities and underused refining capacity".[tpl]cite news|title=MARKETS: Impact of Chavez’s death on Venezuela and the oil trade|url=http://energyasia.com/public-stories/markets-impact-of-chavezs-death-on-venezuela-and-the-oil-trade/|accessdate=21 April 2014|newspaper=Energy Asia|date=11 March 2013[/tpl] Wilpert explained that this move further damaged the strength of Chávez's opposition by removing the many managers in the oil industry who had been supportive of their cause to overthrow Chávez.
The 1999 constitution had introduced the concept of a recall referendum into Venezuelan politics, so the opposition called for such a referendum to take place. A 2004 referendum to recall Chávez was defeated. 70% of the eligible Venezuelan population turned out to vote, with 59% of voters deciding to keep the president in power.Cannon 2009. p. 64. Unlike his original 1998 election victory, this time Chávez's electoral support came almost entirely from the poorer working classes rather than the middle classes, who "had practically abandoned Chávez" after he "had consistently moved towards the left in those five and a half years".Wilpert 2007. p. 19. According to Cannon, some figures in the opposition movement began calling for the United States military to intervene and invade the country in order to topple Chávez.[tpl]dubious|date=April 2014[/tpl]

===="Socialism of the 21st century"====

The various attempts at overthrowing the Bolivarian government from power had only served to further radicalize Chávez. In January 2005, he began openly proclaiming the ideology of "Socialism of the 21st Century", something that was distinct from his earlier forms of Bolivarianism, which had been social democratic in nature, merging elements of capitalism and socialism. He used this new term to contrast the democratic socialism, which he wanted to promote in Latin America from the Marxist-Leninist socialism that had been spread by socialist states like the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China during the 20th century, arguing that the latter had not been truly democratic, suffering from a lack of participatory democracy and an excessively authoritarian governmental structure.
In May 2006, Chávez visited Europe in a private capacity, where he announced plans to supply cheap Venezuelan oil to poor working class communities in the continent. The Mayor of London Ken Livingstone welcomed him, describing him as "the best news out of Latin America in many years".The Observer 2006.

===Third presidential term: 10 January 2007 – 10 January 2013===

In the presidential election of December 2006, which saw a 74% voter turnout, Chávez was once more elected, this time with 63% of the vote, beating his closest challenger Manuel Rosales, who conceded his loss. The election was certified as being free and legitimate by the Organization of American States (OAS) and the Carter Center.International Crisis Group 2007. p. 01.BBC News 2006.[tpl]Cite news|title=Chávez wins Venezuelan election|publisher=Gulf News|url=http://archive.gulfnews.com/articles/06/12/04/10087134.html|date=4 December 2006|accessdate=30 December 2006[/tpl] After this victory, Chávez promised an "expansion of the revolution."Ireland On-Line.

====United Socialist Party of Venezuela and domestic policy====

On 15 December 2006, Chávez publicly announced that those leftist political parties who had continually supported him in the Patriotic Pole would unite into one single, much larger party, the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela, PSUV). In the speech which he gave announcing the PSUV's creation, Chávez declared that the old parties must "forget their own structures, party colours and slogans, because they are not the most important thing for the fatherland." According to political analyst Barry Cannon, the purpose of creating the PSUV was to "forge unity amongst the disparate elements the Bolivarian movement, providing grassroots input into policy and leadership formation, and uniting the grassroots and leadership into one single body."Cannon 2009. p. 60. It was hoped that by doing so, it would decrease the problems of clientelism and corruption and also leave the movement less dependent on its leadership: as Chávez himself declared, "In this new party, the bases will elect the leaders. This will allow real leaders to emerge."
Chávez had initially proclaimed that those leftist parties which chose to not dissolve into the PSUV would have to leave the government, however, after several of those parties supporting him refused to do so, he ceased to issue such threats.Cannon 2009. pp. 59–60. There was initially much grassroots enthusiasm for the creation of the PSUV, with membership having risen to 5.7 million people by 2007,Walter, Mathew. “Venezuela May Lower Voting Age, Add Gay Rights in Constitution.” Bloomberg. 11 October 2007.

In 2007, the Bolivarian government set up a constitutional commission in order to review the 1999 constitution and suggest potential amendments to be made to it. Led by the prominent pro-Chávez intellectual Luis Britto García, the commission came to the conclusion that the constitution could include more socially progressive clauses, such as the shortening of the working week, a constitutional recognition of Afro Venezuelans and the elimination of discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation. It also suggested measures that would have increased many of the president's powers, for instance increasing the presidential term limit to seven years, allowing the president to run for election indefinitely and centralizing powers in the executive. The government put the suggested changes to a public referendum in December 2007.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSN1526395420070816|title=Venezuela's Chávez calls for end to term limits|accessdate=16 August 2007|publisher=Reuters|date=16 August 2007|author=Ellsworth, Brian[/tpl] Abstention rate was high however, with 43.95% of registered voters not turning out, and in the end the proposed changes were rejected by 50.65% of votes.[tpl]Cite news|url= http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/04/world/americas/04venezuela.html |title= Venezuela Vote Sets Roadblocks on Chávez Path |work= New York Times |date = 4 December 2007 |accessdate=26 February 2010 |author= Romero, Simon[/tpl] This would prove to the first electoral loss that Chávez had faced in the thirteen electoral contests held since he took power, something analysts argued was due to the top-down nature of the changes, as well as general public dissatisfaction with "the absence of internal debate on its content, as well as dissatisfaction with the running of the social programmes, increasing street crime, and with corruption within the government."Cannon 2009. pp. 64–65.
In order to ensure that his Bolivarian Revolution became socially engrained in Venezuela, Chávez discussed his wish to stand for re-election when his term ran out in 2013, and spoke of ruling beyond 2030.Carroll 2009. Under the 1999 constitution, he could not legally stand for re-election again, and so brought about a referendum on 15 February 2009 to abolish the two-term limit for all public offices, including the presidency.Cannon 2009. p. 65. Approximately 70% of the Venezuelan electorate voted, and they approved this alteration to the constitution with over 54% in favor, allowing any elected official the chance to try to run indefinitely.[tpl]Cite news|author= Forero, Juan |date=16 February 2009 |url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/15/AR2009021500136.html |title= Chávez Wins Removal of Term Limits |work=The Washington Post[/tpl]

====Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas and the Bank of the South====

The Bolivarian government placed a great emphasis on providing financial and medical aid to the rest of Latin America, bolstered by the profits produced by the Venezuela oil industry: indeed, in the first eight months of 2007 alone, Venezuela spent $8.8 billion in doing so, something which was "unprecedented for a Latin American country" in terms of scale.Kozloff 2008. p. 45. Adding to this, the Chávez administration sought greater political, economic and military alliances with those Latin American countries who had seen leftist, and in particular socialist governments elected in the early 21st century.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.theworldreporter.com/2013/03/venezuela-after-chavez-who-will-lead-latin-america.html |title=Hugo Chavez; His Policies and Who Will Fill the Gap in Latin America? |publisher= The World Reporter |accessdate=10 March 2013[/tpl] The widespread success of left-leaning candidates at the time had led to what political analysts have described as a "pink tide" sweeping the region, although there was a great deal of diversity within this leftist trend. Those that became the closest allies of Bolivarian Venezuela were Evo Morales and his Movement for Socialism, which was elected into power in Bolivia in 2005, and Rafael Correa and his PAIS Alliance, who won the election in Ecuador in 2006.
It was alleged that Chavez's government gave money, weapons and support to the FARC, a rebel guerilla movement in Colombia known for extensive kidnappings and control of the drug trade. The suspicion of Venezuelan support was supposedly repeatedly confirmed. In 2005, captured laptops belonging to FARC leaders showed Chavez's involvement and support. The FARC rebels sought Venezuelan assistance in acquiring surface-to-air missiles.

In 2007, the socialist Daniel Ortega and his Sandinista National Liberation Front were elected into government in Nicaragua, and his administration immediately entered into deals with the Venezuelan government. On Ortega's first day in power, Chávez announced plans to aid the impoverished Central American country by forgiving the $30 million it owed Venezuela, and agreed to supply them with a further gift of $10 million in aid, as well as providing them with a $20-million loan with little or no interest and designed to benefit the country's poor.Carl 2007.
In 2004, Venezuela had been one of the founding states in the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas (ALBA).
As of 26 September 2009, Chávez, along with allies such as Argentina, Brazil and Bolivia, had set up a regional bank and development lender called Bank of the South, based in Caracas, an attempt to distance himself from financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund.

As the Arab Spring erupted across North Africa and the Middle East in 2010, Chávez openly criticised those leaders who had been backed by the U.S., such as Egypt's Hosni Mubarak, but at the same time championed those who had adhered to Arab socialist ideals, such as Syria's Bashar al-Assad, whom he called "a humanist and a brother" in spite of Assad's government's violent crackdown on protesters.[tpl]cite news|author=Otis, John |url=http://www.theworld.org/2011/06/hugo-chavez-arab-spring/|title=Hugo Chávez and the Arab Spring |publisher=The World |date= 20 June 2011 |accessdate=2 November 2011 | location=Boston[/tpl] Following the outbreak of the Libyan civil war, in which forces opposed to the socialist government rose up against the regime, Chávez, who had always had good international relations with Libya – describing its ceremonial leader Muammar Gaddafi as "a friend of mine" – offered to act as an intermediary between the government and the rebel-controlled National Transitional Council (NTC); however the latter declined the offer.Chulov 2011. During the subsequent 2011 military intervention in Libya, in which western forces attacked the Libyan army in support of the NTC, Chávez criticised the "indiscriminate bombing" of the country, accusing the United States of simply trying to "lay its hands on Libya's oil".BBC News 2011a.

On 7 October 2012, Chávez won election as president for a fourth time, and for the third time he won a six years term.

The inauguration of Chávez's new term was scheduled for 10 January 2013, but as he was undergoing medical treatment at the time in Cuba, he was not able to return to Venezuela for that date. The National Assembly president Diosdado Cabello proposed to postpone the inauguration and the Supreme Court decided that, being just another term of the sitting president and not the inauguration of a new one, the formality could be bypassed.

==Political ideology==

Hugo Chávez defined his political position as Bolivarianism, an ideology he developed from that of Simón Bolívar (1783–1830) and others. Bolívar was a 19th-century general who led the fight against the imperialist Spanish authorities and who is widely revered across Latin America today. Along with Bolívar, the other two primary influences upon Bolivarianism are Simón Rodríguez (1769–1854), a philosopher who was Bolívar's tutor and mentor, and Ezequiel Zamora, (1817–1860), the Venezuelan Federalist general.[tpl]Cite journal|last=Cameron|first=Maxwell|year=2001|title=Venezuela's Hugo Chávez: Savior or Threat to Democracy?|journal=Latin American Research Review|volume=36|issue=3|page=263[/tpl]. Online at http://www.injerencia.org/documentos/Venezuela/Articulos_Ingles/Chavez_Savior%20or%20Threat.pdf[tpl]Dead link|date=August 2010[/tpl] Political analyst Gregory Wilpert, in his study of Chávez's politics, noted that "The key ingredients for Chávez's revolutionary Bolivarianism can be summarized as: an emphasis on the importance of education, the creation of civilian-military unity, Latin American integration, social justice, and national sovereignty. In many ways this is not a particularly different set of principles and ideas to those of any other Enlightenment or national liberation thinker."Wilpert 2007 p. 16.
Although he was a leftist ever since his days at the military academy, after becoming president Chávez's political position progressed further left, rejecting both far-left ideologies like communism or marxism-leninism and moderate leftist ideologies like social democracy or the Third Way and instead embracing democratic socialism. He propagated what he called "socialism for the 21st century", but according to Gregory Wilpert, "Chávez has not clearly defined twenty-first century socialism, other than to say that it is about establishing liberty, equality, social justice, and solidarity. He has also indicated that it is distinctly different from state socialism", as implemented by the governments of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China.Wilpert 2007 p. 07. As a part of his socialist ideas, he emphasised the role of so-called "participatory democracy", which he claimed increased democratic participation, and was implemented through the foundation of the Venezuelan Communal Councils and Bolivarian Circles which he cited as examples of grassroots and participatory democracy.Sojo, Cleto A.

Chávez's connection to Marxism was a complex one. In May 1996, he gave an interview with Agustín Blanco Muñoz in which he remarked that "I am not a Marxist, but I am not anti-Marxist. I am not communist, but I am not anti-communist."Quoted in Jones 2007. p. 236. In a 2009 speech to the national assembly, he said: "I am a Marxist to the same degree as the followers of the ideas of Jesus Christ and the liberator of America, Simon Bolivar."http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSwUO-4oXjY He was well versed in many Marxist texts, having read the works of many Marxist theoreticians, and often publicly quoted them. Various international Marxists supported his government, believing it to be a sign of proletariat revolution as predicted in Marxist theory.See for instance Woods 2006 and Ali 2006. In 2010, Hugo Chávez proclaimed support for the ideas of Marxist Leon Trotsky, saying "When I called him (former Minister of Labour, José Ramón Rivero)" Chávez explained, "he said to me: 'president I want to tell you something before someone else tells you ... I am a Trotskyist', and I said, 'well, what is the problem? I am also a Trotskyist! I follow Trotsky's line, that of permanent revolution," and then cited Marx and Lenin.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6246219.stm | title=Chávez accelerates on path to socialism | date=10 January 2007 |work=BBC News | first=Nathalie | last=Malinarich[/tpl]http://www.marxist.com/chavez-trotskyist-president120107.htm

==Policy overview==

===Economic and social policy===

From his election in 1998 until his death in March 2013, Chávez's administration proposed and enacted democratic socialist economic policies.

Oil products were the keystone of the Venezuelan economy during Chávez's presidential period. Chávez gained a reputation as a price hawk in OPEC, pushing for stringent enforcement of production quotas and higher target oil prices. According to Cannon, the state income from oil revenue "increased from 51% of total income in 2000 to 56% 2006";Cannon, p. 87. oil exports "have grown from 77% in 1997 ... to 89% in 2006"; and "this dependence on oil is one of the chief problems facing the Chávez government". In 2012, the World Bank also explained that Venezuela's economy is "extremely vulnerable" to changes in oil prices since in 2012 "96% of the country’s exports and nearly half of its fiscal revenue" relied on oil production.[tpl]cite web|title=Venezuela Overview|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/venezuela/overview|publisher=World Bank|accessdate=13 April 2014[/tpl]
The economist Mark Weisbrot, in an analysis of the Chávez administration, said: "The current economic expansion began when the government got control over the national oil company in the first quarter of 2003.

On February 5, 2003, the government created CADIVI, a currency control board charged with handling foreign exchange procedures. Its creation was to control capital flight by placing limits on individuals and only offering them so much of a foreign currency.CADIVI, CADIVI, una medidia necesaria This limit to foreign currency led to a creation of a currency black market economy since Venezuelan merchants rely on foreign goods that require payments with reliable foreign currencies. As Venezuela printed more money for their social programs, the bolívar continued to devalue for Venezuelan citizens and merchants since the government held the majority of the more reliable currencies.[tpl]cite web|last=Hanke|first=Steve|title=The World's Troubled Currencies|url=http://www.marketoracle.co.uk/Article41552.html|publisher=The Market Oracle|accessdate=26 January 2014[/tpl]
As of January 2014, the official exchange rate is 1 USD to 6.3 VEF while the black market exchange rate is over ten times higher since the actual value of the bolívar is overvalued for Venezuelan businesses. Since merchants can only receive so much necessary foreign currency from the government, they must resort to the black market which in turn raises the merchant's prices on consumers.[tpl]cite news|last=Gupta|first=Girish|title=The ‘Cheapest’ Country in the World|url=http://world.time.com/2014/01/23/venezuelas-currency-controls-propels-those-with-connections/|accessdate=26 January 2014|newspaper=TIME|date=24 January 2014[/tpl] The high rates in the black market make it difficult for businesses to purchase necessary goods since the government often forces these businesses to make price cuts. 
This leads to businesses selling their goods and making a low profit, such as Venezuelan McDonald's franchises offering a Big Mac meal for only $1.[tpl]cite news|last=Pons|first=Corina|title=McDonald’s Agrees to Cut the Price of a Venezuelan Big Mac Combo|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-01-14/mcdonald-s-agrees-to-cut-the-price-of-a-venezuelan-big-mac-combo.html|accessdate=26 January 2014|newspaper=Bloomberg|date=14 January 2014[/tpl] Since businesses make low profits, this leads to shortages since they are unable import the goods that Venezuela is reliant on.

The price ceilings increased the demand for basic foods while making it difficult for Venezuela to import goods causing increased reliance on domestic production. According to some commentators this policy may have increased shortages.

In March 2009, the Venezuelan government set minimum production quotas for 12 basic foods that were subject to price controls, including white rice, cooking oil, coffee, sugar, powdered milk, cheese, and tomato sauce, which is intended to stop food companies from evading the law. Business leaders and food producers claimed that the government was forcing them to produce this food at a loss.Chávez boosts food price controls, BBC, 4 March 2009 Chávez expropriated and redistributed 5 million acres of farmland from large landowners, saying: "The land is not private. It is the property of the state... The land is for those who work it." But, the lack of basic resources made it difficult or impossible to make full use of the expropriated lands by its new tenants – leading to a lower overall degree of productivity in spite of a larger overall area of land under cultivation.In Venezuela, Land 'Rescue' Hopes Unmet, Washington Post, 20 June 2009
As part of his strategy of food security Chávez started a national chain of supermarkets, the Mercal network, which had 16,600 outlets and 85,000 employees that distributed food at highly discounted prices, and ran 6000 soup kitchens throughout the country. In 2008 the amount of discounted food sold through the network was 1.25 million metric tonnes, often sold at as much as 40% below the price ceiling set for privately own stores. Simultaneously Chávez expropriated many private supermarkets.A Food Fight for Hugo Chávez, Business Week, 11 March 2010 According to Commerce Minister Richard Canan, “The average savings for the basic food bundle (at the Mercal Bicentennial markets) is around 30%. There are some products, for example cheese and meat, which reach a savings of 50 to 60% compared with capitalist markets.”Popularity of State-Run Food Markets on the Rise. Venezuelanalysis.com. Retrieved 27 February 2012. The Mercal network was criticized by some commentators as being a part of Chávez's strategy to brand himself as a provider of cheap food, and the shops feature his picture prominently.

Between 2000 and 2007, 6,300 Venezuelan policemen were investigated for violations of human rights. Because decentralization of police was blamed for their ineffectiveness, the 1999 constitution required the National Assembly to form a national police force to fight crime; however, legislation on this became bogged down in numerous legislative discussions. In 2006, the government established the National Commission for Police Reform (Conarepol), in which a range of civil society representatives, politicians, and academics investigated law enforcement in Venezuela and made recommendations. This included setting up a national police force designed to operate with high standards of professionalism and specific training in human rights.

====Prisons====

During Chávez's presidency, there were reports of prisoners having easy access to firearms, drugs and alcohol. Carlos Nieto, head of Window to Freedom, alleges that heads of gangs acquire military weapons from the state saying, “They have the types of weapons that can only be obtained by the country’s armed forces. ... No one else has these.” Use of internet and mobile phones are also a commonplace where criminals can take part in street crime while in prison. One prisoner explained how, “If the guards mess with us, we shoot them” and that he had "seen a man have his head cut off and people play football with it.”[tpl]cite news|last=Gupta|first=Girish|title=In Venezuela’s prisons, inmates are the wardens|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/americas/venezuela/120511/inside-violent-venezuelan-prison-la-planta|accessdate=20 April 2014|newspaper=Global Post|date=14 May 2012[/tpl]
Edgardo Lander, a sociologist and professor at the Central University of Venezuela with a PhD in sociology from Harvard University explained that Venezuelan prisons are "practically a school for criminals" since young inmates come out "more sort of trained and hardened than when they went in". He also explained that prison are controlled by gangs and that "very little has been done" to control them.[tpl]cite news|last=Jay|first=Paul|title=The Modern History of Venezuela, Why Still So Much Crime? - Edgardo Lander on Reality Asserts Itself (7/9)|url=http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=31&Itemid=74&jumival=11760|accessdate=20 April 2014|newspaper=The Real News|date=19 April 2014[/tpl]
In some Venezuelan prisons, inmates partake in gladiatorial matches to settle disputes. In 2011, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights of the Organization of American States denounced the practice of "The Coliseum" saying "The Commission reiterates to the State the need to take immediate and effective steps to prevent such incidents from happening again" after 2 inmates died and 54 more were injured after from the practices.[tpl]cite web|title=IACHR Reiterates Need to Prevent Acts of Violence in Venezuelan Prison|url=http://www.oas.org/en/iachr/media_center/PReleases/2011/014.asp|publisher=Organization of American States|accessdate=20 April 2014[/tpl] However a year later, one "Coliseum" in Uribana left 2 dead and 128 injured.

Venezuelan rights groups report that the 34 prisons in Venezuela hold 50,000 people but are only supposed to hold about one-third of that.

===Corruption===

In December 1998, Hugo Chavez declared three goals for the new government; "convening a constituent assembly to write a new constitution, eliminating government corruption, and fighting against social exclusion and poverty". However, during Hugo Chávez's time in power, corruption has become widespread throughout the government due to impunity towards members of the government, bribes and the lack of transparency.[tpl]cite web|last=Coronel|first=Gustavo|title=Corruption, Mismanagement, and Abuse of Power in Hugo Chávez’s Venezuela|url=http://www.cato.org/publications/development-policy-analysis/corruption-mismanagement-abuse-power-hugo-chavezs-venezuela|publisher=Cato Institute[/tpl] In 2004, Hugo Chávez and his allies took over the Supreme Court, filling it with supporters of Chávez and made new measures so the government could dismiss justices from the court. According to the Cato Institute, the National Electoral Council of Venezuela was under control of Chávez where he tried to "push a constitutional reform that would have allowed him unlimited opportunities for reelection".[tpl]cite web|last=Coronel|first=Gustavo|title=The Corruption of Democracy in Venezuela|url=http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/corruption-democracy-venezuela|publisher=Cato Institute|accessdate=18 March 2014[/tpl] The Corruption Perceptions Index, produced annually by the Berlin-based NGO, Transparency International (TNI) reports findings of corruption in countries around the world.

Most Venezuelans believe the government's effort against corruption is ineffective, that corruption has increased, and that government institutions such as the judicial system, parliament, legislature and police are the most corrupt.[tpl]cite web|title=GLOBAL CORRUPTION BAROMETER 2010/11|url=http://www.transparency.org/country#VEN_PublicOpinion|publisher=Transparency International|accessdate=26 February 2014[/tpl]
In Gallup Poll's 2006 Corruption Index, Venezuela ranked 31st out of 101 countries according to how widespread the population perceive corruption as being in the government and in business. The index lists Venezuela as the second least corrupt nation in Latin America, behind Chile.Steve Crabtree and Nicole Naurath Gallup Launches Worldwide Corruption Index Gallup Poll News Service Accessed 21 Dec 2006. In August 2006, following assaults on a squatter and a National Assembly member, El Universal says that Chávez called on the latest Minister, Jesse Chacón to quit if he could not do the job, demanding more effort in the fight against corruption, and affirming the need to clean up and reform the local police forces. He questioned the impunity that exists in the country, and challenged authorities, like Chacón, to resign if they could not make progress against crime. He also called for greater protection of squatters settling on landed estates.Diaz, Sara Carolina.  Chávez exige acabar con latifundios.  El Universal  (7 August 2006). Some criticism came from Chávez's supporters. Chávez's own political party, Fifth Republic Movement (MVR), had been criticized as being riddled with the same cronyism, political patronage, and corruption that Chávez alleged were characteristic of the old "Fourth Republic" political parties. Venezuela's trade unionists and indigenous communities have participated in peaceful demonstrations intended to impel the government to facilitate labor and land reforms. These communities, while largely expressing their sympathy and support for Chávez, criticize what they see as Chávez's slow progress in protecting their interests against managers and mining concerns, respectively.Fuentes, F. (2005), "Challenges for Venezuela's Workers’ Movement". Green Left Weekly. Accessed 15 February 2006.Márquez, H. (2005), http://www.ipsnews.net/new_nota.asp?idnews=28150 Inter Press Service. Accessed 2 February 2006.Parma, A. Venezuela Analysis (2005a), "Pro-Chavez Union Leaders in Venezuela Urge Chavez to Do Better". Venezuela Analysis. Accessed 26 January 2006.

====Use of income and public funds====

From the beginning of Chávez's presidency to 2008, Venezuela had a total income of approximately $700 billion. During that time, Venezuela's debt increased from $22 billion to $70 billion. According to the Cato Institute, this large amount of money was "nowhere to be seen in terms of public works or effective health and education programs".
However, $22.5 billion of public funds were transferred from Venezuela to foreign accounts with half of that money being unaccounted for by anyone. José Guerra, a former Central Bank executive, claimed that most of that money has been used to buy political allies in countries such as Cuba and Bolivia. Chávez reportedly made promises and carried out most payments of nearly $70 billion USD to foreign leaders without the consultation of the people of Venezuela and without normal legal procedures.

====Aiding FARC====

According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), "Chavez's government funded FARC's office in Caracas and gave it access to Venezuela's intelligence services" and said that during the 2002 coup attempt that, "FARC also responded to requests from (Venezuela's intelligence service) to provide training in urban terrorism involving targeted killings and the use of explosives." The IISS continued saying that "the archive offers tantalizing but ultimately unproven suggestions that FARC may have undertaken assassinations of Chavez's political opponents on behalf of the Venezuelan state." Venezuelan diplomats denounced the IISS' findings saying that the had "basic inaccuracies".[tpl]cite news|last=Martinez|first=Michael|title=Study: Colombian rebels were willing to kill for Venezuela's Chavez|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/americas/05/10/venezuela.farc.documents/index.html|accessdate=21 April 2014|newspaper=CNN|date=10 May 2011[/tpl]
In 2007, authorities in Colombia claimed that through laptops they had seized on a raid against Raul Reyes, they found in documents that Hugo Chávez offered payments of as much as $300 million to the FARC "among other financial and political ties that date back years" along with other documents showing "high-level meetings have been held between rebels and Ecuadorean officials" and some documents claiming that FARC had "bought and sold uranium".[tpl]cite news|title=Colombia: Chavez funding FARC rebels|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-03-02-venezuelacolombia_N.htm?csp=34|accessdate=21 April 2014|newspaper=USA Today|date=4 March 2008[/tpl]

===Human rights===

In the 1999 Venezuelan constitution, 116 of 300 articles were concerned with human rights; these included increased protections for indigenous peoples and women, and established the rights of the public to education, housing, healthcare, and food. It called for dramatic democratic reforms such as ability to recall politicians from office by popular referendum, increased requirements for government transparency, and numerous other requirements to increase localized, participatory democracy, in favor of centralized administration. It gave citizens the right to timely and impartial information, community access to media, and a right to participate in acts of civil disobedience.
In 2008, Human Rights Watch released a report reviewing Chávez's human rights record over his first decade in power.Holland, Alisha. A decade under Chávez. New York: Human Rights Watch. 2008. p 1. The report praises Chávez's 1999 amendments to the constitution which significantly expanded human rights guarantees, as well as mentioning improvements in women's rights and indigenous rights, but noted a "wide range of government policies that have undercut the human rights protections established" by the revised constitution. In particular, the report accused Chávez and his administration of engaging in discrimination on political grounds, eroding the independence of the judiciary, and of engaging in "policies that have undercut journalists' freedom of expression, workers' freedom of association, and civil society's ability to promote human rights in Venezuela."Holland 2008, p 2. The Venezuelan government retaliated for the report by expelling members of Human Rights Watch from the country.BBC NEWS. Venezuela expels rights activists. (19 September 2008). Subsequently, over a hundred Latin American scholars signed a joint letter with the Council on Hemispheric Affairs criticizing the Human Rights Watch report for its alleged factual inaccuracy, exaggeration, lack of context, illogical arguments, and heavy reliance on opposition newspapers as sources, amongst other things.[tpl]cite press release|url=http://www.coha.org/taking-human-rights-watch-to-task/|title=Taking Human Rights Watch to Task on the Question of Venezuela’s Purported Abuse of Human Rights|publisher=Council on Hemispheric Affairs|date=18 December 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite press release|url=http://www.coha.org/scholars-respond-to-hrw-directors-riposte-on-venezuelan-human-rights/|title=Scholars Respond to HRW’s Kenneth Roth’s Riposte on Venezuelan Human Rights|publisher=Council on Hemispheric Affairs|date=12 January 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://venezuelanalysis.com/analysis/3882#report|title=Smoke and Mirrors: An Analysis of Human Rights Watch's Report on Venezuela|author=Gregory Wilpert|work=Venezuela Analysis[/tpl] The International Labor Organization of the United Nations expressed concern over voters being pressured to join the party.

Venezuelan Judge Maria Afiuni was arrested in 2009 on charges of corruption, after she ordered the conditional release on bail of banker Eligio Cedeño, who had been held on charges of fraud and other crimes due to alleged illegal currency trading activities. Some human rights officials alleged the arrest was politically motivated; Cedeño "had been in pretrial detention for nearly three years, despite a two-year limit prescribed by Venezuelan law". Cedeño later fled to the U.S. to avoid prosecution. Following Afiuni's arrest, several groups, including the United Nations, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, the Episcopal Conference of Venezuela, Human Rights Watch, the Law Society of England and Wales, the U.S. Department of State, and the European Union Parliament accused Chávez of "creating a climate of fear" among Venezuela's legal profession.[tpl]Cite news|url= http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6375A020100408 |work= Reuters |title= Rights group says Caracas attacks judicial freedom |date= 8 April 2010 | accessdate=6 August 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite press release |url=http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=33273&Cr=judges&Cr1 |title= Venezuelan leader violates independence of judiciary—UN rights experts |publisher= UN News Centre |date= 16 December 2009 |accessdate=14 April 2010[/tpl]"U.N. experts say Venezuela's Chávez creating fear."

Chávez refocused Venezuelan foreign policy on Latin American economic and social integration by enacting bilateral trade and reciprocal aid agreements, including his so-called "oil diplomacy"."Using oil to spread revolution" (retitled to "Venezuela and Latin America") The Economist, (28 July 2005). Retrieved 11 June 2005.Guyana Diary. (Monthly Newsletter of the Guyana Embassy, Caracas, Venezuela, February 2004). "Guyana to Try for Better Oil Rates Under Caracas Accord".[tpl]dead link|date=March 2013[/tpl]. Retrieved 14 June 2006." Under the Caracas Energy Accord, countries can purchase oil supplies on concessional terms. It complements the terms of the San Jose Agreement, through which Venezuela offers special financial conditions to signatory oil-buying countries." Chávez stated that Venezuela has "a strong oil card to play on the geopolitical stage ... It is a card that we are going to play with toughness against the toughest country in the world, the United States."Blum, Justin (22 November 2005). "Chávez Pushes Petro-Diplomacy". Washington Post. Retrieved 29 November 2005. Chávez focused on a variety of multinational institutions to promote his vision of Latin American integration, including Petrocaribe, Petrosur, and TeleSUR. Bilateral trade relationships with other Latin American countries also played a major role in his policy, with Chávez increasing arms purchases from Brazil, forming oil-for-expertise trade arrangements with Cuba, and creating unique barter arrangements that exchange Venezuelan petroleum for cash-strapped Argentina's meat and dairy products. Additionally, Chávez worked closely with other Latin American leaders following the 1997 Summit of the Americas in many areas – especially energy integration – and championed the OAS decision to adopt the Anti-Corruption Convention. Chávez participated in the United Nations Friends groups for Haiti, and pursued efforts to join and engage the Mercosur trade bloc to expand the hemisphere's trade integration prospects.[tpl]cite web|url=http://english.pravda.ru/russia/politics/10-09-2009/109196-chavez_moscow-0|title=Hugo Chávez in Moscow Thinks First, Then Speaks|accessdate=21 September 2009 |date=1 October 2009 |publisher=Pravda.ru[/tpl]

====Argentina====

In August 2007, Guido Alejandro Antonini Wilson, a self-identified member of the entourage of Hugo Chávez, who was about to visit Argentina, arrived in Argentina on a private flight paid for by Argentine and Venezuelan state officials. Wilson was carrying $800,000 USD in cash, which the police seized on arrival. A few days later Wilson, a Venezuelan-American and a close friend of Chávez's, was a guest at a signing ceremony involving Cristina Kirchner and Chávez at the Casa Rosada. He was later arrested on money laundering and contraband charges. It was alleged that the cash was to have been delivered to the Kirchner's as a clandestine contribution to Cristina's campaign chest from President Chávez. Fernández, as a fellow leftist, was a political ally of Chávez. This was seen as a similar move that Chávez allegedly used to give payments to leftist candidates in presidential races for Bolivia and Mexico in order to back his anti-US allies.[tpl]cite news|last=Padgett|first=Tim|title=Chávez and the Cash-Filled Suitcase|url=http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1838145,00.html|accessdate=28 March 2014|newspaper=TIME|date=3 September 2008[/tpl] The incident led to a scandal and what Bloomberg News called “an international imbroglio,” with the U.S. accusing five men of being secret Chávez agents whose mission was to cover up the attempt to deliver the cash.http://en.mercopress.com/2007/08/10/another-stashed-money-scandal-rocks-kirchner-s-administrationhttp://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=a73rBCz3iDho&refer=latin_america

====Iran====

Hugo Chávez and Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, respectively, both described themselves on the world stage as opposed to American imperialism. Citing this commonality of opinion, they formed a close alliance embarked on a number of initiatives together. On 6 January 2007, the two announced that they would use some money from a previously announced $2 billion joint fund to invest in other countries that were "attempting to liberate themselves from the imperialist yoke", in Chávez's words.Iran and Venezuela plan anti-U.S. fund, USA Today, 14 January 2007 The two presidents declared an "axis of unity" against "US imperialism".[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/07/02/us-iran-venezuela-idUSDAH23660020070702 | work=Reuters | title=Iran, Venezuela in 'axis of unity' against U.S. | date=2 July 2007[/tpl]

==Personal life==

Chávez married twice. He first wed Nancy Colmenares, a woman from a poor family in Chávez's hometown of Sabaneta. Chávez and Colmenares remained married for 18 years, during which time they had three children: Rosa Virginia, María Gabriela, and Hugo Rafael, the latter of whom suffers from behavioural problems.Marcano and Tyszka 2007. pp. 254–255. The couple separated soon after Chávez's 1992 coup attempt. During his first marriage, Chávez had an affair with historian Herma Marksman; their relationship lasted nine years.Byrne, Jennifer. "Venezuela – Bolivarian Revolution".Foreign Correspondent. 3 June 2003. Retrieved 11 November 2005.

Allegations were made that Chávez was a womanizer, and had been throughout both his marriages, but these have remained unproven and are contradicted by statements provided by other figures close to him.Marcano and Tyszka 2007. pp. 230–232.
Chávez was a Catholic. He intended at one time to become a priest. He saw his socialist policies as having roots in the teachings of Jesus Christ,"Chávez demands Pope apologize for Indian comments". Reuters. 19 May 2007. Retrieved 16 August 2010. (liberation theology) and he publicly used the slogan of "Christ is with the Revolution!"Chávez quoted in Marcano and Tyszka 2007. p. 140.

La Jornada. 12 February 2006. Retrieved 27 December 2006. Although he traditionally kept his own faith a private matter, Chávez over the course of his presidency became increasingly open to discussing his religious views, stating that both his faith and his version of Jesus' personal life and ideology had a profound impact on his liberation theology.

==Illness==

In June 2011, Chávez revealed in a televised address from Havana, Cuba, that he was recovering from an operation to remove an abscessed tumor with cancerous cells."President Chávez's address to the Nation". El Universal, 1 July 2011 Vice President Elías Jaua declared that the President remained in "full exercise" of power and that there was no need to transfer power due to his absence from the country."Venezuelan VP rules out declaring temporary absence of Chávez"[tpl]dead link|date=March 2013[/tpl] On 3 July, the Venezuelan government denied, however, that Chávez's tumour had been completely removed, further stating that he was heading for "complete recovery"."Maduro niega que haya secretismo sobre salud de Chávez"[tpl]dead link|date=March 2013[/tpl].

Chávez gave a public appearance on 28 July 2011, his 57th birthday, in which he stated that his health troubles had led him to radically reorient his life towards a "more diverse, more reflective and multi-faceted" outlook, and he went on to call on the middle classes and the private sector to get more involved in his Bolivarian Revolution, something he saw as "vital" to its success.BBC News 2011b. Soon after this speech, in August Chávez announced that his government would nationalize Venezuela's gold industry, taking it over from Russian-controlled company Rusoro, while at the same time also moving the country's gold stocks, which were largely stored in western banks, to banks in Venezuela's political allies like Russia, China and Brazil.The Guardian 2011.

However, on 27 February 2012, Wikileaks released an internal Stratfor email, dated 6 December 2011, that detailed the earlier cancer as well as putting the blame on his doctors and Chavez's personal habits. It also details the cause for his second trip to Cuba.
  "The tumor started as a growth close to the prostate. It spread to the colon, which is what led to a lot of confusion in the unknown about the treatment of prostate v. colon cancer in hormonal v. chemotherapy. A reliable source on the medical team has explained that the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes and into the bone marrow up to the spine, ie. very serious."

  "Chavez temporarily stopped the chemo in order to make an appearance at the recent CELAC meeting. The medical team is made up of both Russian and Cuban doctors. Both sides are clashing. The Russian team blamed the Cubans for an improper surgery the first time in trying to remove the tumor. The second surgery over the summer was basically the Russian team trying to clean up the Cuban team's mistakes. The Russians complain that the Cubans don't have the right imagery treatment to properly treat Chavez. The Cuban medical diagnosis is two years. The Russian medical diagnosis, due to improper medical equipment, is less than one year. The source on the medical team complains that Chavez is a very 'bad patient.' He doesn't listen to his doctors, and he ceases treatment when he has to make a public appearance. Now the Russian and the Chinese doctors are going at it because Chavez sought the advice of a Chinese doctor that advocates more natural treatments and the Russians are saying this is "horse shit treatment". Only Chavez can get the most politicized medical team in the world."
