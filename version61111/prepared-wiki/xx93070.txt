Pitof entered the film industry in 1976 as an assistant director and film editor. He branched out into visual effects in 1986 when he co-founded Duran Duboi, a successful post-production studio. He continued working as a visual effects supervisor and assistant director until 2001, when his directorial debut, the supernatural thriller film Vidocq was released. The film was notable for being the first motion picture to be shot using entirely digital cinematography. It was a commercial success despite receiving mixed reviews from film critics.http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/10001166-vidocq/
In 2003, Pitof made his English-language debut with Catwoman. Despite starring Oscar-winner Halle Berry and Sharon Stone, the film was universally panned by critics and was a box-office bomb.http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/catwoman/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=catwoman.htm Pitof won the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director, and the film has since come to be widely considered one of the worst movies ever made.
After the critical and commercial failure of Catwoman, Pitof continued working on commercials and short films. As of late 2013, he is in pre-production of a new film, tentatively entitled The Dragon Angel.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2678170/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_1
