[[Witch-hunt]]

CATEGORIES: Witch hunting, Informal legal terms, Crowd psychology, Political metaphors

A witch-hunt is a search for witches or evidence of witchcraft, often involving moral panic,[tpl]cite book|author1=Erich Goode|author2=Nachman Ben-Yehuda|title=Moral Panics: The Social Construction of Deviance|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=SbY2Mksi1kcC&pg=PA195|year=2010|publisher=Wiley |page=195[/tpl] or  mass hysteria.[tpl]cite book|author=Lois Martin|title=A Brief History of Witchcraft|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=mfPUIwtKG4cC&pg=PA5|year=2010|publisher=Running Press|page=5[/tpl] Before 1750 it was legally sanctioned and involving official witchcraft trials. The classical period of witchhunts in Europe and North America falls into the Early Modern period or about 1480 to 1750, spanning the upheavals of the Reformation and the Thirty Years' War, resulting in an estimated 40,000 to 60,000 executions.The most common estimates are between 40,000 and 60,000 deaths. Brian Levack (The Witch Hunt in Early Modern Europe) multiplied the number of known European witch trials by the average rate of conviction and execution, to arrive at a figure of around 60,000 deaths. Anne Lewellyn Barstow (Witchcraze) adjusted Levack's estimate to account for lost records, estimating 100,000 deaths. Ronald Hutton (Triumph of the Moon) argues that Levack's estimate had already been adjusted for these, and revises the figure to approximately 40,000.
The last executions of people convicted as witches in Europe took place in the 18th century. In the Kingdom of Great Britain, witchcraft ceased to be an act punishable by law with the Witchcraft Act of 1735. In Germany, sorcery remained punishable by law into the late 18th century. Contemporary witch-hunts have been reported from Sub-Saharan Africa, India and Papua New Guinea. Official legislation against witchcraft is still found in Saudi Arabia and Cameroon.
The term "witch-hunt" since the 1930s has also been in use as a metaphor to refer to moral panics in general (frantic persecution of perceived enemies). This usage is especially associated with the Second Red Scare of the 1950s, with the McCarthyist persecution of suspected communists in the United States.

==Anthropological causes==

The wide distribution of the practice of witch-hunts in geographically and culturally separated societies (Europe, Africa, India, New Guinea) since the 1960s has triggered interest in the anthropological background of this behaviour. The belief in magic and divination, and attempts to use magic to influence personal well-being (to increase life, win love, etc.) are human cultural universals.
Belief in witchcraft has been shown to have similarities in societies throughout the world. It presents a framework to explain the occurrence of otherwise random misfortunes such as sickness or death, and the witch sorcerer provides an image of evil.Jean Sybil La Fontaine, Speak of the devil: tales of satanic abuse in contemporary England, Cambridge University Press, 1998, ISBN 978-0-521-62934-8 34–37.
Reports on indigenous practices in the Americas, Asia and Africa collected during the early modern age of exploration have indeed been taken to suggest that not just the belief in witchcraft but also the periodic outbreak of witch-hunts are a human cultural universal.Behringer (2004), 50.

==History==

===Antiquity===

====Ancient Near East====

Punishment for malevolent sorcery is addressed in the earliest law codes preserved; both in ancient Egypt and in Babylonia it played a conspicuous part. The Code of Hammurabi (18th century BCE short chronology) prescribes that

====Classical Antiquity====

The pre-Christian Twelve Tables of pagan Roman law had provisions against evil incantations and spells intended to damage cereal crops. In 331 BC, 170 women were executed as witches in the context of an epidemic illness. Livy emphasizes that this was a scale of persecution without precedent in Rome. In 184 BC, about 2,000 people were executed for witchcraft (veneficium), and in 182–180 BC another 3,000 executions took place, again triggered by the outbreak of an epidemic. There is no way to verify the figures reported by Roman historians, but if they are taken at face value,[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl] the scale of the witch-hunts in the Roman Republic in relation to the population of Italy at the time far exceeded anything that took place during the "classical" witch-craze in Early Modern Europe.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl] Persecution of witches continued in the Roman Empire until the late 4th century AD and abated only after the introduction of Christianity as the Roman state religion in the 390s.Behringer (2004), 48–50.
The Lex Cornelia de sicariis et veneficiis promulgated by Lucius Cornelius Sulla in the 2nd century BC became an important source of late medieval and early modern European law on witchcraft. Strabo, Gaius Maecenas and Cassius Dio all reiterate the traditional Roman opposition against sorcery and divination, and Tacitus used the term religio-superstitio to class these outlawed observances. The emperor Augustus strengthened legislation aimed at curbing these practices.[tpl]cite book |author=Garnsey, Peter; Saller, Richard P. |title=The Roman Empire: Economy, Society, and Culture |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley and Los Angeles, California |year=1987 |pages=168–174 |isbn=0-520-06067-9 [/tpl]
The Hebrew Bible condemns sorcery. Deuteronomy 18:10–12 states "No one shall be found among you who makes a son or daughter pass through fire, who practices divination, or is a soothsayer, or an augur, or a sorcerer, or one that casts spells, or who consults ghosts or spirits, or who seeks oracles from the dead. For whoever does these things is abhorrent to the Lord;" and Exodus 22:18 prescribes "thou shalt not suffer a witch to live";"witch" here translates the Hebrew [tpl]lang|he|מכשפה[/tpl], and is rendered [tpl]lang|grc|φαρμακός[/tpl] in the Septuagint. tales like that of 1 Samuel 28, reporting how Saul "hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land""those that have familiar spirits": Hebrew [tpl]lang|he|אוב[/tpl], or [tpl]lang|grc|ἐγγαστρίμυθος[/tpl] "ventriloquist, soothsayer" in the Septuagint; "wizards": Hebrew [tpl]lang|he|ידעני[/tpl] or [tpl]lang|grc|γνώστης[/tpl] "diviner" in the Septuagint. suggest that in practice sorcery could at least lead to exile.
In the Judaean Second Temple period, Rabbi Simeon ben Shetach in the 1st century BC is reported to have sentenced to death eighty women who had been charged with witchcraft on a single day in Ashkelon. Later the women's relatives took revenge by bringing (reportedly) false witnesses against Simeon's son and causing him to be executed in turn.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2008[/tpl]

====Late Antiquity====

The 6th century AD Getica of Jordanes records a persecution and expulsion of witches among the Goths in a mythical account of the origin of the Huns. The ancient fabled King Filimer is said to have

===Middle Ages===

The Councils of Elvira (306), Ancyra (314) and in Trullo (692) imposed certain ecclesiastical penances for devil-worship and this mild approach represented the view of the Church for many centuries.
The general desire of the Catholic Church's clergy to check fanaticism about witchcraft and necromancy is shown in the decrees of the Council of Paderborn which in 785 explicitly outlawed condemning people as witches, and condemned to death anyone who burnt a witch. Emperor Charlemagne later confirmed the law. The Council of Frankfurt in 794, called by Charlemagne, was also very explicit in condemning "the persecution of alleged witches and wizards", calling the belief in witchcraft "superstitious", and ordering the death penalty for those who presumed to burn witches.http://medspains.stanford.edu/demo/themes/adoptionism/frankfurt.html
Similarly, the Lombard code of 643 states:
This conforms to the teachings of the Canon Episcopi of circa 900 AD (alleged to date from 314 AD), following the thoughts of St Augustine of Hippo which stated that witchcraft did not exist and that to teach that it was a reality was, itself, false and heterodox teaching.
King Kálmán (Coloman) of Hungary, in his First Legislative Book, Decree 57,file:///C:/Users/Christopher/Pictures/K%C3%A1lm%C3%A1n%20Kir%C3%A1ly%20Dekr%C3%A9tomainak%20Els%C5%91%20K%C3%B6nyve%20_%201000%20%C3%A9v%20t%C3%B6rv%C3%A9nyei.htm[tpl]clarify|date=April 2014[/tpl] published in 1100, also referenced here http://bibleapologetics.wordpress.com/tag/witch-hunts-2/#_ftnref17 in English, banned witch hunting because he said, "witches do not exist".
The "Decretum" of Burchard, Bishop of Worms (about 1020), and especially its 19th book, often known separately as the "Corrector", is another work of great importance. Burchard was writing against the superstitious belief in magical potions, for instance, which may produce impotence or abortion. But he altogether rejected the possibility of many of the alleged powers with which witches were popularly credited. Such, for example, were nocturnal riding through the air, the changing of a person's disposition from love to hate, the control of thunder, rain, and sunshine, the transformation of a man into an animal, the intercourse of incubi and succubi with human beings and other such superstitions. Not only the attempt to practise such things but the very belief in their possibility is treated by Burchard as false and superstitious.
Pope Gregory VII in 1080 wrote to King Harald III of Denmark forbidding witches to be put to death upon presumption of their having caused storms or failure of crops or pestilence. Neither were these the only examples of an effort to prevent unjust suspicion to which such poor creatures might be exposed. See for example the Weihenstephan case discussed by Weiland in the Zeitschrift fuer Kirchengeschichte, IX, 592.
Early secular laws against witchcraft, include those promulgated by King Athelstan (924–939)
In some prosecutions for witchcraft torture (permitted by the Roman civil law) apparently took place. However, Pope Nicholas I (866), prohibited the use of torture altogether, and a similar decree may be found in the Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals.article, Catholic Encyclopaedia, 1911, on the New Advent website
On many different occasions ecclesiastics who spoke with authority did their best to disabuse the people of their superstitious belief in witchcraft. This, for instance, is the general purport of the book, "Contra insulsam vulgi opinionem de grandine et tonitruis" (Against the foolish belief of the common sort concerning hail and thunder), written by Saint Agobard (d. 841), Archbishop of Lyons.Migne, Patrologia Latina, CIV, 147]
The manuals of the Roman Catholic Inquisition remained highly sceptical of the witch craze and of witch accusations, although there was sometimes an overlap between accusations of heresy and of witchcraft, particularly when, in the 13th century, the newly formed Inquisition was commissioned to deal with the Cathars of Southern France, whose teachings were charged with containing an admixture of witchcraft and magic.
Although it has been proposed that the witch-hunt developed in Europe from the early 14th century, after the Cathars and the Templar Knights were suppressed, this hypothesis has been rejected independently by two historians (Cohn 1975; Kieckhefer 1976).
They contend that the early witch-hunts originated among common people in the Switzerland and in the Croatia, who pressed the civil courts to support them.
Although Pope John XXII had authorized the Inquisition to prosecute sorcerers in 1320,Jeffrey Burton Russell, A History of Medieval Christianity (173). inquisitorial courts rarely dealt with witchcraft save incidentally when investigating heterodoxy.
Most inquisitors simply disbelieved in witchcraft and sorcery as superstitious folly.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl] In the case of the Madonna Oriente, the Inquisition of Milan was not sure what to do with two women who in 1384 and in 1390 confessed to have participated in a type of white magic. The women were released with advice to avoid superstitions.
A Catholic figure who preached against witchcraft was popular Franciscan preacher, Bernardino of Siena (1380–1444).
Once again, there seems to have been a phenomenon of superstitious practices and an over-reaction against them by the common people pressing Church and State to act.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl] Bernardino's sermons reveal this phenomenon.See Franco Mormando, The Preacher's Demons: Bernardino of Siena and the Social Underworld of Early Renaissance Italy, Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1999, Chapter 2.  However, it is clear that Bernardino had in mind not merely the use of spells and enchantments and such like fooleries but much more serious crimes, chiefly murder and infanticide. This is clear from his much-quoted sermon of 1427, in which he says:
In 1484, in the Late Middle Ages, Pope Innocent VIII issued Summis desiderantes affectibus, a Papal bull authorizing the "correcting, imprisoning, punishing and chastising" of devil-worshippers who have "slain infants", among other crimes. He did so at the request of two inquisitors, Heinrich Kramer and Jacob Sprenger, members of the Dominican Order, who had been refused permission by the local bishops in Germany to investigate.Levack, The Witch-Hunt in Early Modern Europe, (49)
In 1487, Kramer and Sprenger published the notorious Malleus Maleficarum (the 'Hammer against the Witches') which, because of the newly invented printing presses, enjoyed a wide readership. The book was soon banned by the Church in 1490, and Kramer and Sprenger censured, but it was nevertheless reprinted in 14 editions by 1520 and became unduly influential in the secular courts. In 1538 the Spanish Inquisition cautioned its members not to believe what the Malleus said, even when it presented apparently firm evidence.Jolly, Raudvere, & Peters(eds.), "Witchcraft and magic in Europe: the Middle Ages", page 241 (2002)

===Early Modern Europe===

The witch trials in Early Modern Europe came in waves and then subsided. There were trials in the 15th and early 16th centuries, but then the witch scare went into decline, before becoming a major issue again and peaking in the 17th century.  What had previously been a belief that some people possessed supernatural abilities (which were sometimes used to protect the people) now became a sign of a pact between the people with supernatural abilities and the devil. To justify the killings, Protestant Christianity and its proxy secular institutions deemed witchcraft as being associated to wild Satanic ritual parties in which there was much naked dancing, and cannibalistic infanticide.The Dark Side of Christian History by Helen Ellerbe. It was also seen as heresy for going against the first of the ten commandments (You shall have no other gods before me) or as violating majesty, in this case referring to the divine majesty, not the worldly.Meewis, Wim (1992) De Vierschaar, Uitgevering Pelckmans, p. 115. Further, scripture specifically decreed that "thou shalt not suffer a witch to live" (Exodus 22:18), which many believed.
Witch-hunts were seen across early modern Europe, but the most significant area of witch-hunting in modern Europe is often considered to be central and southern Germany.H. C. Erik Midelfort, “Heartland of the Witchcraze: Central and Northern Europe,” History Today 31 (February 1981): 27–31. Germany was a late starter in terms of the numbers of trials, compared to other regions of Europe. Witch-hunts first appeared in large numbers in southern France and Switzerland during the 14th and 15th centuries. The peak years of witch-hunts in southwest Germany were from 1561 to 1670.H. C. Erik Midelfort, Witch Hunting in Southwestern Germany 1562–1684,1972,71. The first major persecution in Europe, when witches were caught, tried, convicted, and burned in the imperial lordship of Wiesensteig in southwestern Germany, is recorded in 1563 in a pamphlet called "True and Horrifying Deeds of 63 Witches".Behringer (2004), p. 83.
In Denmark, the burning of witches increased following the reformation of 1536. Christian IV of Denmark, in particular, encouraged this practice, and hundreds of people were convicted of witchcraft and burnt. In England, the Witchcraft Act of 1542 regulated the penalties for witchcraft. In the North Berwick witch trials in Scotland, over 70 people were accused of witchcraft on account of bad weather when James VI of Scotland, who shared the Danish king's interest in witch trials, sailed to Denmark in 1590 to meet his betrothed Anne of Denmark. The Pendle witch trials of 1612 are among the most famous witch trials in English history.Follow the Pendle Witches trail BBC Retrieved 26 March 2011.
Witch hysteria also erupted in the Americas. In 1645, 46 years before the Salem witch trials, Springfield, Massachusetts experienced America's first accusations of witchcraft when husband and wife Hugh and Mary Parsons accused each other of witchcraft. At America's first witch trial, Hugh was found innocent, while Mary was acquitted of witchcraft but sentenced to be hanged for the death of her child. She died in prison.http://www.masslive.com/history/index.ssf/2011/05/springfields_375th_from_puritans_to_presidents.html About eighty people throughout England's Massachusetts Bay Colony were accused of practicing witchcraft- thirteen women and two men were executed in a witch-hunt that lasted throughout New England from 1645–1663.Fraden, Judith Bloom, Dennis Brindell Fraden. The Salem Witch Trials. Marshall Cavendish. 2008. p. 15. The Salem witch trials followed in 1692–93.
Once a case was brought to trial, the prosecutors hunted for accomplices. Magic was not considered to be wrong because it failed, but because it worked effectively for the wrong reasons. Witchcraft was a normal part of everyday life. Witches were often called for, along with religious ministers, to help the ill or to deliver a baby. They held positions of spiritual power in their communities. When something went wrong, no one questioned the ministers or the power of the witchcraft. Instead, they questioned whether the witch intended to inflict harm or not.[tpl]cite book|last=Wallace|first=Peter G.|title=The Long European Reformation|year=2004|publisher=PALGRAVE MACMILLAN|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-333-64451-5|pages=210–215[/tpl]
Current scholarly estimates of the number of people executed for witchcraft vary between about 40,000 and 100,000. The total number of witch trials in Europe which are known to have ended in executions is around 12,000.[tpl]cite web |title=Estimates of executions |url=http://www.summerlands.com/crossroads/remembrance/current.htm [/tpl] Based on Ronald Hutton's essay Counting the Witch Hunt.
Prominent contemporaneous critics of witch hunts included Gianfrancesco Ponzinibio (fl. 1520), Johannes Wier (1515–1588), Reginald Scot (1538–1599), Cornelius Loos (1546–1595), Anton Praetorius (1560–1613), Alonso Salazar y Frías (1564–1636), Friedrich Spee (1591–1635), and Balthasar Bekker (1634–1698).Charles Alva Hoyt, Witchcraft, Southern Illinois University Press, 2nd edition, 1989, pp. 66–70, ISBN 0-8093-1544-0.

====Execution statistics====

Some authors claim that millions of witches were killed in Europe,Gaskill, Malcolm Witchcraft, a very short introduction, Oxford University Press, 2010, p.65 while modern scholarly estimates place the total number of executions for witchcraft in the 300-year period of European witch-hunts far lower.  William Monter estimates 35,000 deaths (see table below), historian Malcolm Gaskill 40,000–50,000.Gaskill, Malcolm Witchcraft, a very short introduction, Oxford University Press, 2010, p.76 About 75 to 80 percent of those were women.[tpl]cite book|first=Robert |last=Rapley |year=1998 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=oAoNAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA99&dq=witchcraft+40000+women&hl=en&ei=T06_TvmJG4P20gH3uaT5BA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=book-thumbnail&resnum=7&ved=0CFAQ6wEwBg#v=onepage&q=witchcraft%2040000%20women&f=false | title=A case of witchcraft: the trial of Urbain Grandier[/tpl]

===End of European witch hunts in the 18th century===

In England, Scotland and Ireland, between 1542 and 1735 a series of Witchcraft Acts enshrined into law the punishment (often with death, sometimes with incarceration) of individuals practising, or claiming to practice witchcraft and magic.[tpl]cite book |first=M |last=Gibson |contribution=Witchcraft in the Courts |pages=1–18 |editor-first=Marion |editor-last=Gibson |title=Witchcraft And Society in England And America, 1550–1750 |year=2006 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-8264-8300-3[/tpl] The last executions for witchcraft in England had taken place in 1682, when Temperance Lloyd, Mary Trembles, and Susanna Edwards were executed at Exeter. In 1711, Joseph Addison published an article in the highly respected The Spectator journal (No. 117) criticizing the irrationality and social injustice in treating elderly and feeble women (dubbed Moll White) as witches.[tpl]cite book |isbn=0-7661-4536-0 |last=Summers |first=M |title=Geography of Witchcraft |pages= 153–60 |year=2003 |publisher=Kessinger Publishing [/tpl] Jane Wenham was among the last subjects of a typical witch trial in England in 1712, but was pardoned after her conviction and set free.

The final Act of 1735 led to persecution for fraud rather than witchcraft since it was no longer believed that the individuals had actual supernatural powers or traffic with Satan. The 1735 Act continued to be used until the 1940s to prosecute individuals such as spiritualists and Gypsies. The act was finally repealed in 1951.

Both women have been identified as the last person executed for witchcraft in Europe, but in both cases, the official verdict did not mention witchcraft, as this had ceased to be recognized as a criminal offense.

==Modern witch-hunts==

Witch hunts still occur today in societies where belief in magic is prevalent. In most cases, these are instances of lynching and burnings, reported with some regularity from much of Sub-Saharan Africa, from rural North India and from Papua New Guinea. In addition, there are some countries that have legislation against the practice of sorcery. The only country where witchcraft remains legally punishable by death is Saudi Arabia.
The witch hunts in modern times are continuously reported by the UNHCR of the UNO as massive violation of human rights. Most affected by witch accusation are women and children and additional elder people and outsider groups of the community: albinos and HIV-infected.UNHCR Research Paper No. 169 Witchcraft allegations, refugee protection and human rights: a review of the evidence, January 2009 Poverty, epidemic, social crises and missing education support witch hunt as well as the economical benefit of the hunter and their leader, often a prominent figure in the community or a "witch doctor", earn by exorcism or sell body parts of the murdered.UNHCR Research Paper No. 197 Breaking the spell: responding to witchcraft accusations against children, January 2011UNHCR Research Paper No. 235 Seeking meaning: an anthropological and community-based approach to witchcraft accusations and their prevention in refugee situations, May 2012

Audrey I. Richards, in the journal Africa, relates in 1935 an instance when a new wave of witchfinders, the Bamucapi, appeared in the villages of the Bemba people of Zambia.A Modern Movement of Witch Finders Audrey I Richards (Africa: Journal of the International Institute of African Languages and Cultures, Ed. Diedrich Westermann.) Vol VIII, 1935, published by Oxford University Press, London. They dressed in European clothing, and would summon the headman to prepare a ritual meal for the village. When the villagers arrived they would view them all in a mirror, and claimed they could identify witches with this method. These witches would then have to "yield up his horns"; i.e. give over the horn containers for curses and evil potions to the witch-finders. The bamucapi then made all drink a potion called kucapa which would cause a witch to die and swell up if he ever tried such things again.
The villagers related that the witch-finders were always right because the witches they found were always the people whom the village had feared all along. The bamucapi utilised a mixture of Christian and native religious traditions to account for their powers and said that God (not specifying which God) helped them to prepare their medicine. In addition, all witches who did not attend the meal to be identified would be called to account later on by their master, who had risen from the dead, and who would force the witches by means of drums to go to the graveyard, where they would die. Richards noted that the bamucapi created the sense of danger in the villages by rounding up all the horns in the village, whether they were used for anti-witchcraft charms, potions, snuff or were indeed receptacles of black magic.
The Bemba people believed misfortunes such as wartings, hauntings and famines to be just actions sanctioned by the High-God Lesa. The only agency which caused unjust harm was a witch, who had enormous powers and was hard to detect. After white rule of Africa, beliefs in sorcery and witchcraft grew, possibly because of the social strain caused by new ideas, customs and laws, and also because the courts no longer allowed witches to be tried.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2008[/tpl]
Amongst the Bantu tribes of Southern Africa, the witch smellers were responsible for detecting witches. In parts of Southern Africa, several hundred people have been killed in witch hunts since 1990.Christian responses to witchcraft and sorcery.
Several African states,"Whereas witchcraft cases in the colonial era, especially in former British Central Africa, were based on the official dogma that witchcraft is an illusion (so that people invoking witchcraft would be punished as either impostors or slanderers), in contemporary legal practice in Africa witchcraft appears as a reality and as an actionable offence in its own right." Wim van Binsbergen, Witchcraft in Modern Africa (2002). including Cameroonsection 251 of the Cameroonian penal code (26 August 2004). Two other provisions of the penal code translation "state that witchcraft may be an aggravating factor for dishonest acts" (Afrik.com 26 Aug 2004).

In Sierra Leone, the witch-hunt is an occasion for a sermon by the kɛmamɔi (native Mende witch-finder) on social ethics : "Witchcraft ... takes hold in people’s lives when people are less than fully open-hearted. All wickedness is ultimately because people hate each other or are jealous or suspicious or afraid. These emotions and motivations cause people to act antisocially".Studia Instituti Anthropos, Vol. 41. Anthony J. Gittins : Mende Religion. Steyler Verlag, Nettetal, 1987. p. 197. The response by the populace to the kɛmamɔi is that "they valued his work and would learn the lessons he came to teach them, about social responsibility and cooperation."Studia Instituti Anthropos, Vol. 41. Anthony J. Gittins : Mende Religion. Steyler Verlag, Nettetal, 1987. p. 201.

===India===

In India, labeling a woman as a witch is a common ploy to grab land, settle scores or even to punish her for turning down sexual advances. In a majority of the cases, it is difficult for the accused woman to reach out for help and she is forced to either abandon her home and family or driven to commit suicide. Most cases are not documented because it's difficult for poor and illiterate women to travel from isolated regions to file police reports. Less than 2 percent of those accused of witch-hunting are actually convicted, according to a study by the Free Legal Aid Committee, a group that works with victims in the state of Jharkhand.Womensnews.org.
A 2010 estimate places the number of women killed as witches in India at between 150 and 200 per year, or a total of 2,500 in the period of 1995 to 2009.[ref]The Hindu, Nearly 200 women killed every year after being branded witches, 26 July 2010. Herald Sun,

===Papua New Guinea===

Though the practice of "white" magic (such as faith healing) is legal in Papua, the 1976 Sorcery Act imposes a penalty of up to 2 years in prison for the practice of "black" magic. In 2009, the government reports that extrajudicial torture and murder of alleged witches – usually lone women – are spreading from the highland areas to cities as villagers migrate to urban areas.Channel4.com. For example, in June 2013, four women were accused of witchcraft because the family "had a 'permanent house' made of wood, and the family had tertiary educations and high social standing".[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.yahoo.com/witch-hunts-papua-guinea-linked-jealousy-054301668.html | title=Witch hunts in Papua New Guinea linked to jealousy | agency=Associated Press | date=10 June 2013 | accessdate=10 June 2013 | author=McGuirk, Rod[/tpl] All of the women were tortured and Helen Rumbali was beheaded.

==Metaphorical usage==

In modern terminology 'witch-hunt' has acquired usage referring to the act of seeking and persecuting any perceived enemy, particularly when the search is conducted using extreme measures and with little regard to actual guilt or innocence. It is used whether or not it is sanctioned by the government, or merely occurs within the "court of public opinion".
The first such use reported by the Oxford English Dictionary dates to 1932.[ref]
J. F. Carter, What we are about to Receive (xviii. 204): "Once the election is over ... we shall quietly lay aside our witch hunting."[/ref] Another early instance is George Orwell's Homage to Catalonia (1938). The term is used by Orwell to describe how, in the Spanish Civil War, political persecutions became a regular occurrence.
The term is used when a hunt for wrongdoers becomes abused, and a defendant can be convicted merely on an accusation. For example, in the History Channel documentary America: The Story of Us, narrator Liev Schreiber explains that "the search for runaway slaves becomes a witch hunt. A black man can be convicted with merely an accusation. Unlike white people, they do not have the right to trial by jury. Judges are paid ten dollars to rule them as slaves, five to set them free."[tpl]cite video |people=Liev Schreiber |title=America: The Story of Us – Division |medium=Television |publisher=Nutopia |date=2 May 2010[/tpl]
Use of the term was popularized in the United States in the context of the McCarthyist search for communists during the Cold War,[tpl]cite book |first=Gary F. |last=Jensen |title=The Path of the Devil |pages=Ch. 8 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |year=2007 |isbn=0-7425-4697-7[/tpl][tpl]cite book |last=Murphy |first=Brenda |title=Congressional Theatre |pages=Ch. 4 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1999 |isbn=0-521-89166-3[/tpl] which was discredited partly through being compared to the Salem witch trials. Arthur Miller's The Crucible is notable for using the Salem Witch Trials as an extended metaphor for McCarthyism.
From the 1960s, the term was in wide use and could also be applied to isolated incidents or scandals, specifically public smear-campaigns against individuals. The phenomenon of day care sex abuse hysteria, most notably the McMartin preschool trial of 1984 to 1990, is another iconic example of a moral panic which saw day care providers accused of what was dubbed "satanic ritual abuse", i.e. the charge of physical and sexual child abuse out of an alleged Satanist motivation. The case and the associated media coverage has been frequently termed a witch-hunt by commentators and social researchers.[tpl]cite book |last=de Young |first=Mary |title=The Day Care Ritual Abuse Moral Panic |authorlink=Mary de Young |url=http://books.google.com/?id=_e8ZkJBtz0EC |year=2004 |publisher=McFarland and Company |location=Jefferson, North Carolina, United States |isbn=0-7864-1830-3 [/tpl] More generally the societal reaction to child sexual abuse has been criticized as a witch-hunt by some academics and commentators since the early 1990s.[tpl]cite journal|title=Modern witch hunt – child abuse charges|journal= PEDIATRICS|volume=93|issue=4|date=1 April 1994|page=635|accessdate=2011-05-24|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/93/4/635.abstract |publisher=American Academy of Pediatrics[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=Hans Sebald|title=Witch-children: From Salem Witch-Hunts to Modern Courtrooms|authorlink= Hans Sebald|publisher=Prometheus Books|year=1995|isbn=978-0-87975-965-0[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Scandal of child abuse 'witch-hunt'|newspaper=Daily Post|date=15 May 2002|author=Tariq Tahir|accessdate=2011-05-24|url=http://iccheshireonline.icnetwork.co.uk/0100news/0100regionalnews/page.cfm?objectid=11871955&method=full&siteid=50020[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Abuse witch-hunt traps innocent in a net of lies|newspaper=The Observer|authors=David Rose, Gary Horne|date=26 November 2000|accessdate=2011-05-24|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2000/nov/26/socialcare.childrensservices[/tpl]
