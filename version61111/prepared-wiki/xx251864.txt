Parma railway station ([tpl]lang-it|Stazione di Parma[/tpl]) serves the city and comune of Parma, in the region of Emilia-Romagna, northern Italy.  Opened in 1859, it forms part of the Milanâ€“Bologna railway, and is also a terminus of three secondary railways, linking Piacenza with La Spezia, Sarzana, Brescia and Suzzara, respectively.
The station is currently managed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI).  However, the commercial area of the passenger building is managed by Centostazioni.  Train services on all lines other than the secondary line to Suzzara are operated by Trenitalia. Each of these companies is a subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), Italy's state-owned rail company.
Train services on the line to Suzzara are operated by Ferrovie Emilia Romagna (FER), which is owned by the region of Emilia-Romagna and a number of its provinces.
