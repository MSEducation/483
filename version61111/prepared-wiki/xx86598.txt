[[Web Services Interoperability]]

CATEGORIES: Web services, Interoperability

The Web Services Interoperability Organization (WS-I) is an industry consortium chartered to promote interoperability amongst the stack of web services specifications. WS-I does not define standards for web services; rather, it creates guidelines and tests for interoperability.  It has recently become part of OASIS, another standards body.
It is governed by a Board of Directors consisting of the founding members (IBM, Microsoft, BEA Systems, SAP, Oracle, Fujitsu, Hewlett-Packard, and Intel) and two elected members (currently, Sun Microsystems and webMethods). Since joining OASIS, other organizations have joined the WS-I technical committee including CA Technologies, JumpSoft and Booz Allen Hamilton. 
The organization's deliverables include profiles, sample applications that demonstrate the profiles' use, and test tools to help determine profile conformance.

==WS-I Profiles==

According to WS-I, a profile is
 A set of named web services specifications at specific revision levels, together with a set of implementation and interoperability guidelines recommending how the specifications may be used to develop interoperable web services. 
 

==WS-I Profile Compliance==

The WS-I is not a certifying authority; thus, every vendor can claim to be compliant to a profile. However the use of the test tool is required before a company can claim a product to be compliant. See WS-I Trademarks and Compliance claims requirements
In a 2003 interview,  the WS-I spokesman said even if every companies are free to claim compliance unfaithfully, he expects companies to be honest:
 "We expect enforcement of that brand to be market-driven. We suspect no one wants to be the first person to be called on for making a bad claim." http://www.internetnews.com/dev-news/article.php/2247551
