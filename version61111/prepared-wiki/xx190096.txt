CATEGORIES: Software for teachers

Computer-aided assessment (or "computer-assisted assessment") is a term that covers all forms of assessment, whether summative (i.e. tests that will contribute to formal qualifications) or formative (i.e. tests that promote learning but are not part of a course's marking), delivered with the help of computers.http://technologyenhancedlearning.net/tel-initiatives/computer-aided-assessment/ This covers both assessments delivered on computer, either online or on a local network, and those that are marked with the aid of computers, such as those using Optical Mark Reading (OMR). There are number of open source online tools to handle exams conducted on OMR sheets.Quiz OMR" : An extension to Moodle to provide online support for offline quizzes conducted on OMR sheets http://moodle.org/mod/data/view.php?d=13&rid=3601
Computer-aided assessment can be viewed in a few different ways. Technically, assignments that are written on a computer and researched online are computer-aided assessments.  One of the most common forms of computer-aided assessment (in terms of e-learning) is online quizzes or exams. These can be implemented online, and also marked by the computer by putting the answers in. Many content management systems will have easy to setup and use systems for online exams.
It is also envisaged that computer-based formative assessment, in particular, will play an increasingly important role in learning,Gomersall 2005 with the increased use of banks of question items for the construction and delivery of dynamic, on-demand assessments. This can be witnessed by current projects such as the SQA's SOLAR Project.Scottish Qualifications Authority 2008
