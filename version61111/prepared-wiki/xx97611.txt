USS ''Achigan'' (YT-218/YTB-218) was a Cahto-class large harbor tug in the service of the United States Navy.
She was laid down as Achigan (YT-218) on 23 July 1943 at Ipswich, Massachusetts by W. A. Robinson, reclassified YTB-218 on 15 May 1944, launched on 4 October 1944, and placed in service on 9 January 1945. 

==Service history==

Assigned to the 4th Naval District, Achigan spent most of her naval career at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. On the afternoon of 8 January 1946, she sank at Philadelphia as a result of a collision with [tpl]USS|General J. C. Breckinridge|AP-176|3[/tpl]. Later salvaged, the tug returned to service at Philadelphia in mid-1947. Achigan served there until the summer of 1956 when she was transferred to the 6th Naval District. The meager record of her service indicates that the tug served in the 6th Naval District into 1957 and was disposed of later that year.
