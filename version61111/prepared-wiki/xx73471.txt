The European Greenfinch, or just Greenfinch (Carduelis chloris) is a small passerine bird in the finch family Fringillidae. The genus Carduelis might be split up and in this case, the greenfinches would be separated in their old genus Chloris again.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl]
This bird is widespread throughout Europe, north Africa and south west Asia. It is mainly resident, but some northernmost populations migrate further south. The Greenfinch has also been introduced into both Australia and New Zealand. In Malta it is considered a prestigious song bird which has been trapped for many years. It has been domesticated and many Maltese people breed them.
Chloris is from the Greek Khloros meaning "green" or "yellowish-green".[tpl]cite book |title=A Dictionary of Scientific Bird Names |last=Jobling |first=James A |year=1991 |publisher=OUP |isbn=0-19-854634-3[/tpl]

==Description==

The Greenfinch is 15 cm long with a wing span of 24.5 to 27.5 cm.  It is similar in size and shape to a House Sparrow,[tpl]cite book |title=The Birds of the Western Palearctic Abridged |year=1997 |publisher=OUP |isbn=0-19-854099-X[/tpl] but is mainly green, with yellow in the wings and tail. The female and young birds are duller and have brown tones on the back. The bill is thick and conical. The song contains a lot of trilling twitters interspersed with wheezes, and the male has a "butterfly" display flight.

==Behaviour and ecology==

Woodland edges, farmland hedges and gardens with relatively thick vegetation are favoured for breeding. It nests in trees or bushes, laying 3 to 8 eggs.
This species can form large flocks outside the breeding season, sometimes mixing with other finches and buntings. They feed largely on seeds, but also take berries.
