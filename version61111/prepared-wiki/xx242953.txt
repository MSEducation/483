==Plot==

The film is about the inexplicable love between two girls, Sally and the meek and tradition-bound Nirmala. The two girls run away during a school trip in order to punish their teacher Devika who organised the trip. Their journey is soon interrupted by a man, Harisankar, who mysteriously befriends the girls, while Nirmala starts to develop romantic feelings for Harisankar. Sally strongly objects to this relationship and warns her friend against the suspicious nature of the man. Nirmala, who was almost convinced to leave everything behind to be with the man she loves, gets a shock when she finds out that the man was actually in love with the teacher whom she despised and ran away from. Unable to find a way out of the misery that befalls them, Sally and Nirmala cling on to each other and commit suicide.

==Trivia==

The Film was distributed by Dinny Films.
Though the film is not structured as a thriller, the mystery element in most of the story was highly acclaimed.  It garnered very positive reviews from viewers as well as critics.  Especially the introduction scene of Harishankar, where the character brings in a clear feeling of distrust for Sally and a very clear romantic feeling for Nirmala is notable for the air of mystery around Harishankar.  Through the narrative, Padmarajan brings in a connection between Devika and Harishankar which eventually lead to the suicide of the girls.  The feeling Sally has for Nirmala is also described beautifully.  The willful and disobedient Sally was ready to bend her decisions and views only for Nirmala.  Though Nirmala decided to go back against her wishes, Sally never left Nirmala's side and was ready to be with her for ever.
