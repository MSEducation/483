The indictment also charged Joe Giudice with failure to file tax returns for tax years 2004 through 2008, during which time he allegedly earned nearly $1 million.

Klingeman Esq., of Newark is representing Teresa Giudice. On August 14, 2013, the two pleaded not guilty in federal court to financial fraud charges.[tpl]cite web|title='REAL HOUSEWIVES OF NJ' STARS PLEAD NOT GUILTY|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/real-housewives-nj-stars-back-court|publisher=AP|accessdate=15 August 2013[/tpl]
Joe Giudice stood trial on Nov. 19, 2013 individually on charges that he allegedly used marriage and birth certificates belonging to his brother to fraudulently obtain a driver's license in 2010. Giudice's own driver's license had been suspended following a DUI arrest January 13, 2010. After he was convicted, his license was suspended for 12 months, and he was sentenced to 20 days of community service. Because he is using the same defense attorney in both trials, U.S. District Judge Esther Salas moved the date of the tax case involving both Teresa and Joe from October 8, 2013 to February 24, 2014.
On 4th March, 2014 Teresa and husband Joe entered a guilty plea to 41 counts of fraud, this follows a deal struck with federal prosecutors. The couple are accused of engaging in bank, mail and wire and bankruptcy fraud which allegedly saw them net over $5 million over a 10 year period. Sentencing is scheduled for 8th July, 2014. http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/joe-teresa-giudice-plead-guilty-fraud/story?id=22725884
If convicted of the charges in the tax case against them, Joe and Teresa could each serve more than 50 years in prison and be forced to pay more than $600,000 in fines. Both remain free on $500,000 unsecured bonds.http://www.nj.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2013/09/trial_real_housewives_teresa_joe_giudice_postponed.html
