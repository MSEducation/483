[[Lutetium]]

CATEGORIES: Chemical elements, Lanthanides, Transition metals, Lutetium

Lutetium is a chemical element with the symbol Lu and atomic number 71.  It is a silvery white metal, which resists corrosion in dry, but not in moist air. It is the last element in the lanthanide series (or, on occasion, considered the first element of the 6th-period transition metals), and traditionally counted among the rare earths. 
Lutetium was independently discovered in 1907 by French scientist Georges Urbain, Austrian mineralogist Baron Carl Auer von Welsbach, and American chemist Charles James. All of these men found lutetium as an impurity in the mineral ytterbia, which was previously thought to consist entirely of ytterbium. The dispute on the priority of the discovery occurred shortly after, with Urbain and von Welsbach accusing each other of publishing results influenced by the published research of the other; the naming honor went to Urbain as he published his results earlier. He chose the name lutecium for the new element but in 1949 the spelling of element 71 was changed to lutetium. In 1909, the priority was finally granted to Urbain and his names were adopted as official ones; however, the name cassiopeium (or later cassiopium) for element 71 proposed by von Welsbach was used by many German scientists until the 1950s.
Lutetium is not a particularly abundant element, though significantly more common than silver in the earth's crust; it has few specific uses.  Lutetium-176 is a relatively abundant (2.5%) radioactive isotope with a half-life of about 38 billion years, and so used to determine the age of meteorites. Lutetium usually occurs in association with the element yttrium and is sometimes used in metal alloys and as a catalyst in various chemical reactions. 177Lu-DOTA-TATE is used for radionuclide therapy (see Nuclear medicine) on neuroendocrine tumours. 

==Characteristics==

===Physical properties===

A lutetium atom has 71 electrons, arranged in the configuration Xe] 4f145d16s2.[tpl]Greenwood&Earnshaw|page=1223[/tpl] When entering a chemical reaction, the atom loses its two outermost electrons and the single 5d-electron; this is unusual since reactions of the other lanthanides invariably involve f-shell electrons. The lutetium atom is the smallest among the lanthanide atoms, due to the lanthanide contraction,[tpl]Cotton&Wilkinson5th|pages=776, 955[/tpl] and as a result lutetium has the highest density, melting point, and hardness of the lanthanides.[tpl]cite book| last=Parker | first= Sybil P.| title =Dictionary of Scientific and Technical Terms, 3rd ed| location = New York| publisher = McGraw-Hill| year = 1984[/tpl] Some of these properties can be explained by its position in the d-block, which gives the metal properties of some heavier transition metals. Occasionally, lutetium is classified as a transition metal on this basis, although the IUPAC classifies it as a lanthanide.

===Chemical properties and compounds===

Lutetium's compounds always contain the element in the oxidation state +3.  Aqueous solutions of most lutetium salts are colorless and form white crystalline solids upon drying, with the common exception of the iodide. The soluble salts, such as nitrate, sulfate and acetate form hydrates upon crystallization. The oxide, hydroxide, fluoride, carbonate, phosphate and oxalate are insoluble in water.
Lutetium metal is slightly unstable in air at standard conditions, but it burns readily at 150 °C to form lutetium oxide. The resulting compound is known to adsorb water and carbon dioxide, and may be used to remove vapors of these compounds from closed atmospheres.[tpl]cite book| pages = 303–304| title = The history and use of our earth's chemical elements: a reference guide | last=  Krebs| first= Robert E.| publisher =Greenwood Publishing Group| year = 2006| isbn =0-313-33438-2[/tpl] Similar observations are made during reaction between lutetium and water (slow when cold and fast when hot); lutetium hydroxide is formed in the reaction.[tpl]cite web| url =https://www.webelements.com/lutetium/chemistry.html| title =Chemical reactions of Lutetium| publisher=Webelements| accessdate=2009-06-06[/tpl] Lutetium metal is known to react with the four lightest halogens to form trihalides; all of them (except the fluoride) are soluble in water.
Lutetium dissolves readily in weak acids and dilute sulfuric acid to form solutions containing the colorless lutetium ions, which are coordinated by between seven and nine water molecules, the average being Lu(H2O)8.23+.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Persson|first1=Ingmar|title=Hydrated metal ions in aqueous solution: How regular are their structures?|journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry|volume=82|issue=10|year=2010|pages=1901–1917|issn=0033-4545|doi=10.1351/PAC-CON-09-10-22[/tpl]

===Isotopes===

Lutetium occurs on the Earth in form of two isotopes: lutetium-175 and lutetium-176. Out of these two, only the former is stable, making the element monoisotopic. The latter one, lutetium-176, decays via beta decay with a half-life of 3.78×1010 years; it makes up about 2.5% of natural lutetium.[tpl]cite journal| first = Audi| last = Georges|title = The NUBASE Evaluation of Nuclear and Decay Properties| journal = Nuclear Physics A| volume = 729| pages = 3–128| publisher = Atomic Mass Data Center| year = 2003| doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001| bibcode=2003NuPhA.729....3A| last2 = Bersillon| first2 = O.| last3 = Blachot| first3 = J.| last4 = Wapstra| first4 = A.H.[/tpl]
To date, 32 synthetic radioisotopes of the element have been characterized, ranging in mass from 149.973 (lutetium-150) to 183.961 (lutetium-184); the most stable such isotopes are lutetium-174 with a half-life of 3.31 years, and lutetium-173 with a half-life of 1.37 years. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than 9 days, and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than half an hour. Isotopes lighter than the stable lutetium-175 decay via electron capture (to produce isotopes of ytterbium), with some alpha and positron emission); the heavier isotopes decay primarily via beta decay, producing hafnium isotopes.
The element also has 42 nuclear isomers, with masses of 150, 151, 153—162, 166—180 (not every mass number corresponds to only one isomer). The most stable of them are lutetium-177m, with half-life of 160.4 days and lutetium-174m, with half-life of 142 days; this is longer than half-lives of the ground states of all radioactive lutetium isotopes, except only for lutetium-173, 174, and 176.

==History==

Lutetium, derived from the Latin Lutetia (Paris), was independently discovered in 1907 by French scientist Georges Urbain, Austrian mineralogist Baron Carl Auer von Welsbach, and American chemist Charles James.[tpl]cite web | title = Separation of Rare Earth Elements by Charles James | work = National Historic Chemical Landmarks | publisher = American Chemical Society | url = http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/earthelements.html | accessdate = 2014-02-21 [/tpl] They found it as an impurity in ytterbia, which was thought by Swiss chemist Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac to consist entirely of ytterbium.[tpl]cite journal|title=Un nouvel élément: le lutécium, résultant du dédoublement de l'ytterbium de Marignac|journal=Comptes rendus …|volume=145|year=1907|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3099v/f759.image.langEN|pages=759–762|last= Urbain|first= G.[/tpl] The scientists proposed different names for the elements: Urbain chose neoytterbium and lutecium,[tpl]cite journal|title=Lutetium und Neoytterbium oder Cassiopeium und Aldebaranium -- Erwiderung auf den Artikel des Herrn Auer v. Welsbach|year=1909|journal=Monatshefte für Chemie|volume=31|issue=10|doi=10.1007/BF01530262|first=G. |last=Urbain|page=1[/tpl] while Welsbach chose aldebaranium and cassiopeium.[tpl]cite journal|title=Die Zerlegung des Ytterbiums in seine Elemente|journal=Monatshefte für Chemie|volume=29|issue=2|year=1908|doi=10.1007/BF01558944|pages=181–225|first=Carl A.|last=von Welsbach[/tpl] Both of these articles accused each other of publishing results based on the other party.
The International Commission on Atomic Weights, which was then responsible for the attribution of new element names, settled the dispute in 1909 by granting priority to Urbain and adopting his names as official ones, based on the fact that the separation of lutetium from Marignac's ytterbium was first described by Urbain; after Urbain's names were recognized, neoytterbium was reverted to ytterbium. Until the 1950s, some German chemists called lutetium by von Welsbach's name cassiopeium; in 1949, the spelling of element 71 was changed to lutetium. However, Welsbach's 1907 samples of lutetium had been pure, while Urbain's 1907 samples only contained traces of lutetium.[tpl]cite book|last1=Thyssen|first1=Pieter|last2=Binnemans|first2=Koen|editor1-last=Gschneider|editor1-first=Karl A., Jr.|editor2-last=Bünzli|editor2-first=Jean-Claude|editor3-last=Pecharsky|editor3-first=Vitalij K.|chapter=Accommodation of the Rare Earths in the Periodic Table: A Historical Analysis|title=Handbook on the Physics and Chemistry of Rare Earths|year=2011|page=63|publisher=Elsevier|location=Amsterdam|isbn=978-0-444-53590-0|oclc=690920513|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8SstnPFSzb0C&pg=PA66#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=2013-04-25[/tpl] This later misled Urbain into thinking that he had discovered element 72, which he named celtium, which was actually very pure lutetium. Charles James, who stayed out of the priority argument, worked on a much larger scale and possessed the largest supply of lutetium at the time.[tpl]cite book| pages=240–242| url =http://books.google.com/?id=Yhi5X7OwuGkC&pg=PA241| title =Nature's building blocks: an A-Z guide to the elements|first =John|last=Emsley| publisher=Oxford University Press| isbn = 0-19-850341-5| year=2001[/tpl] Pure lutetium metal was first produced in 1953.

==Occurrence and production==

Found with almost all other rare-earth metals but never by itself, lutetium is very difficult to separate from other elements. The principal commercially viable ore of lutetium is the rare earth phosphate mineral monazite: (Ce,La,etc.)PO4 which contains 0.0001% of the element. The abundance of lutetium in the Earth crust is only about 0.5 mg/kg. The main mining areas are China, United States, Brazil, India, Sri Lanka and Australia. The world production of lutetium (in the form of oxide) is about 10 tonnes per year. Pure lutetium metal is very difficult to prepare. It is one of the rarest and most expensive of the rare earth metals with the price about US$10,000 per kilogram, or about one-fourth that of gold.[tpl]cite news| publisher = USGS| title =Rare-Earth Metals| author = James B.

Crushed minerals are treated with hot concentrated sulfuric acid to produce water-soluble sulfates of rare earths. Thorium precipitates out of solution as hydroxide and is removed. After that the solution is treated with ammonium oxalate to convert rare earths into their insoluble oxalates. The oxalates are converted to oxides by annealing. The oxides are dissolved in nitric acid that excludes one of the main components, cerium, whose oxide is insoluble in HNO3. Several rare earth metals, including lutetium, are separated as a double salt with ammonium nitrate by crystallization. Lutetium is separated by ion exchange. In this process, rare-earth ions are sorbed onto suitable ion-exchange resin by exchange with hydrogen, ammonium or cupric ions present in the resin. Lutetium salts are then selectively washed out by suitable complexing agent. Lutetium metal is then obtained by reduction of anhydrous LuCl3 or LuF3 by either an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal.[tpl]cite book|last =Patnaik|first =Pradyot|year = 2003|title =Handbook of Inorganic Chemical Compounds|publisher = McGraw-Hill|page = 510|isbn =0-07-049439-8|url= http://books.google.com/?id=Xqj-TTzkvTEC&pg=PA243|accessdate = 2009-06-06[/tpl]

==Applications==

Because of the rarity and high price, lutetium has very few commercial uses. However, stable lutetium can be used as catalysts in petroleum cracking in refineries and can also be used in alkylation, hydrogenation, and polymerization applications.

==Precautions==

Like other rare-earth metals, lutetium is regarded as having a low degree of toxicity, but its compounds should be handled with care nonetheless: for example, lutetium fluoride inhalation is dangerous and the compound irritates skin. Lutetium nitrate may be dangerous as it may explode and burn once heated. Lutetium oxide powder is toxic as well if inhaled or ingested.
Similarly to other group 3 elements and lanthanides, lutetium has no known biological role, but it is found even in humans, concentrating in bones, and to a lesser extent in the liver and kidneys. Lutetium salts are known to occur together with other lanthanide salts in nature; the element is the least abundant in the human body of all lanthanides. Human diets have not been monitored for lutetium content, so it is not known how much the average human takes in, but estimations show the amount is only about several micrograms per year, all coming from tiny amounts taken by plants. Soluble lutetium salts are mildly toxic, but insoluble ones are not.
