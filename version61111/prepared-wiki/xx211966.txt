Yu County or Yuxian ([tpl]zh|t=蔚縣|s=蔚县|p=Yù Xiàn[/tpl]) is a district of Zhangjiakou, Hebei, China.
Yuzhouzhen (蔚州镇） refers to the city that serves as the county seat of Yuxian, or Yu County.  The Old City (the earthen rampart walls of which remain in some spots) is home to numerous temples, including the well-preserved Caishengmiao, or money temple. The restored city tower stands at the center of the old city.
The city was a former garrison town during the Ming dynasty, serving as part of the defense system protecting the capital Beijing (located to the East) from Mongol invasion.
Though seldom visited by tourists, the town is accessible via bus from Beijing's Beijiao bus station (near the Olympic Park)
