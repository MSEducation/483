In the spring of 1771, Thomas and John Witten established the first permanent settlement in Tazewell County at Crab Orchard.[ref]

Tazewell County was created on December 20, 1799. The land for the county was taken from portions of Wythe and Russell counties. It was named after Henry Tazewell, a United States Senator from Virginia, state legislator and judge. Delegate Littleton Waller Tazewell originally opposed the formation of the new county but when Simon Cotterel, who drew up the bill to form the county, changed the originally proposed name of the county to Tazewell's namesake, in honor of his father Henry who had died months earlier, the bill passed.[ref]

Later, the town of Jeffersonville was renamed Tazewell and became the county seat.
