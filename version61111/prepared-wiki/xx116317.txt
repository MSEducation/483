Boonton Station is a New Jersey Transit station in Boonton, Morris County, New Jersey, United States along the Montclair-Boonton Line.
It is located on Main Street, near Myrtle Avenue and Interstate 287. The original 1905 station was built by architect Frank J. Nies who built other stations for the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad. Unlike most of his stations which tended to be massive Renaissance structures, Boonton Station was built as a simple Prairie House design. The station house is now a bar, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 13, 1977, two years before the establishment of New Jersey Transit and six years before becoming part of their railroad division.
