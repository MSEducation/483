Norman Gary Finkelstein (born December 8, 1953) is an American political scientist, activist, professor and author. His primary fields of research are the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and the politics of the Holocaust, an interest motivated by the experiences of his parents who were Jewish Holocaust survivors. He is a graduate of Binghamton University and received his Ph.D in Political Science from Princeton University. He has held faculty positions at Brooklyn College, Rutgers University, Hunter College, New York University, and, most recently, DePaul University, where he was an assistant professor from 2001 to 2007.
In 2007, after a highly publicized row between Finkelstein and a notable opponent of his, Alan Dershowitz, Finkelstein's tenure bid at DePaul was denied. Finkelstein was placed on administrative leave for the 2007–2008 academic year, and on September 5, 2007, he announced his resignation after coming to a settlement with the university on generally undisclosed terms.
An official statement from DePaul strongly defended the decision to deny Finkelstein tenure, stated that outside influence played no role in the decision.

==Personal background and education==

Finkelstein has written of his  Jewish parents' experiences during World War II.  His mother, Maryla Husyt Finkelstein, grew up in Warsaw, Poland, survived the Warsaw Ghetto, the Majdanek concentration camp, and two slave labor camps. Her first husband died in the war. She considered the day of her liberation as the most horrible day of her life, as she realized that she was alone, her parents and siblings gone. Norman's father, Zacharias Finkelstein, was a survivor of both the Warsaw Ghetto and the Auschwitz concentration camp. After the war they met in a displaced persons camp in Austria, and then emigrated to the United States, where his father became a factory worker and his mother a homemaker and later a bookkeeper.[tpl]cite news|last=Sheleg|first=Yair|title=The Finkelstein polemic|url=http://www.normanfinkelstein.com/article.php?pg=3&ar=11|accessdate=20 August 2012|newspaper=Ha'aretz Magazine|date=30 March 2001[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=June 2013[/tpl] Finkelstein's  mother was an ardent pacifist.

Finkelstein grew up in New York City, where he attended James Madison High School and was a childhood friend of U.S. Senator Chuck Schumer, (D-NY), who was two years ahead of him.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.normanfinkelstein.com/i-remember-chuck-schumer-from-madison-high-school-his-father-was-an-exterminator-like-father-like-son/ |title=I remember Chuck Schumer from Madison High School.

One childhood friend recalls his mother's "emotional investment in left-wing humanitarian causes as bordering on hysteria."Is This a Man Who Sheds Light, or Simply Sets Fires?  New York Times, Feb. 11, 2010 http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/11/movies/11radical.html?scp=1&sq=norman%20finkelstein&st=cse He had "internalized her indignation", a trait which he admits rendered him "insufferable" when talking of the Vietnam War, and which imbued him with a "holier-than-thou" attitude at the time which he now regrets. But Finkelstein regards his absorption of his mother's outlook — the refusal to put aside a sense of moral outrage in order to get on with one's life — as a virtue. Subsequently, his reading of Noam Chomsky played a seminal role in tailoring the passion bequeathed to him by his mother to the necessity of maintaining intellectual rigor in the pursuit of the truth.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.normanfinkelstein.com/article.php?pg=18&ar=1 |author=Norman G.

He completed his undergraduate studies at Binghamton University in New York in 1974, after which he studied at the École Pratique des Hautes Études in Paris. He went on to earn his Master's degree in political science from Princeton University in 1980, and later his PhD in political studies, also from Princeton. Finkelstein wrote his doctoral thesis on Zionism, and it was through this work that he first attracted controversy. Before gaining academic employment, Finkelstein was a part-time social worker with teenage dropouts in New York.  He then taught successively at Rutgers University, New York University, Brooklyn College, and Hunter College and, until recently, taught at DePaul University in Chicago.  According to The New York Times he left Hunter College in 2001 "after his teaching load and salary were reduced" by the college administration.
Beginning with his doctoral thesis at Princeton, Finkelstein's career has been marked by controversy. A self-described "forensic scholar", he has written  sharply critical academic reviews of several prominent writers and scholars whom he accuses of misrepresenting the documentary record in order to defend Israel's policies and practices. His writings, noted for their support of the Palestinian cause,[ref]
[tpl]dead link|date=June 2013[/tpl][/ref] have dealt with politically charged topics such as Zionism, the demographic history of Palestine and his allegations of the existence of a "Holocaust Industry" that exploits the memory of the Holocaust to further Israeli and financial interests. Citing linguist and political activist Noam Chomsky as an example, Finkelstein notes that it is "possible to unite exacting scholarly rigor with scathing moral outrage," and supporters and detractors alike have remarked on the polemical style of Finkelstein's work.  Its content has been praised by eminent historians such as Raul Hilberg and Avi Shlaim, as well as Chomsky.
Finkelstein has described himself as "an old-fashioned communist," in the sense that he "sees no value whatsoever in states."[tpl]cite journal|last=Bruinsma|first=Jelle|title=Are American Jews Beginning to Distance Themselves from Israel?

==Academic career==

===On From Time Immemorial===

In Finkelstein's doctoral thesis, he examined the claims made in Joan Peters's From Time Immemorial, a best-selling book at the time.
Peters's "history and defense" of Israel deals with the demographic history of Palestine. Demographic studies had tended to assert that the Arab population of Ottoman-controlled Palestine, a 94% majority at the turn of the century, had dwindled towards parity due to massive Zionist immigration. Peters radically challenged this picture by arguing that a substantial part of the Palestinian people were descended from immigrants from other Arab countries from the early 19th century onwards. It followed, for Peters and many of her readers, that the picture of a native Palestinian population overwhelmed by Jewish immigration was little more than propaganda, and that in actuality two almost simultaneous waves of immigration met in what had been a relatively unpopulated land.
From Time Immemorial had been effusively praised in mainstream United States media sources by figures as varied as Barbara Tuchman, Theodore H. White, Elie Wiesel, and Lucy Dawidowicz. Saul Bellow, for one, wrote in a jacket endorsement that:
|author=Edward W. Said, Christopher Hitchens, eds.

|url=http://books.google.com/?id=wELzivMr_-cC&pg=PA23
|isbn=978-1-85984-340-6
|year=2001
}}[/ref]
Finkelstein asserted that the book was nothing more than what he now calls a "monumental hoax". He later opined that, while Peters's book received widespread interest and approval in the United States, a scholarly demonstration of its fraudulence and unreliability aroused little attention:
Noam Chomsky later reminisced:

In 1986, the New York Review of Books published Yehoshua Porath's review and an exchange with critics of the review in which he criticized the assumptions and evidence on which Peters's thesis relied, thus lending independent support from an expert in Palestinian demographics to Finkelstein's doctoral critique. In the house journal of the American Council on Foreign Relations, Foreign Affairs, William B. Quandt, the Edward Stettinius professor of Politics at the University of Virginia and authority on Middle Eastern politics,[tpl]cite web|url=http://people.virginia.edu/~wbq8f/CVLONG.htm |title=Curriculum Vitae of Professor William B. Quandt |publisher=People.virginia.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-11-13[/tpl] later described Finkelstein's critique of From Time Immemorial as a "landmark essay" and a "victory to his credit", in its "demonstration" of the "shoddy scholarship" of Peters's book.[tpl]cite book |author=William B.

In Shlaim's view, Finkelstein had produced an "unanswerable case" with "irrefutable evidence", proving that Peters' book was both "preposterous and worthless".[tpl]cite journal|last=Shlaim|first=Avi|title=AVI SHLAIM, CONFIDENTIAL PEER REVIEW OF BEYOND CHUTZPAH FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA PRESS, 9 FEBRUARY 2005.|journal=Journal of Palestine Studies|date=Winter 2006|volume=XXXV|page=88|url=http://www.palestine-studies.org/files/pdf/jps/6643.pdf[/tpl]
According to Noam Chomsky, the controversy that surrounded Finkelstein's research caused a delay in his earning his Ph.D. at Princeton University.  Chomsky wrote in Understanding Power that Finkelstein "literally could not get the faculty to read " and that Princeton eventually granted Finkelstein his doctorate only "out of embarrassment Princeton" but refused to give him any further professional backing.
Finkelstein published portions of his thesis in the following publications:

===The Holocaust Industry===

The Holocaust Industry: Reflections on the Exploitation of Jewish Suffering was published in 2000. Here, Finkelstein argues that Elie Wiesel and others exploit the memory of the Holocaust as an "ideological weapon." This is done so the State of Israel, "one of the world's most formidable military powers, with a horrendous human rights record, can cast itself as a victim state", in order to garner "immunity to criticism."  He also alleges what he calls a "double shakedown" by "a repellent gang of plutocrats, hoodlums and hucksters" seeking enormous legal damages and financial settlements from Germany and Switzerland, moneys which then go to the lawyers and institutional actors involved in procuring them, rather than actual Holocaust survivors.Where did the Shoah money go? Ynetnews October 12, 2006Lawyer's $4.1 Million Fee Angers Holocaust Survivors New York Times February 25, 2006
The book met with a hostile reception in some quarters, with critics charging that it was poorly researched and/or allowed others to exploit it for antisemitic purposes. For example, German historian Hans Mommsen disparaged the first edition as "a most trivial book, which appeals to easily aroused anti-Semitic prejudices." Israeli holocaust historian Israel Gutman called the book "a lampoon," stating "this is not research; it isn't even political literature... I don't even think it should be reviewed or critiqued as a legitimate book."[ref]
[tpl]dead link|date=June 2013[/tpl][/ref] The book was also harshly criticized by Brown University Professor Omer BartovFrom The New York Times, Book Review Desk A Tale of Two Holocausts August 6, 2000 (archived) and University of Chicago Professor Peter Novick.
Based on his criticism of Holocaust exploitation, the Anti-Defamation League and others branded Finkelstein as a Holocaust denier, despite his being the son of two Holocaust survivors, most of whose family died in the Holocaust.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.csun.edu/~vcmth00m/finkelstein.html |title=Why is Norman Finkelstein Not Allowed to Teach? |publisher=Csun.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-06-06[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.normanfinkelstein.com/how-the-adl-fights-anti-semitism/ |title=How the ADL Fights Anti-Semitism | Norman G.

Asked on another occasion if Finkelstein's analysis might play into the hands of neo-Nazis for antisemitic purposes, Hilberg replied: "Well, even if they do use it in that fashion, I'm afraid that when it comes to the truth, it has to be said openly, without regard to any consequences that would be undesirable, embarrassing."[ref]

===Criticism of Alan Dershowitz's The Case for Israel===

Shortly after the publication of the book The Case for Israel by Alan Dershowitz, Finkelstein derided it as "a collection of fraud, falsification, plagiarism, and nonsense".  During a debate on Democracy Now!, Finkelstein asserted that Dershowitz lacked knowledge about specific contents of his own book. He also claimed that Dershowitz did not write the book, and may not have even read it.
Finkelstein noted 20 instances, in as many pages, where Dershowitz's book cites the same sources and passages used by Joan Peters in her book, in largely the same sequence, with ellipses in the same places. In two instances, Dershowitz reproduces Peters's errors (see below). From this Finkelstein concluded that Dershowitz had not checked the original sources himself, contrary to the latter's claims.[ref]
[tpl]dead link|date=June 2013[/tpl][/ref] Finkelstein suggests that this copying of quotations amounts to copying ideas.[ref]
[tpl]dead link|date=June 2013[/tpl][/ref] Examining a copy of a proof of Dershowitz's book he managed to obtain, he found evidence that Dershowitz had his secretarial assistant, Holly Beth Billington, check in the Harvard library the sources he had read in Peters's book. Dershowitz answered the charge in a letter to the University of California's Press Director Lynne Withey, arguing that Finkelstein had made up the smoking gun quotation, in that he had changed its wording (from 'cite' to 'copy') in his book.[ref]
[tpl]dead link|date=June 2013[/tpl][/ref] In public debate he has stated that if "somebody borrowed the quote without going to check back on whether Mark Twain had said that, obviously that would be a serious charge"; however, he insisted emphatically that he himself did not do that, that he had indeed checked the original source by Twain.
Dershowitz threatened libel action over the charges in Finkelstein's book, as a consequence of which, the publisher deleted the word "plagiarism" from the text before publication.[ref]
[tpl]dead link|date=June 2013[/tpl][/ref] Finkelstein also agreed to remove the suggestion that Dershowitz was not the true author of The Case for Israel because, as the publisher said, "he couldn't document that."
Asserting that he did consult the original sources, Dershowitz says that Finkelstein is simply accusing him of good scholarly practice: citing references he learned of initially from Peters's book. Dershowitz denies that he used any of Peters's ideas without citation. "Plagiarism is taking someone else's words and claiming they're your own. There are no borrowed words from anybody. There are no borrowed ideas from anybody because I fundamentally disagree with the conclusions of Peters's book." In a footnote in The Case for Israel which cites Peters's book, Dershowitz explicitly denies that he "relies" on Peters for "conclusions or data".
In their joint interview on Democracy Now, however, Finkelstein cited specific passages in Dershowitz's book in which a phrase that he says Peters coined was incorrectly attributed to George Orwell:
 "Peters coins the phrase, 'turnspeak', she says she's using it as a play off of George Orwell which as all listeners know used the phrase 'Newspeak.'  She coined her own phrase, 'turnspeak.'  You go to Mr. Dershowitz's book, he got so confused in his massive borrowings from Joan Peters that on two occasions, I'll cite them for those who have a copy of the book, on page 57 and on page 153 he uses the phrase, quote, George Orwell's 'turnspeak.'  'Turnspeak' is not Orwell, Mr. Dershowitz, you're the Felix Frankfurter chair at Harvard, you must know that Orwell would never use such a clunky phrase as 'turnspeak'."[tpl]cite web | title=Scholar Norman Finkelstein Calls Professor Alan Dershowitz’s New Book On Israel a "Hoax" | url=http://www.democracynow.org/2003/9/24/scholar_norman_finkelstein_calls_professor_alan | work= | publisher= | date= | accessdate=2009-06-03[/tpl] 
James O. Freedman, the former president of Dartmouth College, the University of Iowa, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, has defended Dershowitz:  I do not understand Finkelstein's charge of plagiarism against Alan Dershowitz. There is no claim that Dershowitz used the words of others without attribution.  When he uses the words of others, he quotes them properly and generally cites them to the original sources (Mark Twain, Palestine Royal Commission, etc.) Finkelstein's complaint is that instead he should have cited them to the secondary source, in which Dershowitz may have come upon them.  But as The Chicago Manual of Style emphasizes: 'Importance of attribution.  With all reuse of others' materials, it is important to identify the original as the source.  This not only bolsters the claims of fair use, it also helps avoid any accusation of plagiarism.' This is precisely what Dershowitz did.
Responding to an article in The Nation by Alexander Cockburn, Dershowitz also cited The Chicago Manual of Style: Cockburn's claim is that some of the quotes should not have been cited to their original sources but rather to a secondary source, where he believes I stumbled upon them. Even if he were correct that I found all these quotations in Peters's book, the preferred method of citation is to the original source, as The Chicago Manual of Style emphasizes: "With all reuse of others' materials, it is important to identify the original as the source. This...helps avoid any accusation of plagiarism...To cite a source from a secondary source ('quoted in...') is generally to be discouraged...."
...to which Cockburn responded:
 Quoting The Chicago Manual of Style, Dershowitz artfully implies that he followed the rules by citing "the original" as opposed to the
 secondary source, Peters. He misrepresents Chicago here, where "the
original" means merely the origin of the borrowed material, which is,
in this instance, Peters.
Now look at the second bit of the quote from Chicago, chastely
separated from the preceding sentence by a demure three-point
ellipsis. As my associate Kate Levin has discovered, this passage
("To cite a source from a secondary source...") occurs on page 727,
which is no less than 590 pages later than the material before the
ellipsis, in a section titled "Citations Taken from Secondary
Sources." Here's the full quote, with what Dershowitz left out set in
bold: "'Quoted in.' To cite a source from a secondary source ("quoted
in") is generally to be discouraged, since authors are expected to
have examined the works they cite. If an original source is
unavailable, however, both the original and the secondary source must
be listed."
So Chicago is clearly insisting that unless Dershowitz went to the
originals, he was obliged to cite Peters. Finkelstein has
conclusively demonstrated that he didn't go to the originals.
Plagiarism, QED, plus added time for willful distortion of the
language of Chicago's guidelines, cobbling together two separate
discussions.

On behalf of Dershowitz, Harvard Law School dean Elena Kagan asked former Harvard president Derek Bok to investigate the assertion of plagiarism; Bok exonerated Dershowitz of the charge.
In an April 3, 2007 interview with the Harvard Crimson, "Dershowitz confirmed that he had sent a letter last September to DePaul faculty members lobbying against Finkelstein's tenure."
In April 2007, Dr. Frank Menetrez, a former Editor-in-Chief of the UCLA Law Review, published an analysis of the charges made against Finkelstein by Dershowitz, finding no merit in any single charge and concluding that Dershowitz had misrepresented matters.[ref]Frank Menetrez: "Dershowitz v. Finkelstein: Who’s Right and Who’s Wrong?". Included as Epilogue in: 
[/ref] In a follow-up analysis he concluded that he could find 'no way of avoiding the inference that Dershowitz copied the quotation from Twain from Peters's From Time Immemorial, and not from the original source', as Dershowitz claimed.

==Controversies==

===Tenure denial and resignation===

In September 2006, Dershowitz sent members of DePaul's law and political science faculties what he described as "a dossier of Norman Finkelstein's most egregious academic sins, and especially his outright lies, misquotations, and distortions" and lobbied professors, alumni and administrators to deny Finkelstein tenure."Harvard Law Professor Works to Disrupt Tenure Bid of Longtime Nemesis at DePaul U." Chronicle of Higher Education Thursday, April 5, 2007
  De Paul's political science committee investigated his accusations against Finkelstein and concluded that they were not based on legitimate criticism. The department subsequently invited John Mearsheimer and Ian Lustick, two independent academics with known expertise on the Israel/Palestine conflict to evaluate the academic merit of Finkelstein's work who came to the same conclusion.Richard Forer Breakthrough: Transforming Fear Into Compassion : a New Perspective on the Israel-Palestine Conflict E-book 2010 ISBN 9780615404585 Pg 45 - 46
In early 2007 the DePaul University Political Science department voted nine to three, and the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences Personnel Committee five to zero, in favor of giving Finkelstein tenure. The three opposing faculty members subsequently filed a minority report opposing tenure, supported by the Dean of the College, Chuck Suchar. Suchar stated he opposed tenure because Finkelstein's "personal and reputation demeaning attacks on Dershowitz, Benny Morris, and the holocaust authors Elie Wiesel and Jerzy Kosinski" were inconsistent with DePaul's "Vincentian" values.[tpl]cite web |url=http://english.sxu.edu/sites/kirstein/?p=680 |title=The Suchar Memorandum |author=Peter N. Kirstein |date=March 22, 2007 |publisher= [/tpl] Amidst considerable public debate, Dershowitz actively campaigned to block Finkelstein's tenure bid. In June 2007, a 4-3 vote by DePaul University's Board on Promotion and Tenure (a faculty board), affirmed by the university's president, the Rev. Dennis Holtschneider, denied Finkelstein tenure.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/EDUCATION/06/11/depaul.professor.ap/ |title=DePaul denies tenure to controversial professor |publisher=CNN |date=June 11, 2007[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://sherman.depaul.edu/media/webapp/mrNews.asp?NID=1630 |title=DePaul University Statement on the Tenure and Promotion Decision Concerning Professor Norman Finkelstein |publisher=DePaul University |date=June 6, 2007[/tpl]
The university denied that Dershowitz, who had been criticized for his campaign against Finkelstein's tenure, played any part in this decision. At the same time, the university denied tenure to international studies assistant professor Mehrene Larudee, a strong supporter of Finkelstein, despite unanimous support from her department, the Personnel Committee and the Dean.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2007/06/11/finkelstein |title=DePaul Rejects Finkelstein |date=June 11, 2007 |publisher=Inside Higher Education |author= [/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://english.sxu.edu/sites/kirstein/?p=738 |title=Exclusive: Finkelstein Supporter also Denied Tenure at DePaul |author=Peter N.

Dershowitz expressed outrage at the compromise and this statement in particular, saying that the university had "traded truth for peace."
In June 2007, after two weeks of protests, some DePaul students staged a sit-in and hunger strike in support of both professors denied tenure.  The Illinois Conference of the American Association of University Professors also sent a letter to the university's president stating: "It is entirely illegitimate for a university to deny tenure to a professor out of fear that his published research ... might hurt a college's reputation" and that the association has "explicitly rejected collegiality as an appropriate criterion for evaluating faculty members".Students Will Begin Hunger Strike in Support of DePaul Professors Denied Tenure The Chronicle of Higher Education June 25, 2007

===Denied entry to Israel in 2008===

On May 23, 2008 Finkelstein was denied entry to Israel, according to unnamed Shin Bet security officials, because "of suspicions involving hostile elements in Lebanon" and that he "did not give a full accounting to interrogators with regard to these suspicions." Finkelstein had previously visited south Lebanon and met with Lebanese families during the 2006 Lebanon War.[tpl]cite web|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1211434094376&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull|title=American Israel critic denied entry to country|first=Yaakov|last=Katz|publisher=Jerusalem Post|date=2008-05-25[/tpl] He was banned from entering Israel for 10 years.“Israel blocks professor from entering, citing Hezbollah ties” ''International Herald Tribune 24 May 2008.

Finkelstein was questioned after his arrival at Ben Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv and detained for 24 hours in a holding cell. After speaking to Israeli attorney Michael Sfard he was placed on a flight back to Amsterdam, his point of origin. In an interview with Haaretz, Finkelstein stated "I did my best to provide absolutely candid and comprehensive answers to all the questions put to me. I am confident that I have nothing to hide... no suicide missions or secret rendezvous with terrorist organizations."[tpl]cite news|last=Melman|first=Yossi|title=Israel denies entry to high-profile critic Norman Finkelstein |url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/news/israel-denies-entry-to-high-profile-critic-norman-finkelstein-1.246487 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20111016203328/http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/news/israel-denies-entry-to-high-profile-critic-norman-finkelstein-1.246487 |archivedate=16 October 2011 |accessdate=5 October 2011|newspaper=Haaretz|date=24 May 2008[/tpl] He had been travelling to visit friends in the West Bank and stated he had no interest in visiting Israel. Sfard said banning Finkelstein from entering the country "recalls the behavior of the Soviet bloc countries."

==Reception==

Finkelstein's books are an attempt to examine the works of mainstream scholarship. The authors whose work he has thus targeted, including Daniel Jonah Goldhagen and Dershowitz, along with others such as Benny Morris whose work Finkelstein has also cited in his scholarship, have in turn accused Finkelstein of grossly misrepresenting their work, and selectively quoting from their books.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.normanfinkelstein.com/article.php?pg=11&ar=64 |author=Deborah Passner|date=October 10, 2005 |title=Norman Finkelstein's Fraudulent Scholarship |publisher=Reprinted by normanfinkelstein.com as "CAMERA's distorted lens" [/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=June 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.camera.org/index.asp?x_context=2&x_outlet=118&x_article=1280 |title=Norman Finkelstein, Benny Morris and Peace Not Apartheid|date=February 7, 2007 |author= |publisher=Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America[/tpl]
Finkelstein's work has attracted a number of supporters and detractors from around the world. Notable supporters of his work include Noam Chomsky, prominent intellectual and political critic; Raul Hilberg, Holocaust historian; Avi Shlaim, New Historian, and Mouin Rabbani, Palestinian jurist and analyst.
According to Hilberg, Finkelstein displays "academic courage to speak the truth when no one else is out there to support him... I would say that his place in the whole history of writing history is assured, and that those who in the end are proven right triumph, and he will be among those who will have triumphed, albeit, it so seems, at great cost." In a peer review for Beyond Chutzpah, Avi Shlaim  said that Finkelstein "has a most impressive track record in exposing spurious American-Jewish scholarship on the Arab-Israeli conflict."  He praised Finkelstein for "all the sterling qualities for which he has become famous: erudition, originality, spark, meticulous attention to detail, intellectual integrity, courage, and formidable forensic skills."
The liberal Haaretz newspaper stated that "it is difficult to sympathize with Finkelstein's opinions and preferences, especially since he decided to support Hezbollah, meet with its fighters and visit the graves of some of its slain operatives." Still, it continued to say that he should not be banned from entering Israel, because "meetings with Hezbollah operatives do not in themselves constitute a security risk."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/opinion/who-s-afraid-of-finkelstein-1.246638|title=Who's afraid of Finkelstein?|author=Editorial|publisher=Haaretz|date=May 27, 2008[/tpl]

===2009 film about Finkelstein===

American Radical: The Trials of Norman Finkelstein is an award-winning documentary film about the life and career of Norman Finkelstein, released in 2009 and directed by David Ridgen and Nicolas Rossier. It has been screened in Amsterdam IDFA, in Toronto Hot Docs and in more than 40 other national and international venues, it received a freshness rating over 90% on film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/american_radical/|title=American Radical on RT|accessdate=12 April 2010[/tpl]

===Criticism===

Criticism has been leveled against Finkelstein from several angles. The first sources are responses from those whose work Finkelstein has discussed. Daniel Goldhagen, whose book Hitler's Willing Executioners Finkelstein criticized, claimed his scholarship has "everything to do with his burning political agenda."  Alan Dershowitz has written that Peter Novick, Professor of History at the University of Chicago and a noted Holocaust historian whose work Finkelstein says inspired "The Holocaust Industry," has strongly criticized the latter's work, describing it as "trash."[tpl]cite journal |year= 2006 |title= Academic Freedom and Palestine-Israel: The Case of Beyond Chutzpah|url= http://www.palestine-studies.org/files/pdf/jps/6643.pdf |journal= Journal of Palestine Studies |volume= 35 |issue= 2 |pages= 86–99 [/tpl] Similarly, Dershowitz, whose book The Case for Israel and Finkelstein's response Beyond Chutzpah sparked an ongoing feud between the two, has claimed Finkelstein's complicity in a conspiracy against pro-Israel scholars: "The mode of attack is consistent. Chomsky selects the target and directs Finkelstein to probe the writings in minute detail and conclude that the writer didn't actually write the work, that it is plagiarized, that it is a hoax and a fraud," arguing that Finkelstein has leveled charges against many academics, calling at least 10 "distinguished Jews 'hucksters', 'hoaxters' (sic), 'thieves,' 'extortionists', and worse." Although the back and forth between Finkelstein and Dershowitz received the most attention and attracted significant controversy, Finkelstein has maintained that "the real issue is Israel's human rights record."
Israeli historian Omer Bartov, writing for The New York Times Book Review, judged The Holocaust Industry to be  marred by the same errors he denounces in those who exploit the Holocaust for profit or politics:
 It is filled with precisely the kind of shrill hyperbole that Finkelstein rightly deplores in much of the current media hype over the Holocaust; it is brimming with the same indifference to historical facts, inner contradictions, strident politics and dubious contextualizations; and it oozes with the same smug sense of moral and intellectual superiority... Like any conspiracy theory, it contains several grains of truth; and like any such theory, it is both irrational and insidious.[tpl]cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E1DF163DF935A3575BC0A9669C8B63 |title="A Tale of Two Holocausts" a review of The Holocaust Industry |author=Omer Bartov |publisher=The New York Times Book Review |date=August 6, 2000 |accessdate=13 February 2007[/tpl] 
In 2003, Finkelstein published an expanded second edition of this book, focusing especially on the Swiss Banks case. He identifies areas where people have attacked the book, and says that none of them question his actual findings.
Finkelstein has accused journalist Jeffrey Goldberg of "torturing" Palestinian prisoners during his IDF service in the First Intifada. Goldberg referred to the allegation as "ridiculous" and he had "never laid a hand on anybody." Goldberg said his "principal role" was "making sure prisoners had fresh fruit." He characterized Finkelstein as a "ridiculous figure" and accused him of "lying and purposely misreading my book."[tpl]cite web|last=Greenberg |first=Brad A. |url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/thegodblog/item/torture_jews_and_finkelsteins_fact_finding |title=Torture, Jews, and Finkelstein's 'fact-finding' |publisher=Jewishjournal.com |date=2008-05-08 |accessdate=2011-11-13[/tpl]

==Statements on Israel and Israelis==

Finkelstein is a sharp critic of Israel. Discussing Finkelstein's book Beyond Chutzpah, Israeli Historian Avi Shlaim stated that Finkelstein's critique of Israel "is based on an amazing amount of research. He seems to have read everything. He has gone through the reports of Israeli groups, of human rights groups, Human Rights Watch and Peace Now and B'Tselem, all of the reports of Amnesty International. And he deploys all this evidence from Israeli and other sources in order to sustain his critique of Israeli practices, Israeli violations of human rights of the Palestinians, Israeli house demolitions, the targeted assassinations of Palestinian militants, the cutting down of trees, the building of the wall — the security barrier on the West Bank, which is illegal — the restrictions imposed on the Palestinians in the West Bank, and so on and so forth. I find his critique extremely detailed, well-documented and accurate."
In a telephone interview with Today's Zaman, in 2009, Finkelstein stated: I think Israel, as a number of commentators pointed out, is becoming an insane state. And we have to be honest about that. While the rest of the world wants peace, Europe wants peace, the US wants peace, but this state wants war, war and war. In the first week of the massacres, there were reports in the Israeli press that Israel did not want to put all its ground forces in Gaza because it was preparing attacks on Iran. Then there were reports it was planning attacks on Lebanon. It is a lunatic state.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&link=164483 |title=Norman Finkelstein: Israel is committing a holocaust in Gaza |publisher=Todayszaman.com |date=2009-01-19 |accessdate=2011-11-13[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=June 2013[/tpl] 
When asked how he, as the son of Holocaust survivors, felt about Israel’s operation in Gaza, Finkelstein replied: It has been a long time since I felt any emotional connection with the state of Israel, which relentlessly and brutally and inhumanly keeps these vicious, murderous wars. It is a vandal state. There is a Russian writer who once described vandal states as Genghis Khan with a telegraph. Israel is Genghis Khan with a computer. I feel no emotion of affinity with that state. I have some good friends and their families there, and of course I would not want any of them to be hurt. That said, sometimes I feel that Israel has come out of the boils of the hell, a satanic state 
The Anti-Defamation League has described Finkelstein as an "obsessive anti-Zionist" filled with "vitriolic hatred of Zionism and Israel."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/ADL_Opinions/Holocaust/20051031-JewishStandard.htm |title=Norman Finkelstein: An Obsessive Anti-Zionist Shows his Stripes |publisher=Adl.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-13[/tpl] On being called an anti-Zionist Finkelstein has said: "It's a superficial term. I am opposed to any state with an ethnic character, not only to Israel."
Finkelstein is an advocate of a two state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.[tpl]cite web|last=Finkelstein|first=Norman|title=Reasoned rejection of one-state position|url=http://www.normanfinkelstein.com/reasoned-rejection-of-one-state-position/|work=normanfinkelstein.com|publisher=normanfinkelstein.com|accessdate=January 11, 2012[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=June 2013[/tpl]

===Hezbollah and Hamas===

Finkelstein has expressed solidarity with Hezbollah and Hamas with respect to defensive actions, alleging that Israel had invaded Lebanon as a signal of rejection when Hamas was seeking a diplomatic settlement with Israel. He also condemned what he said was Israel's refusal "to abide by international law and to abide by the opinion of the international community" to settle the conflict.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.memritv.org/clip_transcript/en/1676.htm |title=In Defense of Hezbollah |publisher=Normanfinkelstein.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-04[/tpl]The Facts About Hamas and the War on Gaza  "I was of course happy to meet the Hizbullah people, because it is a point of view that is rarely heard in the United States. I have no problem saying that I do want to express solidarity with them, and I am not going to be a coward of a hypocrite about it. I don’t care about Hizbullah as a political organization. I don’t know much about their politics, and anyhow, it’s irrelevant. I don’t live in Lebanon. It’s a choice that the Lebanese have to make: Who they want to be their leaders, who they want to represent them. But there is a fundamental principle. People have the right to defend their country from foreign occupiers, and people have the right to defend their country from invaders who are destroying their country. That to me is a very basic, elementary and uncomplicated question." While condemning the targeting of civilians to achieve a political goal, Finkelstein has stated he believes Hezbollah has the right to target Israeli civilians as long as "Israel persists in targeting Lebanese civilians until Israel ceases its terrorist acts."[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20131006204354/http://palestinechronicle.com/old/view_article_details.php?id=16783 |title=It Was a Massacre – Interview with Norman Finkelstein |publisher=Palestinechronicle.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-13|quote=I do believe that Hezbollah has the right to target Israeli civilians if Israel persists in targeting civilians until Israel ceases its terrorist acts.[/tpl]
During the Second Intifada, Finkelstein stated a moral equivalence exists between Hamas and the state of Israel in regards to the military policy of targeted killings.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.normanfinkelstein.com/article.php?ar=646&pg=11 |title=Finkelstein on Hamas, current crisis, Lebanon, Hezbollah |publisher=Normanfinkelstein.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-13[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=June 2013[/tpl] Finkelstein argued one of Israel’s primary motivations for launching the 2008 offensive in Gaza was that Hamas was “signaling that it wanted a diplomatic settlement of the conflict along the June 1967 border.” Finkelstein believes Hamas had joined the international community in “seeking a diplomatic settlement” and describes Hamas's stance towards Israel prior to the war as a “peace offensive.”[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2009/1/8/former_amb_martin_indyk_vs_author |title=Former Amb.

==Statements on the BDS movement==

In February 2012, Finkelstein "launched a blistering attack" on the BDS movement, saying it was a "hypocritical, dishonest cult", "like the Munchkin cult in Oz," that tries to cleverly pose as human rights activists while in reality their goal is to destroy Israel. Furthermore, Finkelstein stated that the BDS movement has had very few successes, and that just like a cult, the leaders pretend that they are hugely successful when in reality the general public rejects their extreme views.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/63662/finkelstein-disowns-silly-israel-boycott |title=Finkelstein disowns 'silly' Israel boycott |work=The Jewish Chronicle |date=2012-02-16 |accessdate=2012-05-12[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASIBGSSw4lI |title=Norman Finkelstein Interview with Frank Barat: BDS Campaign |work=Imperial College London |date=2012-09-02[/tpl][tpl]Cite web |author= Norman G.
