The Rio Group ([tpl]lang-pt|Grupo do Rio[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-pt|ˈɡɾupu du ˈʁi.u|[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-es|Grupo de Río[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-es|ˈɡɾupo ðe ˈri.o|[/tpl]) is an international organization of Latin American and some Caribbean states. It was created on 18 December 1986 in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro by means of the Declaration of Rio de Janeiro, signed by Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela (the members of the Contadora Group and the Contadora Support Group). To some extent it was perceived by some observers  as an alternative body to the Organization of American States during the Cold War, since that body was dominated by the United States.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2008[/tpl] The Rio Group does not have a secretariat or permanent body, and instead relies on yearly summits of heads of states.
