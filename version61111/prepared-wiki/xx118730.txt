Wildboarclough is a village in east Cheshire, England, in the civil parish of Macclesfield Forest and Wildboarclough within the Peak District National Park. It is famed as being the place where the last wild boar in England was killed. However this is a myth.[tpl]cite book |last=Bilsborough |first=Norman |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The Treasures of Cheshire |year=1983 |publisher=The North West Civic Trust |location=Manchester |isbn=0-901347-35-3 [/tpl] Bilsborough states that the name arises from the rapid rise in levels of the Clough Brook after a heavy fall of rain, but Mills[tpl]cite book |last=Mills  |first=A D |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Dictionary of English Place-Names (2nd ed) |year=1997 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-280074-4 [/tpl] gives it as a deep valley (i.e. a clough) frequented by wild boar.
From the nearby summit of Shutlingsloe (altitude 506 metres), which lies just to the north-west of the village, a wide panorama of the Cheshire Plain and the Peak District can be obtained. In clear conditions the view extends as far as the Mersey Estuary and the Welsh Clwydian Hills 40 miles to the west, and the cooling towers of the power stations on the banks of the River Trent 50 miles to the east. Nearby is the hamlet of Saltersford.
