[[Lynestrenol]]

CATEGORIES: Progestogens

Lynestrenol is a progestogen hormone. It is a synthetic orally-available progestagen associated with numerous effects of the natural progesterone hormone. Lynestrenol has a strong progestational effect on the uterine endometrium (transforming proliferative endometrium into secretory one), inhibits secretion of gonadotropin, suppresses maturation of follicles in the ovaries and ovulation, reduces menstrual bleeding. 
This synthetic gestagen is associated with minimal estrogenic, androgenic and anabolic effects. 
Lynestrenol is used in treatment of hormonal disorders and diseases caused by insufficient secretion of the natural progesterone, except in case of risky pregnancies and prevention of miscarriage, since it is not efficient enough in this indication.

==Pharmacology==

After oral administration lynestrenol is quickly resorbed and converted into pharmacologically active norethisterone, through which it demonstrates the main biological effects. The peak blood are reached within 2â€“4 hours after oral administration, 97% of the administered dose being bound to plasma proteins.
Lynestrenol and its metabolites are predominantly excreted in the urine, less through feces, active metabolite norethisterone elimination halftime being 16-17 h.
