==Career and business interests==

At age 18, Copperfield enrolled at New York city's Jesuit based school, Fordham University.  However, three weeks into his freshman year Copperfield left Fordham, as he was cast in the lead role of the musical "The Magic Man", in Chicago.   At this time is when he adopted his new stage name "David Copperfield", taken from the famous Charles Dickens novel because he liked the sound of it.  Copperfield was the show: he sang, danced and created most of the original illusions it used. "The Magic Man" put Copperfield's name on the map; in fact, the show became the longest running musical in Chicago's history.[tpl]cite web|title=The Magic of David Copperfield|url=http://www3.nd.edu/~observer/04152002/Scene/0.html|work=Notre Dame & St Mary's Observer|accessdate=December 21, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Reappearing Act: Inside The Multimillion Dollar World Of Illusionist David Copperfield|url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/morganbrennan/2013/09/05/reappearing-act-inside-the-multimillion-dollar-world-of-illusionist-david-copperfield/|publisher=Forbes Financial & Lifestyle Journal|accessdate=December 21, 2013|first=Morgan|last=Brennan[/tpl]

There have been 20 Copperfield TV specials between 1977 and 2001.
Copperfield played the character of "Ken the Magician" in the 1980 horror film Terror Train. He also made an uncredited appearance in the 1994 film Prêt-à-Porter. Most of his media appearances have been through television specials and guest spots on television programs. His illusions have included making the Statue of Liberty disappear, flying, levitating over the Grand Canyon, and walking through the Great Wall of China.
In 1996, in collaboration with Francis Ford Coppola, David Ives, and Eiko Ishioka, Copperfield's Broadway show Dreams & Nightmares broke box office records in New York at the Martin Beck Theatre.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/26/theater/poof-quick-as-smoke-questions-about-magic-just-seem-to-disappear.html?scp=39&sq=|title=Poof!

He disappears and reappears, gets cut in half, makes audience members vanish and others levitate.  Copperfield climaxes his show with a flying routine, seven years in the making, that defies both logic and visual evidence -- he could probably retire just by selling his secrets to future productions of Peter Pan.”Evans, Greg - "David Copperfield: Dreams & Nightmares," Variety, Dec 5, 1996.
Also during 1996, Copperfield joined forces with Dean Koontz, Joyce Carol Oates, Ray Bradbury and others for David Copperfield’s Tales of the Impossible, an anthology of original fiction set in the world of magic and illusion.

Copperfield notes that his role models growing up were not magicians, that "My idols were Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire and Orson Welles and Walt Disney ... they took their individual art forms and they moved people with them ... I wanted to do the same thing with magic. I wanted to take magic and make it romantic and make it sexy and make it funny and make it goofy ... all the different things that a songwriter gets to express or a filmmaker gets to express ...."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.magictelevision.org/portal/1996/oprah-david-copperfield.html |title=Magic Television  – Oprah: David Copperfield |publisher= Magic Television |date=February 19, 1996 |accessdate= February 8, 2011[/tpl]
