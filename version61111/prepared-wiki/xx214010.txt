Blackburn Rovers are an English football club formed in 1875.

==The early years==

The club Blackburn Rovers was the idea of John Lewis and Arthur Constantine during a seventeen-man meeting at the Leger Hotel, Blackburn on 5 November 1875. The club's first secretary was Walter Duckworth, and Lewis was its first treasurer. Many of the initial members were wealthy and well-connected. Blackburn has had a particular strong history of football, Rovers weren't the town's only side in the 19th century; other rivals included Blackburn Olympic F.C. (1883 winners of the FA Cup) and Blackburn Park Road F.C., among others.
The first match played by Blackburn Rovers took place in Church, Lancashire on 11 December 1875.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rovers.co.uk/page/ThroughTheYears/0,,10303~78737,00.html|title=1875 - 1884: The early years|date=2 July 2007|work=History|publisher=Blackburn Rovers FC|accessdate=6 June 2012[/tpl]
During the 1876–77 season, Rovers finally gained a ground of its own by renting  a piece of farmland at Oozehead, on the west side of town facing Preston New Road. The ground was little more than a meadow with a pool in the middle that had to be covered with planks and turf for matches. Occasional games were also played at Pleasington Cricket Ground.
Subsequently Blackburn Rovers rented Alexandra Meadows, the home of the East Lancashire Cricket Club, for their matches. The inaugural game at Alexandra Meadows was played against Partick Thistle.
On 28 September 1878, Blackburn Rovers became one of 23 clubs to form the Lancashire Football Association. On 1 November 1879  the club played in the FA Cup for the first time, beating the Tyne Association Football Club 5–1. Rovers were eventually put out of the competition in the third round after suffering a heavy 6–0 defeat by Nottingham Forest.
During the 1881–82 season, the club continued to rent the facilities at Alexandra Meadows, but began to look towards a move elsewhere. As the leading club in the area, it was felt that Rovers needed its own ground. A ground was leased at Leamington Street and £500 was spent on a new grandstand capable of seating 600–700 spectators. Boards were placed around the pitch to help prevent a repeat of the crowd troubles with Darwen, and a large ornate entrance arch was erected bearing the name of the club and ground.
On 25 March 1882, the club won through to the final of the FA Cup against the Old Etonians. Blackburn Rovers was the first provincial team to reach the final, but the result was a 1–0 defeat by the Old Etonians. There was no repeat of the previous season's success during the 1882–83 season, when Rovers suffered a bitter defeat 1–0 at the hands of Darwen in the second-round. Local rivals Blackburn Olympic went on to be the first provincial team to actually win the FA Cup.
Rovers finally won the FA Cup on 29 March 1884 — the year Thomas Mitchell joined as manager — at the Kennington Oval, with a 2–1 victory over the Scottish team Queen's Park F.C. Had it not been for this cup success the club would have folded leaving Blackburn Olympic the primary team in Blackburn. The same teams played the FA Cup final again the next season, with Blackburn Rovers again emerging victorious, with a 2–0 score. Rovers repeated this success yet again the next season, winning the final against West Bromwich Albion. For this three-in-a-row of FA Cup victories, the club was awarded a specially commissioned silver shield and given the unique privilege of displaying the club crest on its corner flags.

==The Football League and Ewood Park==

On 2 March 1888, William McGregor, a Birmingham shopkeeper and a committee member of Aston Villa Football Club, sent a letter to five clubs — Blackburn Rovers among them — suggesting that twelve of the leading clubs should organise a series of home and away matches between themselves. With the introduction of professional players, it seemed natural that better organisation should be brought to the complex and chaotic system of friendly and competitive matches prevalent at the time. On 22 March 1888 John Birtwistle represented Blackburn Rovers at a meeting of a number of clubs at the Anderton Hotel in London. This meeting, and subsequent ones, led to the creation of the Football League, with Blackburn Rovers as part of it. Rovers finished the inaugural season of the league in fourth place, and unbeaten at home.
Blackburn Rovers again reached the FA Cup final on 29 March 1890 at the Kennington Oval. The club claimed the trophy, for the fourth time, by beating Sheffield Wednesday a hefty 6–1 — with left forward William Townley scoring three goals and becoming the first player to achieve a hat-trick in the FA Cup final. The summer of 1890 brought yet another significant event in the history of Blackburn Rovers with the decision to move again. The choice of new home was Ewood Park, and it remained the club's home for the next century or more.
Ewood Park was built in 1882, the idea of four local businessmen, and it had hosted a number of sporting events. In 1890 Blackburn Rovers purchased the ground and spent a further £1000 on refurbishments to bring it up to standard. The first match was played on 13 September 1890 against Accrington, with a 0–0 draw result.
The 1890–1891 season saw Blackburn Rovers win the FA Cup for fifth time against Notts County F.C. with a 3–1 victory — but this success marked beginning of a lengthy period without silverware at national level. With Mitchell still in the manager's seat, Rovers continued their solid league form — Rovers never finished worse than ninth in the top flight until after Mitchell's departure in 1896.

==Early 20th century==

Blackburn Rovers continued to struggle during the early years of the 20th century, but the results began a gradual improvement. Major renovations were made to Ewood Park: in 1905 the Darwen End was covered at a cost of £1680 and the new Nuttall Stand was opened on New Year's Day 1907. During the first three decades of the 20th century, Blackburn Rovers were still considered a top side in the English league. They were league champions in 1912 and 1914, and FA Cup winners in 1928, but the FA Cup win was their last major trophy for nearly 70 years.

==Mid 20th century==

Blackburn Rovers maintained a respectable mid-table position in the First Division until they were finally relegated (along with Aston Villa) from the top flight (for the first time since the foundation of the league) in the 1935–36 season. Their final match prior to relegation was a triumph. By the last game of the season, they were already certain to be relegated, but at Villa Park, they beat the home side, thus dragging the only other team of the original Football League who had never been relegated, Aston Villa, with them. They struggled in the second division for the next two seasons, until winning the Second Division title in the final season before the war.
When the league resumed after the war, Blackburn Rovers were relegated in their second season (1947–48) and remained in the second division for the following ten years. After promotion in 1958, they again returned to the mid-table position they had occupied in the earlier part of the century. During this time, they seldom made a serious challenge for a major trophy — although they did reach the 1960 FA Cup final when managed by Scot Dally Duncan. Rovers lost this game 3–0 to Wolverhampton Wanderers after playing most of the game with only 10 men on the field. Full back Dave Whelan was lost during the game to a broken leg, the game being played in the days before substitutes were allowed. Despite losing, cup final man of the match was future Scotland manager Ally MacLeod (left winger MacLeod scored 47 goals in 193 appearances for Rovers). During the 1960s Blackburn Rovers had several players who made it into national teams. They were again relegated from the First Division in 1966 and began a 26-year exile from the top division.

==1970s and 1980s: More frustration==

During the 1970s, Blackburn Rovers bounced between the Second and Third Divisions, winning the Third Division title in 1975, but never mounted a challenge for promotion to the First Division despite the efforts of successive managers to put the club back on track. They went up as runners up in the Third Division in 1980 and have remained in the upper two tiers of the English league ever since. In 1988–89 they mounted their first serious promotion challenge for many years, and reached the Second Division playoff final in its last-ever season of the home-away two-legged format — but lost to Crystal Palace. A defeat in the 1989–90 Second Division playoff semi-finals brought more frustration to Ewood Park, but the following season saw the club taken over by local steelworks owner and lifelong supporter Jack Walker (1929–2000).

==1990s: The Jack Walker revolution==

===Back at the top (1991–1994)===

Jack Walker's takeover was too late to save Rovers from finishing 19th in the Second Division at the end of the 1990–91 season, but the new owner had made money available to spend on new players. Blackburn Rovers began the 1991–92 season with Don Mackay still manager, but he was soon sacked to make way for Kenny Dalglish. Dalglish made several substantial signings during the season. After his appointment Rovers climbed the league, but later lost six games in a row, causing them to fall out of the play-off places, but Rovers fought back and a 3–1 victory at Plymouth got Rovers to the final play off place. The club reached the play-off final at Wembley where they beat Leicester City 1–0 thanks to a Mike Newell penalty.
Rovers made headlines in the summer of 1992 by paying an English record fee of £3.5million for the 22-year-old Southampton and England centre forward Alan Shearer. Other expensive signings during the 1992–93 season included Chelsea defender Graeme Le Saux, Middlesbrough winger Stuart Ripley and Coventry striker Kevin Gallacher. An impressive Blackburn side remained in the title challenge for most of the season before finishing fourth in the final table, that season not quite enough for UEFA Cup place. Leeds midfielder David Batty and Southampton goalkeeper Tim Flowers were two key signings who helped Blackburn progress in 1993–94 and finish Premiership runners-up to Manchester United. Rovers broke the English transfer fee record again a few weeks later when paying Norwich City £5million for 21-year-old striker Chris Sutton.

===Premiership Champions (1994–1995)===

Blackburn won the Premier League in 1994–95.

===Ray Harford era (1995–1997)===

Kenny Dalglish moved upstairs to the position of Director of Football at the end of the championship season, and handed over the reins to his assistant Ray Harford (1945–2003).
Blackburn Rovers made a poor start to the 1995–96 season, and found themselves in the bottom half for most of the first half of the season. Rovers also struggled in the Champions League and finished bottom of their group with just four points. A 7–0 victory over Nottingham Forest on the day of the official opening of the redeveloped Ewood Park and a 4–1 win over Rosenborg (including a nine-minute Mike Newell hat-trick, which is still the fastest hat-trick in Champions League history) were two highlights of an otherwise disappointing seasons. Alan Shearer was instrumental again, becoming the first striker to score more than 30 Premiership goals in three successive seasons. Blackburn Rovers improved as the season went on, finishing seventh in the Premiership and narrowly missing out on a UEFA Cup place.
Alan Shearer was top goalscorer at Euro 96 and was linked to domestic and international clubs. The main talk in the national media was of Shearer joining hated rivals Manchester United. Blackburn Rovers, Alan Shearer (many Rovers fans didn't forgive Shearer for several years due to his denials) and the Lancashire Evening Telegraph constantly slammed the rumours especially the links with Manchester United. Local journalist Peter White stated that the club should never be forgiven should Shearer be allowed to join Manchester United.
However Shearer was sold to hometown club Newcastle United for a then world record fee of £15million in the summer of 1996, and Rovers were unable to find a suitable replacement.
It was clear that while Shearer was allowed to join Newcastle that Jack Walker would never have allowed him to join Manchester United. The chairman of Manchester United, Martin Edwards admitted this.
A terrible start to the 1996–97 Premiership campaign saw Harford resign in late October with the club bottom of the division, having failed to win any of their first ten games. Relegation looked a real possibility, just two seasons after winning the league. The club immediately began the process of recruiting his replacement.[ref][tpl]cite web |url=http://archive.thisislancashire.co.uk/1996/10/25/842137.html |title=Who's next after Harford? |accessdate=10 February 2008 |date=25 October 1996 |work=Lancashire Evening Telegraph |publisher=Newsquest Media Group[/tpl]
[/ref] Meanwhile caretaker manager Tony Parkes turned the club's fortunes around and they eventually finished in a secure 13th place in the final table.
On 16 December 1996 with Rovers hovering above the relegation zone, it was announced at an Ewood Park press conference that Sven-Göran Eriksson had signed an "unconditional contract" with Rovers to take over as manager at the end of the season on 1 July 1997 when his contract with Italian Serie A club U.C. Sampdoria expired.
It was hoped that the signing of Eriksson would usher in a new era of success after the continuing difficulties following Ray Harford's disappointing tenure as manager. "Not only do I want us to be a top club in this country, I want European football to be the norm for us", said club owner Jack Walker. "If we get support as high as we want it and the public back us in every way they can then we could even consider redeveloping the Walkersteel Stand".p.32, Lancashire Evening Telegraph, Tuesday 17 December 1996

===Renewed hope and downfall (1997–1999)===

They were relegated in 1998-99.

==The new millennium==

===Fighting for a comeback===

They were promoted back to the Premier League in 2000–01.

===Return and cup glory===

In 2001–02, the club marked their first season back in the Premiership with a tenth-place finish and their record signing, an £8m swoop for Manchester United's Andy Cole. More significantly, Blackburn Rovers won their first-ever League Cup by beating Tottenham Hotspur 2–1 at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff — where Cole proved his worth by scoring the winning goal in the 69th minute after Matt Jansen had put Rovers in front. The Jansen and Cole partnership excited the Ewood Park faithful after the latter's arrival in January, and both were disappointed not to make the 2002 England World Cup squad. Before the season began, Turkish playmaker Tugay Kerimoğlu, Italian hotshot Corrado Grabbi and full back Lucas Neill were signed to strengthen an already solid squad. With David Dunn and Damien Duff both shining, the season was a memorable one.

===2003–2004: Setback===

At the start of 2003–04 the sale of fan favourites Damien Duff and David Dunn meant that Rovers were always going to struggle to emulate the previous season's form, and there was anger from fans at their sales. In particular, Dunn, who had demanded a transfer after falling out with his manager.

===2004–2008: Return of the Spark===

Souness left just after the start of 2004–05 to take charge at Newcastle. Rovers appointed Welsh national coach Mark Hughes as his successor, a key player in the club's promotion and League Cup successes a few seasons earlier. Hughes secured Rovers Premiership survival for the 2004–05 season as well as an FA Cup semi-final against Arsenal, with Rovers finishing 15th once again, with Hughes's arrival coinciding with the team becoming one of the most solid teams in the league, thanks to astute signings such as Ryan Nelsen and Aaron Mokoena, and good motivational skills. He was able to strengthen the setup for 2005–06 with the £3.2 million transfer of much sought-after Wales international striker Craig Bellamy from Newcastle United. Following a 1–0 victory over league champions Chelsea F.C., Blackburn Rovers secured the 6th place in the league and a spot in the UEFA Cup for the 2006–07 season — their third European qualification in five years, and their sixth foray into Europe since 1994. Striker Craig Bellamy repaid the faith shown in him by Hughes, as he scored 17 goals, 13 in the league in only 22 starts, including vital goals in the 3–2 wins over Middlesbrough and the 2–2 draw at Portsmouth. Morten Gamst Pedersen, who was signed by Graeme Souness but nurtured by Hughes to become a star, shined and attracted interest from a number of big teams for his performances and set pieces, including his two goals that won the game in a historic 2–1 win over arch rivals Manchester United at Old Trafford.
After qualifying for Europe, Rovers signed South African striker Benni McCarthy from Porto as a replacement for the departed Craig Bellamy. Rovers finished top of their European group and were drawn against Bayer Leverkusen, losing 3–2 on aggregate. The club was busy during the January transfer window, signing David Dunn, Stephen Warnock, Christopher Samba and Bruno Berner. Leaving the squad were Dominic Matteo, Andy Taylor (loan), Joe Garner (loan), Lucas Neill and Jay McEveley. In cup competitions, Rovers were knocked out of the Carling Cup in the Third Round. They defeated Everton, Luton, Arsenal (after replay) and Manchester City in the FA Cup.  Thereafter, they faced Chelsea for a place in the final, losing 2–1 when Michael Ballack scored Chelsea's winner in extra time. Rovers finished the season 10th in the league, with McCarthy netting 18 league goals. The club also qualified for the Intertoto Cup and drew Lithuanian side FK VetraBlackburn Rovers - Vetra: 4 - 0 Match report from ScoresPro.com [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl] of Vilnius.
To prepare for the 2007–08 season Rovers bought Roque Santa Cruz, Maceo Rigters and Gunnar Nielsen. In the January 2008 transfer window, Robbie Savage left for Derby in a £1.5m (rising to £2m) transfer to seek first team football. Rovers were never at any stage during the season outside the top ten and made their best start to a campaign for 10 years and Santa Cruz brilliantly shone scoring 23 goals in all competitions.http://www.premierleague.com/page/blackburn-rovers

==Ince and Allardyce (since 2008)==

After the 2007–08 season, Mark Hughes released three senior players who were out of contract — defenders Stéphane Henchoz and Bruno Berner and goalkeeper Peter Enckelman.
Paul Ince, who took Milton Keynes Dons to the League Two title in 2007–08, was also linked with the manager's job. On 19 June, BBC Sport revealed that Paul Ince was set to replace Hughes as Blackburn manager. In the final few days of the selection process it was also revealed  that Michael Laudrup was interested in the job.[tpl]Cite news | title = Laudrup Enters Rovers Manager Race| publisher= Sky Sports | date = 19 June 2008 | url = http://msnsport.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11095_3710662,00.html[/tpl] On 22 June 2008, it was officially confirmed by the Blackburn Rovers Website/club, that Paul Ince had indeed been brought in to manage Rovers, signing a three-year deal at the club.[tpl]Cite news | title = Paul Ince Rovers New Manager | publisher = Rovers official website | date = 22 June 2008 | url = http://www.rovers.premiumtv.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10303~1332318,00.html[/tpl] Ince was presented to the media on Tuesday 24 June. Ince's first job though as the Blackburn Manager is to persuade some of the wantaway players to stay.[tpl]Cite news | title = Warnock - Exciting times lay ahead! | publisher = BBC Sport | date = 23 June 2008 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/blackburn_rovers/7469927.stm[/tpl] On 4 July, Paul Ince signed experienced coach Archie Knox, who will be taking over as 1st team coach for the oncoming season.
Before the start of the 2008–09 season, regular goalkeeper Brad Friedel and England international winger David Bentley left the club. Goalkeeper Paul Robinson then became Ince's first signing on 25 July for a fee of £3.5 million.
Ince's reign as Blackburn Rovers manager got off to the perfect start, with a 3–2 away win against Everton FC in the first game to the 2008–09 season. Blackburn drew 1–1 at home to Hull City before two heavy defeats to West Ham and Arsenal. They bounced back well and recorded back-to-back wins against Fulham and Newcastle United, but faded drastically: three draws and seven defeats, including five defeats in a row to saw Blackburn slip to 19th in the table after 16 games. This led to Ince coming under increasing pressure: he enjoyed some success in the Carling Cup, with wins over Everton and Sunderland. Eventually Ince paid the price for poor results, and a 3–0 defeat away to Wigan saw him sacked a few days later. He was replaced by the former Bolton manager Sam Allardyce. Allardyce secured Premier League survival, and despite a difficult start to the 2009–10 season Rovers recovered well in the second half of the campaign to secure a comfortable 10th place finish with 50 points — placing them 20 points clear of the relegation zone.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8665471.stm | work=BBC News | title=Aston Villa 0-1 Blackburn | date=9 May 2010[/tpl]

==Club takeover==

In January 2008, the Dan Williams-led consortium interested in taking the club over withdrew interest. The club are prepared to sell and other groups are still interested.[tpl]Cite news | title = Investor confirms Blackburn talks | publisher = BBC Sport | date = 19 June 2007 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/blackburn_rovers/6748019.stm[/tpl]
On Sunday 20 April 2008, Blackburn Rovers were yet again linked with another consortium led bid. This time from new JJB Sports owner Chris Ronnie, and an Icelandic based consortium. Whether this will lead to a formal bid being presented to the Walker Trustees, is still yet to be seen.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.thisislancashire.co.uk/sport/sportheadlines/display.var.2211225.0.blackburn_rovers_in_dark_over_chris_ronnie_takeover_report.php | title=Blackburn Rovers in dark over Chris Ronnie 'takeover' report | author=Neild, Andy | publisher=This Is Lancashire | date=21 April 2008 | accessdate=21 April 2008[/tpl]
On Sunday 8 June 2008, Blackburn Rovers were again linked to Chris Ronnie's consortium in the National Press. In which the Sunday People reported "Chris Ronnie is closing in on his takeover of Blackburn Rovers", the article also went on to say "Ronnie has had four (4) meetings with Rothschilds, the financiers selling the club for the Jack Walker Trustees, and there has been 'significant progress."
Whether or not any takeover of the club results from this will become very clear within the next 4 weeks from 8 June to 8 July.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.people.co.uk/sport/football/tm_headline=ronnie-rush-job%26method=full%26objectid=20600075%26siteid=93463-name_page.html | title=Chris Ronnie closing on 'takeover' of Blackburn Rovers FC | author=Nixon, Alan | publisher=Sunday People | date=8 June 2008 | accessdate=8 June 2008[/tpl]
On 6 July, it was revealed that Chris Ronnie had pulled out of a bid to buy the club, and that Chowdery had a bid of £30 million rejected.[tpl]Cite news | title = Ronnie Loses Interest/Chowdery bid rejected | publisher= Sunday People  | date = 6 July 2008 | url = http://www.people.co.uk/sport/football/tm_headline=rovers-hold-out-for-pound-40m%26method=full%26objectid=20634095%26siteid=93463-name_page.html[/tpl]
