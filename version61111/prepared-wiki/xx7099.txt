</ref> While the threat proved overstated, Archibald proclaimed a general call to arms on 4 October. Companies of armed horsemen were raised, including one led by Riel. When Archibald reviewed the troops in St. Boniface, he made the significant gesture of publicly shaking Riel's hand, signaling that a rapprochement had been affected. This was not to be—when this news reached Ontario, Mair and members of the [[Canada First]] movement whipped up a significant resurgence of anti-Riel (and anti-Archibald) sentiment. With Federal elections coming in 1872, Macdonald could ill afford further rift in Quebec-Ontario relations. He therefore quietly arranged for Taché to offer Riel what amounted to a bribe of [[Canadian dollars|$]]1,000 to enter voluntary exile. This was supplemented by an additional [[Pound Sterling|£]]600 from Smith for the care of Riel's family. Riel accepted, arriving in [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] on 2 March 1872. However, by late June Riel was back in Manitoba and was soon persuaded to run as a member of [[Parliament of Canada|parliament]] for the electoral district of [[Provencher (electoral district)|Provencher]]. However, following the early September defeat of Cartier in his home riding in Quebec, Riel stood aside so that Cartier—on record as being in favour of amnesty for Riel—might secure a seat. Cartier won by acclamation, but Riel's hopes for a swift resolution to the amnesty question were dashed following Cartier's death on 20 May 1873. In the ensuing by-election in October 1873, Riel ran unopposed as an Independent, although he had again fled, a warrant having been issued for his arrest in September. Lépine was not so lucky; he was captured and faced trial. Riel made his way to Montreal and, fearing arrest or assassination, vacillated as to whether he should attempt to take up his seat in the [[Canadian House of Commons|House of Commons]]—[[Edward Blake]], the [[Premier of Ontario]], had announced a bounty of $5,000 for his arrest.<ref>[tpl]cite web| title =Louis Riel (1844–1885): Biography Louis Riel, Métis leader | url = http://www.museevirtuel.ca/Exhibitions/Batoche/docs/proof_en_riel_bio.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 23 September 2007 [/tpl]</ref> Famously, Riel was the only Member of Parliament who was not present for the great [[Pacific Scandal]] debate of 1873 that led to the resignation of the Macdonald government in November. [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] leader [[Alexander Mackenzie]] became the interim [[Prime Minister of Canada|prime minister]], and a general election was held in January 1874. Although the Liberals under Mackenzie formed the new government, Riel easily retained his seat. Formally, Riel had to sign a register book at least once upon being elected, and he did so under disguise in late January. He was nevertheless stricken from the rolls following a motion supported by Schultz, who had become the member for the electoral district of [[Lisgar (electoral district)|Lisgar]].<ref>

Undeterred, Riel prevailed again in the resulting by-election, and although again expelled, his symbolic point had been made and public opinion in Quebec was strongly tipped in his favour.

===Exile and mental illness===

During this period, Riel had been staying with priests of the Oblate order in Plattsburgh who introduced him to Father Fabien Martin dit Barnabé in the nearby village of Keeseville. It was here that he received news of Lépine's fate: following his trial for the murder of Scott, which had begun on 13 October 1874, Lépine was found guilty and sentenced to death. This sparked outrage in the sympathetic Quebec press, and calls for amnesty for both Lépine and Riel were renewed. This presented a severe political difficulty for Mackenzie, who was hopelessly caught between the demands of Quebec and Ontario. However, a solution was forthcoming when, acting on his own initiative, the Governor General Lord Dufferin commuted Lépine's sentence in January 1875. This opened the door for Mackenzie to secure from parliament an amnesty for Riel, on the condition that he remain in exile for five years.
During his time of exile, he was primarily concerned with religious rather than political matters. Spurred on by a sympathetic Roman Catholic priest in Quebec, he was increasingly influenced by his belief that he was a divinely chosen leader of the Métis. Modern biographers have speculated that he may have suffered from the psychological condition megalomania.[ref]
