The Proms, more formally known as The BBC Proms, or The Henry Wood Promenade Concerts presented by the BBC, is an eight-week summer season of daily orchestral classical music concerts and other events held annually, predominantly in the Royal Albert Hall in London. Founded in 1895, each season currently consists of more than 70 concerts in the Albert Hall, a series of chamber concerts at Cadogan Hall, additional Proms in the Park events across the United Kingdom on the last night, and associated educational and children's events. In 2009 the total number of concerts reached 100 for the first time. In the context of classical music festivals, Jiří Bělohlávek has described the Proms as "the world's largest and most democratic musical festival".Jiří Bělohlávek, Speech from The Last Night of the Proms 2007, 8 September 2007.
Prom is short for promenade concert, a term which originally referred to outdoor concerts in London's pleasure gardens, where the audience was free to stroll around while the orchestra was playing. In fact this tradition has been revived in parks and stately homes around the UK at promenade concerts such as the Battle Proms. In the context of the BBC Proms Promming now refers to the use of the standing areas inside the hall (the arena and gallery) for which ticket prices are much lower than for the reserved seating. Single-concert standing Promming tickets for either the Arena or Gallery can be bought only on the day of the concert, which can give rise to long queues for well-known artists or works. Proms concert-goers, particularly those who stand, are sometimes described as "Promenaders", but are most commonly referred to as "Prommers". Prommers can buy full-season tickets instead for guaranteed entry to every concert in the season (until 20 minutes before the concert is due to start), although not the assurance of a particular standing position. A number of Prommers are particularly keen in their attendance. In 1997, one programme in the BBC documentary series Modern Times covered this dedicated following of enthusiasts.

==History==

===Origins and Henry Wood===

Promenade concerts had existed in London's pleasure gardens since the mid 18th century, but on 10 August 1895 impresario Robert Newman arranged the first series of indoor promenade concerts, in the Queen's Hall in Langham Place. Newman's idea was to encourage an audience for concert hall music who, though not normally attending classical concerts, would be attracted by the low ticket prices and more informal atmosphere.  In addition to promenading; eating, drinking and smoking were all allowed.  He stated his goal as follows:
 I am going to run nightly concerts and train the public by easy stages. Popular at first, gradually raising the standard until I have created a public for classical and modern music.[tpl]cite news | author=Ivan Hewett | title= The Proms and the Promenerders | url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2007/07/12/nosplit/bmproms112.xml | work=The Daily Telegraph | date=12 July 2007 | accessdate=20 July 2008 | location=London[/tpl] 
With financial backing from the otolaryngologist Dr George Cathcart, Newman hired Henry Wood as the conductor for this series of concerts, called "Mr Robert Newman's Promenade Concerts".[tpl]cite news | author=Peter Mullen | url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/everyone-knows-henry-wood-set-up-the-proms-but-who-remembers-the-man-who-hired-him-to-do-it-by-peter-mullen-1592519.html | title=Everyone knows Henry Wood set up the Proms.

Although the concerts gained a popular following and reputation, Newman went bankrupt in 1902, and the banker Edgar Speyer took over the expense of funding the concerts.  In 1914, anti-German feeling forced Speyer out of his post.  After Speyer, music publishers Chappell & Co. took control of the concerts.
Newman continued to work in the artistic planning of these promenade concerts until his sudden death in November 1926.  With time, Wood became the name which was most closely associated with the concerts. As conductor from that first concert, Wood was largely responsible for expanding the repertoire heard in later concerts, such that by the 1920s the concerts had grown from being made up of largely more popular, less demanding works, to presenting music by contemporary composers such as Claude Debussy, Richard Strauss and Ralph Vaughan Williams. A bronze bust of Wood, belonging to the Royal Academy of Music,Sir Henry Wood Collection. Bronze bust by Donald Gilbert, 1936. Royal Academy of Music. Retrieved 2 September 2012. is placed in front of the Organ for the whole season. While now known as the BBC Proms, the text on the tickets (along with the headline "BBC Proms" next to the BBC logo), still says "BBC Music presents the Henry Wood Promenade Concerts".
In 1927, the BBC – later based at Broadcasting House next to the hall – took over the running of the concerts.  When the BBC Symphony Orchestra (BBC SO) was formed in 1930, it became the main orchestra for the concerts. At this time the season consisted of nights dedicated to particular composers; Mondays were Wagner, Fridays were Beethoven, with other major composers being featured on other days. There were no Sunday performances.
With the outbreak of World War II in 1939, the BBC withdrew its support. The Proms continued though, under private sponsorship, until the Queen's Hall was gutted by an air raid in 1941 (its site is now the St George's Hotel and BBC Henry Wood House). That same year, the Proms moved to their current home, the Royal Albert Hall, and the BBC took over once more. In 1944, however, increased danger to the Royal Albert Hall from bombing meant that the Proms moved again, this time to the Bedford Corn Exchange. This venue had been the home of the BBC Symphony Orchestra since 1941 and played host to the Proms until the end of the war.  After the war, other orchestras were invited to perform in the Proms, such that the BBC SO was no longer the sole orchestra responsible for all Proms concerts.

===Post-war===

Wood continued his work with the Proms until his death in 1944.  In the years after the war, Sir Adrian Boult and Basil Cameron took on principal conducting duties for the Proms until the advent of Malcolm Sargent as Proms chief conductor in 1947.  Sargent held this post until 1966; his associate conductor from 1949 to 1959 was John Hollingsworth.  Sargent was noted for his immaculate appearance (evening dress, carnation) and his witty addresses where he good-naturedly chided the noisy Prommers. Sir Malcolm championed choral music and classical and British composers, especially Samuel Coleridge-Taylor. The charity founded in his name, CLIC Sargent, continues to hold a special Promenade Concert each year shortly after the main season ends. CLIC Sargent, the Musicians' Benevolent Fund and further musical charities (chosen each year) also benefit from thousands of pounds in donations from Prommers after most concerts.  When asking for donations, Prommers from the Arena regularly announce to the audience the running donations total at concert intervals through the season, or before the concert when there is no interval.
After Wood's death, Julian Herbage acted as de facto principal administrator of the Proms for a number of years, as a freelance employee after his retirement from the BBC, with assistance from such staff as Edward Clark and Kenneth Wright.[tpl]cite journal | url=http://mq.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/91/1-2/89#FN12 | last=Doctor | first=Jenny | title=The Parataxis of "British Musical Modernism" | journal=The Musical Quarterly | volume=91 | issue=1–2 | pages=89–115 | year=2008 | accessdate=19 September 2010 | doi=10.1093/musqtl/gdn031[/tpl] During the tenure of William Glock as Controller of the Proms, beginning in 1960, the Proms repertory expanded both forwards in time, to encompass then contemporary and avant-garde composers such as Boulez, Berio, Carter, Dallapiccola, Peter Maxwell Davies, Gerhard, Henze, Ligeti, Lutosławski, Lutyens, Maw, Messiaen, Nono, Stockhausen, and Tippett, as well as backwards to include music by past composers such as Purcell, Cavalli, Monteverdi, Byrd, Palestrina, Dufay, Dunstaple and Machaut, as well as less-often performed works of Johann Sebastian Bach and Joseph Haydn.[tpl]cite news | author=Bayan Northcott | title=Small ripples in a calm sea: As the 100th season of Henry Wood Proms sails into port, Bayan Northcott wonders if the programming is running out of steam | url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/music--proms-small-ripples-in-a-calm-sea-as-the-100th-season-of-henry-wood-proms-sails-into-port-bayan-northcott-wonders-if-the-programming-is-running-out-of-steam-1446529.html?cmp=ilc-n | work=The Independent | date=| accessdate=19 September 2010 | location=London[/tpl] From the 1960s, the number of guest orchestras at the Proms also began to increase, with the first major international conductors (Leopold Stokowski, Georg Solti and Carlo Maria Giulini) performing in 1963, and the first foreign orchestra, the Moscow Radio Symphony Orchestra, performing in 1966. Since that time, almost every major international orchestra, conductor and soloist has performed at the Proms. In 1970, Soft Machine's appearance led to press attention and comment as the first "pop" band to perform there.

===Since 1990===

The Proms continue today, and still present newly commissioned music alongside pieces more central to the repertoire and early music. Innovations continue, with pre-Prom talks, lunchtime chamber concerts, children's Proms, Proms in the Park either appearing, or being featured more heavily over the past few years. In the UK, all concerts are broadcast on BBC Radio 3, an increasing number are televised on BBC Four with some also shown on BBC One and BBC Two. The theme tune played at the beginning of each programme broadcast on television is an extract from the end of the "Red" movement of Arthur Bliss's A Colour Symphony. It is also possible to hear the concerts live from the BBC Proms website. The Last Night is also broadcast in many countries around the world.
In 1996, a related series of eight lunchtime chamber concerts was started, taking place on Mondays during the Proms season. In their first year these were held in the Britten Hall of the Royal College of Music (just across Prince Consort Road from the Albert Hall). The following year they moved slightly further afield, to the Henry Cole Lecture Theatre at the Victoria and Albert Museum. In 2005 they moved further again, to the new Cadogan Hall, just off London's Sloane Square. These allow the Proms to include music which is not suitable for the vast spaces of the Albert Hall.
From 1998 to 2007, the Blue Peter Prom, in partnership with long-running BBC television programme Blue Peter, was an annual fixture.[tpl]cite book |title=BBC Proms Guide 2007 |year=2007 |publisher=BBC |isbn=978-1-84607-256-7[/tpl] Aimed at children and families, the Prom is informal, including audience participation, jokes, and popular classics.[tpl]cite news |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/proms2004/story/0,,1269954,00.html |title=Blue Peter Proms |first=David |last=Lasserson |date=|work=The Guardian |location=UK [/tpl] High demand for tickets – which are among the lowest priced in the season – saw this Prom be split in 2004 into two Proms with identical content.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2004/07_july/01/proms_bluepeter.shtml |title=Blue Peter presenters perform at the Proms |author=BBC Press Office |date=|accessdate=1 September 2007 [/tpl] In 2008, the Blue Peter Prom was replaced with a Doctor Who Prom which was repeated in both the 2010 and 2013 seasons.[tpl]cite news |first=Neil |last=Fisher |title= The Proms have been innovating ever since 1895 |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/proms/article4413065.ece |work=The Times |location=UK |date=|accessdate=1 January 2009 [/tpl]
The 2004 season also featured the Hall's newly rebuilt pipe organ. It took two years to complete the task (2002–2004) and was the work of Noel Mander, Ltd., of London. It was the first complete restoration of the instrument since Harrison and Harrison's work in 1936.
The tradition of Promming remains an important aspect of the festival, with over 1000 standing places available for each concert, either in the central arena (rather like the groundlings in the pit at Shakespeare's Globe) or high in the hall's gallery.  Promming tickets cost the same for all concerts (still only £5 in 2013), providing a considerably cheaper option for the more popular events. Since the tickets cannot be bought in advance (although there are full-season tickets, first weekend and weekly passes available), they provide a way of getting into otherwise sold-out concerts.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/proms/2010/booking/howtoprom.shtml|title=What is promming?|publisher=BBC|year=2010|accessdate=19 July 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/proms/2010/booking/howtobook.shtml|title=How to book/buy tickets|publisher=BBC|year=2010|accessdate=19 July 2010[/tpl]
In 2010, the Proms Archive was introduced on the BBC Proms webpage, to allow for a systematic searching of all works that have been performed and all artists who have appeared at The Proms since their inception. On 1 September 2011 a Prom given by the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra was severely affected by interruptions from pro-Palestinian protesters.Andrew Hough and Andy Bloxham "Proms: Palestinian protest at Royal Albert Hall forces BBC to abandon live broadcast", The Daily Telegraph, 2 September 2011 While the Palestine Solidarity Campaign had urged a boycott, they denied being behind the disruption inside the Royal Albert Hall.

==Proms seasons: 2006–2011==

===2006 season===

The 2006 season (the 112th) marked the 250th birthday celebrations of Mozart and the centenary of Shostakovich's birth. New initiatives included four Saturday matinee concerts at the Cadogan Hall and the chance for audience members to get involved with The Voice, a collaborative piece performed in two Proms on 29 July. On 3 September 2006, a concert was cancelled due to a fire.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5312108.stm|title=Proms resume after fire at venue|date=|accessdate=11 April 2007|publisher=BBC website|publisher=BBC News Online[/tpl] The season saw the launch of a venture called the Proms Family Orchestra in which children and their extended families can make music with BBC musicians.

===2007 season===

The 2007 season ran from 13 July–8 September 2007, with the first concert beginning with Walton's Portsmouth Point and included Elgar's Cello Concerto performed by Paul Watkins and Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. Following the previous year's Voice day, brass instruments were specially featured with two concerts on 28 July 2007. Early press coverage focused heavily on the fact that musical theatre star Michael Ball would be the central performer in a concert on 27 August and a concert of British film music on 14 July. This led to media accusations of "dumbing down", despite Nicholas Kenyon's defence of the programme.[tpl]cite news | first = Dalya | last = Alberge | title = BBC Proms to feature West End show tunes | url = http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/stage/article1706472.ece |work=The Times |location=London | id = ISSN 0140 0460  | date = | accessdate =26 April 2007 [/tpl][tpl]cite news | first = Arifa | last = Akbar | title = BBC denies dumbing down as Michael Ball signs up for Proms | url = http://news.independent.co.uk/media/article2486631.ece |work=The Independent |location=UK | publisher=Independent News & Media | id = ISSN 002708 | date = | accessdate =26 April 2007 [/tpl]gua[tpl]cite news | title = Dam Busters fly in for British film score night at the Proms | url = http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-23393848-details/Dam+Busters+fly+in+for+British+film+score+night+at+the+Proms/article.do  | work=Evening Standard |location=London  | publisher=Associated Newspapers | date = | accessdate =26 April 2007 [/tpl] Anniversaries marked in this Proms season included the 150th anniversary of the birth of Sir Edward Elgar, the 100th anniversary of the death of Edvard Grieg and the 50th anniversary of the death of Jean Sibelius as well as marking 80 years since the first BBC sponsorship of the Proms.  The series also included an additional series of four Saturday matinee concerts at Cadogan Hall.
The 2007 season was Nicholas Kenyon's last season as controller of the BBC Proms, before he became managing director at the Barbican Centre from October 2007.[tpl]cite news |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/art/news/story/0,,2019515,00.html|title=Proms chief takes over at Barbican|date=|accessdate=11 April 2007|work=The Guardian |location=UK|publisher=Guardian Media Group|first=Charlotte|last=Higgins[/tpl] Roger Wright became controller of the Proms in October 2007, whilst retaining responsibility for BBC Radio 3 and taking up a broader role controlling the BBC's classical music output across all media.[tpl]cite news | title = Radio 3 Controller to run the BBC Proms | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2007/04_april/19/proms.shtml | work=BBC press release CF2/VB | publisher=BBC Online | date = | accessdate =26 April 2007 [/tpl]

===2008 season===

The 2008 season ran from 18 July to 13 September 2008.

The celebration of Stockhausen was centred on two large-scale concerts on 2 August 2008, and complementing Vaughan Williams's interest in folk music, the first Sunday was given over to a celebration of various aspects of British folk, including free events in Kensington Gardens and the Albert Hall, and ending with the first-ever céilidh in the Albert Hall itself.[tpl]cite news | author=Jessica Duchen | title=BBC Proms: Everything you wanted to know (but were afraid to ask) | url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/bbc-proms-everything-you-wanted-to-know-but-were-afraid-to-ask-870363.html | work=The Independent | date=| accessdate=20 July 2008 | location=London[/tpl]
Other changes included additional pre-Prom talks and events.  For the first time, there was a related talk or event before every Prom, held in the Royal College of Music.  The popular family-oriented Prom this year became the Doctor Who Prom, (in place of the Blue Peter Prom of recent years).[tpl]cite news | author=Ciar Byrne | title=Doctor Who makes his debut at the Proms | url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/doctor-who-makes-his-debut-at-the-proms-806999.html | work=The Independent | date=| accessdate=20 July 2008 | location=London[/tpl] The Doctor Who Prom included a mini-episode of Doctor Who, "Music of the Spheres".
Just over a month before the announcement, Margaret Hodge, a Minister of State at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport suggested "that the Proms was one of several big cultural events that many people did not feel comfortable attending" and advocated an increase in multicultural works and an effort to broaden the audience. Her comments received wide criticism in the musical world and media as being a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of the Proms, with Gordon Brown even distancing himself from her remarks.[tpl]cite news | author=Philip Webster | title=Margaret Hodge in hot water after Proms attack | url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article3482980.ece | work=The Times | date=| accessdate=5 March 2008 | location=London[/tpl]

==Last Night of the Proms==

Many people's perception of the Proms is taken from the Last Night, although this concert is very different from the others. It usually takes place on the second Saturday in September, and is broadcast in the UK on BBC2 (first half) and BBC1 (second half).  The concert is traditionally in a lighter, 'winding-down' vein, with popular classics being followed by a series of British patriotic pieces in the second half of the concert. This sequence traditionally includes Edward Elgar's "Pomp & Circumstance March No. 1" (to part of which "Land of Hope and Glory" is sung), and Henry Wood's "Fantasia on British Sea Songs", which culminates in Thomas Arne's "Rule, Britannia!". However, the "Fantasia" did not feature from 2008 to 2011,[tpl]fact|date=September 2012[/tpl] though "Rule, Britannia!" has retained its place in the programme in its own right. The full "Fantasia" re-appeared in 2012, but was again absent from the 2013 concert. The concert concludes with Hubert Parry's "Jerusalem" (a setting of a poem by William Blake), and the British national anthem. The repeat of the Elgar March at the Last Night can be traced to the spontaneous audience demand for a double encore at its premiere at a 1901 Proms concert.[tpl]cite news | author=Colin Matthews | title=The evolution of the Proms | url=http://tls.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,25342-2648022,00.html | work=The Times Literary Supplement | date=| accessdate=20 July 2008 | location=London[/tpl] The closing sequence of the second half became fully established in 1954 during Sargent's tenure as chief conductor of the Proms.[tpl]cite journal | doi=10.1111/j.1468-2281.2008.00466.x | url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119408889/abstract | last=Cannadine | first=David | title=The 'Last Night of the Proms' in historical perspective | journal=Historical Research | volume=81 | issue=212 | pages=315–349 |date=May 2008 | accessdate=7 September 2009[/tpl] The Prommers have made a tradition of singing "Auld Lang Syne" after the end of the concert, but it is not included in the programme. However, when James Loughran, a Scot, conducted the Last Night concert in the late 1970s and early 1980s he included the piece as part of the programme.  Since 2009, "You'll Never Walk Alone", for audience participation has been included annually – a contribution made by the current Proms director, Roger Wright.
Tickets are highly sought after. Promming tickets are the same price as for other concerts during the season, but tickets for seats are more expensive. To book a seat in advance, it is necessary to have bought tickets for at least five other Proms concerts in the season to have a chance of getting a Last Night ticket, and an advance booking must include those five concerts, plus an application for a Last Night ticket. Tickets can only be purchased in an equivalent (or lower) price band to that sold for the previous tickets.  Once the advance booking period ends, there is no requirement to have booked for additional concerts, but the Last Night is generally sold out by this time, though returns may be available.  For standing places, a full season pass automatically includes admission to the Last Night; day Prommers need to present five ticket stubs from concerts previously attended at the box office to qualify to purchase a standing Last Night ticket, either in the Arena or the Gallery.  (Prior to 2009, the requirement was for six concerts in addition to the Last Night when purchasing a ticket in advance, though this has remained at five since then.) 
In recent years, a quantity of Arena standing tickets for the Last Night have been available for purchase on the day itself, with no requirement for having attended any previous concerts.  These are sold on a 'first-come first-served' basis to those who are prepared to queue on the day itself.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/proms/2009/howtobook/lastnight.shtml|title=How to Book / Last Night Booking|date=|publisher=BBC|accessdate=9 April 2009[/tpl] In the post-War period, with the growing popularity of the "Last Night", the only way to obtain tickets was through a postal ballot system where prospective buyers submitted an application well in advance, along with a stamped and addressed reply envelope. The lucky ones received their tickets by return. A ballot now exists annually for the chance for individuals to purchase a maximum of two tickets from a special allocation of 100 stalls seats for the Last Night. 
Prommers with tickets are likely to queue up much earlier than usual (many overnight, and in past years, some slept outside the hall for up to three weeks beforehand to guard their place in the queue – though this is no longer permitted) to ensure a good place to stand in the hall, the resulting camaraderie adds to the atmosphere. Fancy dress is an optional extra: from dinner jackets to patriotic T-shirts. Many use the occasion for an exuberant display of Britishness.  Union Flags are carried and waved by the Prommers, especially during "Rule, Britannia!".
Flags, balloons and party poppers are all welcomed – though John Drummond famously discouraged this 'extraneous noise' during his tenure as Director of the Proms. Sir Henry Wood's bust is adorned with a laurel chaplet by representatives of the Promenaders, who often wipe an imaginary bead of sweat from his forehead or make some similar gentle visual joke.  Since 2006, the cost of standing place tickets has remained at just £5.00. Many people consider these tickets to be the best ones due to the atmosphere of standing in the concert hall for up to 3 hours, albeit with a 20-minute interval.
Another tradition of the Last Night is that near the end of the concert the conductor makes a speech thanking the musicians and audiences, mentioning the main themes covered through the season, noting the cumulative donations collected by the Promenaders' Musical Charities over the season, and announcing the date of the First Night of the Proms for the following year.  The tradition of the Last Night Speech dates from 1941, when Sir Henry Wood gave the first such speech at the close of that Proms season, the first at the Royal Albert Hall, where he thanked colleagues and sponsors.  Wood gave another similar speech of thanks at the 1942 Last Night, and a pre-recorded version was aired to the audience at the 1943 Last Night.  During his tenure as conductor of the Proms, Sir Malcolm Sargent established the tone of making the Last Night speeches more humorous in nature.  Subsequent conductors at the Last Night have generally continued this tradition, although one exception was in 1997 when Sir Andrew Davis more seriously addressed the deaths of Diana, Princess of Wales, Mother Teresa, and Sir Georg Solti in his 1997 Last Night speech.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/last-saturday-saw-the-last-night-of-the-proms-and-the-first-night-of-the-royal-operas-exile-at-the-barbican-robert-cowan-and-edward-seckerson-were-at-the-respective-venues-1239341.html | title=Last Saturday saw the Last Night of the Proms and the first night of the Royal Opera's exile at the Barbican.

The Royal Albert Hall could be filled many times over with people wishing to attend the Last Night. To accommodate these people, and to cater for those who are not near London, the Proms in the Park concerts were started in 1996. Initially there was only one, in Hyde Park, adjacent to the Hall. More locations have been added in recent years, and in 2005, Belfast, Glasgow, Swansea and Manchester hosted a Last Night Prom in the Park which was broadcast live from each venue. 2007 saw Manchester's prom being replaced by one in Middlesbrough. 2008 featured a reduction from 5 to 4 Proms in the Park, in Hyde Park, Belfast, Glasgow and Swansea.  2009 returned to a total of 5 Proms in the Park, in Hyde Park, Glasgow, Swansea, County Down and Salford.  Each location has its own live concert, typically playing the countries' respective national anthems, before joining in a live big screen video link up with the Royal Albert Hall for the traditional finale.
Leonard Slatkin, chief conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra from 2000–2004, expressed a desire to tone down the nationalism of the Last Night somewhat, and on the Last Night of the seasons from 2002 until 2007 "Rule Britannia" has only been heard as part of Henry Wood's '"Fantasia on British Sea Songs" (another piece traditional to the Last Night) rather than separately. Slatkin, an American and the first non-Commonwealth citizen to lead the Last Night, conducted his first Last Night in 2001, just days after the 9/11 attacks.  The atmosphere was more restrained and less festive than normal, with a heavily revised programme where the finale of Beethoven's 9th Symphony replaced the "Sea Songs", and Samuel Barber's "Adagio for Strings" was performed in tribute to the victims of the attacks.[tpl]cite news | author=Andrew Clements | title=Prom 72/ Last Night of the Proms | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2001/sep/17/artsfeatures.proms2001 | work=The Guardian | date=| accessdate=9 November 2008 | location=London[/tpl]
On the day of the 2005 Last Night, the hall management received word of a bomb threat, which led to a thorough search of the Albert Hall for 5 hours, but the concert took place with a modest time delay.  This has led to increased security concerns, given the stature of the Last Night in British culture, which Jacqui Kelly of the Royal Albert Hall staff noted:
 "That was quite a nerve-wracker—our biggest event, the one everybody knows the Albert Hall for, and we were in real danger of losing it.  We're an iconic thing, up there in the public eye, so we have to expect that."[tpl]cite news | author=Michael Church | title=How to put on a Prom | url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/how-to-put-on-a-prom-413606.html | work=The Independent | date=28 August 2006 | accessdate=20 July 2008 | location=London[/tpl] 
2008 also contained some departures from the traditional programme. "Pomp and Circumstance March No 1" was moved to after the conductor's speech. In addition, most of Wood's "Fantasia on British Sea Songs" was replaced by Vaughan Williams's Sea Songs as a final tribute in his anniversary year.  However, Wood's arrangements of naval bugle calls from the start of the "Fantasia" were retained, and Sargent's arrangement of "Rule Britannia" returned with Bryn Terfel as soloist.  As on his 1994 Last Night appearance,Teldec 4509-97868-2 CD, "Last Night of the Proms (The 100th Season)", 1994. he sang one verse in a Welsh translation, with the chorus also translated into Welsh.
2009 saw the continued absence of Wood's Sea Songs, this time replaced by specially commissioned fanfares, and extracts from Handel's "Music for the Royal Fireworks".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/proms/2009/whatson/1209.shtml|title=Prom 76: Last Night of the Proms|publisher=BBC|accessdate=14 August 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/proms/2009/abouttheproms/questions.shtml|title=About the Proms / Questions to Roger Wright—Last Night of the Proms & Sea Shanties|author=Roger Wright|publisher=BBC[/tpl] In 2009, for the first time, the Last Night was shown live in several cinemas across Asia and in Canada and Australia.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/aug/13/last-night-proms-satellite-cinemas|title=Last Night of the Proms to go live at cinemas worldwide|date=|agency=Press Association|accessdate=14 August 2009 | location=London | work=The Guardian[/tpl]
