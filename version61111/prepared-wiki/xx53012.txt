==History==

===Legislative action===

As early as the mid-1980s, a group of gay rights activists, headed by Henk Krol – the editor-in-chief of the Gay Krant – asked the government to allow same sex couples to marry. Parliament decided in 1995 to create a special commission, which was to investigate the possibility of same-sex marriages. At that moment, the Christian Democrats (Christian Democratic Appeal) were not part of the ruling coalition for the first time since the introduction of full democracy. The special commission finished its work in 1997 and concluded that civil marriage should be extended to include same-sex couples. After the election of 1998, the government promised to tackle the issue. In September 2000 the final legislation draft was debated in the Dutch Parliament.
The marriage bill passed the House of Representatives by 109 votes to 33.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/13/world/dutch-legislators-approve-full-marriage-rights-for-gays.html?scp=2&sq=Norway+Gay+Marriages&st=nyt |title=Dutch Legislators Approve Full Marriage Rights for Gays |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2000-09-13 |accessdate=2011-12-26[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/921505.stm |title=Netherlands legalises gay marriage |publisher=BBC News |date=2000-09-12 |accessdate=2011-12-26[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/922024.stm |title=Dutch legalise gay marriage |publisher=BBC News |date=2000-09-12 |accessdate=2011-12-26[/tpl] The Senate approved the bill on 19 December 2000 by 49 to 26 votes.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/20/world/same-sex-dutch-couples-gain-marriage-and-adoption-rights.html |title=Same-Sex Dutch Couples Gain Marriage and Adoption Rights |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2000-12-20 |accessdate=2011-12-26[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1078821.stm |title=Dutch gays allowed to marry |publisher=BBC News |date=2000-12-19 |accessdate=2011-12-26[/tpl] Only the Christian parties, which held 26 of the 75 seats at the time, voted against the bill. Although the Christian Democratic Appeal would form the next government, they did not indicate any intention to repeal the law.
The main article in the Act changed article 1:30 in the marriage law to read as follows:
The law came into effect on 1 April 2001, and on that day four same-sex couples were married by the Mayor of Amsterdam, Job Cohen,[tpl]cite news|title=World's first legal gay weddings|publisher=TVNZ|date=2001-04-01|accessdate=2009-10-08|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/news_world_story_skin/34978[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1253754.stm |title=Dutch gay couples exchange vows |publisher=BBC News |date=2001-04-01 |accessdate=2011-12-26[/tpl] who became a registrar specifically to officiate at the weddings. A few months earlier, Mayor Cohen had been junior Minister of Justice of the Netherlands and was responsible for putting the new marriage and adoption laws through parliament.

===Requirements and rights===

Dutch law requires either partner must have Dutch nationality or to reside in the Netherlands. The marriageable age in the Netherlands is 18, or below 18 with parental consent. The law is only valid in the European territory of the Netherlands and on the Caribbean Islands of Bonaire, St. Eustatius and Saba, but does not apply to the other constituent countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.
The single legal difference between same-sex marriages and heterosexual marriages is parentage by both partners is not automatic. The legal mother of a child is its biological mother (article 1:198 of the civil law) and the father is (in principle) the man she is married to when the child is born. Moreover, the father must be a man (article 1:199). The other partner may thus become a legal mother only through adoption. Only in the case when a biological father does not become a parent (e.g. in case of  artificial insemination by lesbian couples), both female spouses obtain parental authority automatically (article 1:253sa).

===Religious denominations===

The Dutch Remonstrants were the world's first Christian denomination to perform same-sex unions and marriages in 1986.Trouw: Remonstrants and Boomsma receive homo emancipation prize Also the Protestant Church in the Netherlands, the largest Protestant denomination in the Netherlands, allows their congregations to perform same-sex marriages since 2004.Jan Andries de Boer: Same-sex marriage and the church
