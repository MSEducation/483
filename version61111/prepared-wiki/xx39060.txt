Holyfield started slowly as usual in the early going. Botha held and hit Holyfield, and took the control of the fight for the first three rounds. However, the South African could not slow down Holyfield, though he did hurt him, and the American boxer slowly began to punch him more to take control of the bout in the later rounds. In the seventh round Holyfield stunned Botha and knocked him down in the eighth round. Though he beat the count, Holyfield cornered him and landed many punches that forced the referee Russell Mora to stop the bout. At the time of the stoppage, Holyfield was behind on two judges' cards, 67–66, while the third judge had it 69–64 for the American boxer. Only 3,127 attended the fight.[tpl]cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2010/mma/boxing/04/11/holyfield.botha.ap/index.html | work=CNN | title=Holyfield, 47, KOs Botha in 8th to capture WBF heavyweight title | date=April 11, 2010 | accessdate=May 2, 2010[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl]
