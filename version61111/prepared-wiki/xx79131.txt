===Poetry===

An example of one of Waddington's poems entitled "Flying With Milton," is as follows, with an excerpt from Keats.
....he flew

With daring Milton through the fields of air

Keats
Flying with Milton through

his fields of air on a dark

November day in Toronto I

dreamed of terraced hillsides

new forest plantings in Jamaica

irrigation schemes in Israel

and free mountains in Africa

I dreamed of storm windows

piled up on racks in suburban

garages    of fresh air and peace

and gardens for everyone    I

dreamed of violence suspended

from a sonnet string tied to

the apron of April and I hung

on the dangling world a single

bead in a string of beads   one

frail point to sink into the centre

where I could turn the spokes

of Milton's eternal wheel to

speaking radiation
