==Political career==

In 1978, at-large city council member Douglas E. Moore decided to run for council chairman rather than for reelection, and Kane took the opportunity to run for the seat he was vacating. She narrowly defeated H.R. Crawford in the Democratic primary and went on to win the general election. She was reelected in 1982 and 1986.
In 1990, Kane ran for delegate to Congress but lost in the primary to Eleanor Holmes Norton.
