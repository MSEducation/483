However, the legend of Galois pouring his mathematical thoughts onto paper the night before he died seems to have been exaggerated.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]  In these final papers, he outlined the rough edges of some work he had been doing in analysis and annotated a copy of the manuscript submitted to the Academy and other papers.

Only Galois's younger brother was notified of the events prior to Galois's death.[tpl]cite book|last=Coutinho|first=S.C.|title=The Mathematics of Ciphers|year=1999|publisher=A K Peters, Ltd.|location=Natick|isbn=1-56881-082-2|pages=127–128[/tpl]  He was 20 years old. His last words to his younger brother Alfred were:
