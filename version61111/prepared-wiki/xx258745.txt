==Future developments==

The institute has decided to cultivate and grow medicinal herbs, trees and potted plants in its campus. Presently, 70 medicinal plants are being grown and maintained in the campus and planting 270 more such plants in this scheme is under way. There is also a proposal to develop the hillock behind the campus into a grove of medicinal plants. Other proposed facilities include an anatomy laboratory, animal house, green house, drug-testing laboratory, herbal garden and pharmacy.
Initially, the institute had planned to construct additional building to accommodate 100 beds from a grant of [tpl]INR[/tpl] 180 million funded by the Union ministry of health and family welfare. However, the institute later decided to construct a new building for additional in-patients away from the existing building, since the NMA rejected the proposal citing that it was against the provisions of the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Amendment Act, 2010.
