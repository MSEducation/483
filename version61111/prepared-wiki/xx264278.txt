The Mangyongdae Funfair is an amusement park located in Mangyongdae-guyok, 12 kilometers from Pyongyang, North Korea. It has an area of 70 hectares including a funfair and wading pool. In fall, 2011 the funfair was reported to have little or no Korean patronage. It had a roller coaster, which, while operational, was in poor repair. There is a merry-go-round and a train ride.[tpl]cite news|title=Boring rides, rusting tracks and foul toilets: Welcome to the North Korean funfair where FUN definitely isn't an option (but at least the queues aren't bad)|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2055019/Mangyongdae-Would-ride-North-Korean-fun-fair.html|accessdate=May 9, 2012|newspaper=Daily Mail|date=October 29, 2011|author=Simon Tomlinson[/tpl] 
The dismal atmosphere and run-down condition of the funfair were severely criticized by Kim Jong-un, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, First Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea and First Chairman of the National Defence Commission of North Korea during an inspection in May, 2012. Kim Jong-un ordered Choe Ryong-hae, Director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People’s Army, and others, to spruce up the funfair and bring it into compliance with the requirements of the Sŏn'gun era.Sŏn'gun, the military first policy may be relevant in this context, as may assignment of a senior military officer to the task of sprucing the funfair up because the park is used, or, at least, has been used for recreation by members of the Korean People's Army and their families. Mangyongdae – The Last Funfair in North Korea, accessed May 9, 2012 Kim Jong-un used the occasion to emphasize the requirement that officials have the spirit of serving the people and abandon outdated ideological points of view and outmoded work-styles.[tpl]cite news|title=Kim Jong Un Scolds Mangyongdae Funfair Staff|url=http://www.nknews.org/2012/05/kim-jong-un-tours-mangyongdae-funfair/|accessdate=May 9, 2012|newspaper=NK News|date=May 9, 2012|agency=Korean Central News Agency (KCNA)[/tpl]
