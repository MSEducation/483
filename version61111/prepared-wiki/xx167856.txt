Arabic Industrial Development and Mining Organization (AIDMO)([tpl]lang-ar|المنظمة العربية للتنمية الصناعية والتعدين[/tpl])

==History==

In a summit in Kuwait in 1966 the Arab League Council decided to establish an organization to improve and develop the industry in general. The decision was approved by the Arab Economic Council in 1968. The headquarters was established in Cairo. In 1975, the Arab Ministries of Industries freed the organization from Arab League influence and it became an independent organization. The organization's headquarters was moved from Cairo to Tunis temporarily from 1979 to 1980.

==Members==

There are 21 members in the AIDMO, all are members in the Arab League.
