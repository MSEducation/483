USU's Undergraduate Research program recently celebrated its 35th anniversary, making it one of the oldest such organizations in the nation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://research.usu.edu/htm/news/articleID=8747|title=Utah State University Undergraduate Research Program Celebrates 35 Years of Hands-On Learning|publisher=Utah State University|date=February 26, 2010|accessdate=22 March 2010[/tpl]
Along with the University of Utah, USU is an anchor in the Utah Science Technology and Research (USTAR) program, which is aimed at optimizing the university and region's most marketable strengths with the goal of bolstering Utah's high-tech economy. Nine USTAR teams currently perform research at Utah State. USTAR and USU's Advanced Transportation Institute developed charging technology for electric buses. Now, buses can be powered through wireless induction technology. The bus stops over magnetic pads that will charge the bus while passengers load and unload. A prototype of the technology began service on the University of Utah campus in 2012.[ref]

Notable research centers based at USU include the Space Dynamics Laboratory, Energy Dynamics Laboratory, Utah Water Research Laboratory, Center for High Performance Computing, Utah Climate Center, Center for Advanced Nutrition, Center for the School of the Future, National Aquatic Monitoring Center, Intermountain Center for River Rehabilitation and Restoration, Mountain West Center for Regional Studies, and Utah Botanical Center, among others. In 2010, the university received ownership of the more than $30 million Swaner Preserve and EcoCenter outside of Park City. The center consists of a [tpl]convert|1200|acre|km2|adj=on[/tpl] land trust and a [tpl]convert|10000|sqft|m2|adj=on[/tpl], state-of-the-art facility dedicated to environmental education. The preserve protects critical wetland and foothill terrain in the heart of one of the state’s fastest-growing areas, and the EcoCenter, completed in 2009, is a multi-use facility with space for educational and community activities. The facility is LEED Platinum Certified, the highest standard for design, construction and operation of high-performance green buildings.[ref]

Through the Department of Physics (College of Science), Utah State University has placed more student experiments into space than any educational institution in the world.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.usu.edu/ust/index.cfm?article=41990|title=Back in Flight: Aggie GAS Team to Ride NASA's 'Vomit Comet'|publisher=Utah State Today|date=January 14, 2010|accessdate=November 27, 2010[/tpl] A team of USU and University of Idaho researchers were the first in the world to successfully clone an equine.  The baby mule, named Idaho Gem, was born May 4, 2003. USU researchers made headlines in 2011 after breeding transgenic goats. Utah State University professor Randy Lewis' "spider goats", the milk of which contains spider silk, are being studied for uses including human muscle tissue and light-weight bulletproof vests.[ref]

Research efforts are underway to produce a cost-competitive bio-diesel from algae. Lance Seefeldt and other professors formed the Biofuels Program at Energy Dynamics Laboratory to develop new and emerging technologies that will produce methane, biodiesel, hydrogen and alcohols from renewable, carbon-dioxide-neutral energy sources, such as consumer and agricultural waste and sunlight.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news89400502.html|title=Pond Scum: Fueling Our Future?|publisher=Physorg.com|date=January 30, 2007|accessdate=January 19, 2010[/tpl] Dallas Hanks, a doctoral student, has initiated a program at the university called FreeWays to Fuel, which is growing oilseed crops for biodiesel in previously unused municipal land such as highway roadsides. Hanks estimates that in the U.S., [tpl]convert|10|e6acre|km2[/tpl] of such unused land exists—land which generally serves no other purpose and currently costs tax dollars to maintain. Early yields from the crops are promising, and the program has spread to other land-grant universities across the nation. He has a goal to produce [tpl]convert|50|e6USgal|m3[/tpl] of biofuel in five years.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/energy/2010-05-10-highwayharvest10_ST_N.htm?loc=interstitialskip |title=Student's idea turns roadsides into biodiesel cash cropland |work=USA Today |date=May 10, 2010 |accessdate=June 2, 2010 | first=Brian | last=Passey[/tpl]
Utah State University promotes the OpenCourseWare (OCW) Project (open and free university courses) and is developing an open content management system for OCW called eduCommons. This open source content management system is one of the important technology projects in the MIT OpenCourseWare Initiative. eduCommons aids in the creation of OCW sites and has already been adopted by several universities for this purpose.

==Athletics==

[tpl]Main|Utah State Aggies[/tpl]USU's sports teams are known as the Aggies and are a part of the NCAA Division I Mountain West Conference (MWC), which they joined in the summer of 2013. The university sponsors football, men's and women's basketball, volleyball, softball, women's soccer, track and field, golf, tennis, cross country, and gymnastics. An array of club sports exist as well, including lacrosse, hockey, and baseball, which are particularly popular with students.
The crown jewel of Aggie athletics has long been the men's basketball team, which plays in the Dee Glen Smith Spectrum, which has been called one of the nation's top 5 loudest and most difficult places for opposing teams to play. ESPN has also named USU's student section among the smartest in the nation.[ref]
</ref> During the 2008–09 season, USU's ranking in the ESPN/USA Today Coaches' Poll rose as high as #17.<ref name="ESPN">
