Paola Suárez (born 23 June 1976 in Pergamino, Buenos Aires Province, Argentina) is a retired tennis player. She gained prominence in 2004 by reaching the finals of nine straight WTA doubles tournaments, and by reaching the singles semifinals of the French Open tournament, held in Paris.

==Career==

"La Negra" Suárez began playing professional tennis at the age of fifteen, in 1991. In 1994, she joined the professional tour as a singles player. It was not until the 2000s (decade), however, that she became an international figure in her sport, by reaching the semis of the aforementioned French Open, a prestigious grand slam tournament.
Suárez won four WTA titles (2004 Canberra, 2003 Vienna, 1998 & 2001 Bogotá) and 12 other minor tournaments. In 2004, Paola hoped to obtain the French Open title that would become her first grand slam championship, but lost in the semi-finals against Elena Dementieva after defeating 18th seed and future Wimbledon champion Maria Sharapova in the quarter-finals. That year, she was ranked number nine in the world among women tennis players by the WTA, which has been her highest ranking as a singles player thus far. By accomplishing that feat, Paola became the highest-ranked Argentine women's player since  Sabatini achieved the number three ranking in 1989. Also in 2004, she won the bronze medal at the Summer Olympics in Athens for women's doubles with Patricia Tarabini.
But it was in doubles where she had the best results, playing with Virginia Ruano Pascual of Spain in 32 of her 39 titles. They won several tournaments, including the French Open on four occasions, the US Open three times, the Australian Open in 2004, and many others. With Virginia, they were the No. 1 female couple for 3 consecutive years since 9 September 2002 (WTA Tour Doubles Team of the Year 2002, 2003 and 2004). They also reached nine straight Grand Slam finals, two short of Navratilova–Shriver's 11 straight Slam finals.
In 2005 she announced her retirement for 2006 for personal reasons, and that until then she will only play a few tournaments.  In June 2005 she went on labrum hip clinical intervention, with a recovering time of 3 to 4 months. She restarted playing in Sydney in January 2006 with Ruano Pascual, reaching the final, but suffered calf muscle injury short after. Later that same year, she also reached the final of Wimbledon with Ruano Pascual, marking her third appearance in a Wimbledon final.
Paola returned to the circuit with a victory over Dinara Safina, ranked 15, in the San Diego's singles tournament.
On 1 September 2007, Paola played her last professional tennis match. At the US Open, she retired from tennis after losing a mixed doubles second round match. She partnered Kevin Ullyett and lost to Jamie Murray and Liezel Huber, 7–5, 6–4.
In her career, Suárez has earned $4,837,968 US$, with four single WTA titles, and 8 doubles grand slams.
Suárez returned to the WTA doubles circuit in 2012 partnering with fellow Argentinian Gisela Dulko. The pair is aiming to play at the London Summer Olympics Games.Suárez Back On Court, Plays First Match Back  They achieved this aim.http://www.london2012.com/tennis/event/women-doubles/phase=tew002500/index.htmlhttp://www.london2012.com/athlete/suarez-paola-1087942/ During the year 2013  Suárez did not play any international tournaments at all.
