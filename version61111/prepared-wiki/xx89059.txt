==History==

Ancient Panjekent was a small but flourishing town of the Soghdians in pre-Islamic Central Asia.  It was known as Panchekanth.[tpl]cite web|author=Gorgâni, Tirdâd|title=Welcome to Penjakent|url=http://www.geocities.com/panjikent/|publisher=GEOCITIES|accessdate=July 23, 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090728164550/http://geocities.com/panjikent/|archivedate=2009-07-28[/tpl] It means five towns (villages).
The ethnic and territorial  name "Soghd/Soghdian" or Sughd/Sughdian was mentioned in history as early as the Iranian Achaemenid Dynasty (6th century BCE). The Achaemenids founded several city-states, as well as cities along the ancient Silk road and in the Zarafshan valley.  
The town grew in the 5th century CE and many professionals such as established businessmen and landowners made their livelihoods in  Panjakent. In 722 CE, Arabian forces besieged and annexed the town. The last ruler of the town Divashtich fled into upper Zarafshan but he was captured and sentenced to death. For around 50 years, ancient Panjakent was ruled by new administrators but towards the end of the 8th century the town on the upper terraces was depopulated and relocated. Many ancient ruins of the old city, particularly the city architecture and works of art remain today. 
According to Arab geographers, Panjakent in the 10th century had a formal Friday mosque that distinguished the place as a town from a village. It was the easternmost city of Soghd, and became well known for its walnuts.
