==History==

===The beginning (1870-1900)===

Sometime in early November 1870 - while November 12th is most cited, others claim November 5 or 11th - Columbia's intercollegiate football journey began with a short trip to New Brunswick, NJ to play Rutgers.  Perhaps befitting the team that would one day own the NCAA Division 1 record for futility, they lost 3-6 in the first college football game between schools from different states.
