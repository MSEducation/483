Zakazane piosenki (Forbidden Songs) is a 1946 Polish musical film directed by Leonard Buczkowski. It was the first feature film to be created in Poland following the six years of World War II.

The film's premiere took place on January 8, 1947 in the newly reopened Palladium cinema in Warsaw. The film proved to be highly popular and more than 10.8 million people watched it in the following three years - twice the usual average attendance in post-war Poland.[tpl]en icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite book | author =Marek Haltof | coauthors = | title =Polish national cinema | year =2002 | editor = | pages =49–50 | chapter = | chapterurl = | publisher =Berghahn Books | location = | isbn=978-1-57181-276-6 | url = | format = | accessdate = [/tpl]
In 1948 the film was re-edited and re-released in a new version, with more focus on Red Army's role as the liberator of Poland and the main ally of post-war Polish communist regime, as well as more grim outlook of the German occupation of Warsaw and German brutality in general. Main differences:
However, as the farcical plot and all-familiar songs were mostly free of ideological subtexts, the film remained popular in the decades to come and some of its songs re-emerged in slightly modified form during the 1980s martial law and struggle against the Communist rule.[tpl]en icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite book | author =Sylwia D.
