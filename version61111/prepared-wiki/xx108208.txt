Sir James Balfour of Denmylne, 1st Baronet, (c. 1600 – c. 1658) of Perth and Kinross, Scotland, Scottish annalist and antiquary.[tpl]sfn|Chisholm|1911[/tpl]

==Life==

He was well acquainted with Sir William Segar and with William Dugdale, to whose Monasticon he contributed. He was knighted by King Charles I in 1630, was made Lord Lyon King of Arms in the same year, and in 1633 baronet of Kinnaird. He was removed from his office of king-at-arms by Oliver Cromwell and died in 1657. [tpl]sfn|Chisholm|1911[/tpl]
Some of his numerous works are preserved in the Advocates' Library at Edinburgh, together with his correspondence, from which rich collection James Haig published Balfour's Annales of Scotland in 4 volumes (1824 – 1825). James Maidment also extracted papers from the collection in order to publish them.[tpl]sfn|Chisholm|1911[/tpl]
