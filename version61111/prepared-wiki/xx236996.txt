A native of County Kildare,[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2009[/tpl] MayKay was born in 1986. She is the daughter of journalist Kathy Sheridan. Sheridan is a regular Fight Like Apes concert-goer and bought a record player specially to listen to the band's debut album on vinyl.
She was a choir singer for some time. The singer met bandmate Jamie (known as "Pockets") when the pair were vacationing in Spain during their teenage years. She spoke of their meeting in a 2007 interview with Eamon Sweeney of the Irish Independent: "One night, I told Jamie I loved singing, so he made me sign a contract on a piece of tissue in a bar saying that I would never do anything musically without him". She studied medicinal chemistry then philosophy in Trinity College, Dublin. However, she dropped out of college when Fight Like Apes began to first find success.
On stage MayKay dresses in either black or white and is known for her "long black hair and banshee wail". She often plays the keyboard with her head during live performances. She has also played the drill.[tpl]cite web| last=Murphy| first=Lauren| title=Interview with Fight Like Apes| date=10 September 2008| work=entertainment.ie| url=http://entertainment.ie/Music/feature/Interview-with-Fight-Like-Apes/1/49.htm| accessdate=18 October 2009[/tpl] She and most of the band members, with the exception of the drummer, are known for their consumption of alcohol. She likes bands such as Adebisi Shank, Giveamanakick, Grand Pocket Orchestra and Jape.
