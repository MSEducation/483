Mission is a song by the progressive rock band Rush from the 1987 album Hold Your Fire.

==Writing and structure==

"Mission" was inspired from a conversation Neil Peart and Geddy Lee had about people who were not satisfied with the lives of people in their age group. Peart said that the lyrics are related to a tendency that people have for idealizing the lifestyle of others. People tend to imagine that those who are rich and famous are to be viewed as people who have fewer personal issues than ordinary people. However, he argues that every life has its own level of "toughness." As an example of this idea, he recounts that people used to refer to him as someone who has the best job in the world. He claims that he is very proud of being a musician, which was a job that he dreamed of in his youth. However, he claims people tend not to realize that being away from family for several months while on tour is not as easy as others make it sound.  A key verse to express that concept says "We each pay a fabulous price for our visions of paradise," referring to personal sacrifices he had to make to achieve his dream.[tpl]cite book | title=Traveling Music: The Soundtrack to My Life and Times | publisher=ECW Press | author=Peart, Neil | year=2004 | pages=198â€“199[/tpl]
