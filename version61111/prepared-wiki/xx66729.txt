[[BPM (time service)]]

BPM is the call sign of the official short-wave time signal service of the People's Republic of China, operated by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, broadcasting from CAS's National Time Service Center[tpl]Citation |url=http://english.ntsc.cas.cn |title=National Time Service Center[/tpl] in Pucheng County, Shaanxi at [tpl]Coord| 34|56|55.96|N|109|32|34.93|E|type:landmark_region:CN-61|display=it[/tpl], roughly 70 km northeast of Lintong,[tpl]cite web|url=http://english.ntsc.cas.cn/rs/fs/200909/t20090917_39104.html[/tpl] along with NTSC's long-wave time signal BPL on 100 kHz.
BPM is broadcast at 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, and 15.0 MHz, the same frequencies as WWV and WWVH, following the schedule listed below:

==Transmission format==

BPM transmits different signals on a half-hour schedule,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.time.ac.cn/jianjie/3.htm[/tpl] modulated with 1 kHz audio tones to provide second and minute ticks:
BPM is idiosyncratic in that it transmits UT1 time between minutes 25 through to 29 and 55 through to 59, which creates an odd click-beep effect when heard below a stronger time signal station such as WWV.[tpl]cite web|url=http://tufi.alphalink.com.au/time/time_hf.html[/tpl]
