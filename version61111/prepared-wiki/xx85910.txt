[tpl]Nihongo|Ama|海人||women [tpl]nihongo2|海女[/tpl]; men [tpl]nihongo2|海士[/tpl];[/tpl], uminchu (in Okinawan) or  kaito (in Izu Peninsula) are Japanese divers, famous for collecting pearls.  The majority of ama are women.

==History==

Japanese tradition holds that the practice of ama may be 2,000 years old.[tpl]cite book |last=Rahn |first=H. |author2=Yokoyama, T. |title=Physiology of Breath-Hold Diving and the Ama of Japan. |year=1965 |publisher=National Academy of Sciences - National Research Council |location=United States |isbn=0-309-01341-0 |page=369 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/3279 |accessdate=2008-04-25 [/tpl] Traditionally, and even as recently as the 1960s, ama dove wearing only a loincloth. Even in modern times, ama dive without scuba gear or air tanks, making them a traditional sort of free-diver.

==Activities==

Depending on the region, ama may dive with masks, fins, and torso-covering wetsuits at the most. Only divers who work for tourist attractions use white, partially transparent suits.
Ama are famous for pearl diving, but originally they dove for food like seaweed, shellfish, lobsters, octopus, and sea urchins — and oysters which sometimes have pearls.
Ama can keep diving well into old age. The older divers are generally able to stay submerged longer than the younger.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2010[/tpl] Usually they also have another job, typically working on a farm. The Japanese believe that the majority of ama are women because of how their bodies differ from men: The fat on a female body is distributed differently than on men, which ensures that they can stay warmer in colder water.
