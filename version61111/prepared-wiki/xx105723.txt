==History==

Capita was formed in 1984 as a division of the non-profit CIPFA (Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy). In 1987 it became an independent company with 33 staff as a result of a management buy-out, led by Rod Aldridge, and was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1991.
In March 2006, Executive Chairman Rod Aldridge resigned in the aftermath of claims that contracts awarded to the Group were influenced by his loan of £1 million to the Labour Party. Aldridge resigned saying that he denied the claims, but to avoid any lingering doubts about it, he was leaving the company. Aldridge had overseen the company's growth from a small company in 1987 to a FTSE 100 member in 2006.[tpl]Cite news | title = Capita boss quits over Blair loan | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4836024.stm |accessdate=12 February 2007 |publisher=BBC News | date=23 March 2006[/tpl]

Capita manages the Criminal Records Bureau for the Home Office. In 2002, when mandatory CRB-vetting of all workers with children was brought in, a large number of teachers were temporarily unable to work after Capita's systems had difficulty with the workload and were subsequently overwhelmed, meaning that the start of the academic year was delayed in some places. Poor systems specifications and last-minute changes in government policy by the then Secretary of State for Education, Estelle Morris are believed to have been significant factors in these delays.[ref]

Capita also intended to enter into the legal services market and entered into a funding arrangement with the Law Firm Optima Legal Services Limited which saw them, in the period between May 2006 to the end of 2009 invest a total of £36,700,000 by way of investment loans into Optima.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.capitareport2009.co.uk/accounts/consolidated_accounts/note_17.aspx |title=Capita: Annual Report 2009 |publisher=Capitareport2009.co.uk |date= |accessdate=18 April 2011[/tpl]  As part of the funding arrangement Capita Group had the option of acquiring the shares of Optima Legal Services for the nominal sum of £1 upon the full implementation of the Legal Services Act 2007 which would make ownership of law firms by the likes of Capita possible. It is thought that such Alternative Business Structures ("ABS") could be lawful around October 2011.[tpl]cite web|last=Dowell |first=Katy |url=http://www.thelawyer.com/neuberger-mr-calls-for-regulatory-reform-as-abs-timeline-is-unveiled/1003565.article |title=Neuberger MR calls for regulatory reform as ABS timeline is unveiled |publisher=Thelawyer.com |date= |accessdate=18 April 2011[/tpl]  However, on 9 August 2010 it was reported that the Solicitors Regulatory Authority ("SRA") had found that the arrangement breached its rules in that it effectively amounted to an ABS.[tpl]cite web|last=Dowell |first=Katy |url=http://www.thelawyer.com/optima-reprimanded-by-the-sra-over-capita-investment/1005255.article |title=Optima reprimanded by the SRA over Capita investment |publisher=Thelawyer.com |date=9 August 2010 |accessdate=18 April 2011[/tpl] As a consequence, Optima Legal Services Lead Litigation and Property Partners, Philip Robinson and Anthony Ruane respectively were both severely reprimanded by the SRA for what was found to be professional misconduct and only narrowly avoided referral to the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sra.org.uk/consumers/solicitor-check/155841.article |title=Solicitors Regulatory Authority |publisher=Sra.org.uk |date= |accessdate=18 April 2011[/tpl] and  Adrian Lamb, former CEO of Optima Legal Services Limited, left the business in June 2010.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.todaysconveyancer.co.uk/news.php?viewStory=87 |title=SEO Adrian Lamb leaves Optima – 8th June 2010 |publisher=Todaysconveyancer.co.uk |date= |accessdate=18 April 2011[/tpl]

==Criticism==

Capita Group has not always been received well by the public and in the media. It has gained the nickname Crapita, particularly from the coverage in the satirical/investigative magazine Private Eye, which routinely documents the company's many failures and setbacks in the public sector.Simon Bowers Capita deals with £3.3bn of government spending as more work is outsourced, The Guardian, 19 November 2010. Retrieved 2011-11-17.How dare you call me a fat cat, I only earn £14,500 a WEEK, Daily Mail Online, 15 December 2010. Retrieved 2011-11-17.
Pindar himself has attracted criticism for complaining about being called a 'fat cat', despite receiving a £770,000 per annum salary and driving around in an Aston Martin DB9. "It really takes the biscuit - especially when you consider his workers are fighting for a rise equivalent to just four pints of milk a week", said a workers' representative. The average Capita employee salary at the time was £28,000 per year.
It was revealed in January 2013 that Capita was embroiled in a scandal over misinforming people that they had to leave the U.K. as they had no valid visa.  One such person was in fact the holder of a U.K. passport.BBC News - Migrants wrongly told to leave UK by firm hired by UKBA, BBC News, 3 January 2013. Retrieved 2013-01-03.
In 2014, a leak to The Guardian revealed that the DWP had to send civil servants in to help the company process personal independence payments for the seriously ill and the disabled. "Waiting times for assessment," the newspaper noted, "have been so long that in some cases people with terminal conditions have died before receiving a penny."[tpl]Cite news |title = Civil servants deployed to help Capita clear PIP assessments backlog |url = http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/apr/06/civil-servants-capita-pip-assessments-backlog |date = 6 April 2014 |newspaper = The Guardian |accessdate = 7 April 2014 [/tpl]
