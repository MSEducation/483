The Nobel Prize in Chemistry ([tpl]lang-sv|Nobelpriset i kemi|links=no[/tpl]) is awarded annually by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences to scientists in the various fields of chemistry. It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel, who died in 1896.  These prizes are awarded for outstanding contributions in chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine.[tpl]cite web | title = Alfred Nobel – The Man Behind the Nobel Prize | publisher = Nobelprize.org | url = http://nobelprize.org/alfred_nobel/|accessdate=2008-10-07[/tpl] As dictated by Nobel's will, the award is administered by the Nobel Foundation and awarded by a committee that consists of five members elected by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.[tpl]cite web | title = The Nobel Prize Awarders | publisher = Nobelprize.org | url = http://nobelprize.org/prize_awarders/|accessdate=2008-10-07[/tpl] The first Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded in 1901 to Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff, of the Netherlands. Each recipient receives a medal, a diploma and a monetary award prize that has varied throughout the years.[tpl]cite web | title = The Nobel Prize| publisher = Nobelprize.org | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/|accessdate=2008-10-07[/tpl] In 1901, van 't Hoff received 150,782 SEK, which is equal to 7,731,004 SEK in December 2007. In 2012, the prize was awarded to Robert Lefkowitz and Brian Kobilka. The award is presented in Stockholm at an annual ceremony on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death.[tpl]cite web | title = The Nobel Prize Award Ceremonies | publisher = Nobelprize.org | url = http://nobelprize.org/award_ceremonies/|accessdate=2008-10-07 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080822184717/http://nobelprize.org/award_ceremonies/  |archivedate = 2008-08-22[/tpl]
At least 25 laureates have received the Nobel Prize for contributions in the field of organic chemistry, more than any other field of chemistry.[tpl]cite web | title = The Nobel Prize in Chemistry: The Development of Modern Chemistry | publisher = Nobelprize.org | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/articles/malmstrom/index.html|author=Malmström, Bo G.; Bertil Andersson|date=2001-12-03|accessdate=2008-10-08[/tpl] Two winners of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Germans Richard Kuhn (1938) and Adolf Butenandt (1939), were not allowed by their government to accept the prize. They would later receive a medal and diploma, but not the money. Frederick Sanger is one out of two laureates to be awarded the Nobel prize twice in the same subject, in 1958 and 1980. John Bardeen is the other and was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics in 1956 and 1972. Two others have won Nobel Prizes twice, one in chemistry and one in another subject: Maria Skłodowska-Curie (physics in 1903, chemistry in 1911) and Linus Carl Pauling (chemistry in 1954, peace in 1962).[tpl]cite web | title = Nobel Laureates Facts | publisher = Nobelprize.org | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/nobelprize_facts.html|accessdate=2008-10-07[/tpl] Four women have won the prize: Maria Skłodowska-Curie, Irène Joliot-Curie (1935), Dorothy Hodgkin (1964), and Ada Yonath (2009).[tpl]cite web | title = Women Nobel Laureates | publisher = Nobelprize.org | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/lists/women.html|accessdate=2008-10-07[/tpl] As of 2012, the prize has been awarded to 162 individuals. There have been eight years in which the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was not awarded.
