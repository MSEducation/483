Norman Clyde (April 8, 1885 – December 23, 1972) was a mountaineer, mountain guide, freelance writer, nature photographer, and self trained naturalist. He is well known for achieving over 130 first ascents, many in California's Sierra Nevada and Montana's Glacier National Park. He also set a speed climbing record on California's Mount Shasta in 1923.[ref]

==Early life, marriage and work==

Clyde was born in Philadelphia, the son of a Presbyterian minister. He attended Geneva College graduating in the Classics in June 1909. After teaching at several rural schools, including Fargo, North Dakota and Mount Pleasant, Utah, he enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley in 1911. After two years of graduate work he returned to teaching, mostly in northern California, including the towns of McCloud and Weaverville. He taught history, science and Latin.  He continued graduate studies at the University of California in Berkeley in 1923 - 1924.
On June 15, 1915, Norman Clyde married Winifred May Bolster in Pasadena, California.  She was a nurse at a tuberculosis hospital, and contracted the disease herself at approximately the time of their marriage.  After 4 years of suffering she died at age 28 in 1919.  His wife's death appears to have profoundly affected him as he moved to the Eastern Sierra to spend much of his latter life alone in the mountains.
He became principal of the high school at Independence, California in 1924, but resigned in 1928. He admitted firing a pistol during a confrontation with some students who allegedly came to vandalize the school on Halloween night. One bullet hit the side of a car carrying eight high school students, but there were no injuries.  Clyde said that considerable damage had been done to the school grounds the previous Halloween.  He had been issued a license to carry a concealed firearm on February 2, 1928.  This was the end of his career as a schoolteacher and principal, as he resigned in exchange for an agreement by the District Attorney not to press charges.[tpl]cite news|title=Speeding Bullet Ends Boy Frolic on Hallowe'en|newspaper=Inyo Independent|volume=LIX|number=32|date=November 3, 1928[/tpl]
Subsequently he spent his winters as the caretaker of the local lodges, including Glacier Lodge on Big Pine Creek, and a fishing cabin which belonged to Lon Chaney, Sr.  He earned some sporadic income as a mountain guide and freelance writer.

==Life in the mountains==

Clyde began climbing in the Sierra Nevada in 1910, when he visited Yosemite and Sequoia National Parks, writing to his mother that "I climbed the highest mountains in the region".  He also visited McCloud, CA near Mount Shasta that summer.  He began a regimented program of mountaineering in the Sierra Nevada in 1914, including the first of his first ascents.  He also joined the Sierra Club in 1914. He first climbed Mount Shasta in 1916, and climbed that peak a total of 12 times.  While living in Southern California during his wife's illness, he climbed Mount San Jacinto in 1917.  Following his wife's death in 1919, he climbed extensively in the Kings-Kern Divide region of the southern Sierra.
In 1920, Clyde journeyed with a Sierra Club group from Yosemite Valley to the Evolution Basin, completing many climbs along the way.  He set a speed climbing record on Mount Shasta in 1923, ascending from Horse Camp at approximately 8000 feet to the summit at 14,162 feet in 3 hours and 17 minutes.  That year, he also spent 36 days in Glacier National Park, MT, where he climbed 36 mountains, including 11 first ascents.  The National Park Service issued a press release praising his accomplishments in Glacier National Park. He returned to climb in Glacier National Park in 1924 and 1937.
In 1925, he completed 53 climbs in the Sierra Nevada, and told Francis Farquhar that "I sometimes think I climbed enough peaks this summer to render me a candidate for a padded cell--at least some people look at the matter in that way.  However, I get a lot of enjoyment from this rather strenuous form of diversion."  In 1926, he climbed in Yellowstone National Park, Grand Teton National Park, the Beartooth Mountains and Absaroka Range of Montana, and the Sawtooth Range of Idaho.  He made several additional first ascents in California that year.
In 1928, he was a leader of the High Trip to the Canadian Rockies organized by the Sierra Club, the Mazamas of Oregon, and The Mountaineers of the State of Washington.  During this trip, he encountered professional mountain guides, and probably decided on this as his own career path.  He spent six weeks traversing the San Gabriels of Southern California, probably in 1929.  In 1930, he wrote an article describing his trip from the summit of Mount Whitney to the lowest point in Death Valley between sunrise and sunset.
Clyde's first published works appeared as a series of articles entitled "Close Ups of the High Sierra" in 1928, in the Automobile Club of Southern California's magazine, Touring Topics, and were later republished as a perfect-bound edition in 1962 by La Siesta Press (Glendale, CA), edited by Walt Wheelock.
1931 was a seminal year in the history of mountaineering in the Sierra Nevada, and Norman Clyde was in the midst of it.  Sierra Club leader Francis P. Farquhar invited Harvard philosophy professor and Appalachian Mountain Club member Robert L. M. Underhill to come to the Sierra Nevada to teach the latest techniques of roped climbing. Underhill had learned these techniques in the Alps, and had practiced them himself earlier that summer in the Tetons and the Canadian Rockies. After some young climbers were instructed in the techniques, a group including Clyde, Jules Eichorn, Lewis Clark, Bestor Robinson and Glen Dawson traveled south to the Palisades, the most rugged and alpine part of the Sierra Nevada. There, on August 13, 1931, the party completed the first ascent of the last unclimbed 14,000+ foot peak in California, which remained unnamed due to its remote location above the Palisade Glaciers. After a challenging ascent to the summit, the climbers were caught in an intense lightning storm, and Eichorn barely escaped electrocution when "a thunderbolt whizzed right by my ear". The mountain was named Thunderbolt Peak to commemorate that close call.
Three days later on August 16, Eichorn, Clyde, Underhill and Dawson completed the first ascent of the East Face of Mount Whitney, the highest peak in the contiguous United States.[tpl]Fifty Classic Climbs|pages=276–282[/tpl] The route was extremely exposed, especially the famous Fresh Air Traverse. Steve Roper called this route "one of the classic routes of the Sierra, partly because of its spectacular location and partly because it was the first really big wall to be climbed in the range."[tpl]cite book|last=Roper|first=Steve|title=The Climber's Guide to the High Sierra|location=San Francisco|publisher=Sierra Club Books|year=1976|isbn=0-87156-147-6[/tpl] Porcella & Burns wrote that "the climb heralded a new standard of technical competence in Californian rock climbing..."[tpl]cite book|last=Porcella|first=Stephen P.|coauthors=Burns, Cameron M.|title=Climbing California's Fourteeners: 183 Routes to the Fifteen Highest Peaks|publisher=The Mountaineers|location=Seattle|year=1998|isbn=0-89886-555-7[/tpl] These events led to a lifelong friendship between Clyde and Jules Eichorn.
In 1932, he climbed El Picacho del Diablo in Baja California, Mexico, and climbed it again in 1937.  He met David Brower in the Sierra Nevada in 1933, and in 1934 spent time with Brower and Hervey Voge as the younger men bagged 32 first ascents in ten weeks traveling through the High Sierra.  From June 23–26, the trio climbed 10 of the 12 major pinnacles of the Devils Crags.
He served as climbing leader on many Sierra Club sponsored High Trips where he became known as "the pack that walks like a man" because of the huge backpacks he carried. In addition to as many as five cameras, he carried a hammer and cobbler's anvil in order to make field repairs to client's boots.  In 1931, Underhill wrote that Clyde's backpack was an "especially picturesque enormity of skyscraper architecture".[tpl]cite book|last=Roper|first=Steve|coauthors=photographs by David Stark Wilson|others=photographs by David Stark Wilson|title=Above All: Mount Whitney + California's Highest Peaks|publisher=Yosemite Association and Heyday Books|location=Berkeley|year=2008|chapter=The Whitney Region|isbn=978-1-59714-107-9[/tpl] Clyde was also well known for wearing a campaign hat.
Clyde led or participated in many mountain rescues and is credited with saving a number of lives. He also helped in many recoveries of dead climbers, such as 18 year old Howard Lamel, killed in a fall on Mount Whitney in 1930.[ref]
