Head restraints are an automotive safety feature, attached or integrated into the top of each seat to limit the rearward movement of the adult occupant's head, relative to the torso, in a collision — to prevent or mitigate whiplash or injury to the cervical vertebrae.UNECE Regulation 17: Uniform Provisions Concerning the Approval of Vehicles With Regard to the Seats, Their Anchorages and Any Head RestraintsFMVSS No. 202, Head Restraints for Passenger Vehicles: Preliminary Economic Assessment and Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Since their mandatory introduction in the late 1960s, head restraints have prevented or mitigated thousands of serious injuries. 
A patent for an automobile "headrest" was granted to Benjamin Katz, a resident of Oakland, California, in 1921.US Patent 1471168: Headrest for Automobile Seats and the Like Additional patents for such devices were issued in 1930US Patent 1781600: Combined Automobile Headrest and Strap Hanger and in 1950,US Patent 2502801: Headrest for Automobile Seats and subsequently. The major U. K. supplier of head restraints, Karobes, filed patents in the late 1950s and was still competitive in 1973 when British tests evaluated the quality of these devices.New Scientist: Head rests take a bashing, July 5, 1973.
Optional head restraints began appearing on North American cars in the late 1960s,[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl] and were mandated by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in all new cars sold in the U.S. after 1 January 1969. The U.S. regulation, called Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 202, requires that head restraints meet one of the following two standards of performance, design, and construction:
An evaluation performed by NHTSA in 1982 on passenger cars found that "integral" head restraints—a seat back extending high enough to meet the [tpl]convert|27.5|in|mm|1|abbr=on[/tpl] height requirement—reduces injury by 17 percent, while adjustable head restraints, attached to the seat back by one or more sliding metal shafts, reduce injury by 10 percent. NHTSA has said this difference may be due to adjustable restraints being improperly positioned.
