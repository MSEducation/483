The British Youth Band Association, or BYBA, was formed in 1974 by Glen Carter. It aims to promote the marching band activity, to encourage the social aspects of bands and to enhance personal development through all aspects of bands. BYBA has also set up rules for contests, and divided all marching bands into classes. The 1992 season saw 117 units marching across the Novice, Contest, Championship and Premier Classes. By the 2003 season, the system had changed into 40 units marching across Divisions 1,2,3,4 and the Cadets league. The 2007 season saw Division 4 renamed as the Junior Division, and the introduction of the Associate division, allowing for units of any age. As of the 2008 season, BYBA runs eight summer contests annually, as well as the National Championships, an Individual & Ensembles Showcase, the 'On The Road' Tour, the Festival Of Fun & Music, and three regional concerts (Northern, Southern, and Midlands).
At the end of its 2008 season, culminating in the National Finals on October 5, the East Coast Elite marching band won their Division two league, with the Trinity School Showband coming a close second.  Due to their outstanding performance, they and a further four bands were moved up to Division one, where they now begin work on their respective 2009 programmes, alongside such bands as the 2008 Division one winners, Distant Thunder.
