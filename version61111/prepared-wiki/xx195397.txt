==Concept==

The concept of Hadsaa is based on real-life events and it shows how one incident (hadsaa) can change peoples lives forever. The show revolves around a team known as STF — Special Task Force — that helps solve problems and crimes.
The show moves on with episodic stories of crimes. Every episode has an emotional story with a hooker and how that 'hadsaa' changes that story is the main USP of the episode. In addition, the purpose of Haadsa is to bring to light what the common people probably don't know about the evil people — stories of stolen bread eaters of the family maimed for life, of children orphaned and parents left childless. 
The series was replaced by Waaris, produced by Smriti Irani, which is based on the movies Sarkar and Sarkar Raj.
