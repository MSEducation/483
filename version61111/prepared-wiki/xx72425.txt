[[Uniparental disomy]]

CATEGORIES: Cytogenetics

Uniparental disomy (UPD) occurs when a person receives two copies of a chromosome, or of part of a chromosome, from one parent and no copies from the other parent.[tpl]cite journal |author=Robinson WP |title=Mechanisms leading to uniparental disomy and their clinical consequences |journal=Bioessays |volume=22 |issue=5 |pages=452–9 |date=May 2000 |pmid=10797485 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1521-1878(200005)22:53.0.CO;2-K[/tpl] UPD can be the result of heterodisomy, in which a pair of non-identical chromosomes are inherited from one parent (an earlier stage meiosis I error) or isodisomy, in which a single chromosome from one parent is duplicated (a later stage meiosis II error).[tpl]Cite book|title=Human Molecular Genetics 3|publisher=Garland Science|isbn=0-8153-4183-0|pages=58[/tpl]  Because it may lead to the duplication of lethal recessive genes, isodisomy is potentially dangerous, while heterodisomy is essentially benign.

==Pathophysiology==

UPD can occur as a random event during the formation of egg or sperm cells or may happen in early fetal development. It can also occur during trisomic rescue. 

==Phenotype==

Most occurrences of UPD result in no phenotypical anomalies. However, if the UPD causing event happens during meiosis II, the genotype may include identical copies of the uniparental chromosome (isodisomy), leading to the manifestation of rare recessive disorders. UPD should be suspected in an individual manifesting a recessive disorder, where only one parent is a carrier.
Uniparental inheritance of imprinted genes can also result in phenotypical anomalies.  Though few imprinted genes have been identified, uniparental inheritance of an imprinted gene can result in the loss of gene function which can lead to delayed development, mental retardation, or other medical problems.

==All chromosomes (uniparental diploidy)==

Occasionally, all chromosomes will be inherited from one parent, due to either a sperm fertilizing an empty egg and duplicating itself, or a diploid egg that is not fertilized. The effect is similar to triploidy, with either a molar pregnancy with no embryo if only paternal genes are present, or an embryo with no placenta if only maternal genes are present.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]  Neither condition ever results in a liveborn infant.

==History==

The first clinical case of UPD was reported in 1988 and involved a girl with cystic fibrosis and unusually short stature who carried two copies of maternal chromosome 7.[tpl]Cite journal| journal=American Journal of Human Genetics |title=Uniparental disomy as a mechanism for human genetic disease |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=217–226 |year=1988 |doi= |pmid=2893543 |author=Spence JE, Perciaccante RG, Greig GM, Willard HF, Ledbetter DH, Hejtmancik JF, Pollack MS, O'Brien WE, Beaudet AL| pmc=1715272[/tpl] Since 1991, out of the 47 possible disomies, 29 have been identified among individuals ascertained for medical reasons. This includes chromosomes 2, 5–11, 13–16, 21 and 22.
