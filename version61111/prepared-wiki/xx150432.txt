In 1786 the German colony Freudenthal was founded, at a distance of 4 km away from the current site of the village of Jamu Mare. During the 50 years following 1809, the Romanian population was expelled from the commune, so as to make room for the German families coming from Fibiș, Iecea and Grabaț.
