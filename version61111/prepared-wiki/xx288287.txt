==Biography==

Yin Mingzhu was born Yin Shangxian in Wujiang, now part of Suzhou, Jiangsu Province of China, and moved to Shanghai at a young age. In 1926, she married director Dan Duyu (但杜宇). While Yin Mingzhu starred in about half of the some 30 movies directed by Dan Danyu, most are believed to be lost films. The couple later moved to Hong Kong, where Yin Mingzhu died in 1989.[tpl]cite web|title=Yin Mingzhu (Pearl Ing): "Miss FF"|url=http://www.chinesemirror.com/index/2008/08/yin-mingzhu-pea.html|work=A Journal of Chinese Film History|publisher=The Chinese Mirror|accessdate=13 August 2013[/tpl]

Note: in most early Chinese films, there often were no official English translations, leading to a sometimes confusing lack of consistency in titles.
