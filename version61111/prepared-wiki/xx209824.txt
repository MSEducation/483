[[The Heist (2008 film)]]

CATEGORIES: 2008 films, New Zealand films, English-language films

The Heist is a quirky crime-drama about two first-time jewel thieves who stage a bizarre diamond heist with seemingly disastrous results, written and directed by short-film director Campbell Cooley and presented in 2008.
With The Heist Campbell Cooley wanted to tell a character-driven story without dialogue and, to add to the complexity of the challenge, he also underscored the entire story to a minuet by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, writing the story to the music. Consistent with his style, the film is full of twists and surprises. The action flows in harmony with Mozart’s Minuet movement from Divertimento in D Major.
The Leith Short Film Festival in Scotland called it a "Witty & engaging crime-drama".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.leithshortfilmfestival.co.uk/festival-2008.html |title=Leith Short Film Festival, Leith, Edinburgh Scotland, UK |work= |accessdate=2011-02-13[/tpl] The Panorama International Film Festival of Patras, Greece are quoted as saying: "...(the) film is very beautiful!".
