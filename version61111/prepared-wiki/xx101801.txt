Vaughan Mills is a large shopping centre in Canada located at the southeast corner of Highway 400 and Rutherford Road, in Vaughan, Ontario about 32 km north of downtown Toronto.   The mall is located adjacent to Canada's Wonderland. Vaughan Mills opened on November 4, 2004, and was the first regional enclosed shopping complex in the Greater Toronto Area since the Erin Mills Town Centre opened in 1990.  It has almost 1.2 million square feet (110,000 m²) of retail space.
The shopping centre was designed and built by Ivanhoe Cambridge and the Mills Corporation, the latter of which owns a portfolio of malls across the United States. JPRA served as the design architect for the center, with Bregman + Hamann Architects as the project architect. Like its American counterparts, Vaughan Mills incorporates a "race track" layout to maximize the exposure of the mall tenants. The complex has over 200 retail stores, restaurants, and entertainment outlets. Fifteen anchor retailers are present, including Bass Pro Shops Outdoor World, H&M, The Children's Place, and Urban Planet. Entertainment located on the site includes Lucky Strike Lanes and the first Legoland Discovery Centre in Canada.
In August 2006, the Mills Corporation sold its stake in Vaughan Mills to partner Ivanhoe Cambridge. In January 2013, plans were announced to add 150,000 square feet and 50 new stores to the mall by fall of 2014.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.thestar.com/business/article/1315789--vaughan-mills-mall-to-add-50-stores|title=Vaughan Mills mall to add 50 stores|last=McDiarmid |first=Jessica|publisher=Toronto Star|date=16 January 2013|accessdate=2013-01-16[/tpl]

==History==

right|300px||thumb|Vaughan Mills site, October 2000When Vaughan Mills was conceived in 1999, it was meant to be a slightly larger complex at 1.4 million square feet (130,000 m²), with up to 18 anchor retailers and a combined 240 stores and services.
The shopping centre was intended to be a stepping stone for American retailers wanting to enter the Canadian market, however Bass Pro Shops Outdoor World was the only U.S. retailer to make its exclusive launch there, while other anticipated retailers such as Bed, Bath and Beyond, Off 5th Saks and Burlington Coat Factory ending up never came to Vaughan Mills.http://business.financialpost.com/2011/05/24/riocan-and-calloway-race-to-open-outlet-malls/ In September 1999, Bed Bath & Beyond and Sun & Ski Sports were among the six American retailers that were announced as Vaughan Mills' first anchor tenants. An ESPN X Games Skatepark was also planned as the main entertainment venue on the site. The mall had a projected opening date of Fall 2001.
The mall had its 2 millionth visitor less than 2 months after its opening.www.toronto.fashion-monitor.com

CrossIron Mills, located outside of Calgary, Alberta, opened on August 19, 2009. It has a number of the same retailers as the Vaughan Mills Mall, including Bass Pro Shops. The CrossIron Mills location opened in the spring of 2009, several months ahead of the main mall. The construction, leasing, and opening of the mall has paralleled Vaughan Mills to a degree, as it, too, has occurred during an economic recession. CrossIron Mills has a larger footprint than Vaughan Mills, but lacks any direct access to local transit services.
The other locations being considered include:
