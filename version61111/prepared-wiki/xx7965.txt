The process of speciation may fall within the purview of either, depending on the forces thought to drive it. Paleontology, evolutionary developmental biology, comparative genomics and genomic phylostratigraphy contribute most of the evidence for the patterns and processes that can be classified as macroevolution. An example of macroevolution is the appearance of feathers during the evolution of birds from theropod dinosaurs.
The evolutionary course of Equidae (wide family including all horses and related animals) is often viewed as a typical example of macroevolution. The earliest known genus, Hyracotherium (now reclassified as a palaeothere), was a herbivore animal resembling a dog that lived in the early Cenozoic. As its habitat transformed into an open arid grassland, selective pressure required that the animal become a fast grazer. Thus elongation of legs and head as well as reduction of toes gradually occurred, producing the only extant genus of Equidae, Equus.

==Origin of the term==

Russian entomologist Yuri Filipchenko first coined the terms "macroevolution" and "microevolution" in 1927 in his German language work, "Variabilität und Variation". Since the inception of the two terms, their meanings have been revised several times and the term macroevolution fell into limited disfavour when it was taken over by such writers as the geneticist Richard Goldschmidt (1940) and the paleontologist Otto Schindewolf to describe their orthogenetic theories.Macroevolution: Its definition, Philosophy and History
A more practical definition of the term describes it as changes occurring on geological time scales, in contrast to microevolution, which occurs on the timescale of human lifetimes.[tpl]cite doi|10.1139/z87-169 [/tpl]  This definition reflects the spectrum between micro- and macro-evolution, whilst leaving a clear difference between the terms: because the geological record rarely has a resolution better than 10,000 years, and humans rarely live longer than 100 years, "meso-evolution" is never observed.
As a result, apart from Dobzhansky, Bernhard Rensch and Ernst Mayr, very few neo-Darwinian writers used the term, preferring instead to talk of evolution as changes in allele frequencies without mention of the level of the changes (above species level or below). Those who did were generally working within the continental European traditions (as Dobzhansky, Ernst Mayr, Bernhard Rensch, Richard Goldschmidt, and Otto Schindewolf were) and those who didn't were generally working within the Anglo-American tradition (such as John Maynard Smith and Richard Dawkins). Hence, use of the term "macroevolution" is sometimes wrongly used as a litmus test of whether the writer is "properly" neo-Darwinian or not.

==Macroevolution and the modern evolutionary synthesis==

Within the Modern Synthesis school of thought, macroevolution is thought of as the compounded effects of microevolution.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Kutschera U, Niklas KJ |title=The modern theory of biological evolution: an expanded synthesis |journal=Die Naturwissenschaften |volume=91 |issue=6 |pages=255–76 |date=June 2004 |pmid=15241603 |doi=10.1007/s00114-004-0515-y[/tpl] Thus, the distinction between micro- and macroevolution is not a fundamental one[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]the only difference between them is of time and scale. As  Ernst W. Mayr observes, "transspecific evolution is nothing but an extrapolation and magnification of the events that take place within populations and species...it is misleading to make a distinction between the causes of micro- and macroevolution”. However, time is not a necessary distinguishing factor[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]macroevolution can happen without gradual compounding of small changes; whole-genome duplication can result in speciation occurring over a single generation - this is especially common in plants.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Rieseberg LH, Willis JH |title=Plant Speciation |journal=Science |volume=317 |issue=5840 |pages=910–4 |date=August 2007 |pmid=17702935 |pmc=2442920 |doi=10.1126/science.1137729[/tpl]
Changes in the genes regulating development have also been proposed as being important in producing speciation through large and relatively sudden changes in animals' morphology.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Valentine JW, Jablonski D |title=Morphological and developmental macroevolution: a paleontological perspective |journal=The International Journal of Developmental Biology |volume=47 |issue=7–8 |pages=517–22 |year=2003 |pmid=14756327 |url=http://www.intjdevbiol.com/paper.php?doi=14756327[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal|author=Johnson NA, Porter AH |title=Toward a new synthesis: population genetics and evolutionary developmental biology |journal=Genetica |volume=112–113 |issue= |pages=45–58 |year=2001 |pmid=11838782 |doi=10.1023/A:1013371201773[/tpl]

==Research topics==

Some examples of subjects whose study falls within the realm of macroevolution:
Abrupt transformations from one biologic system to another, for example the passing of life from water into land or the transition from invertebrates to vertebrates, are rare. Few major biological types have emerged during the evolutionary history of life and most of them survive till today. When lifeforms take such giant leaps, they meet little to no competition and are able to exploit a plethora of available niches, following a pattern of adaptive radiation. This can lead to convergent evolution, where unrelated populations display similar adaptations.Introduction to Ecology (1983) - J.C. Emberlin, chapter 8
Recently, Persi & Horn[tpl]Cite journal|author=Persi E, Horn D |title=Systematic Analysis of Compositional Order of Proteins Reveals New Characteristics of Biological Functions and a Universal Correlate of Macroevolution  |journal=PLoS Comput Biol |volume=9 |issue=11 |pages=e1003346 |date=November 2013 |doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003346[/tpl]  have argued that macroevolutionary events along the history of an extant species may leave a stamp on its proteome: the existence of compositionally ordered (CO) sections of proteins. Introducing a universal measure that counts an effective CO vocabulary they have shown that it distinguishes between major eukaryotic clades.

==Misuse==

The term "macroevolution" frequently arises within the context of the evolution/creation debate, usually used by creationists alleging a significant difference between the evolutionary changes observed in field and laboratory studies and the larger scale macroevolutionary changes that scientists believe to have taken thousands or millions of years to occur. They accept that evolutionary change is possible within what they call "kinds" ("microevolution"), but deny that one "kind" can evolve into another ("macroevolution").[tpl]cite book|last=edited by Scott|first=Eugenie C.|title=Not in our classrooms : why intelligent design is wrong for our schools|year=2006|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston|isbn=0807032786|edition=1st|coauthors=Branch, Glenn|page=47[/tpl] Contrary to this belief among the anti-evolution movement proponents, evolution of life forms beyond the species level (i.e. speciation) has indeed been observed multiple times under both controlled laboratory conditions and in nature.[ref]

[/ref] In creation science, creationists accepted speciation as occurring within a "created kind" or "baramin", but objected to what they called  "third level-macroevolution" of a new genus or higher rank in taxonomy. Generally, there is ambiguity as to where they draw a line on "species", "created kinds", etc. and what events and lineages fall within the rubric of microevolution or macroevolution.[tpl]cite web|last=Awbrey|first=Frank T.|title=Defining "Kinds" — Do Creationists Apply a Double Standard?|url=http://ncse.com/cej/2/3/defining-kinds-do-creationists-apply-double-standard|year=1981|publisher=National Center for Science Education[/tpl] The claim that macroevolution does not occur, or is impossible, is not supported by the scientific community.
Such claims are rejected by the scientific community on the basis of ample evidence that macroevolution is an active process both presently and in the past.CB901: No Macroevolution The terms macroevolution and microevolution relate to the same processes operating at different scales, but creationist claims misuse the terms in a vaguely defined way which does not accurately reflect scientific usage, acknowledging well observed evolution as "microevolution" and denying that "macroevolution" takes place.CB902: Microevolution is distinct from macroevolution.  Evolutionary theory (including macroevolutionary change) remains the dominant scientific paradigm for explaining the origins of Earth's biodiversity. Its occurrence is not disputed within the scientific community.[tpl]harvnb|Myers|2006[/tpl]; [tpl]harvnb|NSTA|2007[/tpl]; [tpl]harvnb|IAP|2006[/tpl]; [tpl]harvnb|AAAS|2006[/tpl]; and [tpl]harvnb|Pinholster|2006[/tpl]; Ruling, Kitzmiller v.

While details of macroevolution are continuously studied by the scientific community, the overall theory behind macroevolution (i.e. common descent) has been overwhelmingly consistent with empirical data. Predictions of empirical data from the theory of common descent have been so consistent that biologists often refer to it as the "fact of evolution".29+ Evidences for Macroevolution: The Scientific Case for Common Descent, Douglas L.

Describing the fundamental similarity between Macro and Microevolution in his authoritative textbook "Evolutionary Biology," biologist Douglas Futuyma writes,
[tpl]cquote2|One of the most important tenets of the theory forged during the Evolutionary Synthesis of the 1930s and 1940s was that "macroevolutionary" differences among organisms - those that distinguish higher taxa - arise from the accumulation of the same kinds of genetic differences that are found within species. Opponents of this point of view believed that "macroevolution" is qualitatively different from "microevolution" within species, and is based on a totally different kind of genetic and developmental patterning... Genetic studies of species differences have decisively disproved this claim. Differences between species in morphology, behavior, and the processes that underlie reproductive isolation all have the same genetic properties as variation within species: they occupy consistent chromosomal positions, they may be polygenic or based on few genes, they may display additive, dominant, or epistatic effects, and they can in some instances be traced to specifiable differences in proteins or DNA nucleotide sequences. The degree of reproductive isolation between populations, whether prezygotic or postzygotic, varies from little or none to complete. Thus, reproductive isolation, like the divergence of any other character, evolves in most cases by the gradual substitution of alleles in populations.|Douglas Futuyma, "Evolutionary Biology" (1998), pp.477-8[tpl]cite book|first=Douglas|last=Futuyma|title=Evolutionary Biology|publisher=Sinauer Associates|year=1998[/tpl][/tpl]
Nicholas Matzke and Paul R. Gross have accused creationists of using "strategically elastic" definitions of micro- and macroevolution when discussing the topic. The actual definition of macroevolution accepted by the vast majority of[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/macroevolution.html#confusions |title=Macroevolution: Its Definition, Philosophy and History|accessdate=19 March 2013 |author=John Wilkins |year=2006 |publisher= TalkOrigins Archive [/tpl] scientists is "any change at the species level or above" (phyla, group, etc.) and microevolution is "any change below the level of species." Matzke and Gross state that many creationist critics define macroevolution as something that cannot be attained, as these critics dismiss any observed evolutionary change as "just microevolution".
