CATEGORIES: MTV Networks

Virtual MTV, more commonly known as vMTV, is a collection of virtual worlds under the MTV Networks umbrella.
vMTV includes seven separate virtual worlds, each based on an MTV television show.
In early 2008, MTV partnered with Paramount Digital Entertainment and Los Angeles-based developer FanRocket to launch the two companies' VooZoo application in vMTV, allowing users to communicate via scenes and lines of dialogue from the Paramount movie library.http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m4PRN/is_2008_April_3/ai_n25124259 "Paramount Digital Entertainment Extends VooZoo Into MTV Networks' vMTV and Makena's There.com Virtual Worlds"
In early 2009 MTV planned to close down Virtual MTV on February 19, 2009. vMTV will be replaced by a Flash-based virtual world vMTV 2D which is currently in Alpha testing.
