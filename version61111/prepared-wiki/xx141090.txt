[tpl]nihongo|Akegaras Haya|暁烏 敏||extra=1877-1954[/tpl] was a Shin Buddhist student of Kiyozawa Manshi for a decade. Akegaras was a former head of administration of the Higashi Hongan-ji who was a major inspiration to the formation of the Dobokai Movement.Popular Buddhism In Japan: Shin Buddhist Religion & Culture by Esben Andreasen, pp. 46,71,72 / University of Hawaii Press 1998, ISBN 0-8248-2028-2
In 1949 Akegarasu focused Shin practice in the direction of faith alone, declaring in a statement to his disciples: "First shinjin, second shinjin, third shinjin." This is basically the moment where Dobokai became official, although the movement did not receive official recognition until 1962. The early roots for the Dobokai Movement faith movement began in 1947 as the shinjinsha, or, 'true person community'.
