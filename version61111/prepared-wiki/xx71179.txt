In mathematics, the Radon–Nikodym theorem is a result in measure theory that states that, given a measurable space [tpl]math|(X, Σ)[/tpl], if a [tpl]mvar|σ[/tpl]-finite measure [tpl]mvar|ν[/tpl] on [tpl]math|(X, Σ)[/tpl] is absolutely continuous with respect to a [tpl]mvar|σ[/tpl]-finite measure [tpl]mvar|μ[/tpl] on [tpl]math|(X, Σ)[/tpl], then there is a measurable function [tpl]math| f  : X → [0, ∞)[/tpl], such that for any measurable subset [tpl]math|A ⊂ X[/tpl]:
The function [tpl]math| f [/tpl] is called the Radon–Nikodym derivative and denoted by [tpl]math|[tpl]sfrac|dν|dμ[/tpl][/tpl].
The theorem is named after Johann Radon, who proved the theorem for the special case where the underlying space is [tpl]math|RN[/tpl] in 1913, and for Otto Nikodym who proved the general case in 1930.[ref]
