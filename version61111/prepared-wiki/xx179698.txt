The Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test (NNAT) is a nonverbal measure of general ability. There are three versions of this test, designed by Jack A. Naglieri and published by Pearson Education.

Two versions were published in 2007 and 2008, respectively. This includes the group administered Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test - Second Edition and the Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test - Online version. The most current version is NNAT2. Like all nonverbal ability tests, the NNAT is intended to assess cognitive ability independently of linguistic and cultural background.

==Present use==

These tests may be administered to K–12 school children on an individual or group basis as a means to identify potentially gifted children for placement in accelerated programs.

==NNAT and the media==

Beginning in the 2012-13 school year, the Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test- 2nd Edition (NNAT-2) replaced the Bracken School Readiness Assessment (BSRA).http://schools.nyc.gov/NR/rdonlyres/0E2224D7-DF21-42DA-8C9E-BC4FDEC157FB/0/NYCGiftedandTalentedAssessmentFAQ_413.pdf
The decision sparked some degree of controversy[tpl]why?|date=October 2013[/tpl] http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20121024/new-york-city/new-gifted-talented-test-so-hard-it-even-leaves-parents-stumped  The NNAT-2 is considered[tpl]by whom?|date=October 2013[/tpl] significantly harder than the Bracken School Readiness Assessment (BSRA) which it replaced. 
In New York City, the NNAT-2 makes up 50% of the gifted and talented exam, the other 50% is the Otis–Lennon School Ability Test (OLSAT).[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl]

==Criticism==

The NNAT has been found by one study to show excessive score variability, with within-grade standard deviations reaching as high as 20 points. This has the effect of both overrepresenting and underrepresenting index scores - that is, more students received very high or very low scores than expected. Lohman et al. found that 3.4 times as many students scored in the 130+ range on the NNAT as expected.[ref]
