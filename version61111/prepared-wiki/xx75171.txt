Cache Creek is an historic junction community and incorporated village [tpl]convert|354|km|mi[/tpl] northeast of Vancouver in British Columbia, Canada. It is on the Trans-Canada Highway in the province of British Columbia at its junction with northbound Highway 97.  The same intersection and the town that grew around it was at the point on the Cariboo Wagon Road where a branch road, and previously only a trail, led east to Savona's Ferry on Kamloops Lake.
Its name is derived, apparently, from a cache or buried and hidden supply and tradegoods depot used by the fur traders of either the Hudson's Bay Company or its rival the North West Company.[tpl]Cite bcgnis|id=9342 |title=Cache Creek (creek)[/tpl]
Although still very active with traffic, Cache Creek was extremely busy for a few decades before the Trans-Canada Highway was superseded by the newer and shorter Coquihalla Highway, which bypasses the Fraser and Thompson Canyons between Hope and Kamloops via Merritt, about [tpl]convert|97|km|mi|0[/tpl] southeast.
The nearby fossil locality, the McAbee fossil beds, is noted for the wide diversity of Eocene plants and animals preserved in the shale, including the extinct plants Dillhoffia[tpl]cite journal |last1=Manchester |first1=S. |coauthor=Pigg, K. |year=2008 |title=The Eocene mystery flower of McAbee, British Columbia |journal= Botany |volume=86 |pages=1034â€“1038 |doi= 10.1139/B08-044[/tpl] and Trochodendron drachuckii.[tpl]cite doi|10.1086/512104[/tpl]
