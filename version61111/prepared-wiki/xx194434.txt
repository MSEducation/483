The pulpitum is a common feature in medieval cathedral and monastic architecture in Europe. It is a massive screen, most often constructed of stone, or occasionally timber, that divides the choir (the area containing the  choir stalls and high altar in a cathedral, collegiate or monastic church) from the nave and ambulatory (the parts of the church to which lay worshippers may have access).[tpl]cite book |last=Morris |first=Richard |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title=Cathedrals and Abbeys of England and Wales |origdate= |origyear= |origmonth= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |date= |year=1979 |month= |publisher=Dent |location=London |language= |isbn=0-460-04334-X |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=144 |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= [/tpl]  Typically the pulpitum is lavishly carved and decorated, and those of York Minster and Canterbury Cathedral preserve complete medieval sets of statues of the Kings of England. 
The word pulpitum is applied in ecclesiastical Latin both for this form of screen and also for a pulpit; the secular origin of the term being a theatrical stage, or speaker's dais.[tpl]cite book |last=Friar |first=Stephen |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title=A Companion to the English Parish Church|origdate= |origyear= |origmonth= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |date= |year=1996 |month= |publisher=Bramley Books |location= |language= |isbn=1-85833-738-0 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=369 |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= [/tpl] It is thought that this form of screen originated in monastic practice, providing a raised stage from which members of a religious communities could address pilgrims attending to venerate the church's relics, while still maintaining their monastic seclusion from lay contact. 
An internal stair within the thickness of the pulpitum gives access to a broad upper platform, which commonly supports the cathedral organ. The pulpitum is invariably pierced by a central passage, leading immediately into the choir stalls to the (ritual) east. Many pulpitums, as those of Glasgow Cathedral, Exeter Cathedral and Southwell Minster, incorporated subsidiary altars either side of their central passages. In the late medieval period, there would have always have been a rood screen or rood beam placed one bay to the west of the pulpitum (i.e. further away from the high altar of the cathedral); which would have had the main nave altar for the use of lay worshippers set against its western face; and which was pierced by lateral doors, left and right, for processional access to the nave; and through which pilgrims could pass into the eastern arm of the church so as to proceed via the ambulatory to the feretory or shrine, commonly located behind the high altar. Most cathedral rood screens were demolished at the English Reformation, although the cathedrals of Peterborough and Canterbury retained their separate rood screens into the 18th century; and in the collegiate church of Ottery Saint Mary, both sets of screens remained until the early 19th century. At the former monastic churches of Saint Albans and Ewenny the rood screen survives, while the pulpitum does not. 
Several English cathedrals demolished their pulpitums in the early 19th century, intending to open the view from the congregation to the high altar; but in most instances this was found to be unsatisfactory, and a much less massive chancel screen was erected in its place.
