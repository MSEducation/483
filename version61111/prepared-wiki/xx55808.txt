Joseph Carl Robnett Licklider (March 11, 1915 – June 26, 1990), known simply as J.C.R. or "Lick" was an American psychologist Miller, G. A. (1991), "J. C. R. Licklider, psychologist", Journal of the Acoustic Society of America 89, no. 4B, pp. 1887-1887 and computer scientist who is considered one of the most important figures in computer science and general computing history.
He is particularly remembered for being one of the first to foresee modern-style interactive computing, and its application to all manner of activities; and also as an Internet pioneer, with an early vision of a worldwide computer network long before it was built. He did much to actually initiate all that through his funding of research which led to a great deal of it, including today's canonical graphical user interface, and the ARPANET, the direct predecessor to the Internet.
He has been called "computing's Johnny Appleseed", for having planted the seeds of computing in the digital age; Robert Taylor, founder of Xerox PARC's Computer Science Laboratory and Digital Equipment Corporation's Systems Research Center, noted that "most of the significant advances in computer technology—including the work that my group did at Xerox PARC—were simply extrapolations of Lick's vision. They were not really new visions of their own. So he was really the father of it all".[tpl]cite book | last=Waldrop | first=M. Mitchell | title=The Dream Machine: J. C. R.

For people who only know today's computerized, information-rich world, the change from what came before, and thus his impact on the world (since his ideas, and the work of people he sponsored, has led, directly and indirectly, to much of it), is probably hard to truly fathom. This quotation from the full-length biography of him called The Dream Machine, gives some sense of it:

==Biography==

Licklider was born on March 11, 1915, in St. Louis, Missouri, USA.Internet Pioneers: J.C.R. Licklider, retrieved online: 2009-05-19 He was the only child of Joseph Parron Licklider, a Baptist minister, and Margaret Robnett Licklider.Joseph Carl Robnett Licklider 1915—1990, A Biographical Memoir by Robert M. Fano, National Academies Press, Washington D.C., 1998 Despite his father's religious background, he was not religious in later life.[tpl]cite book|title=The Dream Machine: J.C.R. Licklider and the Revolution That Made Computing Personal|year=2002|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=9780142001356|author=M. Mitchell Waldrop|page=471|quote=Al Vezza was insistent, remembers Louise Licklider. "Lick had said that he didn't want any kind of to-do when he died", she says. "He wasn't religious himself, even though his father had been a Southern Baptist minister, so it would seem totally phony if he'd had a big religious service."[/tpl] He displayed early engineering talent, building model airplanes. He carried on with his hobby of refurbishing automobiles throughout his life.
He studied at Washington University in St. Louis, where he received a bachelor of arts degree in 1937, majoring in physics, mathematics, and psychology, and a master of arts degree in psychology in 1938. He received a PhD in psychoacoustics from the University of Rochester in 1942, and worked at the Psycho-Acoustic Laboratory at Harvard University from 1943 to 1950.
He became interested in information technology, and moved to MIT in 1950 as an associate professor, where he served on a committee that established MIT Lincoln Laboratory and established a psychology program for engineering students.
In 1957 he received the Franklin V. Taylor Award from the Society of Engineering Psychologists. In 1958 he was elected President of the Acoustical Society of America, and in 1990 he received the Commonwealth Award for Distinguished Service.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.columbia.edu/~jrh29/years.html |title= J. C. R. Licklider (1915-1990) |author= Jay R. Hauben |publisher= Columbia University |accessdate= March 30, 2011 [/tpl]
In 1957 he became a Vice President at Bolt Beranek and Newman, Inc., where he bought the first production PDP-1 computer and conducted the first public demonstration of time-sharing.
In October 1962, Licklider was appointed head of the Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) at DARPA, then called ARPA, the United States Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.[tpl]cite book|title=Computing: A Concise History|year=2012|publisher=The MIT Press|isbn=9780262517676|author=Paul E. Ceruzzi|page=75[/tpl]
In 1963 he was named Director of Behavioral Sciences Command & Control Research at ARPA. In April of that year, he sent a memo to his colleagues in which he outlined the early challenges presented in trying to establish a time-sharing network of computers with the software of the era.[tpl]cite web |author= J. C. R.

In 1968 J. C. R. Licklider became director of Project MAC at MIT, and a professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering. Project MAC had produced the first computer time-sharing system, CTSS, and one of the first online setups with the development of Multics (work on which commenced in 1964). Multics provided inspiration for some elements of the Unix operating system developed at Bell Labs by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie in 1970.[tpl]cite book|last=Raymond|first=Eric S.|title=The Art of Unix Programming|year=2003|url=[tpl]Google books|H4q1t-jAcBIC|The Art of Unix Programming|page=30|plainurl=yes[/tpl]|page=30[/tpl]
He retired and became Professor Emeritus in 1985. He died in 1990 in Arlington, Massachusetts, from complications following  an asthma attack.  He was survived by his wife, Louise Carpenter Licklider, son Tracy Robnett Licklider, daughter Linda Licklider Smith, and 2 grandchildren.

==Work==

===Psychoacoustics===

In the psychoacoustics field, Licklider is most remembered for his 1951 "Duplex Theory of Pitch Perception", presented in a paperLicklider, J. C. R. (1951). "A duplex theory of pitch perception". Experientia (Basel) 7, 4, 128–134. that has been cited hundreds of times,[tpl]cite web | url = http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&lr=&safe=off&q=%22duplex+theory+of+pitch+perception%22++licklider+1951&btnG=Search | title = Google Scholar[/tpl] was reprinted in a 1979 book,[tpl]cite book | title = Physiological Acoustics | author = Earl D.

===Semi-Automatic Ground Environment===

While at MIT in the 1950s, Licklider worked on "SAGE" (Semi-Automatic Ground Environment), a Cold War project to create a computer-aided air defense system. The SAGE system included computers that collected and presented data to a human operator, who then chose the appropriate response. Licklider worked as a human factors expert, which helped convince him of the great potential for human/computer interfaces."J. C. R. Licklider And The Universal Network", Living Internet, accessed 18 September 2012

===Information technology===

Licklider became interested in information technology early in his career. His ideas foretold of graphical computing, point-and-click interfaces, digital libraries, e-commerce, online banking, and software that would exist on a network and migrate wherever it was needed. Much like Vannevar Bush's, Licklider's contribution to the development of the Internet consists of ideas, not inventions. He foresaw the need for networked computers with easy user interfaces. He also did some seminal early work for the Council on Library Resources, imagining what libraries of the future might look like, describing them as "thinking centers." [tpl]cite book |url=http://comminfo.rutgers.edu/~tefko/Courses/e553/Readings/Licklider%20Libraries%20of%20the%20future%201965.pdf |last=Licklider |first=J. C. R. |title=Libraries of the Future |year=1965 |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |location=Cambridge, MA |pages=1965[/tpl]
Licklider was instrumental in conceiving, funding and managing the research that led to modern personal computers and the Internet. In 1960 his seminal paper on Man-Computer Symbiosis foreshadowed interactive computing, and he went on to fund early efforts in time-sharing and application development, most notably the work of Douglas Engelbart, who founded the Augmentation Research Center at Stanford Research Institute and created the famous On-Line System where the computer mouse was invented.

====Man–computer symbiosis====

In Man–Computer Symbiosis, Licklider outlined the need for simpler interaction between computers and computer users.[tpl]citation |last=Guice|first=Jon|year=1998|title= Controversy and the State: Lord ARPA and Intelligence Computing|journal=Social Studies of Science|volume=28| issue=1|pages=103–138|jstor=285752[/tpl] Licklider has been credited as an early pioneer of cybernetics and artificial intelligence (AI),[tpl]cite web |title=J. C. R. Licklider |url=http://www.thocp.net/biographies/licklidder_jcr.html |work=The History of Computing Project |publisher=thocp.net |date=July 8, 2001 |accessdate=August 7, 2011[/tpl] but unlike many AI practitioners, Licklider never felt that men would be replaced by computer-based beings. As he wrote in that article: "Men will set the goals, formulate the hypotheses, determine the criteria, and perform the evaluations. Computing machines will do the routinizable work that must be done to prepare the way for insights and decisions in technical and scientific thinking".Licklider, J. C. R., "Man-Computer Symbiosis", IRE Transactions on Human Factors in Electronics, vol. HFE-1, 4-11, March 1960.  This approach, focusing on effective use of information technology in augmenting human intelligence, is sometimes called Intelligence amplification (IA).

====Project MAC====

During his time as director of ARPA's Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) from 1962 to 1964, he funded Project MAC at MIT where a large mainframe computer was designed to be shared by up to 30 simultaneous users, each sitting at a separate "typewriter terminal". He also funded similar projects at Stanford University, UCLA, UC Berkeley, and the System Development Corporation. In 1964, Licklider left IPTO and went to work at IBM. In 1968, he went back to MIT to lead Project MAC.

====Global computer network====

Licklider played a similar role in conceiving of and funding early networking research, most notably the ARPAnet. He formulated the earliest ideas of a global computer network in August 1962 at BBN, in a series of memos discussing the "Intergalactic Computer Network" concept. These ideas contained almost everything that the Internet is today, including cloud computing.[tpl]cite web |last=Mohamed |first=Arif |date=March 2009 |title=A History of Cloud Computing |publisher=ComputerWeekly |location= |url=http://www.computerweekly.com/Articles/2009/06/10/235429/A-history-of-cloud-computing.htm |doi= |id= |accessdate=May 1, 2012[/tpl]
While at IPTO, he convinced Ivan Sutherland, Bob Taylor, and Lawrence G. Roberts that an all-encompassing computer network was a very important concept.
In 1967 Licklider submitted the paper "Televistas: Looking ahead through side windows" to the Carnegie Commission on Educational Television."Televistas: Looking ahead through side windows", J. C. R. Licklider, Supplementary Papers submitted to the Carnegie Commission on Educational Television, 1967  This paper describes a radical departure from the "broadcast" model of television. Instead, Licklider advocates a two-way communications network. The Carnegie Commission led to the creation of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Although the Commission's report explains that "Dr. Licklider's paper was completed after the Commission had formulated its own conclusions," President Johnson said at the signing of the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, "So I think we must consider new ways to build a great network for knowledge-not just a broadcast system, but one that employs every means of sending and of storing information that the individual can use".[tpl]cite web |last=Johnson |first=Lyndon B. |title=Remarks of President Lyndon B.

His 1968 paper The Computer as a Communication Device illustrates his vision of network applications and predicts the use of computer networks to support communities of common interest and collaboration without regard to location."The Computer as a Communication Device", J.C.R.
