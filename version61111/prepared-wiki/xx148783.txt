Cyrus J. Young, Jr. (born July 23, 1928) is an American former athlete who competed mainly in the javelin throw. A graduate of UCLA, he was the first non-European man to win the gold medal in the javelin throw in the Olympics in 1952, and - through the 2012 London Olympics - he remains the only American male to earn Olympic gold in the event.
He attended the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) and graduated in 1951. Incredibly, Young only toyed with the javelin for two years in junior college and only took it seriously after entering UCLA in 1948. In 1950, he placed second in the NCAA Championships, and in 1952 Young set a new U.S. record of 256 feet 3 inches (78.12 meters) in the javelin.[tpl]cite web|title=UCLA Hall of Fame to Induct 12 New Members|date=September 16, 1998|publisher=UCLA Athletics official website|url=http://uclabruins.cstv.com/genrel/091698aaa.html|accessdate=2011-10-31[/tpl]
Young competed in the javelin throw for the U.S. at the 1952 Summer Olympic Games in Helsinki, Finland where he won the gold medal.Biography and statistics at Sports-Reference.com
Young continued to throw during his mid-20s and four years later prepared to defend his Olympic title. In April 1956, Young had the best throw of his career with 259-8½ (79.16m). Later in the season, he won his only AAU championship. Because the Olympics were being in held in the Southern hemisphere - where the seasons are "reversed" in comparison to America and Europe - the Summer Games were delayed until late November, which was months after the track & field outdoor season typically ended. A few months before the Melbourne Games, Poland’s Janusz Sidło - the 1954 European Champion - pushed the javelin world record out to 83.66 (274-5¾). Nonetheless, Young headed to Melbourne, Australia as one of the favorites. Three days before the competition he twisted an ankle which caused him pain has he "planted" his leg to release his throw.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.modbee.com/2008/08/16/395683/modesto-gold-medalist-tackling.html|title=http://www.modbee.com/2008/08/16/395683/modesto-gold-medalist-tackling.html|first=Ron|last=Agostini|date=16 August 2008|publisher=Modesto Bee|accessdate=30 March 2014[/tpl]
