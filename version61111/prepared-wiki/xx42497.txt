==Early life==

In March 1984, when NYU student Rick Rubin and promoter-manager Russell Simmons founded the then-independent Def Jam label, 16 year–old St. Albans, Queens native James Todd Smith was creating demo tapes in his grandparents' home. His grandfather, a jazz saxophonist, purchased him $ 2,000 worth of equipment, including two turntables, an audio mixer and an amplifier.Holden, Stephen. "From Rock To Rap", New York Times, April 26, 1987. Retrieved on 2008-11-16. Smith later discussed his childhood background and rapping, stating that "By the time I got that equipment, I was already a rapper. In this neighborhood, the kids grow up in rap. It's like speaking Spanish if you grow up in an all-Spanish house. I got into it when I was about 9, and since then all I wanted was to make a record and hear it on the radio." By using the mixing table he had received from his grandfather, Smith produced and mixed his own demos and sent them to various record companies throughout New York City, including Simmons' and Rubin's own Def Jam Recordings.[tpl]cite web|url=http://videoeta.com/person/726|title=VideoETA....LL Cool J bio|publisher=VideoETA.com Inc.|accessdate=2008-06-24[/tpl]
Under his new stage name, LL Cool J (an acronym for Ladies Love Cool James),[tpl]cite web|url=http://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/Ladies+Love+Cool+James+(rap+artist)|title=Acronyms and abbreviations by the Free Online Dictionary|publisher=Farlex, Inc.|accessdate=2008-07-01[/tpl] Smith was signed by Def Jam, which led to the release of his first official record, the 12-inch single "I Need a Beat" (1984).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/ll_cool_j/artist.jhtml#bio|title=MTV.com - LL Cool J Bio|publisher=MTV Networks.|accessdate=2008-06-24[/tpl] The single was a hard-hitting, streetwise b-boy song with spare beats and ballistic rhymes. Smith later discussed his search for a label, stating "I sent my demo to many different companies, but it was Def Jam where I found my home."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.defjam.com/site/artist_bio.php?artist_id=202|title=Def Jam Recordings - LL Cool J Biography|publisher=The Island Def Jam Music Group|accessdate=2008-05-25|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080429202053/http://www.defjam.com/site/artist_bio.php?artist_id=202 |archivedate=2008-04-29[/tpl] That same year, Smith made his professional debut concert performance at Manhattan Center High School. In a later interview, LL Cool J recalled the experience, stating "They pushed the lunch room tables together and me and my DJ, Cut Creator, started playing. ... As soon as it was over there were girls screaming and asking for autographs. Right then and there I said 'This is what I want to do'."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tribute.ca/people/LL+Cool+J/2045/8892|title=LL Cool J bio: Edison Force ActorTribute.ca....|publisher=Tribute Entertainment Media Group|accessdate=2008-06-24[/tpl] LL's debut single sold over 100,000 copies and helped establish both Def Jam as a label and Smith as a rapper. The commercial success of "I Need a Beat", along with the Beastie Boys's single "Rock Hard" (1984), helped lead Def Jam to a distribution deal with Columbia Records the following year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.addressdefjam.com/|title=Address Island / Def Jam Records ...

==Career==

===Radio (1985)===

Radio was released to critical acclaim, both for production innovation and LL's powerful rap.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/02/magazine/02rubin.t.html|author=Hirschber Lynn|title=The Music Man |publisher=  New York Times Magazine|date=September 2, 2007[/tpl] 
Released November 18, 1985, on Def Jam Recordings in the United States,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.headsprung.net/discography.php|title=LL Cool J career discography at HeadSprung.net|publisher=Headsprung.net|accessdate=2008-06-24[/tpl] Radio earned a significant amount of commercial success and sales for a hip hop record at the time. Shortly after its release, the album sold over 500,000 copies in its first five months, eventually selling over 1 million copies by 1988, according to the Recording Industry Association of America.George (1990), pp. 1-4.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS&action=&title=Radio&artist=L.L.%20Cool%20J&format=&debutLP=&category=&sex=&releaseDate=&requestNo=&type=&level=&label=&company=&certificationDate=&awardDescription=&catalogNo=&aSex=&rec_id=&charField=&gold=&platinum=&multiPlat=&level2=&certDate=&album=&id=&after=&before=&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2008&sort=Artist&perPage=25 |title=RIAA searchable database |publisher=Recording Industry Association of America |accessdate=2008-06-19[/tpl] Radio peaked at number 6 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and at number 46 on the Billboard 200 albums chart. It entered the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart on December 28, 1985, and remained there for forty-seven weeks, while also entering the Pop Albums chart on January 11, 1986. Radio remained on the chart for thirty-eight weeks.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/esearch/searchResult.jsp?exp=y&Ntt=LL+Cool+J+Radio&Ntk=Keyword&Ntx=mode+matchallpartial&nor=10&an=bbcom&N=36&Ns=FORMATTED_DATE|title=Billboard Music Charts - Search Results - LL Cool J Radio|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|accessdate=2008-08-04[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] By 1989, the album had earned platinum status from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), after earning a gold certification in the United States on April 14, 1986, with sales exceeding one million copies.
"I Can't Live Without My Radio" and "Rock the Bells" were singles that helped the album go platinum.  It eventually reached 1,500,000 in US sales.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1528980/ll-cool-j-cant-knock-out-billboard-champs.jhtml|title=LL Cool J Can't Knock Out Billboard Champs|author =Chris Harris |publisher=  MTV|date=April 19, 2006 [/tpl]
With the breakthrough success of his hit single "I Need a Beat" and the Radio LP, LL Cool J became one of the first hip-hop acts to achieve mainstream success along with Kurtis Blow and Run-D.M.C.. Gigs at larger venues were offered to LL as he would join the 1986-'87 Raising Hell tour, opening for Run-D.M.C. and the Beastie Boys.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.askmen.com/men/entertainment_100/100_ll_cool_j.html|title=Biography and other information at Askmen.com|publisher=IGN Entertainment, Inc.|accessdate=2008-06-24[/tpl] Another milestone of LL's popularity was his appearance on American Bandstand as the first hip hop act on the show.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mcgillismusic.com/ll_cool_j.htm|title=Career overview at McgillisMusic|publisher=World Wide Entertainment USA, Inc.|accessdate=2008-06-24 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080412075151/http://www.mcgillismusic.com/ll_cool_j.htm |archivedate = April 12, 2008[/tpl]
The album's success also helped in contributing to Rick Rubin's credibility and repertoire as a record producer. Radio, along with Raising Hell (1986) and Licensed to Ill (1986), would form a trilogy of New York City-based, Rubin-helmed albums that helped to diversify hip-hop.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/pid/1084925/a/Radio.htm |title=Radio cd product notes |publisher=Muze Inc.  |accessdate=2008-06-19[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rhino.com/Features/liners/72851lin.html|title=Kurtis Blow Presents: The History Of Rap, Vol. 1: The Genesis|publisher=Rhino Entertainment|accessdate=2008-06-24[/tpl] Rubin's production credit on the back cover reads "REDUCED BY RICK RUBIN", referring to his minimalist production style, which gave the album its stripped-down and gritty sound. This style would serve as one of Rubin's production trademarks and would have a great impact on future hip-hop productions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://top40.about.com/od/popmusicproducers/p/rickrubin.htm|title=About.com ... Rick Rubin's Style and Approach|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=2008-06-24[/tpl] Rubin's early hip hop production work, before his exit from Def Jam to Los Angeles, helped solidify his legacy as a hip hop pioneer and establish his reputation in the music industry.

===Breakthrough and success (1987-1990)===

LL Cool J's second album was 1987's Bigger and Deffer, which was produced by DJ Pooh.[tpl]cite web|author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/dj-pooh-mn0000663828/biography |title=DJ Pooh | Biography |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2014-04-19[/tpl] This stands as his biggest-selling career album, having sold in excess of three million copies in the United States alone.  It spent 11 weeks at #1 on Billboard[tpl]'[/tpl]s R&B albums chart.  It also reached #3 on the Billboard[tpl]'[/tpl]s Pop albums chart. The album featured the singles "I'm Bad", the revolutionary "I Need Love" - L L's first #1 R&B and Top 40 hit, "Bristol Hotel", and "Go Cut Creator Go".
LL Cool J's third album was 1989's Walking with a Panther. Released in 1989, the album was a commercial success, with several charting singles ("Going Back to Cali," "I'm That Type of Guy," "Jingling Baby," "Big Ole Butt," and "One Shot at Love"). The album however was often criticized by the hip-hop community as being too commercial and materialistic, and for focusing too much on love ballads.[tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r28044/review|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|title=Walking with a Panther: Review|publisher=Allmusic|author=Huey, Steve|accessdate=2009-12-23[/tpl]  According to Billboard, the album peaked at #6 on the Billboard 200 and was LL Cool J's second #1 R&B Album where it spent four weeks.
While the previous album Bigger and Deffer, which was a big success, was produced by The L.A. Posse (at the time consisting of Dwayne Simon, Darryl Pierce and, according to himself the most important for crafting the sound of the LP, Bobby "Bobcat" Erving), Dwayne Simon was the only one left willing to work on producing Walking with a Panther. Bobcat said he wanted more money for the album after realizing how much of a success the previous album really had become but Def Jam refused to change the contract which made him leave Cool J.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.raptalk.net/news/features/RaptalksitsdownwithBobcatinahistoricinterview.php|title=A historic sit-down with Bobcat|publisher=Rap Talk Magazine|author=The Rap Talk Crew|accessdate=2010-10-25[/tpl] According to Bobcat this is the reason that Walking with a Panther was met with very mixed reception at the time of its release.

===Continued success and career prominence (1993-2005)===

After acting in The Hard Way and Toys, LL Cool J released 14 Shots to the Dome. The album had three singles ("How I'm Comin'", "Back Seat" and the strangely titled "Pink Cookies in a Plastic Bag Getting Crushed by Buildings") and guest-featured labelmates Lords of the Underground on "NFA-No Frontin' Allowed".  The album went gold.
LL Cool J starred in In the House, an NBC sitcom, before releasing Mr. Smith (1995), which went on to sell over two million copies. Its singles included "Doin' It" (that samples "My Jamaican Guy" by Grace Jones) and "Loungin" (that samples "Who Do You Love?" by Bernard Wright). Another of the album's singles, "Hey Lover", featured Boyz II Men sampling Michael Jackson's "The Lady in My Life," which eventually became one of the first hip-hop music videos to air on  VH1.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2010[/tpl] The song also earned him a Grammy Award. Yet another single from the album, "I Shot Ya Remix", included vocal work by Foxy Brown.
In 1996, Def Jam released this "greatest hits" package, offering a good summary of Cool J's career, from the relentless minimalism of early hits such as "Rock the Bells" to the smooth-talking braggadocio that followed. Classic albums including Bigger and Deffer and Mama Said Knock You Out are well represented here.
In 1997, he released the album Phenomenon. The singles included "Phenomenon" and "Father". The official second single from Phenomenon was "4, 3, 2, 1," which featured Method Man, Redman & Master P and introduced DMX and Canibus.
In 2000, LL Cool J released the album G.O.A.T., which stood for the "greatest of all time." It debuted at number one on the Billboard album charts,[tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]BillboardURLbyName|artist=ll cool j|bio=true[/tpl] |title=Biography – LL Cool J |work=Billboard |accessdate=March 24, 2011[/tpl] and went platinum. LL Cool J thanked Canibus in the liner notes of the album, "for the inspiration".
LL Cool J's next album 10 from 2002, was his 9th studio (10th overall including his greatest hits compilation All World), and included the singles "Paradise" (featuring Amerie), "Luv U Better", produced by Pharrell and The Neptunes and the 2003 Jennifer Lopez duet, "All I Have". The album reached platinum status.
LL Cool J's 10th album The DEFinition was released on August 31, 2004. The album debuted at No. 4 on the Billboard charts. Production came from Timbaland, 7 Aurelius, R. Kelly, and others. The lead single was the Timbaland-produced "Headsprung", which peaked at No. 16 on the Billboard Hot 100. The second single was the 7 Aurelius–produced, "Hush", which peaked at No. 26 on the Billboard Hot 100.

===Later career and touring (2006-2012)===

LL Cool J's 11th album, Todd Smith, was released on April 11, 2006. It includes collaborations with 112, Ginuwine, Juelz Santana, Teairra Mari and Freeway. The first single was the Jermaine Dupri-produced "Control Myself" featuring Jennifer Lopez. They shot the video for "Control Myself" on January 2, 2006 at Sony Studios, New York. The second video, directed by Hype Williams, was "Freeze" featuring Lyfe Jennings.
In July 2006, LL Cool J announced details about his final album with Def Jam Recordings, the only label he has ever been signed to. The album is titled Exit 13. The album was originally scheduled to be executively produced by fellow Queens rapper 50 Cent.[tpl]cite web|last=Moss |first=Corey |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1535528/20060630/50_cent.jhtml?headlines=true |title=50 Cent, LL Cool J Teaming Up For LP – News Story Music, Celebrity, Artist News | MTV News |publisher=Mtv |date=July 5, 2006 |accessdate=March 24, 2011[/tpl] Exit 13 was originally slated for a fall 2006 release, however, after a 2-year delay, it was released September 9, 2008 without 50 Cent as the executive producer. Tracks that the two worked on were leaked to the internet and some of the tracks produced with 50 made it to Exit 13.
LL Cool J partnered with DJ Kay Slay to release a mixtape called "The Return of the G.O.A.T.". It was the first mixtape of his 24-year career and includes freestyling by LL Cool J  in addition to other rappers giving their renditions of his songs.

He toured with Janet Jackson on her Rock Witchu tour, only playing in Los Angeles, Chicago, Toronto, and Kansas City.
In September 2009, LL Cool J released a song about the NCIS TV series. It is a single and is available on iTunes. The new track is based on his experiences playing special agent Sam Hanna. "This song is the musical interpretation of what I felt after meeting with NCIS agents, experienced Marines and Navy SEALs," LL Cool J said. "It represents the collective energy in the room. I was so inspired I wrote the song on set."[tpl]Cite news | author=Adam Bryant | title=VIDEO: Check out LL Cool J's New NCIS:LA-Inspired Song | url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/NCIS-Cool-J-1009723.aspx | work=TVGuide.com | date=September 16, 2010 | accessdate=September 16, 2010[/tpl]

I'm an Independent, you know?"[tpl]cite web|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1202/10/pmt.01.html |title=CNN.com - Transcripts |publisher=Transcripts.cnn.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-02[/tpl]  In LL Cool J's Platinum 360 Diet and Lifestyle, he included Barack Obama in a list of "People I admire" saying, "He accomplished what people thought was impossible."LL Cool J with Dave Honig, Chris Palmer & Jim Stoppani; LL Cool J's Platinum 360 Diet and Lifestyle: A Full-Circle Guide to Developing Your Mind, Body, and Soul, page 14, Rodale, 2010

==Legacy==

With the breakthrough success of his hit single "I Need a Beat" and the Radio LP, LL Cool J became one of the first hip-hop acts to achieve mainstream success along with Kurtis Blow and Run-D.M.C.. Gigs at larger venues were offered to LL as he would join the 1986-'87 Raising Hell tour, opening for Run-D.M.C. and the Beastie Boys. Another milestone of LL's popularity was his appearance on American Bandstand as the first hip hop act on the show.
The album's success also helped in contributing to Rick Rubin's credibility and repertoire as a record producer. Radio, along with Raising Hell (1986) and Licensed to Ill (1986), would form a trilogy of New York City-based, Rubin-helmed albums that helped to diversify hip-hop. Rubin's production credit on the back cover reads "REDUCED BY RICK RUBIN", referring to his minimalist production style, which gave the album its stripped-down and gritty sound. This style would serve as one of Rubin's production trademarks and would have a great impact on future hip-hop productions. Rubin's early hip hop production work, before his exit from Def Jam to Los Angeles, helped solidify his legacy as a hip hop pioneer and establish his reputation in the music industry.
Radio[tpl]'[/tpl]s release coincided with the growing new school scene and subculture, which also marked the beginning of hip-hop's "golden age" and the replacement of old school hip hop.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.warr.org/llcoolj.html#Radio |title=Wilson & Alroy's Record Reviews - Radio |publisher=© 2007 - 2008 Gridwerk |accessdate=2008-06-24[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/345049/LL-Cool-J |title=Encyclopedia - Britannica Online Encyclopedia ... Def Jam, LL, & new school hip hop |publisher=©2008 Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc |accessdate=2008-06-24[/tpl] This period of hip hop was marked by the end of the disco rap stylings of old school, which had flourished prior to the mid-80s, and the rise of a new style featuring "ghetto blasters". Radio served as one of the earliest records, along with Run-D.M.C.'s debut album, to combine the vocal approach of hip hop and rapping with the musical arrangements and riffing sound of rock music, pioneering the rap rock hybrid sound.Yahoo!

The emerging new school scene was initially characterized by drum machine-led minimalism, often tinged with elements of rock, as well as boasts about rapping delivered in an aggressive, self-assertive style. In image as in song, the artists projected a tough, cool, street b-boy attitude. These elements contrasted sharply with the 1970s P-Funk and disco-influenced outfits, live bands, synthesizers and party rhymes of acts prevalent in 1984, rendering them old school.Toop (2000), p. 126. In contrast to the lengthy, jam-like form predominant throughout early hip hop ("King Tim III", "Rapper's Delight", "The Breaks"), new school artists tended to compose shorter songs that would be more accessible and had potential for radio play, and conceive more cohesive LPs than their old school counterparts; the style typified by LL Cool J's Radio.Shapiro (2005), p. 228. A leading example of the new school sound is the song "I Can't Live Without My Radio", a loud, defiant declaration of public loyalty to his boom box, which The New York Times described as "quintessential rap in its directness, immediacy and assertion of self". It was featured in the film Krush Groove (1985), which was based on the rise of Def Jam and new school acts such as Run-D.M.C. and the Fat Boys.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.casenet.com/people/llcoolj.htm|title=CaseNet.com - LL Cool J|publisher=CaseNet|accessdate=2008-06-24 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071121204648/http://www.casenet.com/people/llcoolj.htm |archivedate = November 21, 2007[/tpl]
The energy and hardcore delivery and musical style of rapping featured on Radio, as well as other new school recordings by artists such as Run-D.M.C., Schooly D, T La Rock and Steady B, proved to be influential to hip hop acts of the "golden age" such as Boogie Down Productions and Public Enemy.Coleman (2007), p. 354. The decline of the old school form of hip hop also led to the closing of Sugar Hill Records, one of the labels that helped contribute to early hip-hop and that, coincidently, rejected LL's demo tape.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rapreviews.com/archive/BTTL_radio.html |title=LL Cool J :: Radio ** RapReviews "Back to the Lab" series ** by Steve "Flash" Juon |publisher=RapReviews.com; Flash Web Design Exclusive |accessdate=2008-06-19[/tpl] As the album served as an example of an expansion of hip hop music's artistic possibilities, its commercial success and distinct sound soon led to an increase in multi-racial audiences and listeners, adding to the legacy of the album and hip hop as well.
