</ref> Following national trends, Muni replaced most of its rail lines with trolleybus service in the succeeding decades. A few lines with dedicated rights-of-way (including those serving the [[Twin Peaks Tunnel|Twin Peaks]] and [[Sunset Tunnel|Sunset]] tunnels) continued as rail lines running 1940s-era [[PCC streetcar]]s through the 1970s. These lines became the foundation of the Muni Metro.

===1970s and '80s: Construction and reorganization===

In the 1950s and '60s, the neighboring BART system had been conceived on a grandiose level (described as one of the "great planning disasters" of the 20th century[tpl]cite book|last=Hall|first=Peter|title=Great Planning Disasters|year=1981|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0-14-081323-3[/tpl] ), operating express trains through San Francisco, and local service within San Francisco. Because it was assumed BART would provide local rail service, investment in Muni infrastructure failed to keep pace with major urban redevelopment projects. For example, BART was intended to provide Richmond district and Western Addition service as part of its Golden Gate Bridge/Marin line. This leaves a legacy of the inadequate 38-Geary bus serving these neighborhoods.
Construction on BART's Market street tunnel started in 1967,[tpl]cite web|title=BART – A History|url=http://www.bart.gov/about/history/history.aspx[/tpl] with two decks tracks – the upper intended to provide local service. Major cost overruns in the BART project forced the state legislature to rescue the project in 1969: curtailing local service in San Francisco and converting the partially constructed stations into the basis of a new light-rail subway called the Muni Metro to connect the downtown stations to the Twin Peaks Tunnel and continuing along reserved tracks to St. Francis Circle. Construction on the metro began in 1970, but the project suffered from further cuts and design changes throughout the 1970s. The Muni Metro finally opened in February 1980, for one line (N-Judah),[tpl]cite book|last=Perles|first=Anthony|title=The People's Railway: The History of the Municipal Railway of San Francisco|year=1981|publisher=Interurban Press|location=Glendale, CA (US)|isbn=0-916374-42-4|page=250[/tpl] with other lines following later in 1980, but the many design compromises and piecemeal planning led to long-term operational challenges and inefficiencies.
In 1970, Muni also suffered a severe diesel bus crisis.
Muni experienced a diesel bus availability crisis in 1981-2 when most of their diesel buses, 401 GMC and Flxible "New Looks" purchases in 1969, reached the end of their 12-year design life and funds for their replacement were not available. Most of the rest of the fleet were undersized 36-foot AM Generals purchased for neighborhood routes, and their use on heavier lines exacerbated conditions. The trolley bus fleet was in good order and had excess capacity at the time so Muni improvised a few temporary services with them to help out. One such service was a trolley 14-Limited that used the abandoned trolley overhead on South Van Ness. The diesel 82-Chinatown was replaced with short runs of the 30-Stockton. But the trolleys could only go where their wires went.
Muni adopted some policies to alleviate future service issues due to an aged fleet. They would stagger bus purchases so not as large a portion of the fleet would hit retirement age at once. They would arrange for mid-life rebuilds to keep the buses more serviceable in their final years.  And they would work to reduce the role of diesels in the total operation.  Three trunk diesel lines were converted to trolley bus service in the next twelve years.
But these efforts have not been as successful as hoped. Out of necessity most of the fleet, 330 standard bus equivalents out of 506, were replaced in just two years in 1985-6. (Standard bus equivalents factor the 30-foot and 60-foot into their equivalent capacity in 40-foot buses). And seven years passed without any new buses coming on board before Muni started its next full diesel fleet replacement cycle in 1999. This was fourteen years after the previous cycle instead of the twelve years that buses are designed to last. Muni is now aware that they must expect to keep diesel buses past their design life and have also found that funds granted for mid-life rebuilds require that the buses be kept longer still. As the fleet replacement cycle begins again in 2013, Muni has arranged for life-extending rebuilds of 142 buses, by count over 30% of the fleet.
In September 1982, the cable car system was shut down for 21 months for rebuilding, and there were massive line reorganizations as Muni restructured their route network to provide stronger cross-town services.
In 1983, Muni temporarily ran streetcars down Market Street as part of the San Francisco Historic Trolley Festival, initially conceived of as a substitute attraction for tourists during the one summer when no cable cars would be in operation.[tpl]cite book|last=Perles|first=Anthony|title=Tours of Discovery: A San Francisco Muni Album|year=1984|publisher=Interurban Press|isbn=0-916374-60-2|page=136[/tpl] The service became so popular that the festival was repeated for several years following.[tpl]cite paper|url=http://www.sfmta.com/cms/rhome/documents/TransitinSanFrancisco-CallwellChronologyweb.pdf |title=Transit in San Francisco: A Selected Chronology, 1850-1995 |publisher= |agency=San Francisco Municipal Railway |date=September 1999 |accessdate=2013-01-27 |author=Robert Callwell[/tpl] Anticipating the return of permanent streetcar service on Market Street, Muni began rehabilitating tracks in 1987, a process that culminated in the opening of the F line in 1995.
The first modern Muni shelter was installed in front of the War Memorial Opera House in 1987.

===1990s: the "Muni Meltdown"===

During the late 1990s, with aging equipment and poor management, Muni developed a reputation for poor and erratic service. In 1996 a group called Rescue Muni representing transit riders formed to organize concerns and press for change, advocating for the successful 1999 Proposition E that formed the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency and set service standards for Muni. In an effort to improve service, Muni began to replace its troublesome fleet of Boeing-Vertol light rail vehicles with newer Italian Breda light rail vehicles. In 1998, San Francisco residents witnessed a protracted malfunction of Muni Metro during the switch to automatic train control, culminating in an event that is known as the Muni Meltdown. The two-decade-old fleet of Flyer trolleybuses were replaced with Electric Transit, Inc. (ETI) trolleybuses in the early 2000s.Webb, Mary (ed.) (2009). Jane's Urban Transport Systems 2009–2010, p. 464.  Coulsdon, Surrey (UK): Jane's Information Group.  ISBN 978-0-7106-2903-6. Likewise, the diesel bus fleet saw an infusion of 45 new NABI buses from AC Transit in 1999.
Meanwhile, the F line was reintroduced in 1995 as a heritage streetcar service. Initially designed as a temporary tourist attraction to make up for the suspension of cable car service for rebuilding, the F has become a permanent fixture.

===2000s===

On October 8, 2007, SFMTA's cable car signs were awarded the AdWheel Award as the best in print promotion by the American Public Transportation Association. Nathaniel Ford, executive director of Muni, said that the "marketing group has done an outstanding job making the key boarding areas more attractive and inviting for residents and our guests."[ref]

On November 15, 2007, city officials announced that they were looking into the possibility of adding double-decker buses to the Muni fleet, which would be operating mostly on the 38 Geary and the 14 Mission routes. The test period started on December 12, 2007, and ended on January 8, 2008.[ref]

On December 1, 2007, Mayor Gavin Newsom announced that the entire city fleet, including all of Muni buses, are henceforth powered with biodiesel, a combination of 80% petroleum diesel fuel and 20% biofuel, to reduce carbon emissions. Muni's current hybrid bus fleet currently runs on biodiesel.[ref]

On July 17, 2009, a Muni LRV rear-ended another at West Portal Station. That accident injured 50 people.[ref]

On December 5, 2009, the Muni system underwent its most extensive changes in over 30 years, in an attempt by the SFMTA to reduce its budget shortfall.  This involved changes to over 60 percent of its bus and light rail routes, including the elimination of six bus routes.  Changes included reduced frequency of service, shortened or altered routes, and earlier termination of service, although a few of the busiest lines, such as the 38 Geary, saw service increases.

===2010s===

On February 26, 2010, the SFMTA board, which oversees Muni operations, voted for Muni to undergo further extensive changes in a further attempt to reduce its budget shortfall.
On July 1, 2012, Muni was the first transit agency in North America to implement all-door boarding throughout its system. Such practice already exists in the Muni Metro as Proof-of-Payment.

==System expansion==

Construction on a sixth light rail line from Caltrain Depot in Mission Bay to Visitacion Valley and Bayview/Hunters Point was completed in December 2006. The new line, named the T Third Street, consists of 19 new high-platform stations at street-level, including at least one within walking distance of Candlestick Park.[ref]

A further underground expansion for the T line is under construction. Dubbed the Central Subway, four new underground stations at Moscone Center, Market and Stockton Streets, Union Square, and Chinatown are being built with a target opening date of 2018.  Construction will include tunneling up to Columbus Ave and Washington Square Park but the T line will stop at Chinatown. A future extension into North Beach and Fisherman's Wharf or to the Marina District and The Presidio may be built in a third phase. This project is expected to cost about $1.4 billion.[ref]
