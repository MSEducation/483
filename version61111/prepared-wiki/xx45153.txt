Founded in 1948, Zengakuren is a communist/anarchist league of students in Japan.  The word [tpl]nihongo|Zengakuren|全学連[/tpl] is an abridgement of [tpl]nihongo|Zen Nihon Gakusei Jichikai Sō Rengō |全日本学生自治会総連合[/tpl] which literally means “All-Japan League of Student Self-Government.”  Notable for organizing protests and marches, Zengakuren has been involved in Japan’s Anti-Red Purge Movement, the Peace Treaty Movement, and opposition to the Korean War in its first stage.

==History==

Although the association was formally organized on September 18, 1948, political movements among Japanese college students can be traced back to much earlier times.Shimbori, Michiya.  Zengakuren: A Japanese Case Study of a Student Political Movement. Printed in: Sociology of Education, Vol. 37, No. 3, Spring, 1964 http://www.jstor.org/pss/2111956  While most writers recognize that the student political movement began hand in hand with the spreading labor movement after the First World War,E.g., T. Kikukawa, Gakusei Shakai Undo Shi (The History of Student Social Movements)  Tokyo: Chuokoron-sha, 1931 some writers say that this movement is as old as Japanese higher institutions.
In 1960, the league became divided after activities concerning the revision of the Japan-US Security Treaty.  Five separate organizations emerged under the name Zengakuren, the most famous being the Sagadaigaku Gakusei Jitikai Ren.
Throughout the 1960s, Zengakuren organizations held protests against the U.S. invasion of Vietnam.  In one notable case, U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower had planned to visit Japan during a 1960 tour of Asia, but so many Zengakuren turned out to protest at the airport that he decided not to land.Kurlansky, Mark.  1968: The Year that Rocked the World.  New York: Random House, 2004.
The Zengakuren are discussed by French philosopher Roland Barthes in L’empire des Signes (Empire of Signs) in a section entitled ‘The Writing of Violence.’  Barthes explains:
 In our western mythology, violence is caught up in the same prejudice as literature or art: we can attribute to it no other function than that of expressing a content, an inwardness, a nature, of which it is the primary, savage, asystematic language...Barthes, Roland. L’empire des Signes. (“Empire of Signs”). 1970.  
But in contrast, according to Barthes, the violence of the Zengakuren 'is immediately a sign': expressing nothing'.Barthes, Roland. L’empire des Signes. (“Empire of Signs”). 1970. This violence is intransitive, concerned with creating 'a great scenario of signs', and exhausting itself in its immediate expression.Barthes, Roland. L’empire des Signes. (“Empire of Signs”). 1970.
In 2010 and 2011, Zengakuren groups organized massive rallies and peaceful protests in major cities in Japan.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]
