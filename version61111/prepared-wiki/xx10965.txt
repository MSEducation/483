Spindletop is a salt dome oil field located in the southern portion of Beaumont, Texas in the United States. The Spindletop dome was derived from the Louann Salt evaporite layer of the Jurassic geologic period.Hyne, Norman J., Nontechnical guide to petroleum geology, exploration, drilling, and production, Pennwell Books, 2nd ed. p. 193 ISBN 978-0-87814-823-3 On January 10, 1901, a well at Spindletop struck oil ("came in"). The new oil field soon produced more than [tpl]convert|100000|oilbbl|m3[/tpl] of oil per day.[tpl]Handbook of Texas | name=Spindletop Oilfield | id=SS/dos3 | author=Wooster, Robert; Sanders, Christine Moor | retrieved=October 18, 2009[/tpl], Texas State Historical Association Gulf Oil and Texaco, now part of Chevron Corporation, were formed to develop production at Spindletop.Daniel Yergin, The Prize, New York: Simon & Schuster, 1991, pp.75–78.
The strike at Spindletop represented a turning point for Texas and the United States; no oil field in the world had ever been so productive. The frenzy of oil exploration and the economic development it generated in the state became known as the Texas Oil Boom. The United States soon became the world's leading oil producer.

==History==

There had long been suspicions that oil might be under "Spindletop Hill." The area was known for its vast sulfur springs and bubbling gas seepages that would ignite if lit. In August 1892, George W. O'Brien, George W. Carroll, Pattillo Higgins and others formed the Gladys City Oil, Gas, and Manufacturing Company to do exploratory drilling on Spindletop Hill. The company drilled many dry holes and ran into trouble, as investors began to balk at pouring more money into drilling with no oil to show for it.
Pattillo Higgins left the company and teamed with Captain Anthony F. Lucas, the leading expert in the U.S. on salt dome formations. Lucas made a lease agreement in 1899 with the Gladys City Company and a subsequent agreement with Higgins. Lucas drilled to [tpl]Convert|575|ft|m|-1[/tpl] before running out of money. He secured additional funding from John H. Galey and James M. Guffey of Pittsburgh, but the deal left Lucas with only a small share of the lease and Higgins with nothing.Daniel Yergin, The Prize, New York: Simon & Schuster, 1991, p.75.  
Lucas continued drilling and on January 10, 1901, at a depth of 1,139 ft (347 m), what is known as the Lucas Gusher or the Lucas Geyser blew oil over [tpl]convert|150|ft|m|-1[/tpl] in the air at a rate of [tpl]convert|100000|oilbbl/d|m3/d[/tpl](4,200,000 gallons).  It took nine days before the well was brought under control. Spindletop was the largest gusher the world had seen and catapulted Beaumont into an oil-fueled boomtown.  Beaumont's population of 10,000 tripled in three months and eventually rose to 50,000.Daniel Yergin, The Prize, New York: Simon & Schuster, 1991, p.69.  Speculation led land prices to increase rapidly. By the end of 1902, more than 500 companies had been formed and 285 wells were in operation.
Spindletop was the first oil field found on the US Gulf Coast, and prompted further drilling, and further oil field discoveries. Oil drillers looking for another Spindletop particularly sought out other salt domes, and were often successful. The Gulf Coast turned into a major oil region.
Standard Oil, which then had a monopoly or near-monopoly on the petroleum industry in the eastern states, was prevented from moving aggressively into the new oil field by state antitrust laws. Populist sentiment against Standard Oil was particularly strong at the time of the Spindletop discovery. In 1900, an oil products marketing company affiliated with Standard Oil had been banned from the state for its cutthroat business practices. Although Standard built refineries in the area, Standard was unable to dominate the new Gulf Coast oil fields the way it had in the eastern states.  As a result, a number of startup oil companies at Spindletop, such as Texaco and Gulf Oil, grew into formidable competitors to Standard Oil.Ron Chernow, Titan: the Life of John D. Rockefeller {New York: Random House, 1998} 431. 
Among those drilling at Spindletop was W. Scott Heywood, a native of Cleveland, Ohio, who in 1901 made the first oil discovery in nearby Jeff Davis Parish in southwestern Louisiana. In 1932, Heywood was elected to a single term in the Louisiana State Senate.
Production at Spindletop began to decline rapidly after 1902, and the wells produced only [tpl]convert|10000|oilbbl/d|m3/d[/tpl] by 1904.  On November 14, 1925,  the Yount-Lee Oil Company brought in its McFaddin No. 2 at a depth of about [tpl]convert|2500|ft|m|-2[/tpl], sparking a second boom, which culminated in the field's peak production year of 1927, during which 21 millions barrels (3.3 GL) were produced.  Over the ten years following the McFaddin discovery, more than 72 million barrels (11.4 GL) of oil were produced, mostly from the newer areas of the field.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2009[/tpl] Spindletop continued as a productive source of oil until about 1936.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2009[/tpl]  It was then mined for sulfur from the 1950s to about 1975.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2009[/tpl]

==Spindletop-Gladys City Boomtown Museum==

In 1976 Lamar University dedicated the Spindletop-Gladys City Boomtown Museum to preserve the history of the Spindletop oil gusher era in Beaumont. The museum features an oil derrick and many reconstructed Gladys City building interiors furnished with authentic artifacts from the Spindletop boomtown period.http://www.spindletop.org/tour/index.html
The Lucas Gusher Monument is located at the museum. The Monument, erected at the wellhead in July, 1941, was moved to the Spindletop-Gladys City Museum after it became unstable due to ground subsidence.  According to an article by Nedra Foster, LS in the July/August, 2000 issue of the Professional Surveyor Magazine, the Monument was originally located within four feet of the actual site of the Spindletop well. http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=616
Today a flag pole flying a Texas flag marks the location of the wellhead, at Spindletop Park, about 1.5 miles southwest of the museum, off West Port Arthur Road/Spur 93.  There is a viewing platform with information placards there, about a quarter mile from the flagpole, which is in the middle of swampland on private land and not accessible.  Directions to the site are available at the museum.
On December 4, 1955, the Spindletop story was dramatized in "Spindletop - The First Great Texas Oil Strike (January 10, 1901)" on the CBS history series, You Are There. Robert Bray was cast as Pattillo Higgins; Mike Ragan as Marion Fletcher; Parley Baer as Captain Lucas, Jean Byron as Caroline Lucas, DeForest Kelley as Al Hammill, Tyler McVey as Mayor Wheat, and William Fawcett as a farmer.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0751910/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_96|title=Spindletop - The First Great Texas Oil Strike (January 10, 1901)(4 Dec. 1955), You Are There|publisher=Internet Movie Data Base|accessdate=April 20, 2014[/tpl]
