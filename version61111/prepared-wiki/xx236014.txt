[[Fallon National Wildlife Refuge]]

Fallon National Wildlife Refuge was established in 1931 as a refuge and breeding ground for birds and wild animals. It is located in the Lahontan Valley of western Nevada, at the terminus of the Carson River. The refuge comprises over [tpl]convert|15000|acre[/tpl] of playa and wetland habitat in the Carson Sink.
In years of high water flows down the Carson River, the refuge is important for migratory shorebirds and waterfowl. However, due to diversions, in most years there is insufficient water flow down the Carson River for the water to enter the refuge.
The refuge is open 7 days a week, 24 hours a day, but there are no facilities on the refuge. Roads are primitive and passable only during those periods of dry weather.
