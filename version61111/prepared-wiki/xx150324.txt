==Community involvement==

===Unite El Paso===

In 1992, Senator Shapleigh joined with hundreds of other progressive El Paso civic leaders to found Unite El Paso.  This group of emerging leaders wanted to improve the per capita income in El Paso and create a viable economic model for future growth.  From the 1950s, when El Paso’s per capita income levels were 20 percent higher than the Texas average, El Paso's per capita income level began a steep decline.  By 2000, levels had fallen to 30 percent below the state average.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.elpasoinc.com/showArticle.asp?articleId=274 | title = Hunt: 'What happened, what we need to do' | accessdate = 2009-07-15 | publisher = El Paso Inc.[/tpl]
Unite El Paso successfully identified major new initiatives to reverse this decline and create a consensus vision for a new, more prosperous El Paso.  To launch that vision as one of several initiatives, the group defined a goal of a new four-year medical school as the anchor of a Medical Center of the Americas.

===Court of Inquiry===

In 1994, Senator Shapleigh, at the request of Judge Edward Marquez of the 65th District Court, was sworn in as an ad litem for the El Paso Court of Inquiry.  Several prominent El Paso lawyers joined Judge Marquez to investigate whether the constitutional rights of the citizens of El Paso had been denied due to historically inadequate funding in the areas of transportation, mental health, and nutrition.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/10/us/judge-is-out-to-jail-any-budget-makers-who-shortchange-el-paso-in-texas-capital.html | title = Judge Is Out to Jail Any Budget Makers Who Shortchange El Paso in Texas Capital | accessdate = 2009-07-15 | publisher = The New York Times | date=1994-06-10[/tpl]  Judge Marquez later issued an historic and groundbreaking report that identified significant disparities in funding that had an impact on border economic and educational outcomes.  Among the several findings in the report, some later became important statewide issues, including state highway funding.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.elpasomobility.org/documents/news/20070325ElPasoTimesHwyFunding.pdf  | title = Court case improved EP road funding | accessdate = 2009-07-15 | publisher = El Paso Times[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]  In 1999, then Texas Comptroller John Sharp issued a report outlining the various inequities faced by Texas border communities when compared to the rest of the state.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.window.state.tx.us/border/border.html  | title = Bordering the Future | accessdate = 2009-07-15 | publisher = Texas Comptroller John Sharp[/tpl]

===El Paso Economic Summit===

As a result of the Unite El Paso movement, Senator Shapleigh organized the 1998 El Paso Economic Summit, along with civic leaders such as Woody Hunt, UTEP President Diana Natalicio, and Mayor Carlos Ramirez.  Hundreds assembled at UTEP to describe a communitywide effort to build capacity for higher wage jobs in El Paso.  At that gathering, the number one goal for El Paso's future was identified as establishing a four-year medical school as the anchor of a joint institution Medical Center of the Americas.
Soon thereafter, Senator Shapleigh, County Attorney José Rodriguez, Woody Hunt, Robert Brown, John Montford, and others joined in discussions about how best to establish the medical school and which institution should carry the mission forward.  As a result, the Texas Tech University System Board of Regents made establishing a four-year medical school in El Paso an important goal of the System.  Over the coming legislative sessions, incremental progress was made in establishing the state's ninth medical school and first since 1977.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.dallasfed.org/research/swe/2008/swe0804d.cfm | title = Spotlight: El Paso Medical School | accessdate = 2009-07-09 | publisher = Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas[/tpl]  In 2009, the first new medical students at El Paso's medical school began their studies at the campus.  The El Paso Medical School was the first new medical school to be established in the U.S. in 30 years.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.lubbockonline.com/stories/020409/hea_384515840.shtml | title = Tech's El Paso medical school accepts first class | accessdate = 2009-08-14 | publisher = Lubbock Avalanche-Journal[/tpl]  The school also is the only four-year medical school on the United States/Mexico border.

===Community Scholars===

===The Texas Eleven===

Senator Shapleigh was one of the Texas Eleven, a group of Democratic Texas State Senators who broke quorum and removed to New Mexico for 46 days in 2003 in a quorum-busting effort aimed at preventing the passage of controversial re-redistricting legislation, spearheaded by then Congressional House Majority leader Tom DeLay, that would have benefited Texas Republicans.
Eventually the Texas Eleven was vindicated by the United States Supreme Court through its rulings that the re-districting could be considered gerrymandering and did bear unconstitutional elements.

===ASARCO===

Senator Shapleigh led the opposition to the reopening of an ASARCO-operated copper smelter located near downtown El Paso since 1887.  The smelter, which had been shut down in 1999 due to low copper prices, filed to renew their air permit application with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality in 2002.  Joined by leaders[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.newspapertree.com/news/3415-asarco-announcement-el-paso-smelter-will-not-reopen | title = Asarco announcement: El Paso smelter will not reopen | accessdate = 2009-07-09 | publisher = Newspaper Tree[/tpl] from across the three-state, two-nation region, Senator Shapleigh and hundreds of activists from El Paso, Juarez, and New Mexico placed enormous pressure on the corporation to justify putting over 7,000 tons of new pollutants into El Paso's air.  After eight years, the TCEQ Commissioners granted the permit on a 3-0 vote.  The Environmental Protection Agency soon intervened, however, citing deficiencies with the permitting process and ASARCO's air control equipment.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.newspapertree.com/news/3416-epa-letters-to-asarco-tceq-assert-aged-equipment-and-possible-enforcement-actions | title = EPA letters to Asarco, TCEQ, assert aged equipment and possible enforcement actions | accessdate = 2009-07-09 | publisher = Newspaper Tree[/tpl]  As a result, ASARCO announced that the El Paso smelter would not reopen.  As of July 2009, it appears the smelter property will be placed in an environmental remediation trust so that it may be cleaned up using funding obtained via ASARCO's bankruptcy.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.newspapertree.com/news/3598-asarco-feds-and-state-propose-52-million-cleanup-agreement-for-el-paso-and-amarillo | title = Asarco, feds and state propose $52 million cleanup agreement for El Paso and Amarillo | accessdate = 2009-07-09 | publisher = Newspaper Tree[/tpl]
