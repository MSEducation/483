[[Elegant variation]]

CATEGORIES: Language varieties and styles

Elegant variation is a term coined by Henry Watson Fowler (1858–1933). It refers to the unnecessary use of synonyms to denote a single thing. In his Dictionary of Modern English Usage (first edition, 1926), Fowler wrote:

In the 1920s, when Fowler coined the term "elegant variation," the word elegant had a pejorative connotation of “precious over-refinement”. In Garner's Modern American Usage, Bryan Garner unambiguously recast the term as "inelegant variation."[tpl]cite book |last=Garner |first=Bryan A. |edition=3rd |date=2009 |title=Garner's Modern American Usage |page=298 |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-538275-4[/tpl]
Elegant variation is very common in modern journalism, where, for example, a "fire" often becomes a "blaze" or a "conflagration" with no clear justification. It is considered particularly problematic in legal, scientific, and technical writing, where the avoidance of ambiguity is essential.
Elegant variation in poetry may occur because of a poet’s need to use a word which fits the scansion and rhyme pattern of the poem.

==Examples==

In The King's English (1906), Fowler gives as an example this passage from The Times:
[tpl]Quotation|The Emperor received yesterday and to-day General Baron von Beck ... It may therefore be assumed with some confidence that the terms of a feasible solution are maturing themselves in His Majesty's mind and may form the basis of further negotiations with Hungarian party leaders when the Monarch goes again to Budapest.[tpl]cite book |last1=Fowler |first1=H.W. |last2=Fowler |first2=F.G. |title=The King's English |edition=3rd |year=1931 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=London |isbn=0-19-869105 X |page=187[/tpl][/tpl]
Fowler objected to the passage because The Emperor, His Majesty, and the Monarch all refer to the same person: "The effect," he pointed out in A Dictionary of Modern English Usage (first edition, p.131, col. 2), "is to set readers wondering what the significance of the change is, only to conclude disappointedly that it has none."

==In other languages==

Whereas in  English elegant variation is considered a stylistic error, in other languages it might be considered good writing style (e.g., in French,[ref]
