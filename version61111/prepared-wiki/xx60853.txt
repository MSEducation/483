==Wisconsin Senate==

In 1982, he was elected to the Wisconsin Senate, where he served for ten years until his election to the United States Senate. In 1987, he joined the "Bowtie Brigade," a coalition of grassroots activists and local-level politicians who backed the presidential candidacy of bowtie-clad Senator Paul Simon of Illinois. After he was elected to the United States Senate, Feingold was succeeded in the State Senate by Joseph Wineke.http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/WI/WI-idx?type=goto&id=WI.WIBlueBk1985&isize=M&submit=Go+to+page&page=75

===Committee assignments===

==Political positions==

Feingold's primary legislative focus has been on campaign finance reform; fair trade policies; healthcare reform; conservation and environmental protection; a multilateral foreign policy; Social Security; and the elimination of capital punishment and wasteful spending. He was also "a staunch supporter of civil liberties."Good, Chris (2011-02-15) Rand Paul vs. the PATRIOT Act, The Atlantic
Feingold was the only Democratic senator to vote against a motion to dismiss Congress's 1998–1999 impeachment case of President Bill Clinton. In a statement, Feingold said House prosecutors must have "every reasonable opportunity" to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Clinton should be removed from office on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2012[/tpl] Feingold ultimately voted against conviction on all charges.
Feingold opposed NAFTA and other free trade agreements – a popular position among many pro-fair trade Democrats – but at odds with the pro-free trade Democratic wing, including the Democratic Leadership Council.[tpl]cn|date=June 2013[/tpl]
In 2001, Feingold was the only Senator to vote against the Patriot Act (H.R. 3162).[tpl]cite|url=http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=107&session=1&vote=00313|title=U.S. Senate Roll Call Votes 107th Congress - 1st Session[/tpl] Also in 2001, Feingold voted for the confirmation of Attorney General John Ashcroft.

Alabama Governor Bob Riley and Greenville Mayor Dexter McLendon, both Republicans, were perturbed at Feingold's description of "check-cashing stores and abject trailer parks, and some of the hardest-used cars for sale on a very rundown lot." McLendon invited Feingold back for a more complete tour of the city, and Feingold agreed. He visited the city on March 28, 2005, making amends and increasing speculation about his presidential plans for 2008.[tpl]cite news|last=Gilbert|first=Craig|title=Feingold in Dixie on mission of diplomacy|publisher=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=March 29, 2005 |url= http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=313522|accessdate=June 6, 2007 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060820171046/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=313522 |archivedate= August 20, 2006[/tpl]

===Campaign finance reform===

Feingold is perhaps best known for his work alongside Senator John McCain on the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 – better-known as the McCain-Feingold Act – which took almost seven years to pass.
On July 14, 2005, Feingold introduced a bill in the Senate that would ban lobbyists from giving gifts to senators and impose a $50,000 fine for violating the ban; force lawmakers to sign statements saying that lobbyists did not pay their travel expenses; forbid lawmakers from traveling on corporate jets; bar congressmen, staffers, and executive branch officials from serving as lobbyists for two years after leaving office; and require that lobbying reports be disclosed on a quarterly, rather than semi-annual, basis.[tpl]cite web|last=|first=|title=Feingold Introduces Lobbying and Ethics Reform Bill |url=http://feingold.senate.gov/~feingold/releases/05/07/2005714641.html|date=July 14, 2005 |accessdate= August 27, 2007|archivedate=January 2, 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vRJXFVbg[/tpl] The bill is the Senate version of a bill by Congressman Marty Meehan (D-MA), who co-wrote the House version of McCain-Feingold, and Rahm Emanuel (D-IL). Neither version came to a vote. The Feingold-McCain bill was initially waiting completion of McCain hearings on the issue, but the Jack Abramoff scandal put it in the spotlight, along with several other more recent reform proposals.

===Government spending===

Feingold is also a well-known advocate for reductions in pork barrel spending and corporate welfare. Citizens Against Government Waste, the Concord Coalition, and Taxpayers for Common Sense – three nonpartisan organizations dedicated to those causes – have repeatedly commended him.Russ Feingold for United States Senate - Issues
Feingold was elected to Congress on a promise not to accept pay raises while in office, and has so far returned over $70,000 in such raises to the U.S. Treasury.Russell Feingold on Principles & Values In addition, he is notoriously frugal in his office's spending, and sends back the money that he does not use. In one six-month period in 1999, for example, his office received $1.787 million in appropriations and returned $145,000, a higher percentage than any other senator's office.[tpl]cite news|last=Marlin|first=Adam S.|title=Russ Feingold: Mr. Good Government|publisher=VOTE.com|url= http://www.vote.com/magazine/editorials/editorial3489430.phtml |accessdate=June 6, 2007[/tpl] Since becoming a Senator in 1993, Feingold has returned to the U.S. Treasury $3.2 million from his office budget.[tpl]cite web|url=http://feingold.senate.gov/deficit/history.html|title=A Record of Deficit Reduction, a Commitment to Fiscal Responsibility |archivedate= January 2, 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vRJZ8L7x[/tpl]

===USA PATRIOT Act===

Feingold was the only senator to vote against the USA PATRIOT Act when first voted on in 2001.[tpl]cite web|title=U.S. Senate Roll Call Votes 107th Congress — 1st Session|publisher=U.S. Senate|url= http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=107&session=1&vote=00313|accessdate=June 6, 2007[/tpl] At the time, Feingold stated that provisions in the act infringed upon citizens' civil liberties.[tpl]cite web|last=Feingold|first=Russ|title=Russell Feingold — On Opposing The U.S.A. Patriot Act|publisher=Archipelago|date=October 12, 2001|url= http://www.archipelago.org/vol6-2/feingold.htm|accessdate=June 6, 2007[/tpl]
When the bill was up for renewal in late December 2005, Feingold led a bipartisan coalition of senators – including Lisa Murkowski, Ken Salazar, Larry Craig, Dick Durbin, and John Sununu  – to remove some of the Act's more controversial provisions. He led a successful filibuster against renewal of the act. This ultimately led to a compromise on some of its provisions. This compromise bill passed the Senate on March 2, 2006, by a vote of 89-10. Feingold was among the ten senators who voted nay, stating that the bill still lacked necessary protections for some civil liberties.
In 2009, when the Act was again up for re-authorization, Feingold introduced the JUSTICE Act (S. 1686) "To place reasonable safeguards on the use of surveillance and other authorities under the USA PATRIOT Act."[tpl]cite web|author=|title= S. 1686|url= http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s111-1686 |work=|publisher= govtrack.us|date=|accessdate=October 8, 2009[/tpl] Senator Patrick Leahy then introduced an alternative bill, about which Feingold later said "...while narrower than the JUSTICE Act that Senator Durbin and I have championed, it did contain several important and necessary protections for the privacy of innocent Americans." After what Feingold saw as the further watering down of civil liberty protections in the bill, it passed out of the Senate Judiciary Committee on October 8 on a vote of 11-8[tpl]cite web|author= Bankston, Kevin|title= Obama Sides with Republicans; PATRIOT Act Renewal Bill Passes Senate Judiciary Committee Minus Critical Civil Liberties Reforms|url= http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2009/10/obama-sides-republicans-patriot-act-renewal-bill-p|work=|publisher= Electronic Frontier Foundation|date=|accessdate=October 8, 2009[/tpl] with Feingold voting against it.[tpl]cite web|author= Feingold, Russ|title= It's Not the Prosecutors' Committee, it's the Judiciary Committee|url= http://www.dailykos.com/story/2009/10/8/791144/-Its-Not-the-Prosecutors-Committee,-its-the-Judiciary-Committee|work=|publisher= Daily Kos|date=|accessdate=October 8, 2009[/tpl]

===Proposed constitutional amendment===

Feingold announced in January 2009 that he was planning to introduce a constitutional amendment which would prohibit governors from making temporary Senate appointments instead of holding special elections. Feingold referred to recent controversies, most notably the Rod Blagojevich corruption charges and also called appointments an anachronism, which doesn't reflect the will of voters.[ref]Feingold Wants to End Senate Appointments

===War in Iraq===

Feingold was one of 23 US senators to vote against H.J. Resolution 114, which authorized President George W. Bush to use force against Iraq in 2002.[tpl]cite web|title=U.S. Senate Roll Call Votes 107th Congress — 2nd Session|publisher=U.S. Senate|url= http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=107&session=2&vote=00237 |accessdate= January 4, 2011[/tpl]
On August 17, 2005, he became the first senator to call for the withdrawal of troops from Iraq and urge that a timetable for that withdrawal be set. He called other Democrats "timid" for refusing to take action sooner, and suggested December 31, 2006, as the date for total withdrawal of troops. On the subject of Bush's assertion that a deadline would be helpful to Iraqi insurgents, Feingold said, "I think he's wrong. I think not talking about endgames is playing into our enemies' hand."
On April 27, 2006, Feingold announced that he would move to amend an appropriations bill granting $106.5 billion in emergency spending measure for Iraq and Hurricane Katrina relief to require that troops withdraw completely from Iraq.[tpl]cite news|last=Hulse|first=Carl|title=Tough road ahead on Iraq funding|publisher=San Jose Mercury News|date=April 27, 2007|url= http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_5762762|accessdate=June 6, 2007[/tpl]

===Call for a vote of censure===

On March 14, 2006, Feingold introduced a resolution in the Senate to censure President Bush.[tpl]cite web|title=Relating to the censure of George W. Bush.

Feingold made a 25-minute speech on the Senate Floor, declaring that Congress must "hold the president accountable for his actions". It received support from Senators Tom Harkin of Iowa and Barbara Boxer of California, although most Democratic senators avoided expressing an opinion on it. Senators John Kerry of Massachusetts and Patrick Leahy of Vermont expressed support for the bill, but Feingold was able to find only three co-sponsors.
Feingold again called for Bush's censure in July 2007 for his management of the Iraq war, accusing him of mounting an "assault" against the United States Constitution.Sen. Feingold proposes censuring Bush

===Health care reform===

Feingold has long been an advocate for creating a system of universal health care in America. During his first run for the Senate, he endorsed the single-payer model, similar to that used by Canada. Once elected, he opposed the Clinton health care plan, saying that it did too much for the insurance industry and not enough for the uninsured. During the Bush administration, he opposed the enactment of Medicare Part D and authored a bill to require the Senate leadership to submit health care reform bills.Russ Feingold for United States Senate - Issues
On July 24, 2006, at a press conference at the Martin Luther King Heritage Health Center in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Feingold announced that he had authored the State-Based Health Care Reform Act, a bill to create a pilot program for a system of universal healthcare under which each U.S. state would create a program to provide its citizenry with universal health insurance, and the federal government would provide the funding. The bill would create a non-partisan "Health Care Reform Task Force," which would provide five-year federal grants to two or three states. The program is expected to cost $32 billion over 10 years.[tpl]cite news |last=Schmid |first=John|title=Feingold would give states sway over health care|publisher=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=July 24, 2006|url= http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=475836 |accessdate= June 6, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060823221828/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=475836|archivedate=August 23, 2006[/tpl]
Feingold voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act which passed the Senate on December 24, 2009.

===Gun issues===

Feingold has a mixed record on gun rights and gun control issues, voting in favor of certain gun-control legislation, while also voting to expand certain gun rights. On February 24, 2004, he voted against S.1805, a bill that would have extended the Federal ban on semi-automatic firearms.[tpl]cite web|last=|first=|title= S. 1805, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act|url=http://democrats.senate.gov/dpc/dpc-new.cfm?doc_name=lb-108-2-49|accessdate=August 27, 2007|postscript= |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070726020526/http://democrats.senate.gov/dpc/dpc-new.cfm?doc_name=lb-108-2-49|archivedate=July 26, 2007[/tpl] In 2002, he voted for allowing airline pilots to carry firearms in cockpits.[tpl]Cite document |title=Senate votes to let pilots carry firearms|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3827/is_200209/ai_n9131759 |accessdate=August 27, 2007|publisher= FindArticles|postscript= [/tpl] He has spoken in support of the interpretation that the Second Amendment pertains to an individual right to own firearms, and in opposition to proposals for handgun bans and mandatory firearms registration. Recently Feingold took this position when he sided with the conservative majority of the Senate and signed the Congressional amicus in District of Columbia v. Heller.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2008[/tpl]
On the other hand, he has consistently voted in favor of bills to require background checks for firearms purchases at gun shows, and to require that handguns be sold with trigger locks.
In March 2004, he explained his position in a speech on the Senate floor:
[tpl]cquote|I have never accepted the proposition that the gun debate is a black and white issue, a matter of 'you're with us, or you're against us.' Instead, I have followed what I believe is a moderate course, faithful to the Constitution and to the realities of modern society. I believe that the Second Amendment was not an afterthought, that it has meaning today and must be respected. I support the right to bear arms for lawful purposes — for hunting and sport and for self-protection. Millions of Americans own firearms legally and we should not take action that tells them that they are second-class citizens or that their constitutional rights are under attack. At the same time, there are actions we can and should take to protect public safety that do not infringe on constitutional rights.[tpl]cite web|title=Statement of U.S. Senator Russ Feingold on the Gun Manufacturers Liability Bill|date=March 2, 2004|url= http://www.senate.gov/~feingold/speeches/04/03/2004310624.html|accessdate=June 6, 2007[/tpl][/tpl]

===Reproductive rights===

Feingold co-sponsored a bill protecting the reproductive rights of women. He also co-sponsored a bill providing emergency contraception at military facilities.  He signed a letter from 58 Senators to President George W. Bush urging expanding embryonic stem cell research. He voted against restricting United Nations funding for population control policies, against defining an unborn child as eligible for SCHIP, against prohibiting minors crossing state lines for abortion, against barring Health and Human Services grants to organizations that perform abortions, against notifying parents of minors who get out-of-state abortions, against criminal penalties for harming an unborn fetus during another crime, against banning partial birth abortions except for maternal life, and against banning human cloning. He voted for $100 million to reduce teen pregnancy by education and contraceptives. He supports federal funding of abortions.Russell Feingold on Abortion

===Same-sex marriage===

On April 4, 2006, Feingold told constituents at a listening session in Kenosha, Wisconsin, that he supported the legalization of same-sex marriage. Though Feingold had once voted against passage of the Defense of Marriage Act, this was the first time that he publicly announced his support for marriage rights for same-sex couples. Feingold's comments were in response to a question about whether he supported a ballot initiative that Wisconsinites voted on in November 2006 that incorporated a ban on same-sex marriage and all civil unions (same-sex or not) into the state constitution.[tpl]cite web|url=http://milwaukee.about.com/od/electionsandpolitics/i/civilunionsban.htm|title=Milwaukee - By Category|publisher=Milwaukee.about.com|date=April 19, 2010|accessdate=July 12, 2010[/tpl] He joined then-Republican Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island and Democrats Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, Ron Wyden of Oregon, and Mark Dayton of Minnesota as one of only five senators to publicly announce their support for same-sex marriage.

On May 18, 2006, Feingold again made news with his stance on marriage when he walked out of a meeting of the Senate Judiciary Committee shortly before a vote on a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage. After Feingold objected to both the amendment and decision of Chairman Arlen Specter (R-PA at the time) to move the meeting to an area of the Capitol Building not open to the public, Specter told Feingold, "I don't need to be lectured by you. You are no more a protector of the Constitution than am I. If you want to leave, good riddance." Feingold then replied, "I've enjoyed your lecture, too, Mr. Chairman. See ya."

==Political campaigns==

===1992 U.S. Senate===

Feingold's senatorial career began in 1992, with a victory over incumbent Republican Senator Bob Kasten. Feingold, who had little name recognition in the state and was campaigning in a primary against a pair of millionaire opponents – Congressman Jim Moody and businessman Joe Checota – adopted several proposals to gain the electorate's attention. The most memorable of these was a series of five promises written on Feingold's garage door in the form of a contract.[tpl]cite web|title=Promises Made, Promises Kept|url=http://www.russfeingold.org/promiseskept.php |accessdate=June 6, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061229095747/http://www.russfeingold.org/promiseskept.php|archivedate=December 29, 2006[/tpl] These were:
Also noted was Feingold's advertising campaign, which was widely compared to that used by progressive candidate Paul Wellstone in his victorious Senate campaign in Minnesota. Shot in the form of home movies, the ads attempted to portray Feingold, who always referred to himself as "the underdog running for U.S. senate," as a down-to-earth, Capra-esque figure, taking the audience on a guided tour of the candidate's home and introducing them to his children, all of whom were enrolled in public school.[tpl]cite web|title=Russ Feingold for United States Senate Multimedia|url= http://www.russfeingold.org/multimedia.php#vintage|accessdate=June 5, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061229095811/http://www.russfeingold.org/multimedia.php#vintage|archivedate=December 29, 2006[/tpl]
The ads also contained a significant amount of humor. One featured Feingold meeting with an Elvis Presley impersonator, who offered Feingold his endorsement.[tpl]cite news|title=Wisconsin Senate: The Candidates|publisher=Washington Post|url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/campaigns/keyraces98/wisen/candidates.htm|accessdate=June 5, 2007|date=September 9, 1998[/tpl] (Bob Kasten responded to the Elvis endorsement with an advertisement featuring an Elvis impersonator attacking Feingold's record.[tpl]cite news|last=Marcus|first=Greil|title=The Elvis Test|work=San Francisco Examiner|publisher=Eye Candy Promotions|date=January 17, 1993|url= http://eyecandypromo.com/GM/Elvistest.html|accessdate=June 6, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070405205820/http://eyecandypromo.com/GM/Elvistest.html |archivedate=April 5, 2007[/tpl]) Another showed Feingold standing next to a pair of half-sized cardboard cut-outs of his opponents, refusing to "stoop to their level" as the two were shown literally slinging mud at one another.
During the primary campaign, Feingold unveiled an 82-point plan that aimed to eliminate the deficit by the end of his first term.[tpl]cite news |last=Odegard |first=Sue |title=Feingold tackles health care, capital punishment, COPS grants at River Falls Listening Session |publisher=River Falls Journal|year=1999|url= http://rivertowns.net/news1999/rfjrival/week46/frontpage/np/LOCAB06.HTM|accessdate=June 6, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20031127131632/http://www.rivertowns.net/news1999/rfjrival/week46/frontpage/np/LOCAB06.HTM|archivedate=November 27, 2003[/tpl] The plan, which called for, among other things, a raise in taxes and cuts in the defense budget, was derided as "extremist" by Republicans and "too liberal" by his Democratic opponents. Feingold also announced his support for strict campaign finance reform and a national health care system and voiced his opposition to term limits and new tax cuts.[tpl]cite news|last=Sykes|first=Charles J.|coauthors =|title=The next Bill Proxmire? — US Senate race between Democrat Russ Feingold and Republican Robert W.

Feingold won by positioning himself as a quirky underdog who offered voters an alternative to what was seen by many as negative campaigning of opponents Jim Moody and Joe Checota.[tpl]cite web|last=Wagner|first=Jeff|title=A Republican Senator from Wisconsin in 2004?|publisher=WTMJ-AM |date=September 17, 2004|url= http://www.620wtmj.com/_content/talk/jeffwagner/index.asp?id=14&entry=4202|accessdate=June 6, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060103021529/http://www.620wtmj.com/_content/talk/jeffwagner/index.asp?id=14&entry=4202|archivedate=January 3, 2006[/tpl] On primary day, Feingold, whose support had shown in the single digits throughout much of the campaign, surged to victory with 70 percent of the vote. Seven weeks later, while Bill Clinton, George H. W. Bush, and Ross Perot split the Wisconsin presidential vote 41%-37%-21%, Feingold beat Kasten by a margin of 53 percent to 46 percent.

===1998 U.S. Senate===

During his 1998 re-election campaign, Feingold once again eschewed big-money campaigning, despite the fact that the National Republican Senatorial Committee had targeted him for defeat.[tpl]cite web |last=Nichols|first=John|title=Rockin' in the Real World|publisher=The Nation|date=September 22, 2002 |url= http://www.thenation.com/blogs/thebeat?pid=83|accessdate=June 6, 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite news |last=Hendrie |first=Paul|title=Sneak Attacks: Issue Ads Evade Limits|work=Capital Eye |publisher= opensecrets.org |date=December 1998|url= http://www.opensecrets.org/newsletter/ce56/02issue.htm |accessdate=June 6, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061111053059/http://www.opensecrets.org/newsletter/ce56/02issue.htm|archivedate=November 11, 2006[/tpl] Feingold placed a cap on his own fundraising, refusing to raise or spend more than $3.8 million (one dollar for every citizen of Wisconsin) during the campaign.[tpl]cite web|title=Feingold captures tight Wis.

He refused to allow his party to raise any soft money to air ads favoring him, and he requested that several lobby groups, including the AFL-CIO and the League of Conservation Voters, refrain from airing pro-Feingold "issue ads."[tpl]cite web|title=Political Wrap: October 30, 1998|publisher=PBS|date=October 30, 1998|url= http://www.pbs.org/newshour/shields&gigot/october98/sg_10-30.html|accessdate=June 6, 2007[/tpl] His Republican opponent, Representative Mark Neumann, also limited himself to $3.8 million in spending, but allowed soft money to be used in his favor by a variety of pro-Republican groups. Other Democrats and supporters were angry at Feingold for "putting his career at risk" with these self-imposed limits. On election day, a strong showing in the Democratic strongholds of Milwaukee and Madison allowed Feingold to win by around two percent.[tpl]cite web|title=1998 Senatorial General Election Results — Wisconsin|publisher=US Election Atlas|url= http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?fips=55&year=1998&f=0&off=3&elect=0|accessdate=June 6, 2007[/tpl]

===2004 U.S. Senate===

In the 2004 Senate election, Feingold defeated the Republican candidate and construction magnate Tim Michels by 12 percent (56 percent-44 percent), earning a third term. During the campaign, Feingold refrained from imposing spending caps on himself as he had in the past, and raised and spent almost $11 million. Although critics attempted to use that fact to paint him as a hypocrite, Feingold's records showed that more than 90 percent of the money came from individuals, that the average contribution was $60, and that a majority of it was raised from Wisconsin residents.[tpl]cite web |title=Russell D.

In late December 2004, Feingold was appointed to be one of four deputy whips for the Senate Democrats. Feingold pledged that the new role would not sway his "maverick stance" within the party or the chamber.[tpl]cite news|title=Feingold's New Role|pages=Editorial, p. 6-A|publisher=The Capital Times|date=January 4, 2005|url= http://www.madison.com/archives/read.php?ref=/tct/2005/01/04/0501040109.php|accessdate=June 6, 2007[/tpl]

===2008 possible Presidential bid===

In late January 2005, Feingold told the Tiger Bay Club of Volusia County, Florida that he intended to travel around the country before deciding whether or not to run in 2008.[tpl]cite news |last=Gilbert |first=Craig|title=Feingold sizes up presidential race|publisher=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel |date= February 4, 2005 |url= http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=298859|accessdate=June 6, 2007 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061031122026/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=298859 |archivedate=October 31, 2006[/tpl] In March 2005, his Senate campaign staff registered the domain www.russfeingold08.com, as well as the .org and .net versions.[ref]

On August 17, 2005, Feingold became the first U.S. Senator of either party to suggest a firm date for American withdrawal from the Iraq war, saying that he favored a complete withdrawal by no later than December 31, 2006.[tpl]cite news|last=Baker|first=Peter|title=Feingold Urges Troop Withdrawal By End of '06|publisher=Washington Post|date=August 18, 2005|url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/17/AR2005081701778.html|accessdate=June 6, 2007[/tpl]
On September 22, 2005, during the hearing on Judge John Roberts's nomination for Chief Justice of the United States, Feingold was one of three Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee to vote in favor of sending Roberts's nomination to the floor for a full vote. He also announced that he would vote to confirm Roberts. (Feingold graduated in the same Harvard Law School class (1979) as Roberts, as did Spencer Abraham, former U.S. senator from Michigan and former United States Secretary of Energy.) Many members of the Democratic blogosphere predicted that this vote would have a negative impact on his presidential aspirations, but Feingold's supporters pointed out that this was not the first time Feingold voted in favor of Bush's judicial nominees. However, Feingold voted against Samuel Alito in committee and voted against cloture of debate regarding Alito's nomination on the Senate floor.[tpl]cite web|title=U.S. Senate Roll Call Votes 109th Congress — 2nd Session|publisher=U.S. Senate|url= http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=109&session=2&vote=00001|accessdate=June 6, 2007[/tpl]
Although Feingold usually received support in the single digits in opinion polls featuring various potential Democratic presidential candidates, he was highly popular among Democratic grassroots activists.
Following Democratic victories in the November 2006 mid-term elections, Feingold announced that he would not run for president in 2008. He said that running for president would detract from his focus on the Senate, and the resulting scrutiny "would dismantle both my professional life (in the Senate) and my personal life." In his parting comments, he warned his supporters against supporting anyone for the presidency who voted for the Iraq War, whether they later regretted it or not, saying his first choice for president in 2008 was someone who voted against the war, and his second choice is someone who wasn't in Congress but spoke out against the war at the time.Feingold rules out 2008 run for president.

On February 22, 2008, he stated that he voted for Barack Obama as the Democratic Party nominee for the 2008 presidential election.Feingold: I voted for Obama. February 22, 2008.
