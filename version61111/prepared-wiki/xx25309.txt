==History==

A large dam across the Yangtze River was originally envisioned by Sun Yat-sen in The International Development of China, in 1919.[tpl]cite news |author=Lin Yang |title=China's Three Gorges Dam Under Fire |url= http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1671000,00.html |work=Time |date=2007-10-12 [/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2006-10-23/113410303856s.shtml |title=中国国民党、亲民党、111新党访问团相继参观三峡工程_新闻中心_新浪网 |publisher=News.sina.com.cn |accessdate=2009-08-01[/tpl] He stated that a dam capable of generating 30 million horsepower (22 GW) was possible downstream of the Three Gorges. In 1932, the Nationalist government, led by Chiang Kai-shek, began preliminary work on plans in the Three Gorges. In 1939, Japanese military forces occupied Yichang and surveyed the area. A design, the Otani plan, was completed for the dam in anticipation of a Japanese victory over China.
In 1944, the United States Bureau of Reclamation chief design engineer, John L. Savage, surveyed the area and drew up a dam proposal for the 'Yangtze River Project'.[ref]
John Lucian Savage Biography by Abel Wolman & W. H. Lyles, National Academy of Science, 1978.[/ref] Some 54 Chinese engineers went to the U.S. for training. The original plans called for the dam to employ a unique method for moving ships; the ships would move into locks located at the lower and upper ends of the dam and then cranes with cables would move the ships from one lock to the next. In the case of smaller water craft, groups of craft would be lifted together for efficiency. It is not known whether this solution was considered for its water-saving performance or because the engineers thought the difference in height between the river above and below the dam too great for alternative methods. "China's Dream Dam." Popular Science, July 1946 Some exploration, survey, economic study, and design work was done, but the government, in the midst of the Chinese Civil War, halted work in 1947.
After the 1949 Communist takeover, Mao Zedong supported the project, but began the Gezhouba Dam project nearby first, and economic problems including the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution slowed progress. After the 1954 Yangtze River Floods, in 1956, Mao Zedong authored "Swimming", a poem about his fascination with a dam on the Yangtze River. In 1958, after the Hundred Flowers Campaign, some engineers who spoke out against the project were imprisoned.[tpl]cite news |work=Washington Post | author=Steven Mufson | url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/yangtze/yangtze.htm | title= The Yangtze Dam: Feat or Folly? | date=1997-11-09 | accessdate=2010-11-23 [/tpl]
During the 1980s, the idea of a dam reemerged. The National People's Congress approved the dam in 1992: out of 2,633 delegates, 1,767 voted in favour, 177 voted against, 664 forfeited, and 25 members did not vote.[tpl]cite web |url= http://news.china.com/history/all/11025807/20110402/15882237.html |title=1992年4月3日全国人大批准兴建三峡工程 |publisher=News.rednet.cn |accessdate=2009-08-16[/tpl] Construction started on December 14, 1994. The dam was expected to be fully operational in 2009, but additional projects, such as the underground power plant with six additional generators, delayed full operation until May 2012. The ship lift is expected to be completed in 2014. The dam had raised the water level in the reservoir to [tpl]Convert|172.5|m|0|abbr=on[/tpl] above sea level by the end of 2008 and the designed maximum level of [tpl]Convert|175|m|0|abbr=on[/tpl] by October 2010.[tpl]cite web |url= http://news.sohu.com/20081106/n260480174.shtml |title=三峡完成172.5米蓄水 中游航道正常维护(图)-搜狐新闻 |publisher=News.sohu.com |accessdate=2009-08-16[/tpl]

==Composition and dimensions==

Made of concrete and steel, the dam is [tpl]Convert|2335|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] long and the top of the dam is [tpl]convert|185|m|ft|0[/tpl] above sea level. The project used [tpl]convert|27.2|e6m3|e6cuyd[/tpl] of concrete (mainly for the dam wall), 463,000 tonnes of steel (enough to build 63 Eiffel Towers) and moved about [tpl]convert|102.6|e6m3|e6cuyd[/tpl] of earth. The concrete dam wall is [tpl]convert|181|m|ft|0[/tpl] high above the rock basis.
When the water level is at its maximum of [tpl]convert|175|m|ft|0[/tpl] above sea level, which is [tpl]convert|110|m|ft|0[/tpl] higher than the river level downstream, the dam reservoir is on average about [tpl]convert|660|km|mi|0[/tpl] in length and [tpl]convert|1.12|km|ft[/tpl] in width. It contains [tpl]convert|39.3|km3|acre.ft|abbr=on|lk=out[/tpl] of water and has a total surface area of [tpl]convert|1045|km2[/tpl]. On completion, the reservoir flooded a total area of [tpl]convert|632|km2[/tpl] of land, compared to the [tpl]convert|1350|km2[/tpl] of reservoir created by the Itaipu Dam.

==Economics==

The government estimated that the Three Gorges Dam project would cost 180 billion yuan (US$22.5 billion). By the end of 2008, spending had reached 148.365 billion yuan, among which 64.613 billion yuan was spent on construction, 68.557 billion yuan on relocating affected residents, and 15.195 billion yuan on financing.[tpl]cite web |url= http://chinaneast.xinhuanet.com/jszb/2009-01/11/content_15419027.htm |title=国家重大技术装备 |publisher=Chinaneast.xinhuanet.com |date=2009-01-11 |accessdate=2009-08-01[/tpl] It is estimated that the construction cost will be recovered when the dam has generated [tpl]convert|1000|TWh|link=in[/tpl] of electricity, yielding 250 billion yuan. Full cost recovery is expected to occur ten years after the dam starts full operation.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.waterpowermagazine.com/story.asp?storyCode=2041318 |title=International Water Power and Dam Construction |publisher=Waterpowermagazine.com |date=2007-01-10 |accessdate=2009-08-01[/tpl]
Funding sources include the Three Gorges Dam Construction Fund, profits from the Gezhouba Dam, loans from the China Development Bank, loans from domestic and foreign commercial banks, corporate bonds, and revenue before and after the dam is fully operational. Additional charges were assessed as follows: Every province receiving power from the Three Gorges Dam has to pay ¥7.00 per MWh extra. Other provinces had to pay an additional charge of ¥4.00 per MWh. Tibet pays no surcharge.

==Power generation and distribution==

===Generating capacity===

Power generation is managed by China Yangtze Power, a listed subsidiary of China Three Gorges Corporation (CTGC) — a Central Enterprise SOE administered by SASAC. The Three Gorges Dam is the world's largest capacity hydroelectric power station with 34 generators: 32 main generators, each with a capacity of 700 MW, and two plant power generators, each with capacity of 50 MW, making a total capacity of 22,500 MW. Among those 32 main generators, 14 are installed in the north side of the dam, 12 in the south side, and the remaining six in the underground power plant in the mountain south of the dam. The expected annual electricity generation will be over 100 TWh.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.hb.xinhuanet.com/zhibo/2008-12/04/content_15097047.htm |title=三峡机组国产化已取得成功 |language=Chinese |publisher=hb.xinhuanet.com |date=2008-12-04 |accessdate=2008-12-06[/tpl]

===Generators===

The main generators weigh about 6,000 tonnes each and are designed to produce more than 700 MW of power. The designed head of the generator is [tpl]convert|80.6|m|ft|sp=us[/tpl]. The flow rate varies between [tpl]convert|600|-|950|m3/s|ft3/s[/tpl]  depending on the head available. The greater the head, the less water needed to reach full power. Three Gorges uses Francis turbines. Turbine diameter is 9.7/10.4 m (VGS design/Alstom's design) and rotation speed is 75 revolutions per minute. Rated power is 778 MVA, with a maximum of 840 MVA and a power factor of 0.9. The generator produces electrical power at 20  kV. The outer diameter of the generator stator is 21.4/20.9 m. The inner diameter is 18.5/18.8 m. The stator, the biggest of its kind, is 3.1/3 m in height. Bearing load is 5050/5500 tonnes. Average efficiency is over 94%, and reaches 96.5%.[tpl]cite news |url= http://news.xinhuanet.com/fortune/2008-08/28/content_9723523_2.htm |title=李永安:我水轮发电机组已具完全自主设计制造能力_财经频道_新华网 |language=Chinese |agency=Xinhua News Agency  |date=2008-08-28 |accessdate=2008-12-06[/tpl]THREE GORGES DAM by Matthew Morioka, Alireza Abrishamkar, Yve Kay CEE 491
The generators are manufactured by two joint ventures. One of them includes Alstom, ABB Group, Kvaerner, and the Chinese company Haerbin Motor. The other includes Voith, General Electric, Siemens (abbreviated as VGS), and the Chinese company Oriental Motor. The technology transfer agreement was signed together with the contract. Most of the generators are water-cooled. Some newer ones are air-cooled, which are simpler in design and manufacture and are easier to maintain.[ref]

===Generator installation progress===

The 14 north side main generators are in operation. The first (No. 2) started on July 10, 2003. The north side became completely operational September 7, 2005 with the implementation of generator No. 9. Full power (9,800 MW) was only reached on October 18, 2006 after the water level reached 156 m.
The 12 south side main generators are also in operation. No. 22 began operation on June 11, 2007 and No. 15 started up on October 30, 2008. The sixth (No. 17) began operation on December 18, 2007, raising capacity to 14.1 GW, finally surpassing Itaipu (14.0 GW), to become the world's largest hydropower plant by capacity.[ref]

===Output milestones===

By August 16, 2011, the plant had generated 500 TWh of electricity.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.ctgpc.com.cn/xwzx/news.php?mnewsid=49662 |title=三峡电站持续安稳运行累计发电突破5000亿千瓦时 |publisher=ctgpc.com.cn |accessdate=2011-08-28[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://gb.cri.cn/18824/2008/10/30/2945s2302630.htm |title=三峡工程左右岸电站26台机组全部投入商业运行 – 中国报道 – 国际在线 |language=Chinese |publisher=CRI online|date=2008-10-30 |accessdate=2008-12-06[/tpl] In July 2008 it generated 10.3 TWh of electricity, its first month over 10 TWh.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.ctgpc.com.cn/sx/news.php?mNewsId=29583 |title=三峡电站月发电量首过百亿千瓦时 |language=Chinese |publisher=China Three Gorges Project Corporation |date=2008-08-15 |accessdate=2008-12-06[/tpl] On June 30, 2009, after the river flow rate increased to over 24,000 m3, all 28 generators were switched on, producing only 16,100 MW because the head available during flood season is insufficient.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.hb.xinhuanet.com/zhibo/2009-06/30/content_16958373.htm |title=三峡电站26台发电机组投产后首次满负荷发电 |publisher=Hb.xinhuanet.com |accessdate=2009-08-01[/tpl] During an August 2009 flood, the plant first reached its maximum output for a short period.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.ctgpc.com.cn/sx/news.php?mNewsId=35674 |title=中国长江三峡工程开发总公司 |publisher=Ctgpc.com.cn |accessdate=2009-08-16[/tpl]
During the November to May dry season, power output is limited by the river's flow rate, as seen in the diagrams on the right. When there is enough flow, power output is limited by plant generating capacity. The maximum power-output curves were calculated based on the average flow rate at the dam site, assuming the water level is 175 m and the plant gross efficiency is 90.15%. The actual power output in 2008 was obtained based on the monthly electricity sent to the grid.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.sgcc.com.cn/dwxx/qydwyxqk/lsyxqk/default.shtml |title=国家电网公司-主要水电厂来水和运行情况 |publisher=Sgcc.com.cn |accessdate=2009-08-01[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://www.sgcc.com.cn/dwxx/sgddxx/gdzdxxxt/default.shtml |title=国家电网公司-国调直调信息系统 |publisher=Sgcc.com.cn |accessdate=2009-08-01[/tpl] State Grid Corporation
The Three Gorges Dam reached its design-maximum reservoir water level of [tpl]Convert|175|m|0|abbr=on[/tpl] for the first time on October 26, 2010, in which the intended annual power-generation capacity of 84.7 TWh was realized.Water level at Three Gorges Project raised to full capacity In 2012, the dam's 32 generating units generated a record 98.1 TWh of electricity, which accounts for 14% of China's total hydro generation.[tpl]cite news|title=China's Three Gorges sets new production record |work=Hydro World |date=January 10, 2013 |url=http://www.hydroworld.com/articles/2013/january/chinas-three-gorges-sets-new-production-record.html |accessdate=2013-01-10[/tpl] 

===Distribution===

The State Grid Corporation and China Southern Power Grid paid a flat rate of ¥250 per MWh (US$35.7) until July 2, 2008. Since then, the price has varied by province, from ¥228.7–401.8 per MWh. Higher-paying customers receive priority, such as Shanghai.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.ctgpc.com.cn/sx/news.php?mNewsId=29096 |title=中国长江三峡工程开发总公司 |publisher=Ctgpc.com.cn |date=2008-07-04 |accessdate=2009-08-01[/tpl] Nine provinces and two cities consume power from the dam.
Power distribution and transmission infrastructure cost about 34.387 billion Yuan. Construction was completed in December 2007, one year ahead of schedule.
Power is distributed over multiple 500 kilovolt (kV) transmission lines. Three Direct current (DC) lines to the East China Grid carry 7,200 MW: Three Gorges – Shanghai (3,000 MW), HVDC Three Gorges – Changzhou (3,000 MW), and HVDC Gezhouba – Shanghai (1,200 MW). The alternating current (AC) lines to the Central China Grid have a total capacity of 12,000 MW. The DC transmission line HVDC Three Gorges – Guangdong to the South China Grid has a capacity of 3,000 MW.
The dam was expected to provide 10% of China's power. However, electricity demand has increased more quickly than previously projected. Even fully operational, on average, it supports only about 1.7% of electricity demand in China in the year of 2011, when the Chinese electricity demand reached 4692.8 GWh.[ref]

==Environmental impact==

===Emissions===

According to the National Development and Reform Commission of China, 366 grams of coal would produce 1 kWh of electricity during 2006. At full power, Three Gorges reduces coal consumption by 31 million tonnes per year, avoiding 100 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions, millions of tonnes of dust, one million tonnes of sulfur dioxide, 370,000 tonnes of nitric oxide, 10,000 tonnes of carbon monoxide, and a significant amount of mercury. Hydropower saves the energy needed to mine, wash, and transport the coal from northern China.
From 2003 to 2007, power production equaled that of 84 million tonnes of standard coal, reducing carbon dioxide by 190 million tonnes, sulfur dioxide by 2.29 million tonnes, and nitrogen oxides by 980,000 tonnes.[ref]

[/ref]
The dam increased the Yangtze's barge capacity sixfold, reducing carbon dioxide emission by 630,000 tonnes. From 2004 to 2007 a total of 198 million tonnes of goods passed through the ship locks. Compared to using trucking, barges reduced carbon dioxide emission by ten million tonnes and lowered costs by 25%.

===Erosion and sedimentation===

Two hazards are uniquely identified with the dam.[ref]
Topping, Audrey Ronning. Environmental controversy over the Three Gorges Dam. Earth Times News Service.[/ref] One is that sedimentation projections are not agreed upon, and the other is that the dam sits on a seismic fault. At current levels, 80% of the land in the area is experiencing erosion, depositing about 40 million tons of sediment into the Yangtze annually. Because the flow is slower above the dam, much of this sediment will now settle there instead of flowing downstream, and there will be less sediment downstream.
The absence of silt downstream has three effects:

===Earthquakes and landslides===

Erosion in the reservoir, induced by rising water, causes frequent major landslides that have led to noticeable disturbance in the reservoir surface, including two incidents in May 2009 when somewhere between [tpl]convert|20000|and|50000|m3|cuyd[/tpl] of material plunged into the flooded Wuxia Gorge of the Wu River.[tpl]cite web |last=Yang|first=Sung |url= http://english.cri.cn/6909/2009/05/19/45s485830.htm |title=No Casualties in Three Gorges Dam Landslide |publisher=CRIEnglish.com |work=Xinhua News Network |accessdate=2009-06-03[/tpl] Also, in the first four months of 2010, there were 97 significant landslides.

===Waste management===

The dam catalyzed improved upstream wastewater treatment around Chongqing and its suburban areas. According to the Ministry of Environmental Protection, as of April 2007 more than 50 new plants could treat 1.84 million tonnes per day, 65% of the total need. About 32 landfills were added, which could handle 7,664.5 tonnes of solid waste every day.[ref]

===Forest cover===

In 1997 the Three Gorges area had 10% forestation, down from 20% in the 1950s.
Research by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization research suggested that the Asia-Pacific region would, overall, gain about 6,000 square km of forest by 2008. That is quite a turnaround from the 13,000 square km net loss of forest each year in the 1990s. The main reason is China's huge reforestation effort. This accelerated after the 1998 Yangtze River floods convinced the government that it must restore tree cover, especially in the Yangtze's basin upstream of the Three Gorges Dam.Peter Collins, Falling Here, Rising There, The World in 2008, The Economist, p. 63.

===Wildlife===

Concerns about the potential wildlife impact of the Dam predate the National People's Congress's approval in 1992.Li, Long (1989). Environmental planning of large-scale water projects: The Three Gorges Dam case, China (M.A. thesis) Wilfrid Laurier University This region has long been known for its rich biodiversity. It is home to 6,388 species of plants, which belong to 238 families and 1508 genera. Of these plant species, 57 percent are endangered.Wu, Jianguo, et al. “Three-Gorges Dam— Experiment in Habitat Fragmentation?” Science 300-5623 (May 23, 2003): 1239–1240. These rare species are also used as ingredients in traditional Chinese medicines.Chetham, Deirdre. “Before the Deluge: The Vanishing World of the Yangtze's Three Gorges.” New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2002. Already, the percentage of forested area in the region surrounding the Three Gorges Dam has dropped from twenty percent in 1950 to less than ten percent as of 2002,Chetham, Deirdre. “Before the Deluge: The Vanishing World of the Yangtze's Three Gorges.” negatively affecting all plant species in this locality. The region also provides habitats to hundreds of freshwater and terrestrial animal species.Wu, Jianguo, et al. “Three-Gorges Dam— Experiment in Habitat Fragmentation?” Freshwater fish are especially affected by dams due to changes in the water temperature and flow regime. Many other fish are hurt in the turbine blades of the hydroelectric plants as well. This is particularly detrimental to the ecosystem of the region because the Yangtze River basin is home to 361 different fish species and accounts for twenty-seven percent of all endangered freshwater fish species in China.Xie, Ping. “Three-Gorges Dam: Risk to Ancient Fish.” Science 302-5648 (Nov 14, 2003): 1149. Other aquatic species are being endangered by the dam, particularly the Baiji, or the Chinese River Dolphin.
Of the 3,000 to 4,000 remaining critically endangered Siberian Crane, a large number currently spend the winter in wetlands that will be destroyed by the Three Gorges Dam. The dam contributed to the functional extinction of the Baiji Yangtze river dolphin.  Though it was close to this level even at the start of construction, the dam further decreased its habitat and increased ship travel, which are among the factors causing what will be its ultimate demise.  In addition, populations of the Yangtze sturgeon are guaranteed to be "negatively affected" by the dam.[ref]

==Floods, agriculture, industry==

An important function of the dam is to control flooding, which is a major problem for the seasonal river of the Yangtze. Millions of people live downstream of the dam, with many large, important cities like Wuhan, Nanjing, and Shanghai situated adjacent to the river. Plenty of farm land and China's most important industrial area are built beside the river.
The reservoir's flood storage capacity is [tpl]convert|22|km3|acre.ft|lk=out[/tpl]. This capacity will reduce the frequency of major downstream flooding from once every ten years to once every 100 years. The dam is expected to minimize the effect of even a "super" flood.[tpl]cite web |url= http://finance.people.com.cn/GB/1039/60370/62598/63180/4385148.html |title=三峡工程的防洪作用将提前两年实现-经济-人民网 |work=People's Daily  |accessdate=2009-08-01[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://www.chn-consulate-sapporo.or.jp/chn/ztxw/t252626.htm |title=三峡工程防洪、通航、发电三大效益提前全面发挥 |publisher=Chn-consulate-sapporo.or.jp |date=2006-05-16 |accessdate=2009-08-01[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] In 1954 the river flooded [tpl]convert|193000|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on[/tpl], killing 33,169 people and forcing 18,884,000 people to move.

Dai, Qing. Yangtze! Yangtze!. UK: Earthscan Ltd, 1994., 184[/ref] Also the dam cannot protect against some of the large tributaries downstream, including the Xiang, Zishui, Yuanshui, Lishui, Hanshui, and the Gan.
In 1998 a flood in the same area caused billions of dollars in damage; [tpl]convert|2039|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] of farm land were flooded. The flood affected more than 2.3 million people, killing 1,526.
In early August 2009, the largest flood in five years passed through the dam site. The dam limited the water flow to less than [tpl]convert|40000|m3|cuyd[/tpl] per second, raising the upstream water level from 145.13 metres on August 1, 2009, to 152.88 on August 8, 2009. 4.27 cubic kilometres of flood water were captured and the river flow was cut by as much as 15,000 cubic metres per second.
The dam discharges its reservoir during the dry season between December and March every year.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.gov.cn/jrzg/2009-02/18/content_1235518.htm |title=经过不懈努力三峡枢纽主体工程建设任务提前完成 |publisher=Gov.cn |accessdate=2009-08-01[/tpl] This increases the flow rate of the river downstream, and provides fresh water for agricultural and industrial usage. It also improves shipping conditions.

The water also powers the Gezhouba Dam downstream.
Since the filling of the reservoir in 2003, the Three Gorges Dam has supplied an extra 11 cubic kilometres of fresh water to downstream cities and farms during the dry season.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.ctgpc.com.cn/sx/news.php?mNewsId=35412 |title=中国长江三峡工程开发总公司 |publisher=Ctgpc.com.cn |date=2009-08-07 |accessdate=2009-08-16[/tpl]

==Navigating the dam==

===Locks===

The installation of ship locks is intended to increase river shipping from ten million to 100 million tonnes annually, as a result transportation costs will be cut between 30 and 37%. Shipping will become safer, since the gorges are notoriously dangerous to navigate. Ships with much deeper draft will be able to navigate [tpl]convert|2400|km[/tpl] upstream from Shanghai all the way to Chongqing. It is expected that shipping to Chongqing will increase fivefold.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=yAgGHnENHjoC&pg=PA377&dq=three+gorges+dam#v=onepage&q=three%20gorges%20dam&f=false |title=World Regional Geography |author=Joseph J. Hobbs, Andrew Dolan |year=2008 |publisher=Cengage Learning |page=376 |isbn=978-0-495-38950-7 [/tpl]
There are two series of ship locks installed near the dam ([tpl]coord|30|50|12|N|111|1|10|E|display=inline|region:CN-62_type:landmark[/tpl]). Each of them is made up of five stages, with transit time at around four hours. Maximum vessel size is 10,000 tons.[ref]
 [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
[/ref] The locks are 280 m long, 35 m wide, and 5 m deep (918 x 114 x 16.4 ft).[ref]
 mirror
[/ref][ref]
mirror
[/ref] That is 30 m longer than those on the St Lawrence Seaway, but half as deep. Before the dam was constructed, the maximum freight capacity at the Three Gorges site was 18.0 million tonnes per year. From 2004 to 2007, a total of 198 million tonnes of freight passed through the locks. The freight capacity of the river increased six times and the cost of shipping was reduced by 25%. The total capacity of the ship locks is expected to reach 100 million tonnes per year.
These locks are staircase locks, whereby inner lock gate pairs serve as both the upper gate and lower gate.  The gates are the vulnerable hinged type, which, if damaged, could temporarily render the entire flight unusable. As there are separate sets of locks for upstream and downstream traffic, this system is more water efficient than bi-directional staircase locks.

===Ship lifts===

In addition to the canal locks, a ship lift, a kind of elevator for vessels, is under construction. The ship lift is designed to be capable of lifting ships of up to 3,000 tons.[ref]
 mirror
[/ref] The original plans specified a lift with the capacity to lift 11,500 ton vessels. The vertical distance traveled will be 113 metres, and the size of the ship lift's basin will be 120x18x3.5 metres. The ship lift, when completed, will take 30 to 40 minutes to transit, as opposed to the three to four hours for stepping through the locks. One complicating factor is that the water level can vary dramatically. The ship lift must work even if water levels vary by [tpl]convert|12|m|ft|sp=us[/tpl] on the lower side, and 30 metres on the upper side.
The ship lift was not yet complete when the rest of the project was officially opened on May 20, 2006.[ref]
 mirror
[/ref][ref]
 mirror
[/ref] 
In November 2007 it was reported in the local media that construction of the ship lift started in October 2007 and was anticipated to be completed in 2014.[ref]
 translation
[/ref]
In February 2012 Xinhua reported that the four towers that are to support the ship lift had almost been completed.
The report said the towers had reached 189 meters of the anticipated 195 meters, the towers would be completed by June 2012 and the entire shiplift in 2015.

===Portage railways===

Plans also exist for the construction of short portage railways bypassing the dam area altogether. Two short rail lines, one on each side of the river, are to be constructed. The 88-km long northern portage railway (北岸翻坝铁路) will run from the Taipingxi port facility (太平溪港) on the northern side of the Yangtze, just upstream from the dam, via Yichang East Railway Station to the Baiyang Tianjiahe port facility in Baiyang Town (白洋镇), below Yichang.湖北议案提案：提升三峡翻坝转运能力 ("Hubei's Proposal: raise the Three Gorges dam-bypassing transportation capacity"), 2013-03-17 [tpl]zh icon[/tpl] The 95-km long southern portage railway (南岸翻坝铁路) will run from Maoping[tpl]dn|date=May 2013[/tpl] (upstream of the dam) via Yichang South Railway Station to Zhicheng (on the Jiaozuo–Liuzhou Railway).
In late 2012, preliminary work started along both future railway routes.三峡翻坝铁路前期工作启动 建成实现水铁联运 (Preliminary work started on the Three Gorges Portage Railways. The project will implement a water-rail connection.) 2012-10-12

==Relocation of residents==

As of June 2008, China relocated 1.24 million residents (ending with Gaoyang in Hubei Province),[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.ctgpc.com.cn/sx/news.php?mNewsId=29626 |title=三峡四期移民工程通过阶段性验收 |language=Chinese |publisher=China Three Gorges Project Corporation |date=2008-08-22 |accessdate=2008-12-06[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url= http://chinese.wsj.com/gb/20080724/bch094619.asp?source=whatnews3 |title=中港台] 三峡库区城镇完成拆迁-华尔街日报 |work=The Wall Street Journal  |accessdate=2009-08-01[/tpl] about 1.5% of the province's 60.3 million and Chongqing Municipality's 31.44 million population. About 140,000 residents were relocated to other provinces.
Relocation was completed on July 22, 2008. Some 2007 reports claimed that Chongqing Municipality will encourage an additional four million people to move away from the dam to the main urban area of Chongqing by 2020.
However, the municipal government explained that the relocation is due to urbanization, rather than the dam, and people involved included other areas of the municipality.
Allegedly, funds for relocating 13,000 farmers around Gaoyang disappeared after being sent to the local government, leaving residents without compensation.

==Other effects==

===Culture and aesthetics===

The [tpl]convert|600|km|abbr=on[/tpl] long reservoir flooded some 1,300 archaeological sites and altered the appearance of the Three Gorges as the water level rose over [tpl]convert|300|ft|abbr=on[/tpl]. Cultural and historical relics are being moved to higher ground as they are discovered, but the flooding inevitably covered undiscovered relics. Some sites could not be moved because of their location, size, or design. For example, the hanging coffins site high in the Shen Nong Gorge is part of the cliffs.

===National security===

The United States Department of Defense reported that in Taiwan, “proponents of strikes against the mainland apparently hope that merely presenting credible threats to China's urban population or high-value targets, such as the Three Gorges Dam, will deter Chinese military coercion.”
The notion that the military in Taiwan would seek to destroy the dam provoked an angry response from the mainland Chinese media. People's Liberation Army General Liu Yuan was quoted in the China Youth Daily saying that the People's Republic of China would be "seriously on guard against threats from Taiwan independence terrorists."

===Structural integrity===

Days after the first filling of the reservoir, around 80 hairline cracks were observed in the dam's structure.[tpl]cite web |url= http://internationalrivers.org/en/china/three-gorges-dam |title=Three Gorges Dam |publisher=International Rivers |accessdate=2009-06-03[/tpl][tpl]cite web |last=Adams|first=Jerry |url= http://www.awesomelibrary.org/Library/Local_Information/Asia/China/Three_Gorges_Dam.html |title=Three Gorges Dam |work=Electronic Data Interchange |publisher=Awesome Library |accessdate=2009-06-03[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://www.loe.org/series/3gorges/ |title=Three Gorges Dam |publisher=Living On Earth |accessdate=2009-06-03[/tpl] The submerged spillway gates of the dam might pose a risk of cavitation, similar to what severely damaged the poorly designed and cavitating spillways of the Glen Canyon Dam in the US state of Arizona, which was unable to properly withstand the Colorado river floods of 1983.Steven Hannon.

==Upstream dams==

In order to maximize the utility of the Three Gorges Dam and cut down on sedimentation from the Jinsha River, upstream of the Yangtze River before reaching Yibin in Sichuan, authorities plan to build a series of dams downstream of Jinsha, including Wudongde Dam, Baihetan Dam, Xiluodu Dam, and Xiangjiaba Dam. The total capacity of those four dams is 38,500 MW,[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.chinapower.com.cn/newsarticle/1008/new1008554.asp |title=中国三峡总公司拟在金沙江上建４座梯级水电站 总装机容量为３８５０万千瓦_中国电力网(www.chinapower.com.cn)新闻中心 |publisher=chinapower.com.cn |accessdate=2009-08-01[/tpl] almost double the capacity of the Three Gorges. Xiluodu and Xiangjiaba are under construction, while Baihetan is preparing for construction and Wudongde is seeking government approval. Another eight dams are in the midstream of the Jinsha and eight more upstream of it.
