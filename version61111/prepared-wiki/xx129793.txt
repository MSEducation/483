==Political parties==

===Political spectrum===

===Dominant party system===

Hawaii has run on a Dominant party system, even misinterpreted as a Single-Party system. The legislative majority tends to hold significantly more power than any minority power and the position of the government and the position of the ruling party are closely aligned. This system was largely brought about by the 1887 Constitution which was forced on King David KalƒÅkaua by what is now known as the Hawaii Republican at gun point. The constitution diminished the power of the monarchy and empowered the legislature.

==Hawaiian nationalism==

Hawaiian nationalism is focused on producing a national identity.  Most Hawaiian nationalists have argued that the Hawaiian race and their descendants should govern the islands as a constitutional monarchy.  It is also important to note that Hawaiian nationalism is not limited to Native Hawaiians but have included other groups including Whites and Asians such as Walter M. Gibson.
However, most citizens of Hawaii support continued membership in the United States and disregard separatist views.

==Presidential elections==

Hawaii is dominated by the Democratic Party and has supported Democrats in 11 of the 13 presidential elections in which it has participated. In 2004, John Kerry won the state's 4 electoral votes by a margin of 9 percentage points with 54% of the vote. Every county in the state supported the Democratic candidate. In 2008, Hawaii native Barack Obama also won here, by an overwhelming 45 point lead: 72% for the Democrat and 27% for Republican John McCain. Hawaii is the only actual state that gave either candidate more than 70% of the vote.
