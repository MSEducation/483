Joe Perry (born 13 August 1974 in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire) is an English professional snooker player. He is often referred to as the "Fen Potter" and also nicknamed "the Gentleman" for his likeable attitude. He has run courses to teach people to play.
Perry climbed the rankings steadily after turning professional in 1991, and reached the top sixteen for the first time in 2002. The 2013/2014 season was Perry's most successful to date as he reached two ranking event semi-finals and a further four quarter-finals. It was also the year when he won his first title by claiming the minor-ranking 2013 Yixing Open.
