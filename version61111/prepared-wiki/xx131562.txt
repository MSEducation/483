==Critical reception==

The album received mixed to negative reviews.  Greg Prato of Allmusic gave it a rating of two and a half out of five stars, and said that the album sounded extremely similar to earlier releasesâ€”"you get the same angry-yet-melodic riff rockers that you long ago came to expect from the group ...  Revolutions Per Minute is just what you'd expect from Skid Row."[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r861125|first=Greg|last=Prato|accessdate=June 21, 2011[/tpl]
