In the 20th year, Han Zhuo conquered Ge. In the 26th year, Han Zhuo ordered his son Jiao to fight in Zhenguan. In the 27th year of Xiang's reign, Jiao attacked Xia at Wei in Zhenxun.

===28th year of reign===

In the 28th year of Xiang's reign, Han Zhuo ordered his son Jiao to kill Emperor Xiang. At that time, Xiang's wife, Queen Ji was pregnant. She escaped and hid in Youren. The prime minister of Xia, Mi, fled to Youge. Later, Ji gave birth to a boy named Shao Kang.
19 years later, Shao Kang, heir to the throne of Xia, went from Youren to Yu. In the following years, Shao Kang and Mi led the forces of Zhenxun and Zhenguan to fight against the renegade Han Zhuo. Shao Kang sent Ru Ai to fight Jiao in Guo, and Jiao was killed. He also sent his son Zishu to recover Ge. Finally, forty years after Xiang's death, Mi executed Han Zhuo.
Shao Kang returned in triumph to the Xia capital and took the throne, and all the former Xia vassals came to do homage.
