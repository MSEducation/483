==Major league career==

===Montreal Expos / Washington Nationals===

In the winter of 2001, Chávez was waived by the Royals and then claimed and waived by both the Mets and Detroit Tigers before being claimed by the Montreal Exposhttp://www.baseball-reference.com/players/c/chaveen01.shtml where he playing 309 games over three years (2002–05) while splitting time at AAA Ottawa and Edmonton. Playing full-time for the Expos in 2003 and 2004, Chávez batted first in the lineup and started in center field, stealing 18 bases in 2003 and 32 in 2004. On October 3, 2004 Chávez recorded the final out in Montreal Expos history in their 8–1 loss to the Mets at Shea Stadium. In 2005 Chávez played in only seven games in the majors for the now re-located Washington Nationals before being traded to the Philadelphia Phillies for fellow outfielder Marlon Byrd. During his tenure in Washington, Chávez was given the mocking nickname of "Inning Endy" by Nationals fansites due to his tendency to swing away rather than work the count to his favor which often resulted in groundouts and popups to end the Nationals innings.[tpl]cite web |url=http://dchardball.blogspot.com/2005/03/inning-endy.html|title= Inning-Endy? |date=March 1, 2005 |publisher=DC Hardball |accessdate=April 1, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A61278-2005Feb28.html|title= Up First for the Nats: Chavez |date=March 1, 2005 |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=April 1, 2008 | first=Barry | last=Svrluga[/tpl]

===Philadelphia Phillies===

Chávez spent the rest of the 2005 season with the Philadelphia Phillies and appeared in 91 games with 107 at bats and hit only .215. At the end of the season, Chávez became a free agent for the first time and signed one year, $500,000 contract with the Mets signed on December 23, 2005.

===New York Mets===

During spring training, Mets manager Willie Randolph worked with Chávez to improve his hitting. Chávez's speed and his modified batting style sparked a 90-point jump in his batting average over the previous season (hitting .306 in 353 at bats) as the Mets fourth outfielder (often as an injury replacement for regular left fielder Cliff Floyd). His improved hitting and excellent defensive skills contributed to the Mets winning the National League East.
Chávez's arguably signature moment came at Shea Stadium in Game 7 of the 2006 National League Championship Series. In the top of the sixth inning, with the game tied 1–1, Cardinals third baseman Scott Rolen hit a pitch off Mets starter Óliver Pérez. Leaping over the [tpl]convert|8|ft|m|sing=on[/tpl]-high left field wall, Chávez caught the ball with the tip of his glove to rob Rolen of a two-run home run. Chávez then threw to cutoff man second baseman José Valentín, who threw to Carlos Delgado at first base to double off Cardinals center fielder Jim Edmonds for an inning-ending double play. The catch was named the top post-season moment in the 5th annual This Year in Baseball Awards. On July 13, 2007, American International Group (the company whose left field advertisement was where Chávez made the catch) sponsored a special Bobblehead Doll day to commemorate the catch. The Left Field entrance gate of the Mets' current ballpark, Citi Field, features a metal silhouette of a baseball player making a leaping catch similar to the one Chávez made in the 2006 NLCS.
Chávez's playing time decreased dramatically in 2007 when he only saw time in 71 games, primarily splitting time with regular left fielder Moisés Alou, due to left hamstring issues which landed him on the disabled list twice. That winter, he reinjured the hamstring and injured his right ankle while playing winter ball in Venezuela for Navegantes del Magallanes.[tpl]cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3195054 |title= Chavez injures ankle, hamstring in winter ball in Venezuela |date=January 13, 2008 |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=January 14, 2008[/tpl]
In 2008, Chávez again saw time as the Mets' fourth outfielder and hit .267 in 270 at-bats. On September 28, the final day of the 2008 regular season and the final game at Shea Stadium, the Mets played the Florida Marlins. With an NL wildcard spot at stake for the Mets, Chávez made another terrific catch in the outfield during the top of the seventh inning. After a ball was hit to left field by Jorge Cantú, Chávez made the catch for the final out of the inning. Despite his defensive play, the Mets lost to the Marlins 4-2 and failed to qualify for post-season play.

===Seattle Mariners===

On December 11, Chávez was involved in a three-team, 12-player trade in which he was sent, along with pitcher Aaron Heilman and several minor leaguers, to the Seattle Mariners.[tpl]cite web|author=By Anthony Castrovince / MLB.com |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20081211&content_id=3712527&vkey=hotstove2008&fext=.jsp |title=Three-team blockbuster gets Mets Putz |publisher=Mlb.mlb.com |date=April 23, 2008 |accessdate=October 4, 2011[/tpl]
