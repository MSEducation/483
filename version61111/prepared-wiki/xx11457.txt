CATEGORIES: Vaccination, Biotechnology, Preventive medicine

Vaccination is the administration of antigenic material (a vaccine) to stimulate an individual's immune system to develop adaptive immunity to a pathogen.  Vaccines can prevent or ameliorate morbidity from infection. The effectiveness of vaccination has been widely studied and verified; for example, the influenza vaccine,[tpl]cite journal |author=Fiore AE, Bridges CB, Cox NJ |title=Seasonal influenza vaccines |journal=Curr.

The active agent of a vaccine may be intact but inactivated (non-infective) or attenuated (with reduced infectivity) forms of the causative pathogens, or purified components of the pathogen that have been found to be highly immunogenic (e.g., outer coat proteins of a virus). Toxoids are produced for immunization against toxin-based diseases, such as the modification of tetanospasmin toxin of tetanus to remove its toxic effect but retain its immunogenic effect.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/tetanus.pdf |title=Tetanus |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-03-01[/tpl]

In common speech, 'vaccination' and 'immunization' have a similar meaning. This distinguishes it from inoculation, which uses unweakened live pathogens, although in common usage either can refer to an immunization. Vaccination efforts have been met with some controversy on scientific, ethical, political, medical safety, and religious grounds. In rare cases, vaccinations can injure people and, in the United States, they may receive compensation for those injuries under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. Early success and compulsion brought widespread acceptance, and mass vaccination campaigns have greatly reduced the incidence of many diseases in numerous geographic regions.

==Mechanism of function==

Generically, the process of artificial induction of immunity, in an effort to protect against infectious disease, works by 'priming' the immune system with an 'immunogen'.  Stimulating immune responses with an infectious agent is known as immunization.  Vaccination includes various ways of administering immunogens.
Some vaccines are administered after the patient already has contracted a disease. Vaccinia given after exposure to smallpox, within the first three days, is reported to attenuate the disease considerably, and vaccination up to a week after exposure probably offers some protection from disease or may modify the severity of disease.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/vaccination/pdf/vaccine-overview.pdf |format=PDF|title=Vaccine Overview |accessdate=2008-01-02 |work=Smallpox Fact Sheet[/tpl]  The first rabies immunization was given by Louis Pasteur to a child after he was bitten by a rabid dog. Subsequent to this, it has been found that, in people with uncompromised immune systems, four doses of rabies vaccine over 14 days, wound care, and treatment of the bite with rabies immune globulin, commenced as soon as possible after exposure, is effective in preventing the development of rabies in humans.[tpl]cite journal |author=Rupprecht CE, Briggs D, Brown CM, et al. |title=Use of a reduced (4-dose) vaccine schedule for postexposure prophylaxis to prevent human rabies: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices |journal=MMWR Recomm Rep |volume=59 |issue=RR–2 |pages=1–9 |date=March 2010 |pmid=20300058 |doi= |url=[/tpl] Other examples include experimental AIDS, cancer and Alzheimer's disease vaccines. Such immunizations aim to trigger an immune response more rapidly and with less harm than natural infection.
Most vaccines are given by hypodermic injection as they are not absorbed reliably through the intestines. Live attenuated polio, some typhoid and some cholera vaccines are given orally to produce immunity in the bowel.

===Adjuvants and preservatives===

Vaccines typically contain one or more adjuvants, used to boost the immune response. Tetanus toxoid, for instance, is usually adsorbed onto alum. This presents the antigen in such a way as to produce a greater action than the simple aqueous tetanus toxoid. People who get an excessive reaction to adsorbed tetanus toxoid may be given the simple vaccine when time for a booster occurs.
In the preparation for the 1990 Gulf campaign, Pertussis vaccine (not acellular) was used as an adjuvant for Anthrax vaccine. This produces a more rapid immune response than giving only the Anthrax, which is of some benefit if exposure might be imminent.
Vaccines may also contain preservatives to prevent contamination with bacteria or fungi. Until recent years, the preservative thimerosal was used in many vaccines that did not contain live virus. As of 2005, the only childhood vaccine in the U.S. that contains thimerosal in greater than trace amounts is the influenza vaccine,http://www.vaccinesafety.edu/thi-table.htm which is currently recommended only for children with certain risk factors.Melinda Wharton. National Vaccine Advisory committee U.S.A. national vaccine plan Single-dose Influenza vaccines supplied in the UK do not list Thiomersal (its UK name) in the ingredients. Preservatives may be used at various stages of production of vaccines, and the most sophisticated methods of measurement might detect traces of them in the finished product, as they may in the environment and population as a whole.http://www.npl.co.uk/environment/vam/nongaseouspollutants/ngp_metals.html[tpl]dead link|date=September 2012[/tpl]

===Vaccination versus inoculation===

Many times these words are used interchangeably, as if they were synonyms. In fact, they are different things. As doctor Byron Plant explains: "Vaccination is the more commonly used term, which actually consists of a 'safe' injection of a sample taken from a cow suffering from cowpox... Inoculation, a practice probably as old as the disease itself, is the injection of the variola virus taken from a pustule or scab of a smallpox sufferer into the superficial layers of the skin, commonly on the upper arm of the subject. Often inoculation was done 'arm to arm' or less effectively 'scab to arm'..."[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.uvic.ca/vv/student/smallpox/doctors/diff.html |title="Doctors and diagnosis" The difference between Vaccination and Inoculation |publisher=Web.uvic.ca |accessdate=2014-01-08[/tpl]
Vaccination began in the 18th century with the work of Edward Jenner."Edward Jenner - (1749–1823)". Sundaytimes.lk. 2008-06-01. http://sundaytimes.lk/080601/FunDay/famous.html.

==Types==

Vaccines work by presenting a foreign antigen to the immune system to evoke an immune response, but there are several ways to do this.  Four main types are currently in clinical use:
A number of other vaccine strategies are under experimental investigation.  These include DNA vaccination and recombinant viral vectors.

==History==

===In written history===

It is believed likely that some form of inoculation was developed in India or China before the 16th century. Scholar Ole Lund comments: "The earliest documented examples of vaccination are from India and China in the 17th century, where vaccination with powdered scabs from people infected with smallpox was used to protect against the disease. Smallpox used to be a common disease throughout the world and 20% to 30% of infected persons died from the disease. Smallpox was responsible for 8% to 20% of all deaths in several European countries in the 18th century. The tradition of inoculation may have originated in India in 1000 BCE."Lund, Ole; Nielsen, Morten Strunge and Lundegaard, Claus (2005). Immunological Bioinformatics. MIT Press. ISBN 0-262-12280-4 The mention of inoculation in the Sact'eya Grantham, an Ayurvedic text, was noted by the French scholar Henri Marie Husson in the journal Dictionaire des sciences médicales.Chaumeton, F.P.; F.V. Me`rat de Vaumartoise. Dictionaire des sciences sciences médicales. Paris: C.L.F. Panckoucke, 1812-1822, lvi (1821). Almroth Wright, the professor of pathology at Netley, further helped shape the future of vaccination by conducting limited experiments on the professional staff at Netly, including himself. The outcome of these experiments resulted in further development of vaccination in Europe.Curtin, Phillip (1998). "Disease and Empire: The Health of European Troops in the Conquest of Africa". Cambridge University Press. ISBN 0-521-59835-4 The Anatolian Ottoman Turks knew about methods of inoculation. This kind of inoculation and other forms of variolation were introduced into England by Lady Montagu, a famous English letter-writer and wife of the English ambassador at Istanbul between 1716 and 1718, who almost died from smallpox as a young adult and was physically scarred from it.  She came across the Turkish methods of inoculation, consenting to have her son inoculated by the Embassy surgeon Charles Maitland in the Turkish way.  Lady Montagu wrote to her sister and friends in England describing the process in details.  On her return to England she continued to propagate the Turkish tradition of inoculation and had many of her relatives inoculated.  The breakthrough came when a scientific description of the inoculation operation was submitted to the Royal Society in 1724 by Dr Emmanual Timoni, who had been the Montagu's family physician in Istanbul. Inoculation was adopted both in England and in France nearly half a century before Jenner's famous smallpox vaccine of 1796.[tpl]cite book |author=Anthony Henricy (ed.)|title=Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, Letters of the Right Honourable Lady Mary Wortley Montagu:Written During her Travels in Europe, Asia and Africa |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=167–169 |year=1796[/tpl]
Since then vaccination campaigns have spread throughout the globe, sometimes prescribed by law or regulations (See Vaccination Acts). Vaccines are now used against a wide variety of diseases besides smallpox.  Louis Pasteur further developed the technique during the 19th century, extending its use to killed agents protecting against anthrax and rabies.  The method Pasteur used entailed treating the agents for those diseases so they lost the ability to infect, whereas inoculation was the hopeful selection of a less virulent form of the disease, and Jenner's vaccination entailed the substitution of a different and less dangerous disease for the one protected against.  Pasteur adopted the name vaccine as a generic term in honor of Jenner's discovery.
Prior to vaccination with cowpox, the only known protection against smallpox was inoculation or variolation (Variola - the Smallpox viruses) where a small amount of live smallpox virus was administered to the patient; this carried the serious risk that the patient would be killed or seriously ill.  The death rate from variolation was reported to be around a tenth of that from natural infection with Variola, and the immunity provided was considered quite reliable. Factors contributing to the efficacy of variolation probably include the choices of Variola Minor strains used, the relatively low number of cells infected in the first phase of multiplication following initial exposure, and the exposure route used, via the skin or nasal lining rather than inhalation of droplets into the lungs.
Consistency would suggest the activity should have predated Jenner's description of an effective vaccination system, and there is some history relating to opposition to the older and more hazardous procedure of variolation.[tpl]cite journal|last=Wolfe|first=Robert M|coauthors=Sharp, Lisa K|date=24 August 2002|title=Anti-vaccinationists past and present|journal=British Medical Journal|location=London|page=325|doi=10.1136/bmj.325.7361.430|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/325/7361/430.full.pdf|volume=325|issue=7361|pmid=12193361|pmc=1123944[/tpl]
In modern times, the first vaccine-preventable disease targeted for eradication was smallpox. The World Health Organization (WHO) coordinated this global eradication effort.  The last naturally occurring case of smallpox occurred in Somalia in 1977.
Maurice Hilleman was the most prolific vaccine inventor, and developed successful vaccines for measles, mumps, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, chickenpox, meningitis, pneumonia and Haemophilus influenzae.[tpl]cite book |author=Offit PA |title=Vaccinated: One Man's Quest to Defeat the World's Deadliest Diseases |location=Washington, DC |publisher=Smithsonian |isbn=0-06-122796-X |year=2007 [/tpl]
In 1988, the governing body of WHO targeted polio for eradication by 2000.  Although the target was missed, eradication is very close.  The next disease to be targeted for eradication would most likely be measles, which has declined since the introduction of measles vaccination in 1963.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl]
In 2000, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization was established to strengthen routine vaccinations and introduce new and under-used vaccines in countries with a per capita GDP of under US$1000. GAVI is now entering its second phase of funding, which extends through 2014.

==Society and culture==

To eliminate the risk of outbreaks of some diseases, at various times several governments and other institutions have instituted policies requiring vaccination for all people. For example, an 1853 law required universal vaccination against smallpox in England and Wales, with fines levied on people who did not comply.  Common contemporary U.S. vaccination policies require that children receive common vaccinations before entering public school.
Beginning with early vaccination in the nineteenth century, these policies were resisted by a variety of groups, collectively called antivaccinationists, who object on scientific, ethical, political, medical safety, religious, and other grounds. Common objections are that vaccinations do not work, that compulsory vaccination represents excessive government intervention in personal matters, or that the proposed vaccinations are not sufficiently safe.[tpl]cite journal |author= Wolfe R, Sharp L |title= Anti-vaccinationists past and present |journal=BMJ |volume=325 |issue=7361 |pages=430–2 |year=2002 |pmid=12193361 |doi=10.1136/bmj.325.7361.430 |url=http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/325/7361/430 |pmc= 1123944[/tpl] Many modern vaccination policies allow exemptions for people who have compromised immune systems, allergies to the components used in vaccinations or strongly held objections.[tpl]cite journal |author= Salmon DA, Teret SP, MacIntyre CR, Salisbury D, Burgess MA, Halsey NA |title= Compulsory vaccination and conscientious or philosophical exemptions: past, present, and future |journal=Lancet |volume=367 |issue=9508 |pages=436–42 |year=2006 |pmid=16458770 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68144-0[/tpl]

===Vaccination-autism controversy===

A noteworthy allegation of vaccine-induced injury is the MMR vaccine controversy. A fraudulent 1998 paper by Andrew Wakefield, originally published in The Lancet, presented supposed evidence that the MMR Vaccine (an immunization against measles, mumps and rubella that is typically first administered to children shortly after their first birthday) was linked to the onset of autism spectrum disorders.[tpl]cite journal|title= Ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia, non-specific colitis, and pervasive developmental disorder in children |journal=Lancet|volume=351|issue=9103|pages = 637–41|year=1998|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(97)11096-0|pmid=9500320|url=http://briandeer.com/mmr/lancet-paper.htm|accessdate= 2007-09-05|author-separator= , |author1 = Wakefield A|author2 = Murch S|author3=Anthony A et al.|authorlink1=Andrew Wakefield[/tpl][tpl]Retracted|intentional=yes[/tpl] The article was widely criticized for lack of scientific rigour and then partially retracted in 2004 by Wakefield's co-authors,[tpl]cite journal |author=Murch SH, Anthony A, Casson DH et al.  |title=Retraction of an interpretation |journal=Lancet |volume=363 |issue=9411 |page=750 |year=2004 |pmid=15016483 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(04)15715-2[/tpl] and was fully retracted by The Lancet in 2010.[tpl]cite journal |author= |title=Retraction—Ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia, non-specific colitis, and pervasive developmental disorder in children |journal=Lancet |volume=375 |issue=9713 |page=445 |date=February 2010 |pmid=20137807 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(10)60175-4 |laysource=BBC News |laydate=2010-02-02 |laysummary=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/health/8493753.stm |last1= The Editors Of The Lancet [/tpl]

==Side effects and injury==

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has compiled a list of vaccines and their possible side effects.[tpl]cite web | title= Possible Side-effects from Vaccines |url=http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/side-effects.htm [/tpl] Allegations of vaccine injuries in recent decades have appeared in litigation in the U.S. Some families have won substantial awards from sympathetic juries, even though most public health officials have said that the claims of injuries were unfounded.[tpl]cite journal |journal= N Engl J Med |year=2007 |volume=357 |issue=13 |pages=1275–7 |title= Cases in vaccine court—legal battles over vaccines and autism |author= Sugarman SD |pmid=17898095 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/357/13/1275 |doi= 10.1056/NEJMp078168[/tpl] In response, several vaccine makers stopped production, which the US government believed could be a threat to public health, so laws were passed to shield makers from liabilities stemming from vaccine injury claims.

==Routes of administration==

A vaccine administration may be oral, by injection (intramuscular, intradermal, subcutaneous), by puncture, transdermal or intranasal.
