Blue Lotus Assembly (Sho-Ren Ko) is a form of esoteric Buddhism established in North America by Stephen K. Hayes. Hayes was originally a martial arts practitioner and instructor who had established the Japanese Bujinkan in North America and later created his own martial art, To-Shin Do. 
The name, Blue Lotus Assembly (Sho-Ren Ko), was derived from the Shoren-In Blue Lotus Temple of Kyoto, former temple home of the poet-priest Jien, 62nd Zasu (Headmaster) of Tendai, whose name inspired the dharma name given to founder Stephen Kinryu-Jien Hayes.
Blue Lotus Assembly teachings are based on the teachings and practices of Tendai and the Mountain ascetic practices of the shugendo yamabushi.

==Distinctly American==

The Blue Lotus Assembly Order of the Tendai Lineage has no direct affiliation with, or oversight from, the Japanese Tendai administration or the Japanese government, but is self-directing and autonomous in its affairs. The biggest implication of this is that the Blue Lotus Assembly training and teaching of esoteric Buddhism (vajrayana or mikkyo) is more open than in its parent organization, Tendai. Where the full range of teachings and practices in Japanese Tendai are restricted solely to its priesthood, the Blue Lotus Assembly Order seems to take a more egalitarian approach.
The Blue Lotus Assembly has temples and meeting places in Ohio and Colorado.
