Full Speed Ahead is an R&B studio album by Táta Vega. It is her first solo album and was released on Motown's Tamla label in 1976.
The album was produced by Trinidadian native Winston Monseque, who was also her manager.  In a November 1976 interview, Vega cited "Try Love from the Inside," "Try God," and "Music in My Heart" as her favorite tracks off of the album.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.soulmusic.com/taveno19in.html |title=Tata Vega:Tata for Now |first=John |last=Abbey |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= November 1976  |work= |publisher=SoulMusic.com |location= |page= |pages= |at= |language= |trans_title= |arxiv= |asin= |bibcode= |doi= |doibroken= |isbn= |issn= |jfm= |jstor= |lccn= |mr= |oclc= |ol= |osti= |pmc = |embargo= |pmid= |rfc= |ssrn= |zbl= |id= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |deadurl= |accessdate= |quote=The album itself is interesting in that she can justifiably be compared to several big name artists — such as Stevie Wonder (because her diction and phrasing are very similar at times) and Chaka Khan (because of her rough, ready and raucous approach to a song. |ref= |separator= |postscript=[/tpl]
