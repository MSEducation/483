[[Chadic languages]]

CATEGORIES: Afro-Asiatic languages, Chadic languages

The Chadic languages are a branch of the Afroasiatic language family that is spoken in parts of the Sahel. They include 150 languages spoken across northern Nigeria, southern Niger, southern Chad, Central African Republic and northern Cameroon. The most widely spoken Chadic language is Hausa, a lingua franca of much of inland West Africa.

==Composition==

Newman (1977) classified the languages into four groups which have been accepted in all subsequent literature. Further subbranching, however, has not been as robust; Blench (2006), for example, only accepts the A/B bifurcation of East Chadic.Blench, 2006.

==Origin==

Several modern genetic studies of Chadic speaking groups in the northern Cameroon region have observed high frequencies of the Y-Chromosome Haplogroup R1b in these populations (specifically, of R1b's R-V88 variant). This paternal marker is common in parts of West Eurasia, but otherwise rare in Africa. Cruciani et al. (2010) thus propose that the Proto-Chadic speakers during the mid-Holocene (~7,000 years ago) migrated from the Levant to the Central Sahara, and from there settled in the Lake Chad Basin.[tpl]Cite journal|last1=Cruciani|first1=F|year=2010|journal=European Journal of Human Genetics | doi=10.1038/ejhg.2009.231|title=Human Y chromosome haplogroup R-V88: a paternal genetic record of early mid Holocene trans-Saharan connections and the spread of Chadic languages|pmc=2987365|url=http://www.nature.com/ejhg/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/ejhg2009231a.html|pmid=20051990|last2=Trombetta|first2=B|last3=Sellitto|first3=D|last4=Massaia|first4=A|last5=Destro-Bisol|first5=G|last6=Watson|first6=E|last7=Beraud Colomb|first7=E|last8=Dugoujon|first8=JM|last9=Moral|first9=P|last10=Scozzari|first10=R|volume=18|issue=7|pages=800â€“7|postscript=[/tpl]
