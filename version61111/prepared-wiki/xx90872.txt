Iqbal Park (formerly Minto Park) is large area of green space, located at the heart of Lahore city in Pakistan.[tpl]cite web|url=http://gulftoday.ae/portal/50bcdf70-a028-40cd-a1b9-c549d2ee39fa.aspx |title=Bury the hatchet|publisher=gulftoday.ae |date= |accessdate=2012-03-23|author=Zafar Iqbal[/tpl] The park accommodates Minar-e-Pakistan (Lighthouse of Pakistan), a 60 meters (198.5 feet) tall distinctive monument in the shape of a minaret that has been built in commemoration of the Lahore Resolution passed at the three-day general session (22–24 March 1940) of All India Muslim League, calling for greater Muslim autonomy in British India. The resolution became synonymous to the demand for a separate Muslim state of Pakistan. In 2014 a project has been started to expand the park to include Lahore Fort and Badshahi Mosque which are across the road into its premise as well .
