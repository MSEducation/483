Dithionic acid, H2S2O6, is a chemical compound known only in solution.[tpl]Greenwood&Earnshaw[/tpl] pp. 715-716

==Salts==

Dithionic acid is dibasic and salts called dithionates are known. No acid salts have been discovered. All dithionates are readily soluble in water. They are mild oxidizing and mild reducing agents. The structure of dithionate ion is like ethane, but two SO3 groups adopt an almost eclipsed conformation. The S—S length is 2.15 Å; S—O bonds are rather short with bond length of 1.43 Å.

==Synthesis==

Dithionates can be made by oxidizing a sulfite (from the +4 to the +5 oxidation state), but on a larger scale they are made by oxidizing a cooled aqueous solution of sulfur dioxide with MnO2:
The manganese dithionate solution formed can then be converted to dithionate salts of other metals by metathesis reactions:
Concentrated solutions of dithionic acid can subsequently be obtained treating a barium dithionate solution with sulfuric acid:
