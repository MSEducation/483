Constructions Aéronautiques Maurice Brochet was a French manufacturer of light aircraft established by Maurice Brochet in Neauphle-le-Château in 1947. 

==Aircraft design and construction==

Initially, the firm sold plans for light aircraft of Brochet's own designs to amateur constructors, but gradually undertook more and more aircraft construction, with its final designs not marketed for homebuilding at all. During the early 1950s, Brochet sold some 58 light planes of eight designs to the French government for distribution to the country's aeroclubs. Simpson, 2005, p. 71
