Stephen Lawrence (13 September 1974 – 22 April 1993) was a Black British man from Eltham, south east London, who was murdered in a racist attack while waiting for a bus on the evening of 22 April 1993. The case became a cause célèbre and one of the highest profile racial killings in UK history; its fallout included profound cultural changes to attitudes on racism and the police, and to the law and police practice, and the partial revocation of double jeopardy laws, before two of the perpetrators were convicted almost 20 years later in 2012.
After the initial investigation, five suspects were arrested but not convicted.[tpl]cite news|author=BBC News|title=Lawrence detective denies claim|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/5232372.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=31 July 2006|accessdate=4 January 2008[/tpl] It was suggested during the course of that investigation that the murder was racially motivated and that Lawrence was killed because he was black, and that the handling of the case by the police and Crown Prosecution Service was affected by issues of race. A public inquiry was held in 1998,[tpl]cite web|title=Sir William Macpherson's Inquiry Into The Matters Arising From the Death of Stephen Lawrence|publisher=Official Documents Archive|url=http://www.archive.official-documents.co.uk/document/cm42/4262/sli-00.htm|date=24 February 1999|accessdate=21 June 2009[/tpl] (see also summary: [tpl]cite news|title=Lawrence: Key recommendations |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/285537.stm|accessdate=5 January 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=24 March 1999[/tpl]) headed by Sir William Macpherson, that examined the original Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) investigation and concluded that the force was "institutionally racist". It also recommended that the double jeopardy rule should be abrogated in murder cases to allow a retrial upon new and compelling evidence; this became law in 2005. The publication in 1999 of the resulting Macpherson Report has been called 'one of the most important moments in the modern history of criminal justice in Britain'.[tpl]cite news|author=BBC News|title=Q&A: Stephen Lawrence murder| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3685733.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=5 May 2004|accessdate=4 January 2008[/tpl] Jack Straw, Home Secretary from 1997 to 2001, commented in 2012 that ordering the inquiry was "the single most important decision I made as Home Secretary".[tpl]cite news|title=Justice at last for Stephen Lawrence|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/crime/article3275748.ece|accessdate=4 January 2012|newspaper=The Times|date=4 January 2012[/tpl] In 2010 the case was described as being "one of the highest-profile unsolved racially-motivated murders".[tpl]cite news|title=Lawrence murder suspect jailed for dealing|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/lawrence-murder-suspect-jailed-for-dealing-2022528.html|accessdate=5 January 2012|newspaper=The Independent / Press Association|date=9 July 2010[/tpl]

In the years after Dobson and Norris were sentenced, the case again regained prominence when concerns of corrupt police conduct during the original case handling surfaced in the media. Such claims had surfaced before, and been investigated in 2006, but were reignited in 2013 when a former undercover police officer stated in an interview that at the time, he had been pressured to find ways to "smear" and discredit the victim's family, to mute and deter public campaigning for better police responses to the case. Although further inquiries in 2012 by both Scotland Yard and the Independent Police Complaints Commission had ruled that there was no basis for further investigation, Home Secretary Theresa May ordered an independent inquiry into undercover policing and corruption by a prominent QC, which was described as "devastating" when published in 2014.

==Stephen Lawrence==

Stephen Lawrence was born on 13 September 1974. His father was Neville Lawrence, a carpenter, and his mother was Doreen, a special needs teacher. Brought up in Plumstead, South-East London, he was the eldest of three children.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stephenlawrence.org.uk/about-us/stephens-story/|title=Stephen's Story|publisher=Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust|accessdate=9 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Wilkins|first=Verna Alette|title=The Life of Stephen Lawrence|year=2001|publisher=Tamarind Limited|isbn=1-870516-58-3|page=p1[/tpl] At the time of his death he was studying technology and physics at the Blackheath Bluecoat School and English language and literature at Woolwich College, and was hoping to become an architect.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/the-life-and-legacy-of-stephen-lawrence-6286671.html|title=The life and legacy of Stephen Lawrence|publisher=The Independent|date=8 January 2012|first=Brian|last=Cathcart|accessdate=3 May 2012[/tpl]

==Murder==

Lawrence had spent the day of Thursday 22 April 1993 at Blackheath Bluecoat School.[tpl]cite web|last=Sutcliffe|first=Roger|title=The murder of Stephen Lawrence Archived|url=http://www.dialogueworks.co.uk/newswise/months/feb99/lasen.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071116082756/http://www.dialogueworks.co.uk/newswise/months/feb99/lasen.html|archivedate=2007-11-16|work=February 1999|publisher=Newswise|accessdate=3 January 2012[/tpl]  After school, he went to Lewisham to look around shops.  After this, he travelled by bus to an uncle's house in Plumstead.  He was joined there by Duwayne Brooks, and they played video games until leaving in the late evening.  After realising that the bus on which they were travelling would get them home late, they decided to change buses on Well Hall Road. Lawrence walked along Well Hall Road to the junction of Dickson Road to see if he could see a bus coming and then went back towards the bus stop.[tpl]cite web|last=Macpherson|first=William|title=THE MURDER OF STEPHEN LAWRENCE, Chapter 1|publisher=Official Documents Archive|url=http://www.archive.official-documents.co.uk/document/cm42/4262/sli-01.htm|date=24 February 1999|accessdate=4 January 2008[/tpl] Brooks was still on Well Hall Road, part way between Dickson Road and the roundabout with Rochester Way and Westhorne Avenue. At this point, Brooks saw a group of five or six white youths on the opposite side of the street near the area of the zebra crossing moving towards them.  At 10:35 pm, he called out to ask whether Lawrence saw the bus coming. Brooks claimed that he heard one of Lawrence's assailants saying: "What, what, nigger?" as they all quickly crossed the road and 'engulfed' Lawrence, who was forced down and then received two stab wounds to a depth of about [tpl]convert|5|in|cm|0[/tpl] on both sides of the front of his body, in the chest and arm. Both of the stab wounds severed axillary arteries. Brooks began running, and shouted for Lawrence to run to escape with him. They both ran in the direction of Shooters Hill, though Lawrence collapsed and bled to death after running [tpl]convert|130|yd|m[/tpl].
Brooks ran to call an ambulance while an off-duty police officer stopped his car and covered Lawrence with a blanket. Lawrence was taken to hospital by 11:05 pm, but he was already dead.

==Trials==

===Witnesses===

All three witnesses at the bus stop at the time of the attack said in statements that the attack was sudden and short; none were later able to identify any of the suspects. In the days following Lawrence's murder, several residents came forward to provide names of suspects and an anonymous note was also left on a police car windscreen and in a telephone box naming a local gang[tpl]cite news|last=Evans|first=Martin|title=Interactive graphic: Stephen Lawrence murder timeline|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/8974878/Interactive-graphic-Stephen-Lawrence-murder-timeline.html|accessdate=5 January 2012|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|date=3 January 2012[/tpl] as the five main suspects.[tpl]cite book|last=Holohan|first=Siobhan|title=The search for justice in a media age: reading Stephen Lawrence and Louise Woodward|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aBxFkbEs2AsC|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|accessdate=3 January 2012|isbn=978-0-7546-4380-7|page=123[/tpl]  The suspects were Gary Dobson, brothers Neil and Jamie Acourt, Luke Knight and David Norris.  In February 1999, officers investigating the handling of the initial inquiry revealed that a woman who might have been a vital witness had telephoned detectives three times within the first few days after the killing, and appealed for her to contact them again.[tpl]cite news|author=BBC News|title=Police appeal for witness in Stephen Lawrence murder inquiry|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/278943.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=13 February 1999|accessdate=4 January 2008[/tpl]

===Initial investigations, arrests and prosecutions===

Within 3 days of the crime, prime suspects had been identified. No arrests were made, however, until over two weeks after the killing. The officer who had been leading the murder investigation from its third day, and who would ultimately lead the murder squad for 14 months, explained to an incredulous public inquiry in 1998 that part of the reason no arrests had taken place by the fourth day after the killing (Monday 26 April) was that he had not known the law allowed arrest upon reasonable suspicion – a basic point of criminal law.[tpl]cite news|last=Pallister|first=David|title=Police bungling that betrayed Stephen Lawrence|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/1998/jul/18/lawrence.ukcrime|accessdate=5 January 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=18 July 1998[/tpl] – stated in the text to be "now, on the 49th day of the inquiry".
On 7 May 1993, the Acourt brothers and Dobson were arrested. Norris turned himself in to police and was likewise arrested three days later.  Knight was arrested on 3 June. Neil Acourt, picked out at an identity parade, and Luke Knight were charged with murder on 13 May and 23 June 1993 respectively, but the charges were dropped on 29 July 1993, the Crown Prosecution Service citing insufficient evidence.[tpl]cite news|author=BBC News|title=1997: Lawrence 'killed by racists'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/14/newsid_2723000/2723721.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=14 February 1997|accessdate=4 January 2008[/tpl]
An internal review was opened in August 1993 by the Metropolitan Police.  On 16 April 1994, the Crown Prosecution Service stated they did not have sufficient evidence for murder charges against anyone else, despite a belief by the Lawrence family that new evidence had been found.

===Private prosecution===

In April 1994,[tpl]cite news|author=BBC News|title=Stephen Lawrence – timeline of events|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/stephen_lawrence/timeline.htm|publisher=BBC News|date=2 December 1999|accessdate=4 January 2008[/tpl]  Stephen Lawrence's family initiated a private prosecution against the initial two suspects and three others: Jamie Acourt, Gary Dobson and David Norris. The family were not entitled to legal aid and a fighting fund was established to pay for the analysis of forensic evidence and the cost of tracing and re-interviewing witnesses. The family were represented by counsel Michael Mansfield QC, Martin Soorjoo and Margo Boye who worked pro bono.[tpl]cite news|author="The Lawyer"|title=Funds pour in for Lawrence action|url=http://www.thelawyer.com/funds-pour-in-for-lawrence-action/84152.article|publisher=The Lawyer|date=5 February 1995|accessdate=10 June 2009[/tpl] The charges against Jamie Acourt and David Norris were dropped before the trial due to lack of evidence. On 23 April 1996, the three remaining suspects were acquitted of murder by a jury at the Central Criminal Court, after the trial judge, the Honourable Mr Justice Curtis, ruled that the identification evidence given by Duwayne Brooks was unreliable. The Macpherson report endorsed the judgement, stating that "Mr Justice Curtis could have properly reached only one conclusion" and that "there simply was no satisfactory evidence available".

===Subsequent events (1994–2010)===

An inquest into the death of Stephen Lawrence was held in February 1997. The five suspects refused to answer any questions, claiming privilege against self-incrimination.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/wall-of-silence-from-white-youths-at-lawrence-inquest-1278182.html |title=Wall of silence from white youths at Lawrence inquest |publisher=The Independent |date=12 February 1997 |accessdate=6 January 2012[/tpl] The inquest concluded on 13 February 1997, with the jury returning a verdict after 30 minutes' deliberation of unlawful killing "in a completely unprovoked racist attack by five white youths"; this finding went beyond the bounds of their instructions.Ailsen Daniels, Duncan Campbell, "'Unlawfully killed in an unprovoked racist attack by five white youths'", The Guardian, 14 February 1997, p. 1. On 14 February 1997, the Daily Mail newspaper labelled all five suspects "murderers". The headline read, "Murderers: The Mail accuses these men of killing. If we are wrong, let them sue us." Underneath this headline appeared pictures of the five suspects: Dobson, Neil and Jamie Acourt, Knight, and Norris.[tpl]cite news|last=Wright|first=Stephen|title=The Mail's victory: How Stephen Lawrence's killers were finally brought to justice years after our front page sensationally branded the evil pair murderers|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2080159/Stephen-Lawrence-case-How-killers-finally-brought-justice.html|accessdate=4 January 2012|newspaper=Daily Mail|date=3 January 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=British Library|title=Stephen Lawrence murder|url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/features/frontpage/lawrence.html|publisher=British Library|year=1997|accessdate=4 January 2008[/tpl] None of the men ever sued for defamation and strong public opinions rose against the accused and the police who handled the case.[tpl]cite news|last=Taylor|first=Adam|title=This Daily Mail Headline May Have Been Crucial in Putting Racist Murderers Behind Bars|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/stephen-lawrence-daily-mail-paul-dacre-2012-1|accessdate=4 January 2012|newspaper=Business Insider|date=3 January 2012[/tpl]
In 2002, David Norris and Neil Acourt were convicted and jailed for a racist attack on a plain-clothes black police officer.[tpl]cite news|author=BBC News|title=Lawrence pair jailed for race attack|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2240697.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=6 September 2002|accessdate=4 January 2008[/tpl] In 2005 the law changed. As part of the findings on the Lawrence case, the Macpherson Report recommended that double jeopardy (the ancient common law that once acquitted an accused person could not be tried for the same crime a second time) should be abrogated in murder cases, and that it should be possible to subject an acquitted murder suspect to a second trial if "fresh and viable" new evidence later came to light. The Law Commission later added its support to this in its report "Double Jeopardy and Prosecution Appeals" (2001). A parallel report into the criminal justice system by Lord Justice Auld, a past senior presiding judge for England and Wales, had also commenced in 1999 and was published as the Auld Report 6 months after the Law Commission report. It opined that the Law Commission had been unduly cautious by limiting the scope to murder and that "the exceptions should ... extend to other grave offences punishable with life and/or long terms of imprisonment as Parliament might specify."[tpl]cite web|title=A Review of the Criminal Courts of England and Wales by The Right Honourable Lord Justice Auld|url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http://www.criminal-courts-review.org.uk/|accessdate=5 January 2012|date=September 2001[/tpl]

Between the Lawrence murder and early 2010 Dobson was arrested or charged a number of times for offences such as theft and burglary. Some of these charges were dropped, at least one resulted in a small fine. None led to imprisonment.[tpl]cite news|author=Daily Mail|title=Justice at last: Thug accused of murdering Stephen Lawrence gets five years for drug dealing|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1293203/Stephen-Lawrence-murderer-Gary-Dobson-jailed-gets-years-drug-dealing.html|accessdate=3 January 2012|newspaper=Daily Mail|date=8 July 2010[/tpl] On 27 July 2006, the Daily Mail repeated its famous "Murderers" front page. In July 2010, Gary Dobson was jailed for five years for possessing and supplying 49 kg of class B drugs with a street value of around £350,000 (approximately US $540,000GBP:USD exchange rate on 23 February 2010, the time of the attempted drug deal: £1 = $1.5449, therefore £350,000 = approx. US $540,000). At the time of Dobson's sentencing for drug dealing, The Independent described the Lawrence killing – despite it having happened more than 17 years previously – as "one of the highest-profile unsolved racially motivated murders".

===Cold case review and new evidence===

In June 2006, a cold case review commenced, involving a full re-examination of the forensic evidence. Initially this was held in secrecy and not publicised;[tpl]cite news|last1=Dodd|first1=Vikram|last2=Hodgson|first2=Martin|title=Lawrence murder: new forensic clue|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/lawrence/Story/0,,2207231,00.html|publisher=Guardian Online|date=8 September 2007|accessdate=4 January 2008[/tpl] however, in November 2007, police confirmed they were investigating new scientific evidence.
The most important of the new evidence comprised:[tpl]cite news|title=Lawrence murder trial: the forensic evidence|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/lawrence-murder-trial-the-forensic-evidence|accessdate=5 January 2012|newspaper=Channel 4 News|date=3 January 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Stephen Lawrence murder: Dobson and Norris found guilty|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16257377|accessdate=5 January 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=3 January 2012[/tpl]
The police unit manager involved in the matter commented that the new evidence was only found because of scientific developments and developments in forensic approaches that had taken place since 1996 which allowed microscopic blood stains and hair fragments to be analysed for DNA and other microscopic evidence to be found and used forensically.

===2011–2012 trial===

Gary Dobson and David Norris were arrested and charged without publicity on 8 September 2010 and on 23 October 2010 the Director of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer QC, applied to the Court of Appeal  for Dobson's original acquittal to be quashed. Dobson was in prison at the time for drug dealing. Norris had not been previously acquitted, so no application was necessary in his case. For legal reasons – to protect the investigation and ensure a fair hearing – reporting restrictions were put in place at the commencement of these proceedings; the arrests and subsequent developments were not publicly reported at the time.
Dobson's acquittal was quashed following a two-day hearing on 11 and 12 April 2011, enabling his retrial.[tpl]cite web|title=R. v. Dobson,  EWCA Crim 1256|url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2011/1256.html|accessdate=5 January 2012[/tpl] On 18 May 2011, the Court of Appeal handed down its judgment and the reporting restrictions were partially lifted. It was announced by the Crown Prosecution Service that the two would face trial for Lawrence's murder in light of "new and substantial evidence". The judgment of the court stated that "if reliable, the new scientific evidence would place Dobson in very close proximity indeed to Stephen Lawrence at the moment of and in the immediate aftermath of the attack, proximity, moreover, for which no innocent explanation can be discerned". The ruling also emphasised that this was to be "a new trial of a defendant who, we repeat, is presumed in law to be innocent," and suggested a cautious and fact-based reporting style to avoid contempt of court or risk of prejudice to the future trial.
A jury was selected on 14 November 2011,[tpl]cite news|author=BBC News|title=Lawrence trial: Not jury's job to right racism – defence|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16302993|accessdate=3 January 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=22 December 2011[/tpl] and the trial, presided over by Mr Justice Treacy, began the next day at the Central Criminal Court.[tpl]cite news|author=BBC News|title=Stephen Lawrence: New evidence to be 'centre stage'|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15716320|publisher=BBC News|date=14 November 2011| accessdate=14 November 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|author=BBC News|title=Stephen Lawrence DNA 'found on defendants' clothes'|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/mobile/uk-15735026|publisher=BBC News|date=15 November 2011|accessdate=16 November 2011[/tpl] With the prosecution led by Mark Ellison QC, the case centred on the new forensic evidence and whether it demonstrated the defendant's involvement in the murder, or was the result of later contamination due to police handling. On 3 January 2012, Dobson and Norris were found guilty of Lawrence's murder. The two were sentenced on 4 January 2012 to detention at Her Majesty's Pleasure, equivalent to a life sentence for an adult, with minimum terms of 15 years and 2 months for Dobson and 14 years and 3 months for Norris.[tpl]cite news|author=BBC News|title=Stephen Lawrence murder: Dobson and Norris found guilty|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16347953|accessdate=3 January 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=3 January 2012[/tpl] Time spent on remand by Dobson was not deducted from his minimum term to ensure his existing sentence for drug-related offences was served. The judge's sentencing remarks were later published in full online.
The judge stated that the sentences reflected the fact that Dobson and Norris were juveniles at the time of the offence, which took place before the Criminal Justice Act 2003; the starting point for the minimum term was therefore 12 years. The judge acknowledged this was "lower than some might expect". A similar crime committed in 2011 as an adult would have justified a sentence with a starting point of 30 years for the minimum term.[tpl]cite web|title=CPS sentencing manual: Murder: Sentencing Legislation and Guidelines (24 February 2010 edition, current at 5 January 2012)|url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/sentencing_manual/murder/|publisher=Crown Prosecution Service|accessdate=5 January 2012[/tpl] (This is occasionally misreported as 25 years, the starting point for "bringing and using a weapon";[tpl]cite news|last=Laville|first=Sandra|title=Stephen Lawrence murder: Gary Dobson and David Norris await sentencing|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/jan/04/stephen-lawrence-murder-sentencing|accessdate=4 January 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=4 January 2012[/tpl] murder with racial motive incurs a higher 30-year starting point.)

On 5 January 2012, it was reported that the Attorney General was reviewing the minimum terms at the request of a member of the public, to determine whether he believed them to be "unduly lenient", and if so whether to apply to the Court of Appeal for an increase in the minimum terms.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16430633 |title=Stephen Lawrence: Attorney General to review sentences |publisher=BBC News |date=5 January 2012|accessdate=6 January 2012[/tpl] Juvenile minimum life sentences in a 2000 review (i.e. before the 2003 act passed into law) varied from a "most common" minimum of 10 years to a maximum of 20, placing Dobson and Norris in the middle of that range.

==Other inquiries and investigations==

===The Stephen Lawrence Inquiry===

On 31 July 1997, the Home Secretary Jack Straw ordered a public inquiry, to be conducted by Sir William Macpherson and officially titled "The Inquiry Into The Matters Arising From The Death of Stephen Lawrence".Cover letter upon completion of inquiry Its report, produced in February 1999, estimated that it had taken "more than 100,000 pages of reports, statements, and other written or printed documents"Report, ch.2, para 2.9 and concluded that the original Metropolitan Police Service investigation had been incompetent and that officers had committed fundamental errors, including: failing to give first aid when they reached the scene; failing to follow obvious leads during their investigation; and failing to arrest suspects. The report found that there had been a failure of leadership by senior MPS officers and that recommendations of the 1981 Scarman Report, compiled following race-related riots in Brixton and Toxteth, had been ignored.
Detective Superintendent Brian Weeden said during the inquiry that mistakes had been made in the murder investigation, including his own ignorance that he could have arrested the suspects four days after the killing simply on reasonable suspicion, a basic point of criminal law.
The report also found that the Metropolitan Police was institutionally racist.  A total of 70 recommendations for reform were made. These proposals included abolishing the double jeopardy rule and criminalising racist statements made in private. Macpherson also called for reform in the British Civil Service, local governments, the National Health Service, schools, and the judicial system, to address issues of institutional racism.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Holdaway|first1=Simon|last2=O'Neill|first2=Megan|title=Institutional Racism after Macpherson: An Analysis of Police Views|journal=Policing and Society|volume=16|issue=4|pages=349–369|year=2006|doi=10.1080/10439460600967885[/tpl]
The report was criticised at the time by Michael Gove (later Secretary of State for Education) in The Times, who said, "The tendentious reasoning and illiberal recommendations of that document have been brilliantly anatomised by the ethical socialists Norman Dennis and George Erdos and the Kurdish academic Ahmed al-Shahi in the Civitas pamphlet Racist Murder and Pressure Group Politics."[tpl]cite news|first=Michael|last=Gove|authorlink=Michael Gove|title=Be politically astute, not politically correct|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/article987478.ece|work=The Times |location=UK|date=10 October 2000|accessdate=2 May 2010[/tpl]

===Public complaints about mishandling of case===

In 1997, Lawrence's family registered a formal complaint with the Police Complaints Authority (PCA), which in 1999 exonerated the officers who had worked on the case of allegations of racism.  Only one officer, Detective Inspector Ben Bullock, was ordered to face disciplinary charges for neglect of duty. Bullock, who was second in command of the investigation, was later found guilty of failure to properly brief officers and failure to fully investigate an anonymous letter sent to police, but he was acquitted of 11 other charges. Four other officers who would have been charged as a result of the inquiry retired before it concluded.
Bullock retired the day after his punishment was announced, so that it amounted to a mere caution. Neville Lawrence, Stephen's father, criticised the punishment, saying that Bullock was "guilty on all counts." However, a spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police Federation stated that Bullock had been "largely vindicated" in the proceedings.[tpl]cite news|author=BBC News|title=Lawrence hearing a "whitewash"|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/393790.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=13 July 1999|accessdate=4 January 2008[/tpl]

===Concerns and inquiries of alleged police corruption and undercover officer conduct===

====Investigation into police corruption (2006)====

On 25 July 2006, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) announced that it had asked the Metropolitan Police to look into alleged claims of police corruption that may have helped hide the killers of Lawrence.
A BBC investigation alleged that the murder inquiry's Det. Sgt. John Davidson had taken money from known drug smuggler Clifford Norris, the father of David Norris, a chief suspect in the investigation.[tpl]cite news|author=BBC News|title=Lawrence case 'corruption' probe|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/5214644.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=26 July 2006|accessdate=4 January 2008[/tpl] Neil Putnam, a former corrupt police detective turned whistleblower, told a BBC investigation that Clifford Norris was paying Mr Davidson to obstruct the case and to protect the suspects. "Davidson told me that he was looking after Norris and that to me meant that he was protecting him, protecting his family against arrest and any conviction," Putnam said. Davidson denied any such corruption.
The Metropolitan Police Service announced that it was to open up a special incident room to field calls from the public, following the BBC documentary The Boys Who Killed Stephen Lawrence. The Independent Police Complaints Commission later stated that the claims made in the programme were unfounded.[tpl]cite news|author=BBC News|title='No corruption' in Lawrence case|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7043064.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=13 November 2007|accessdate=4 January 2008[/tpl]

On 17 December 2009, Independent Police Complaints Commission investigators and officers from the Metropolitan Police's directorate of professional standards arrested a former police constable and a serving member of Metropolitan Police staff on suspicion of attempting to pervert the course of justice by allegedly withholding evidence from the original murder inquiry, the Kent investigation and the Macpherson inquiry. Dr Richard Stone, who sat on the Macpherson inquiry, commented that the panel had felt that there was "a large amount of information that the police were either not processing or were suppressing" and "a strong smell of corruption". Baroness Ros Howells, patron of the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust, agreed: "Lots of people said they gave the police evidence which was never produced."[tpl]cite news|last1=Laville|first1=Sandra|last2=Muir|first2=Hugh|title=Stephen Lawrence case pair arrested over evidence 'withheld' since murder|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/dec/18/stephen-lawrence-case-evidence-withheld|work=The Guardian |location=UK|date=18 December 2009|accessdate=2 May 2010[/tpl] On 1 March 2010 the IPCC announced that "No further action will be taken against the two men arrested following concerns identified by the internal Metropolitan police service (MPS) review of the murder of Stephen Lawrence" and the two were released from bail.[tpl]cite news|last=Davies|first=Caroline|title=No action over 'hidden evidence' claims in Stephen Lawrence murder case|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2010/mar/01/stephen-lawrence-hidden-evidence-claim|work=The Guardian |location=UK|date=1 March 2010|accessdate=10 January 2011[/tpl]

====Revelations about undercover police conduct (2013)====

On 23 June 2013, an interview with Peter Francis, a former under-cover police officer, was published in The Guardian. In the interview Francis disclosed that while he was working undercover within an anti-racist campaign group in the mid-1990s, he was constantly pressured by superiors to "smear" the credibilities of the family of Lawrence so as to put an end to campaigns for a better investigation into Lawrence's death.[tpl]cite web|title=Stephen Lawrence family and friends targeted by police 'smear' campaign|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2013/jun/23/stephen-lawrence-undercover-police-smears|work=The Guardian|date=23 June 2013|first=Rob|last=Evans|first2=Paul|last2=Lewis|authorlink2=Paul Lewis (journalist)|accessdate=23 June 2013[/tpl] After the revelation, Theresa May, the UK's home secretary pledged to be "ruthless about purging corruption from the police", and Prime Minister David Cameron ordered Police to investigate the allegations, saying of them that he was "deeply worried about the reports".[tpl]cite news|last=Mason|first=Rowena|title=Home Secretary pledges to 'purge corruption' from police after Stephen Lawrence family smear allegations|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/10139347/Home-Secretary-pledges-to-purge-corruption-from-police-after-Stephen-Lawrence-family-smear-allegations.html|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=25 June 2013|date=24 June 2013[/tpl] Chief Constable Mick Creedon, who is leading Operation Herne, an ongoing inquiry into Metropolitan police undercover operations against protest groups, said he would investigate the allegations as part of the inquiry.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2013/jun/24/undercover-officers-police-chief-met|title=Dozens of undercover officers could face prosecution, says police chief|work=The Guardian|date=24 June 2013|first=Paul|last=Lewis | authorlink = Paul Lewis (journalist)|first2=Rob|last2=Evans|accessdate=25 June 2013[/tpl]

====The Stephen Lawrence Independent Review (2014)====

Following the 2012 convictions, further inquiries by both Scotland Yard and the Independent Police Complaints Commission ruled that there was no new evidence to warrant further investigation. After discussions with Doreen Lawrence, Home Secretary Theresa May commissioned Mark Ellison QC to review Scotland Yard's investigations into alleged police corruption.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/lawrence-murder-police-corruption-will-be-investigated-7811117.html|title=May defies Met to order inquiry after Independent campaign|author=Andrew Grice & Paul Peachey|publisher=The Independent|date=2 June 2012|accessdate=7 March 2014[/tpl]

==Legacy and recognition==

An annual architectural award, the Stephen Lawrence Prize, was established by the Royal Institute of British Architects in Lawrence's memory.
His mother, Doreen Lawrence, said, "I would like Stephen to be remembered as a young man who had a future. He was well loved, and had he been given the chance to survive maybe he would have been the one to bridge the gap between black and white because he didn't distinguish between black or white. He saw people as people."
In 1995 a memorial plaque was set into the pavement at the spot where he was killed on Well Hall Road. The plaque has been vandalised several times since then.[tpl]cite web|title=Smashed glass bottle on Stephen Lawrence plaque in Eltham |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-15153119|publisher=BBC|date=3 October 2011|accessdate=7 June 2013[/tpl]
