[[Zschirnsteine]]

CATEGORIES: Mountains under 1000 metres, Mountains of Saxon Switzerland, Reinhardtsdorf-Schöna

The Zschirnsteine are two prominent table mountains near Kleingießhübel in the municipality of Reinhardtsdorf-Schöna, about 7 km south of the German resort of Bad Schandau in the Elbe Sandstone Mountains. They lie west of the River Elbe and not far north of the Czech border.
The 561 m high Großer Zschirnstein ("Great Zschirnstein") is the highest hill in Saxon Switzerland.
The Kleiner Zschirnstein ("Little Zschirnstein") is also a sandstone table mountain. It is 473 m high and lies north of the Großer Zschirnstein.  
Both tables lie in the midst of a forest and may be climbed on foot. They offer extensive views of the Elbe Sandstone Mountains and beyond. A good base for walking to the hills is the Panoramahotel Wolfsberg near the village of Reinhardtsdorf.
