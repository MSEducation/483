Les Dayman (born 28 October 1901, date of death unknown) was an Australian rules footballer who played for Port Adelaide in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL) and Footscray in the Victorian Football League (VFL). 

==Career==

Dayman started his career at Port Adelaide in 1921, who he arrived from Salisbury, and was a member of their premiership team that year. He played beside his brother Clem at the club during the 1920s and was used mostly as a ruckman or in the key forward positions. On three occasions Dayman won Port Adelaide's 'Best and fairest' award and also topped their goal-kicking four times. He was the league's top goal-kicker in 1929 with 86 goals.
A regular South Australian interstate representative, he made a total of 19 appearances and kicked 30 goals for his state. 
Footscray acquired his services in 1932 and he had a solid first season, kicking a bag of five against Fitzroy in just his second game and topping the club's goal-kicking with 37 majors.
Following the end of his three year VFL stint, Dayman played briefly at Coburg in the Victorian Football Association (VFA). He returned to Port Adelaide in 1937, making one further appearance for the seniors and going on to serve the club in an off field capacity.

==Honours==

In 2002 he was one of the inaugural inductees into the South Australian Football Hall of Fame. He is also a centre half forward in Port Adelaide's official 'Greatest Team', which took into account the period 1870 to 2000.
