Margaret E. Snyder is an American politician from California and a member of the Democratic Party.  A former legal secretary and community volunteer, she served on the Modesto School Board from 1985 until 1992, when she won election to the newly created 25th district in the California State Assembly.California Journal Vol. XXIII, No.12 (December 1992) "Complete District By District Results".  StateNet Publications, December 1992.  
She entered the legislature with a relatively liberal record from her years on the school board.  She quickly cultivated her conservative Central Valley district, however, as exemplified by her 100 percent rating from the NRA.California Journal Vol. XXV, No.10 (October 1994) "Election Preview".  StateNet Publications, October 1994.   Nevertheless, Snyder was unable to win reelection in 1994, when Republicans enjoyed huge wins across the country.  She lost to Republican George House, a retired CHP commander and almond farmer, who at the time was considered a weak candidate.California Journal Vol. XXV, No.12 (December 1994) "Complete Election Results".
