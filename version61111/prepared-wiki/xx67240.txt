[[Affine combination]]

CATEGORIES: Affine geometry

In mathematics, an affine combination of vectors x1, ..., xn is a vector 
called a linear combination of x1, ..., xn, in which the sum of the coefficients is 1, thus:
This concept is important, for example, in Euclidean geometry.
The act of taking an affine combination commutes with any affine transformation T in the sense that
When a stochastic matrix, A, acts on a column vector, B, the result is a column vector whose entries are affine combinations of B with coefficients from the rows in A.
