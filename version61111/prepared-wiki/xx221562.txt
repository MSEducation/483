[[Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria]]

CATEGORIES: States and territories established in 1914, Former colonies in Africa, Colonial Nigeria

The Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria was created as a merger of Northern Nigeria Protectorate and Southern Nigeria Protectorate on 1 January 1914, due to growing tension with the German colonies.
As one of the wealthiest British colonies, it was a good candidate for being the first colony to be granted independence.  Nigeria was first given increased autonomy as the Federation of Nigeria on 1 October 1954 and made fully independent in 1960.
