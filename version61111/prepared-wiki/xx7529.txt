The largest ethnic group are Dhivehis, native to the historic region of the Maldive Islands comprising today's Republic of Maldives and the island of Minicoy in Union territory of Lakshadweep, India. They share the same culture and speak the Dhivehi language. They are principally an Indo-Aryan people, closely related to the Sinhalese having traces of Arab, Malay, South Indian and African genes in the population.
In the past there was also a small population known as the Giraavaru people. This group have now been almost completely absorbed into the larger Maldivian society but were once native to the island of Giraavaru (Kaafu Atoll).

==Languages==

Dhivehi or Maldivian, a language closely related to Sinhala and written in a specialized Arabic script (TƒÅna), is the official language and is spoken by virtually the whole population. English is also spoken as a second language by many.

==Religion==

Originally the Maldivians were Buddhists who converted to Sunni Islam in the mid-12th century. Sunni Islam is now the only accepted religion, though there are small numbers of others, particularly Buddhist workers from Sri Lanka and Hindus from India. There are also 300 Christians.
