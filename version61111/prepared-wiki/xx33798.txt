==Acting career==

===Early career===

During the 1960s, Farrell guest-starred in a few series. Notable roles included Federal Agent Modell in the episode "Monkee Chow Mein" on The Monkees in 1967; astronaut Arland in the episode "Genie, Genie, Who's Got the Genie?" on I Dream of Jeannie; and an Army doctor in the episode "The Bankroll" of Combat!. In 1968, he originated the continuing role of Scott Banning in the NBC soap opera Days of our Lives. In 1970, he starred as one of the young doctors in the CBS prime-time series The Interns, in a cast led by Broderick Crawford. In 1971, he played the assistant to Anthony Quinn in ABC's The Man and the City. In 1973, while under contract to Universal Studios, Farrell starred with Robert Foxworth in The Questor Tapes. During the years under contract, he guest starred in a number of shows, including Banacek and Marcus Welby, M.D.; and starred in a television pilot with Jane Wyman, one which did not sell.  Farrell also had a cameo role in the 1967 classic The Graduate.[tpl]IMDb name|268286[/tpl]

===M*A*S*H (1975–83) and later roles===

Farrell's big break came in 1975 when Wayne Rogers unexpectedly departed M*A*S*H at the end of the third season. Farrell was quickly recruited for the newly created role of B.J. Hunnicutt, along with co-series' lead, Harry Morgan, who replaced McLean Stevenson, also at the end of the third season, opposite Alan Alda. The most coincidental thing is both Morgan and Farrell were big fans of the M*A*S*H series during its early seasons before they both joined the cast, with Morgan having also appeared as "General Bartford Hamilton Steele" in the season-three episode "The General Flipped at Dawn" (for which he won an Emmy Award for Best Guest Role in a Primetime Comedy Series).[tpl]IMDb name|604702|section=bio|Harry Morgan[/tpl] He stayed with the series for its remaining eight years on the air. During that time, Farrell wrote five episodes and directed four.
His favorite episode is “The Interview.”
In a recent interview, Farrell discussed the byplay between his M*A*S*H co-stars, David Ogden Stiers and Harry Morgan: "David was like a rock, when he was concentrating, when he was being Charles Emerson Winchester III, you just couldn't get him, except for Harry Morgan. Harry could look at David and reduce him to a puddle of tears without turning an eye. David said, 'When he Harry looks at me and flares those nostrils; and he would be gone,' it would be such a wonderful thing to see this great big guy just reduced to a giggling idiot by Harry. Unfortunately, all I can do is to tell you, we had great fun doing the show; and much of it was laughing at some silly gag that one of us had pulled on the others."http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpXBSL5yiYc Farrell continued to stay in touch or to have dinner with his on-screen commanding officer, until Morgan's death on December 7, 2011. Farrell said of his TV commanding officer's death: "He was an imp. As Alan once said, there's not an un-adorable bone in the man's body. He was full of fun, and he was smart as a whip."http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/45584920/ns/today-entertainment/t/m-a-s-h-star-harry-morgan-dies-age/?fb_ref=.Tu9KoFpKtlE.like&fb_source=timeline Prior to Morgan's death, he also added of his mentor's six-decade career: "He was one of the foundational pieces of the industry. Such honors routinely go to stars, but also belong to Morgan and other character actors who provide 'the grit and the substance and the context' for so many films and TV shows," to sum it up, he stated: "Harry has been that, par excellence, for many years."[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/08/harry-morgan-death-his-in_n_1136542.html | work=Huffington Post | title=Harry Morgan Death: His Influence In TV And Movies | date=December 8, 2011[/tpl]

==Political activism==

Even before he was well-known, Farrell was an activist for many political and social causes. He was co-chair of the California Human Rights Watch for ten years, was on the Board of Advisors of the original Cult Awareness Network, and has been president of Death Penalty Focus for more than ten years,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mikefarrell.org/activist/humanrights.html |title=Mike Farrell Online |publisher=Mikefarrell.org |date=March 1, 2004 |accessdate=May 17, 2011[/tpl] being the first person to be awarded its Human Rights Award, subsequently named after him in 2006.  He received PETA's Humanitarian Award in 2001, and narrated a public service campaign for them about animal abuse."Awards," MikeFerrell.org, accessed May 9, 2012."Animal Protection Group Offers Reward To Nab Dog Torturer, Killer," Walker County Messenger, August 29, 2003.
In 1985, Farrell was in Central America, helping refugees from the civil war in El Salvador. A guerrilla commander, Nidia Diaz, had been taken prisoner. She needed surgery, but no Salvadoran doctor dared to help her, so Amnesty International recruited a foreign doctor. Farrell was present as an observer, but was in his words, "shanghaied into assisting with the surgery" when the doctor said his help was needed. The in-prison surgery was successful and Diaz went on to be one of the signatories of the Chapultepec Peace Accords (the peace treaty ending the war). She also served in the Legislative Assembly of El Salvador and in the Central American Parliament.[tpl]Cite news|last =Varble |first =Bill|title =Author to share his journey of activism|newspaper =Mail Tribune|date =March 17, 2007|url = http://archive.mailtribune.com/archive/2007/0317/local/stories/farrell-bv.htm[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last =Farrell|first =Mike |title =Cuba, Today |publisher =Mike Farrell Online|date =October 22, 1994 |url =http://www.mikefarrell.org/Journals/Cuba3.html|accessdate =July 16, 2007[/tpl]
