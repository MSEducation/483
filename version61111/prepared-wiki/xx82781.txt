==History==

Franing Field, the site of the present Quad City International Airport, was picked as an ideal flying field, with [tpl]convert|120|acre|ha|0[/tpl] of level, grassy land free of obstacles.  The airport made headlines right at the start, chosen as a control point for the first coast-to-coast flight in the fall of 1919.  On August 18, 1927 an estimated 10,000 people came to welcome  Charles Lindbergh in Moline and his famous plane, the Spirit of St. Louis on the Gugenheim tour, a cross-country commercial aviation promotion tour.  In 1929 Phoebe Omlie set an altitude record above the airport in a Velie Monocoupe, the only plane ever manufactured in Moline, which still hangs in the passenger terminal.  In 1947 the Metropolitan Airport Authority of Rock Island County was formed after seven townships voted to establish it.  In 1957 the first count of enplaning and deplaning passengers was made with a total of 59,701 recorded. The airport underwent major remodeling in 1961 and 1968, adding everything from baggage claim to a restaurant and boarding areas.  The present airport terminal was completed in 1985, after studies showed that an addition to the 1954 structure would be more costly than an entirely new terminal. The shift to the new $11 million terminal allowed expansion of airline facilities; between 1979 and 1986, the number of airlines increased from two to seven.[tpl]cite news|author= Sarah Hayes|title=A Q-C Century - Progress 99: A brief history of the Quad City Airport |publisher=The Dispatch / The Rock Island Argus|year= 1999|url= http://www.qconline.com/progress99/4airport.shtml|accessdate=2012-06-23[/tpl]

In 2001 the terminal underwent a major renovation and expansion: two new concourses, a larger baggage claim area, new restaurants and gift shops. The project doubled the size of the passenger terminal. The Philadelphia architectural firm DPK&A designed the new concourses.
A larger U.S. Customs and Border Protection Facility was opened in 2014 in a former air cargo building.  The facility processes international passengers arriving on general aviation flights.  It includes a processing room, an interview room, space for agricultural inspections, office space, and holding cells for passengers who are prohibited from entering the U.S. or who are being detained and transported by law enforcement.[tpl]cite news|author=Jennifer DeWitt|title=New customs facility opens at Q-C airport|publisher=Quad-City Times|date=2014-04-22|url=http://qctimes.com/business/new-customs-facility-opens-at-q-c-airport/article_0972fdbf-d4d7-528b-9432-9244c3e475db.html|accessdate=2014-04-23[/tpl]   Phase two of the project will renovate the remainder of the building to create an international terminal should the airport establish direct international commercial flights. Gere-Dismer Architects of Rock Island designed the facility.
