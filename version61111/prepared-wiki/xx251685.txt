==History==

Klein Tools was founded in 1857 in Chicago, Illinois by German immigrant Mathias Klein.[tpl]cite web|last=Murphy|first=H. Lee|title=Pliers Poker|work=Crain's Chicago Business|url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/19960706/ISSUE01/10006963|date=1996-07-08|accessdate=2014-03-12[/tpl] The first tool Klein made was a pair of side-cutting pliers for a telegraph lineman. The company grew as the telegraph and eventually telephone and electrical industries grew after the Civil War by adding an additional 100 types of pliers in the 1910s. From the 1960s-1980s, the company expanded their product line to include leather and canvas products, occupational safety equipment, hex key wrenches, screwdrivers, nut drivers, as well as electrical terminals and connectors.
