Independent Monitoring Boards (IMB) are statutory bodies established by the Prison Act 1952 to monitor the welfare of prisoners in the UK to ensure that they are properly cared for within Prison and Immigration Centre rules, whilst in custody and detention.  Their responsibilities were extended to Immigration Removal Centres by the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 following an inspection in 1989 of what was then Harmondsworth Detention Centre.
Until April 2003, IMBs in prisons were known as Boards of Visitors and IMBs in immigration removal centres were known as Visiting Committees.  
Boards consist of members of the public who are unpaid volunteers who are appointed by the Minister of Justice to fulfill this task. Each Board reports Annually to the Justice Minister with all their findings and at other times regarding matters of serious concern. The success rate of applicants is about 50%.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2006-01-19d.16382.h|title=Independent Monitoring Boards- Written Question|date=19 January 2006|publisher=Hansard|accessdate=2007-11-30[/tpl]    There are on average between 15 to 20 volunteers per institution.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2006-01-19d.16380.h|date=19 January 2006|title=Independent Monitoring Board - Written Question|publisher=Hansard|accessdate=2007-11-30[/tpl]  Most members serve more than three years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2005-12-12c.16381.h|accessdate=2006-01-19|title=Independent Monitoring Boards -- Written Question|publisher=Hansard|accessdate=2007-11-30[/tpl]
