Sodium is a chemical element with the symbol Na (from [tpl]lang-la|natrium[/tpl]) and atomic number 11. It is a soft, silver-white, highly reactive metal and is a member of the alkali metals; its only stable isotope is 23Na. The free metal does not occur in nature, but instead must be prepared from its compounds; it was first isolated by Humphry Davy in 1807 by the electrolysis of sodium hydroxide. Sodium is the sixth most abundant element in the Earth's crust, and exists in numerous minerals such as feldspars, sodalite and rock salt (NaCl). Many salts of sodium are highly water-soluble, and their sodium has been leached by the action of water so that sodium and chlorine (Cl) are the most common dissolved elements by weight in the Earth's bodies of oceanic water.
Many sodium compounds are useful, such as sodium hydroxide (lye) for soap-making, and sodium chloride for use as a de-icing agent and a nutrient (edible salt). Sodium is an essential element for all animals and some plants. In animals, sodium ions are used against potassium ions to build up charges on cell membranes, allowing transmission of nerve impulses when the charge is dissipated. The consequent need of animals for sodium causes it to be classified as a dietary inorganic macro-mineral.

==Characteristics==

===Physical===

Sodium at standard temperature and pressure is a soft, silvery metal that can be readily cut with a knife, and is a good conductor of electricity. These properties change dramatically at elevated pressures: at 1.5 Mbar, the color changes from silvery metallic to black; at 1.9 Mbar the material becomes transparent, with a red color; and at 3 Mbar sodium is a clear and transparent solid. All of these high-pressure allotropes are insulators and electrides.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Gatti|first1=M.|last2=Tokatly|first2=I.|last3=Rubio|first3=A.|year=2010|title=Sodium: A Charge-Transfer Insulator at High Pressures|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=104|issue=21|pages=216–404|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.104.216404|bibcode=2010PhRvL.104u6404G|arxiv = 1003.0540 [/tpl]
When sodium or its compounds are introduced into a flame, they turn it yellow,[tpl]cite book|last=Schumann|first=Walter|title=Minerals of the World|date=5 August 2008|publisher=Sterling|isbn=978-1-4027-5339-8|edition=2nd|page=28|oclc=637302667[/tpl] because the excited 3s electrons of sodium emit a photon when they fall from 3p to 3s; the wavelength of this photon corresponds to the D line at 589.3 nm. Spin-orbit interactions involving the electron in the 3p orbital split the D line into two; hyperfine structures involving both orbitals cause many more lines.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Citron|first1=M. L.|last2=Gabel|first2=C.|last3=Stroud|first3=C.|year=1977|title=Experimental Study of Power Broadening in a Two-Level Atom|journal=Physical Review A|volume=16|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.16.1507|page=1507|issue=4|bibcode=1977PhRvA..16.1507C|last4=Stroud|first4=C.[/tpl]

===Chemical===

When freshly cut, sodium has a bright, silvery luster. If exposed to air, the surface rapidly tarnishes, darkening at first and then forming a white coating of sodium hydroxide and sodium carbonate.
Sodium is generally less reactive than potassium and more reactive than lithium.[tpl]cite web|last=De Leon|first=N|title=Reactivity of Alkali Metals|url=http://www.iun.edu/~cpanhd/C101webnotes/modern-atomic-theory/alkali-reac.html|publisher=Indiana University Northwest|accessdate=2007-12-07[/tpl] Like all the alkali metals, it reacts exothermically with water, to the point that sufficiently large pieces melt to a sphere and may explode; this reaction produces caustic sodium hydroxide and flammable hydrogen gas. When burned in dry air, it mainly forms sodium peroxide as well as some sodium oxide. In moist air, sodium hydroxide results.[tpl]Greenwood&Earnshaw2nd[/tpl] Sodium metal is highly reducing, with the reduction of sodium ions requiring −2.71 volts.[tpl]cite book|last1=Atkins|first1=Peter W.|last2=de Paula|first2=Julio|title=Physical Chemistry|year=2002|edition=7th|publisher=W. H. Freeman|isbn=978-0-7167-3539-7|oclc=3345182[/tpl]  Hence, the extraction of sodium metal from its compounds (such as with sodium chloride) uses a significant amount of energy.  However, potassium and lithium have even more negative potentials.[tpl]cite book|last=Davies|first=Julian A.|title=Synthetic Coordination Chemistry: Principles and Practice|year=1996|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-981-02-2084-6|oclc=717012347|page=293[/tpl]

===Isotopes===

20 isotopes of sodium are known, but only 23Na is stable. Two radioactive, cosmogenic isotopes are the byproduct of cosmic ray spallation: 22Na with a half-life of 2.6 years and 24Na with a half-life of 15 hours; all other isotopes have a half-life of less than one minute.[tpl]cite journal| last=Audi|first=Georges|title=The NUBASE Evaluation of Nuclear and Decay Properties| journal=Nuclear Physics A|volume=729|pages=3–128|year=2003| doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001| bibcode=2003NuPhA.729....3A| last2=Bersillon| first2=O.| last3=Blachot| first3=J.| last4=Wapstra| first4=A.H.[/tpl] Two nuclear isomers have been discovered, the longer-lived one being 24mNa with a half-life of around 20.2 microseconds. Acute neutron radiation, such as from a nuclear criticality accident, converts some of the stable 23Na in human blood to 24Na; by measuring the concentration of 24Na in relation to 23Na, the neutron radiation dosage of the victim can be calculated.[tpl]cite journal|title=Neutron Activation of Sodium in Anthropomorphous Phantoms|journal=HealthPhysics| volume=8|issue=4| pages=371–379| year=1962| last1=Sanders| first1=F.

===Occurrence===

23Na is created in the carbon-burning process in stars by fusing two carbon atoms together; this requires temperatures above 600 megakelvins and a star of at least three solar masses.[tpl]cite journal|bibcode=1987SvAL...13..214D|title= Sodium Synthesis in Hydrogen Burning Stars|last1=Denisenkov |first=P. A.|last2=Ivanov|first2=V. V.|volume=13| year=1987|page= 214|journal=Soviet Astronomy Letters[/tpl] The Earth's crust contains 2.6% sodium by weight, making it the sixth most abundant element on Earth.[tpl]RubberBible86th[/tpl] Because of its high reactivity, it is never found as a pure element. It is found in many different minerals, some very soluble, such as halite and natron, others much less soluble such as amphibole, and zeolite.  The insolubility of certain sodium minerals such as cryolite and feldspar arises from their polymeric anions, which in the case of feldspar is a polysilicate. In the interstellar medium, sodium is identified by the D spectral line; though it has a high vaporization temperature, its abundance allowed it to be detected by Mariner 10 in Mercury's atmosphere.[tpl]cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1200/is_v128/ai_3898126|date= 1985-08-17|first=Dietrick E.|last= Tjrhonsen|accessdate=2008-09-18|title=Sodium found in Mercury's atmosphere|publisher=BNET[/tpl]

==Compounds==

Sodium compounds are of immense commercial importance, being particularly central to industries producing glass, paper, soap, and textiles. The sodium compounds that are the most important include table salt (NaCl), soda ash (Na2CO3), baking soda (NaHCO3), caustic soda (NaOH), sodium nitrate (NaNO3), di- and tri-sodium phosphates, sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3·5H2O), and borax (Na2B4O7·10H2O). In its compounds, sodium is usually ionically bonded to water and anions, and is viewed as a hard Lewis acid.[tpl]cite book|last=Cowan|first=James A.|title=Inorganic Biochemistry: An Introduction|year=1997|publisher=Wiley-VCH|isbn=978-0-471-18895-7|page=7|oclc=34515430[/tpl]
Most soaps are sodium salts of fatty acids. Sodium soaps are harder (higher melting) soaps than potassium soaps.[tpl]cite book|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=1985|edition=91–100|pages=931–943|isbn=3-11-007511-3|title=Lehrbuch der Anorganischen Chemie|last1=Holleman|first1=Arnold F.|last2=Wiberg|first2=Egon|last3=Wiberg|first3=Nils|language=German|chapter=Natrium[/tpl] Sodium chloride is extensively used for anti-icing and de-icing and as a preservative; sodium bicarbonate is mainly used for cooking. Along with potassium, many important medicines have sodium added to improve their bioavailability; although in most cases potassium is the better ion, sodium is selected for its lower price and atomic weight.[tpl]cite book|last=Remington|first=Joseph P.|title=Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy|year=2006|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|isbn=978-0-7817-4673-1|pages=365–366|edition=21st|editor-last=Beringer|editor-first=Paul|oclc=60679584[/tpl]Sodium hydride is used as a base for various reactions (such as the aldol reaction) in organic chemistry, and as a reducing agent in inorganic chemistry.[tpl]cite book|last1=Wiberg|first1=Egon|last2=Wiberg|first2=Nils|last3=Holleman|first3=A. F.|title=Inorganic Chemistry|year=2001|publisher=Academic Press|pages=1103–1104|url=http://books.google.com.sg/books?id=Mtth5g59dEIC&pg=PA1103|isbn=978-0-12-352651-9|oclc=48056955[/tpl]

===Aqueous solutions===

Sodium tends to form water-soluble compounds, such as halides, sulfates, nitrates, carboxylates and carbonates. The main aqueous species are the aquo complexes Na(H2O)n+, where n = 4–6.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1016/B0-08-043748-6/01055-0|title=Comprehensive Coordination Chemistry II|year=2004|isbn=978-0-08-043748-4|page=515|chapter=Metal Aqua Ions[/tpl]  The high affinity of sodium for oxygen-based ligands is the basis of crown ethers; macrolide antibiotics, which interfere with Na+ transport in the infecting organism, are functionally related and more complex.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]
Direct precipitation of sodium salts from aqueous solutions is rare, because sodium salts typically have a high affinity for water; an exception is sodium bismuthate (NaBiO3).[tpl]cite book|title=Lange's Handbook of Chemistry|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1998|isbn=0-07-016384-7|last1=Dean|first1=John Aurie|last2=Lange|first2=Norbert Adolph[/tpl] Because of this, sodium salts are usually isolated as solids by evaporation or by precipitation with an organic solvent, such as ethanol; for example, only 0.35 g/L of sodium chloride will dissolve in ethanol.[tpl]cite book|last=Burgess|first= J.|title=Metal Ions in Solution|publisher=Ellis Horwood|location=New York|year=1978|isbn=0-85312-027-7[/tpl] Crown ethers, like 15-crown-5, may be used as a phase-transfer catalyst.[tpl]cite book|last1=Starks|first1=Charles M.|last2=Liotta|first2=Charles L.|last3=Halpern|first3=Marc|title=Phase-Transfer Catalysis: Fundamentals, Applications, and Industrial Perspectives|year=1994|publisher=Chapman & Hall|page=162|isbn=978-0-412-04071-9|oclc=28027599[/tpl]
Sodium content in bulk may be determined by treating with a large excess of uranyl zinc acetate; the hexahydrate (UO2)2ZnNa(CH3CO2)·6H2O precipitates, which can be weighed. Caesium and rubidium do not interfere with this reaction, but potassium and lithium do.[tpl]cite journal|journal=J. Am. Chem. Soc.|doi=10.1021/ja01386a008|year=1929|last1=Barber|first1=H.

===Electrides and sodides===

Like the other alkali metals, sodium dissolves in ammonia and some amines to give deeply coloured solutions; evaporation of these solutions leaves a shiny film of metallic sodium. The solutions contain the coordination complex (Na(NH3)6)+, whose positive charge is counterbalanced by electrons as anions; cryptands permit the isolation of these complexes as crystalline solids. Cryptands, like crown ethers and other ionophores, have a high affinity for the sodium ion; derivatives of the alkalide Na- are obtainable[tpl]cite journal|journal=J. Am. Chem.

===Organosodium compounds===

Many organosodium compounds have been prepared. Because of the high polarity of the C-Na bonds, they behave like sources of carbanions (salts with organic anions). Some well known derivatives include sodium cyclopentadienide (NaC5H5) and trityl sodium ((C6H5)3CNa).[tpl]OrgSynth |first1=W. B. | last1=Renfrow, Jr |first2= C.

==History==

Salt has been an important commodity in human activities, as shown by the English word salary, which derives from salarium, the wafers of salt sometimes given to Roman soldiers along with their other wages. In medieval Europe, a compound of sodium with the Latin name of sodanum was used as a headache remedy. The name sodium is thought to originate from the Arabic suda (صداع), meaning headache, as the headache-alleviating properties of sodium carbonate or soda were well known in early times.[tpl]cite book|last=Newton|first=David E.|editor-last=Baker|editor-first=Lawrence W.|title=Chemical Elements|year=1999|isbn=978-0-7876-2847-5|oclc=39778687[/tpl] The chemical abbreviation for sodium was first published by Jöns Jakob Berzelius in his system of atomic symbols,[tpl]cite web|url=http://elements.vanderkrogt.net/element.php?sym=Na|title=Elementymology & Elements Multidict|first = Peter|last = van der Krogt|accessdate=2007-06-08[/tpl] and is a contraction of the element's New Latin name natrium, which refers to the Egyptian natron, a natural mineral salt primarily made of hydrated sodium carbonate. Natron historically had several important industrial and household uses, later eclipsed by other sodium compounds. Although sodium, sometimes called soda, had long been recognised in compounds, the metal itself was not isolated until 1807 by Sir Humphry Davy through the electrolysis of sodium hydroxide.[tpl]cite journal|first=Humphry|last=Davy|title=On some new phenomena of chemical changes produced by electricity, particularly the decomposition of the fixed alkalies, and the exhibition of the new substances which constitute their bases; and on the general nature of alkaline bodies|year=1808|volume=98|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London|pages=1–44|url=http://books.google.com/?id=gpwEAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA57|doi=10.1098/rstl.1808.0001[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1021/ed009p1035|title=The discovery of the elements.

Sodium imparts an intense yellow color to flames. As early as 1860, Kirchhoff and Bunsen noted the high sensitivity of a sodium flame test, and stated in Annalen der Physik und Chemie:[tpl]cite journal|doi =10.1002/andp.18601860602| title=Chemische Analyse durch Spectralbeobachtungen|year=1860 |last1=Kirchhoff |first1=G.|last2=Bunsen|first2=R. |journal=Annalen der Physik und Chemie |volume=186|issue=6 |pages=161–189|bibcode=1860AnP...186..161K[/tpl]

==Commercial production==

Enjoying rather specialized applications, only about 100,000 tonnes of metallic sodium are produced annually. Metallic sodium was first produced commercially in 1855 by carbothermal reduction of sodium carbonate at 1100 °C,[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl] in what is known as the Deville process:[tpl]cite journal|last1=Eggeman |first1=Tim|title=Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2007 |doi=10.1002/0471238961.1915040912051311.a01.pub3|chapter=Sodium and Sodium Alloys|last2=Updated By Staff|isbn=0-471-23896-1[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|jstor=27757153|pages=205–221 |last1=Oesper|first1=R.

A related process based on the reduction of sodium hydroxide was developed in 1886.
Sodium is now produced commercially through the electrolysis of molten sodium chloride, based on a process patented in 1924.Pauling, Linus, General Chemistry, 1970 ed., Dover Publications[tpl]cite web|url=http://periodic.lanl.gov/11.shtml|title=Los Alamos National Laboratory – Sodium|accessdate=2007-06-08[/tpl] This is done in a Downs cell in which the NaCl is mixed with calcium chloride to lower the melting point below 700 °C. As calcium is less electropositive than sodium, no calcium will be deposited at the cathode. This method is less expensive than the previous Castner process of electrolyzing sodium hydroxide.
Reagent-grade sodium in tonne quantities sold for about US$3.30/kg in 2009; lower purity metal sells for considerably less.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl] The market for sodium is volatile due to the difficulty in its storage and shipping; it must be stored under a dry inert gas atmosphere or anhydrous mineral oil to prevent the formation of a surface layer of sodium oxide or sodium superoxide. These oxides can react violently in the presence of organic materials.  Smaller quantities of sodium cost far more, in the range of US$165/kg; the high cost is partially due to the expense of shipping hazardous material.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.mcssl.com/store/gallium-source/sodium-metal |title=007-Sodium Metal| publisher=Mcssl.com |accessdate=2010-11-27[/tpl]

==Applications==

Though metallic sodium has some important uses, the major applications of sodium use it in its many compounds; millions of tons of the chloride, hydroxide, and carbonate are produced annually.

===Free element===

Metallic sodium is mainly used for the production of sodium borohydride, sodium azide, indigo, and triphenylphosphine. Previous uses were for the making of tetraethyllead and titanium metal; because applications for these chemicals were discontinued, the production of sodium declined after 1970.Alfred Klemm, Gabriele Hartmann, Ludwig Lange, "Sodium and Sodium Alloys" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. [tpl]DOI|10.1002/14356007.a24_277[/tpl] Sodium is also used as an alloying metal, an anti-scaling agent,[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=LI4KmKqca78C&pg=PA76|page=76|title=Metal cleaning: bibliographical abstracts, 1842–1951|last=Harris|first=Jay C.|year=1949|publisher=American Society for Testing and Materials|oclc=1848092[/tpl] and as a reducing agent for metals when other materials are ineffective.

====Heat transfer====

Liquid sodium is used as a heat transfer fluid in some fast reactors,Sodium as a Fast Reactor Coolant presented by Thomas H. Fanning. Nuclear Engineering Division. U.S. Department of Energy. U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Topical Seminar Series on Sodium Fast Reactors. May 3, 2007 due to its high thermal conductivity and low neutron absorption cross section, which is required to achieve a high neutron flux; the high boiling point allows the reactor to operate at ambient pressure. Drawbacks of using sodium include its opacity, which hinders visual maintenance, and its explosive properties. Radioactive sodium-24 may be formed by neutron activation during operation, posing a slight radiation hazard; the radioactivity stops within a few days after removal from the reactor. If a reactor needs to be frequently shut down, NaK is used; due to it being liquid at room temperature, cooling pipes do not freeze. In this case, the pyrophoricity of potassium means extra precautions against leaks need to be taken. Another heat transfer application is in high-performance internal combustion engines with poppet valves, where valve stems partially filled with sodium are used as a heat pipe to cool the valves.

==Biological role==

In humans, sodium is an essential nutrient that regulates blood volume, blood pressure, osmotic equilibrium and pH; the minimum physiological requirement for sodium is 500 milligrams per day.[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20110823114818/http://nuinfo-proto4.northwestern.edu/nutrition/factsheets/sodium.pdf|title=Sodium|publisher=Northewestern University|accessdate=2011-11-21[/tpl] Sodium chloride is the principal source of sodium in the diet, and is used as seasoning and preservative, such as for pickling and jerky; most of it comes from processed foods.[tpl]cite web|url=http://health.ltgovernors.com/sodium-and-potassium-health-facts.html|title=Sodium and Potassium Quick Health Facts|work=health.ltgovernors.com[/tpl] The DRI for sodium is 2.3 grams per day,[tpl]cite web|title=Dietary Reference Intakes: Water, Potassium, Sodium, Chloride, and Sulfate|url=http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2004/Dietary-Reference-Intakes-Water-Potassium-Sodium-Chloride-and-Sulfate.aspx|publisher=Food and Nutrition Board, Institute of Medicine, United States National Academies|date=2004-02-11[/tpl] but on average people in the United States consume  3.4 grams per day,[tpl]cite book|author1=U.S. Department of Agriculture|author2=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services|authorlink1=United States Department of Agriculture|authorlink2=United States Department of Health and Human Services|title=Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010|page=22|edition=7th|date=December 2010|url=http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/Publications/DietaryGuidelines/2010/PolicyDoc/PolicyDoc.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2011-11-23|isbn=978-0-16-087941-8|oclc=738512922[/tpl] the minimum amount that promotes hypertension;[tpl]cite journal|pmid=15369026|year=2004|last1=Geleijnse|first1=J.

The renin-angiotensin system regulates the amount of fluids and sodium in the body. Reduction of blood pressure and sodium concentration in the kidney result in the production of renin, which in turn produces aldosterone and angiotensin, retaining sodium in the urine. Because of the increase in sodium concentration, the production of renin decreases, and the sodium concentration returns to normal.[tpl]cite book|last1=McGuire|first1=Michelle|last2=Beerman|first2=Kathy A.|title=Nutritional Sciences: From Fundamentals to Food|year=2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-324-59864-3|page=546|oclc=472704484[/tpl] Sodium is also important in neuron function and osmoregulation between cells and the extracellular fluid, their distribution mediated in all animals by Na+/K+-ATPase;[tpl]cite book|last=Campbell|first=Neil|title=Biology|year=1987|isbn=0-8053-1840-2|page=795|publisher=Benjamin/Cummings[/tpl] hence, sodium is the most prominent cation in extracellular fluid.[tpl]cite book|last=Srilakshmi|first=B.|title=Nutrition Science|year=2006|publisher=New Age International|url=http://books.google.com.sg/books?id=f_i7j4_cMLIC&pg=PA318|isbn=978-81-224-1633-6|edition=2nd|page=318|oclc=173807260[/tpl]
In C4 plants, sodium is a micronutrient that aids in metabolism, specifically in regeneration of phosphoenolpyruvate and synthesis of chlorophyll.[tpl]cite web|last=Kering|first=M.

==Precautions==

Care is required in handling elemental sodium, as it generates flammable hydrogen and caustic sodium hydroxide upon contact with water; powdered sodium may spontaneously explode in the presence of oxygen.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2012[/tpl] Excess sodium can be safely removed by hydrolysis in a ventilated cabinet; this is typically done by sequential treatment with isopropanol, ethanol and water. Isopropanol reacts very slowly, generating the corresponding alkoxide and hydrogen.[tpl]cite book | last1= Angelici, R. J.|title= Synthesis and Technique in Inorganic Chemistry |publisher = University Science Books |place = Mill Valley, CA | year = 1999 | isbn = 0-935702-48-2[/tpl] Fire extinguishers based on water accelerate sodium fires; those based on carbon dioxide and bromochlorodifluoromethane lose their effectiveness when they dissipate. An effective extinguishing agent is Met-L-X, which comprises approximately 5% Saran in sodium chloride together with flow agents; it is most commonly hand-applied with a scoop. Other materials include Lith+, which has graphite powder and an organophosphate flame retardant, and dry sand.
