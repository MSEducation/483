Joan Greenwood (4 March 1921 – 28 February 1987) was an English actress. Born in Chelsea, she studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. Her husky voice, coupled with her slow, precise elocution, was her trademark. She may be best remembered for her role as Sibella in Kind Hearts and Coronets (1949).

==Life and career==

Greenwood worked mainly on the stage, where she had a long career, appearing with Donald Wolfit's theatre company in the years following World War II.  
Greenwood made regular several memorable screen appearances just after the war, in Ealing Comedies, in Whisky Galore!; as Sibella in the black comedy Kind Hearts and Coronets (1949) and in The Man in the White Suit (1951). She opened The Grass is Greener in the West End in 1952, and played Gwendolen in a film version of The Importance of Being Earnest released in the same year. 
She had leading roles in Stage Struck (1958), an adaptation of Jules Verne's Mysterious Island (1961), and Tom Jones (1963).

Greenwood appeared as Olga, alongside Spike Milligan in Frank Dunlop's production of the play Oblomov, based on the novel by Russian writer Ivan Goncharov. The play opened at London's Lyric Theatre on 6 October 1964. Greenwood was described as "a model of generosity and tolerance ... the only person in the cast who could not be 'corpsed' by Milligan (although) he tried very hard. She looked beautiful, and played the part of Oblomov's unfortunate lady with total integrity. 'She never left the script', says Milligan with a guilty smile of something between irritation and admiration. 'I just couldn't make her crack up. All the rest of us did. She never lost her dignity for a moment.'"[tpl]cite book|last=Scudamore|first=Pauline|title=Spike Milligan: A Biography|year=1985|publisher=Granada|location=London|isbn=0-246-12275-7[/tpl] pp. 215-216
Her last film was Little Dorrit (1988), which was released posthumously. She played Lady Carlton, a quirky romance novelist and landlady to the main characters in the British sitcom Girls on Top (1985-86)
Joan Greenwood died of a heart attack in London, less than a week before her 66th birthday. With her husband she had one child, Jason Morell, a film actor who has appeared in Mrs Brown (1997, as Lord Stanley), and Wilde (also 1997, as Ernest Dowson).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0603695|title=Jason Morell|publisher=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=2007-05-03[/tpl]
