[[Noble Eightfold Path]]

CATEGORIES: Buddhist philosophical concepts, Buddhist terms

The Noble Eightfold Path ([tpl]lang-pi|[tpl]IAST|ariyo aṭṭhaṅgiko maggo[/tpl][/tpl],  [tpl]lang-sa|[tpl]IAST|āryāṣṭāṅgamārga[/tpl][/tpl])Brekke, Torkel. "The Religious Motivation of the Early Buddhists." Journal of the American Academy of Religion, Vol. 67, No. 4 (Dec., 1999), p. 860 is one of the principal teachings of the Buddha, who described it as the way leading to the cessation of suffering (dukkha) and the achievement of self-awakening.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn56/sn56.011.than.html |title=Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta |accessdate=2008-05-06|publisher=Access to Insight |last=Thanissaro Bhikkhu[/tpl] It is used to develop insight into the true nature of phenomena (or reality) and to eradicate greed, hatred, and delusion. The Noble Eightfold Path is the fourth of the Buddha's Four Noble Truths; the first element of the Noble Eightfold Path is, in turn, an understanding of the Four Noble Truths. It is also known as the Middle Path or Middle Way.
All eight elements of the Path begin with the word "right", which translates the word samyañc (in Sanskrit) or sammā (in Pāli). These denote completion, togetherness, and coherence, and can also suggest the senses of "perfect" or "ideal".See, for instance, Allan (2008). 'Samma' is also translated as "wholesome", "wise" and "skillful".
In Buddhist symbolism, the Noble Eightfold Path is often represented by means of the dharma wheel (dharmachakra), whose eight spokes represent the eight elements of the path.

==Origin==

According to discourses found in both the Theravada school's Pali canon, and some of the Āgamas in the Chinese Buddhist canon, the Noble Eightfold Path was rediscovered by Gautama Buddha during his quest for enlightenment. The scriptures describe an ancient path which has been followed and practiced by all the previous Buddhas. The Noble Eightfold Path is a practice said to lead its practitioner toward self-awakening and liberation. The path was taught by the Buddha to his disciples so that they, too, could follow it.
[tpl]quote|In the same way I saw an ancient path, an ancient road, traveled by the Rightly Self-awakened Ones of former times. And what is that ancient path, that ancient road, traveled by the Rightly Self-awakened Ones of former times? Just this noble eightfold path: right view, right aspiration, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration...I followed that path. Following it, I came to direct knowledge of aging & death, direct knowledge of the origination of aging & death, direct knowledge of the cessation of aging & death, direct knowledge of the path leading to the cessation of aging & death...Knowing that directly, I have revealed it to monks, nuns, male lay followers & female lay followers...|Nagara Sutta[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn12/sn12.065.than.html |title=Nagara Sutta |accessdate=2008-05-06|publisher=Access to Insight |last=Thanissaro Bhikkhu[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cbeta.org/result/normal/T02/0099_012.htm |title=Samyukta Agama, sutra no. 287, Taisho vol 2, page 80 |accessdate=2008-10-27|publisher=Cbeta [/tpl][/tpl]
The practice of the Noble Eightfold Path varies from one Buddhist school to another. Depending on the school, it may be practiced as a whole, only in part, or it may have been modified. Each Buddhist lineage implements the path in the manner most conducive to the development of the students drawn to that lineage.
Additionally, some sources give alternate definitions for the Noble Eightfold Path. The Ekottara Āgama in particular contains variant teachings of basic doctrines such as the Noble Eightfold Path, which are different from those found in the Pali Canon.Sujato Bhikku.

==Threefold division==

The Noble Eightfold Path is sometimes divided into three basic divisions, as follows:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.044.than.html |title=Culavedalla S[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/waytoend.html#ch2 |title=The Noble Eightfold Path: The Way to the End of Suffering |accessdate=2010-07-10|publisher=Access to Insight |last=Bhikkhu Bodhi[/tpl]
This presentation is called the "Three Higher Trainings" in Mahāyāna Buddhism: higher moral discipline, higher concentration and higher wisdom. "Higher" here refers to the fact that these trainings that lead to liberation and enlightenment are engaged in with the motivation of renunciation or bodhicitta.

==Practice==

According to the bhikkhu (monk) and scholar Walpola Rahula, the divisions of the noble eightfold path "are to be developed more or less simultaneously, as far as possible according to the capacity of each individual. They are all linked together and each helps the cultivation of the others."Rahula 46 Bhikkhu Bodhi explains that "with a certain degree of progress all eight factors can be present simultaneously, each supporting the others. However, until that point is reached, some sequence in the unfolding of the path is inevitable."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/waytoend.html |title=The Noble Eightfold Path: The Way to the End of Suffering|accessdate=2008-05-06|publisher=Buddhist Publication Society |last=Bhikkhu Bodhi[/tpl]
According to the discourses in the Pali and Chinese canons, right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, and right mindfulness are used as the support and requisite conditions for the practice of right concentration. Understanding of the right view is the preliminary role, and is also the forerunner of the entire Noble Eightfold Path.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.117.than.html |title=Maha-cattarisaka Sutta|accessdate=2008-05-06|publisher=Access to Insight |last=Thanissaro Bhikkhu[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cbeta.org/result/normal/T01/0026_049.htm |title=Madhyama Agama, Taisho Tripitaka Vol. 1, No. 26, sutra 189 (中阿含雙品 聖道經第三)|accessdate=2008-10-27|publisher=Cbeta[/tpl] The practitioner should first try to understand the concepts of right view. Once right view has been understood, it will inspire and encourage the arising of right intention within the practitioner. Right intention will lead to the arising of right speech. Right speech will lead to the arising of right action. Right action will lead to the arising of right livelihood. Right livelihood will lead to the arising of right effort. Right effort will lead to the arising of right mindfulness.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/nanamoli/wheel377.html |title=The Discourse on Right View: The Sammaditthi Sutta and its Commentary |accessdate=2008-05-06|publisher=Buddhist Publication Society|last=Bhikkhu Ñanamoli & Thanissaro Bhikkhu[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cbeta.org/result/normal/T01/0026_002.htm |title=Madhyama Agama, Taisho Tripitaka Vol. 1, No. 26, Sutra 9 (中阿含七法品七車經第九)|accessdate=2008-10-27|publisher=Cbeta[/tpl] The practitioner must make the right effort to abandon the wrong view and to enter into the right view. Right mindfulness is used to constantly remain in the right view. This will help the practitioner restrain greed, hatred and delusion.
Once these support and requisite conditions have been established, a practitioner can then practice right concentration more easily. During the practice of right concentration, one will need to use right effort and right mindfulness to aid concentration practice. In the state of concentration, one will need to investigate and verify his or her understanding of right view. This will then result in the arising of right knowledge, which will eliminate greed, hatred and delusion. The last and final factor to arise is right liberation.

==Wisdom==

"Wisdom" (prajñā / paññā), sometimes translated as "discernment" at its preparatory role, provides the sense of direction with its conceptual understanding of reality. It is designed to awaken the faculty of penetrative understanding to see things as they really are. At a later stage, when the mind has been refined by training in moral discipline and concentration, and with the gradual arising of right knowledge, it will arrive at a superior right view and right intention.

===Right view===

Right view ([tpl]IAST|samyag-dṛṣṭi[/tpl] / [tpl]IAST|sammā-diṭṭhi[/tpl]) can also be translated as "right perspective", "right outlook" or "right understanding".
It is the right way of looking at life, nature, and the world as they really are for us. It is to understand how our reality works. It acts as the reasoning with which someone starts practicing the path. It explains the reasons for our human existence, suffering, sickness, aging, death, the existence of greed, hatred, and delusion. Right view gives direction and efficacy to the other seven path factors.  It begins with concepts and propositional knowledge, but through the practice of right concentration, it gradually becomes transmuted into wisdom, which can eradicate the fetters of the mind. An understanding of right view will inspire the person to lead a virtuous life in line with right view. In the Pāli and Chinese canons, it is explained thus: [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.141.than.html |title=Saccavibhanga Sutta |accessdate=2008-05-06|publisher=Access to Insight |last=Thanissaro Bhikkhu[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.141.piya.html |title=Saccavibhanga Sutta |accessdate=2008-05-06|publisher=Access to Insight |last=Piyadassi Thera[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn45/sn45.008.than.html |title=Magga-vibhanga Sutta |accessdate=2008-05-06|publisher=Access to Insight |last=Thanissaro Bhikkhu[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cbeta.org/result/normal/T01/0026_007.htm |title=Madhyama Agama, Taisho Tripitaka Vol. 1, No. 26, sutra 31 (分別聖諦經第十一) |accessdate=2008-10-27|publisher=Cbeta[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cbeta.org/result/normal/T01/0032_001.htm |title=Taisho Tripitaka Vol. 1, No. 32, Page 814|accessdate=2008-10-27|publisher=Cbeta[/tpl]
There are two types of right view:
Right view has many facets; its elementary form is suitable for lay followers, while the other form, which requires deeper understanding, is suitable for monastics. Usually, it involves understanding the following reality:
Right view for monastics is explained in detail in the [tpl]IAST|Sammādiṭṭhi Sutta[/tpl] ("Right View Discourse"), in which Ven. Sariputta instructs that right view can alternately be attained by the thorough understanding of the unwholesome and the wholesome, the four nutriments, the twelve nidanas or the three taints.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/nanamoli/wheel377.html |title=The Discourse on Right View: The Sammaditthi Sutta and its Commentary |accessdate=2008-05-06|publisher= Buddhist Publiccation Society |last=Bhikkhu Ñanamoli & Thanissaro Bhikkhu[/tpl]
"Wrong view" arising from ignorance (avijja), is the precondition for wrong intention, wrong speech, wrong action, wrong livelihood, wrong effort, wrong mindfulness and wrong concentration.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn45/sn45.001.than.html |title=Avijja Sutta |accessdate=2008-05-06|publisher=Access to Insight |last=Thanissaro Bhikkhu[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an10/an10.103.than.html |title=Micchatta Sutta|accessdate=2008-05-06|publisher=Access to Insight |last=Thanissaro Bhikkhu[/tpl] The practitioner should use right effort to abandon the wrong view and to enter into right view. Right mindfulness is used to constantly remain in right view.
The purpose of right view is to clear one's path of the majority of confusion, misunderstanding, and deluded thinking. It is a means to gain right understanding of reality. Right view should be held with a flexible, open mind, without clinging to that view as a dogmatic position.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/snp/snp.4.03.than.html|title=Dutthatthaka Sutta|accessdate=2008-11-16| publisher=Access to Insight[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url= http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.022.nypo.html|title=Alagaddupama Sutta: The Snake Simile[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url= http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/bps-essay_25.html|title=From Views to Vision|accessdate=2008-11-16|publisher=Access to Insight|last=Bodhi[/tpl] In this way, right view becomes a route to liberation rather than an obstacle.

===Right intention===

Right intention (samyak-saṃkalpa/sammā sankappa) can also be known as "right thought", "right resolve", "right conception", "right aspiration" or "the exertion of our own will to change". In this factor, the practitioner should constantly aspire to rid themselves of whatever qualities they know to be wrong and immoral. Correct understanding of right view will help the practitioner to discern the differences between right intention and wrong intention. In the Chinese and Pali Canon, it is explained thus:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cbeta.org/result/normal/T01/0026_007.htm |title=Madhyama Agama, Taisho Tripitaka Vol. 1, No. 26, sutra 31 (分別聖諦經第十一) |accessdate=2008-10-28|publisher=Cbeta[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cbeta.org/result/normal/T01/0032_001.htm |title=Taisho Tripitaka Vol. 1, No. 32, Page 814|accessdate=2008-10-28|publisher=Cbeta[/tpl]
It means the renunciation of the worldly things and an accordant greater commitment to the spiritual path; good will; and a commitment to non-violence, or harmlessness, towards other living beings.

==Ethical conduct==

For the mind to be unified in concentration, it is necessary to refrain from unwholesome deeds of body and speech to prevent the faculties of bodily action and speech from becoming tools of the defilements. Ethical conduct (Śīla / Sīla) is used primarily to facilitate mental purification.

===Right speech===

Right speech (samyag-vāc / sammā-vācā), deals with the way in which a Buddhist practitioner would best make use of their words.  In the Pali Canon, it is explained thus:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn45/sn45.008.than.html|title=Magga-vibhanga Sutta |accessdate=2008-05-06|publisher=Access to Insight |last=Thanissaro Bhikkhu[/tpl]
The Samaññaphala Sutta, Kevatta Sutta and Cunda Kammaraputta Sutta elaborate:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.02.0.than.html|title=Samaññaphala Sutta - The Fruits of the Contemplative Life |accessdate=2008-05-06|publisher=Access to Insight|last=Thanissaro Bhikkhu[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.11.0.than.html|title=Kevatta (Kevaddha)Sutta - To Kevatta |accessdate=2008-05-06|publisher=Access to Insight |last=Thanissaro Bhikkhu[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url= http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an10/an10.176.than.html|title=Cunda Kammaraputta Sutta - To Cunda the Silversmith |accessdate=2008-05-06|publisher=Access to Insight |last=Thanissaro Bhikkhu[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cbeta.org/result/normal/T01/0001_016.htm |title=Taisho Tripitaka Vol. 1, No. 1 , Page 101, Sutra 24 -- the Kevaddha Sutra (第三分堅固經第五)|accessdate=2008-10-28|publisher=Cbeta[/tpl]

The Abhaya Sutta elaborates:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.058.than.html |title=Abhaya Sutta|accessdate=2008-05-06|publisher=Access to Insight |last=Thanissaro Bhikkhu[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cbeta.org/result/normal/T02/0099_026.htm |title=Taisho Tripitaka Vol. 2, No. 99, Sutra 711|accessdate=2008-10-28|publisher=Cbeta[/tpl]

In every case, if it is not true, beneficial nor timely, one is not to say it.  The Buddha followed this, for example, when asked questions of a purely metaphysical nature, unrelated to the goal, path or discipline that he taught. When asked a question such as "Is the universe eternal?", the Buddha dismissed the topic with the response: "It does not further." (or: "The personal possibilities (goals) assigned you are not furthered by an answer to an ultimate question about the universe's fate.")

===Right action===

Right action (samyak-karmānta / sammā-kammanta) can also be translated as "right conduct". As such, the practitioner should train oneself to be morally upright in one's activities, not acting in ways that would be corrupt or bring harm to oneself or to others. In the Chinese and Pali Canon, it is explained as:
For the lay follower, the Cunda Kammaraputta Sutta elaborates:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an10/an10.176.than.html |title=Cunda Kammaraputta Sutta |accessdate=2008-05-06|publisher=Access to Insight |last=Thanissaro Bhikkhu [/tpl]
For the monastic, the Samaññaphala Sutta adds:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.02.0.than.html |title=Samaññaphala Sutta |accessdate=2008-05-06|publisher=Access to Insight |last=Thanissaro Bhikkhu[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.11.0.than.html |title=Kevatta (Kevaddha) Sutta |accessdate=2008-05-06|publisher=Access to Insight |last=Thanissaro Bhikkhu[/tpl]

===Right livelihood===

Right livelihood (samyag-ājīva / sammā-ājīva). This means that practitioners ought not to engage in trades or occupations which, either directly or indirectly, result in harm for other living beings. In the Chinese and Pali Canon, it is explained thus:
More concretely today interpretations include "work and career need to be integrated into life as a Buddhist,"Right Livelihood, The Buddhist Centre: a triratna buddhist community space it is also an ethical livelihood, "wealth obtained through rightful means" (Bhikku Basnagoda Rahula) - that means being honest and ethical in business dealings, not to cheat, lie or steal.Buddhism and Wealth: Defining 'Right Livelihood', Huff Post, March 16, 2011 As people are spending most of their time at work, it’s important to assess how our work affects our mind and heart. So important questions include "How can work become meaningful? How can it be a support, not a hindrance, to spiritual practice — a place to deepen our awareness and kindness?"
The five types of businesses that should not be undertaken:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an05/an05.177.than.html |title=Vanijja Sutta |accessdate=2008-05-06|publisher=Access to Insight |last=Thanissaro Bhikkhu [/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bogoda/wheel397.html |title=A Simple Guide to Life |accessdate=2008-05-06|publisher=Buddhist Publication Society |last=Robert Bogoda[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/price/wheel363.html |title=Two Dialogues on Dhamma |accessdate=2008-05-06|publisher=Buddhist Publication Society |last=Robert Bogoda[/tpl]

==Concentration==

Concentration ("samadhi") is achieved through concentrating the attention on a single meditation object. This brings the calm and collectedness needed to develop true wisdom by direct experience.

===Right effort===

Right effort  (samyag-vyāyāma / sammā-vāyāma) can also be translated as "right endeavor" or "right diligence". In this factor, the practitioners should make a persisting effort to abandon all the wrong and harmful thoughts, words, and deeds. The practitioner should instead be persisting in giving rise to what would be good and useful to themselves and others in their thoughts, words, and deeds, without a thought for the difficulty or weariness involved. In both the Chinese and the Pali Canon, it is explained thus:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn45/sn45.008.than.html |title=Magga-vibhanga Sutta |accessdate=2008-05-06|publisher=Access to Insight |last =Thanissaro Bhikkhu [/tpl]

Although the above instruction is given to the male monastic order, it is also meant for the female monastic order and can be practiced by lay followers of both genders.
The above four phases of right effort mean to:

===Right mindfulness===

Right mindfulness ([tpl]IAST|samyak-smṛti[/tpl] / sammā-sati), also translated as "right memory", "right awareness" or "right attention". Here, practitioners should constantly keep their minds alert to phenomena that affect the body and mind. They should be mindful and deliberate, making sure not to act or speak due to inattention or forgetfulness. In the Pali Canon, it is explained thus:

Although the above instruction is given to the male monastic order, it is also meant for the female monastic order and can be practiced by lay followers from both genders.
Bhikkhu Bodhi, a monk of the Theravada tradition, further explains the concept of mindfulness as follows:Bodhi 1998
The Maha Satipatthana Sutta also teaches that by mindfully observing these phenomena, we begin to discern its arising and subsiding and the Three Characteristics of Dharma in direct experience, which leads to the arising of insight and the qualities of dispassion, non-clinging, and release.

===Right concentration===

Right concentration (samyak-samādhi / sammā-samādhi), as its Sanskrit and Pali names indicate, is the practice of concentration (samadhi). It is also known as  right meditation.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2011[/tpl] As such, the practitioner concentrates on an object of attention until reaching full concentration and a state of meditative absorption (jhana).  Traditionally, the practice of samadhi can be developed through mindfulness of breathing (anapanasati), through visual objects (kasina), and through repetition of phrases (mantra). Samadhi is used to suppress the five hindrances in order to enter into jhana. Jhana is an instrument used for developing wisdom by cultivating insight and using it to examine true nature of phenomena with direct cognition. This leads to cutting off the defilements, realizing the dhamma and, finally, self-awakening.
During the practice of right concentration, the practitioner will need to investigate and verify their right view. In the process right knowledge will arise, followed by right liberation. In the Pali Canon, it is explained thus:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn45/sn45.008.than.html |title=Magga-vibhanga Sutta |accessdate=2008-05-06|publisher=Access to Insight |last=Thanissaro Bhikkhu [/tpl]

Although this instruction is given to the male monastic order, it is also meant for the female monastic order and can be practiced by lay followers from both genders.
According to the Pali and Chinese canon, right concentration is dependent on the development of preceding path factors:

==Acquired factors==

In the Mahācattārīsaka Sutta[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cbeta.org/result/normal/T02/0099_028.htm |title=Taisho Tripitaka Vol. 2, No. 99 , Sutra 785|accessdate=2008-10-28|publisher=Cbeta[/tpl] which appears in the Chinese and Pali canons, the Buddha explains that cultivation of the noble eightfold path leads to the development of two further factors, which are right knowledge, or insight (sammā-ñāṇa), and right liberation, or release (sammā-vimutti). These two factors fall under the category of wisdom (paññā).

===Right knowledge and right liberation===

Right knowledge is seeing things as they really are by direct experience, not as they appear to be, nor as the practitioner wants them to be, but as they truly are. A result of Right Knowledge is the tenth factor - Right liberation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://buddhanet.net/budsas/ebud/ebmed059.htm|title=Deep Insight|accessdate=2009-03-23|publisher=BuddhaSasana|last=Ajahn Brahmavamso[/tpl]
These two factors are the end result of correctly practicing the noble eightfold path, which arise during the practice of right concentration. The first to arise is right knowledge: this is where deep insight into the ultimate reality arises. The last to arise is right liberation: this is where self-awakening occurs and the practitioner has reached the pinnacle of their practice.

==Cognitive psychology==

In the essay "Buddhism Meets Western Science", Gay Watson explains:Watson 2001
The noble eightfold path is, from this psychological viewpoint, an attempt to change patterns of thought and behavior. It is for this reason that the first element of the path is right understanding ([tpl]IAST|sammā-diṭṭhi[/tpl]), which is how one's mind views the world. Under the wisdom (paññā) subdivision of the noble eightfold path, this worldview is intimately connected with the second element, right thought ([tpl]IAST|sammā-saṅkappa[/tpl]), which concerns the patterns of thought and intention that controls one's actions. These elements can be seen at work, for example, in the opening verses of the Dhammapada:[tpl]Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=n19J-wDlJlQC&lpg=PP1&ots=q9W5uGhg1R&dq=%C2%BBThe%20Dhammapada%3A%20A%20New%20Translation%20of%20the%20Buddhist%20Classic%20with%20Annotations&pg=PT33 |title=The Dhammapada: A New Translation of the Buddhist Classic with Annotations |accessdate=2009-07-14|publisher=Shambhala Publications, Inc. |last=Gil Fronsdal[/tpl] The noble eightfold path is also the fourth noble truth.

Thus, by altering one's distorted worldview, bringing out "tranquil perception" in the place of "perception polluted", one is able to ease suffering. Watson points this out from a psychological standpoint:
 Research has shown that repeated action, learning, and memory can actually change the nervous system physically, altering both synaptic strength and connections. Such changes may be brought about by cultivated change in emotion and action; they will, in turn, change subsequent experience.
