Yusef Abdul Lateef (born William Emanuel Huddleston, October 9, 1920 – December 23, 2013) was an American jazz multi-instrumentalist, composer and educator for the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community after his conversion to the Ahmadiyya sect of Islam in 1950.
Although Lateef's main instruments were the tenor saxophone and flute, he also played oboe and bassoon, both rare in jazz, and also used a number of non-western instruments such as the bamboo flute, shanai, shofar, xun, arghul  and koto. He is known for having been an innovator in the blending of jazz with "Eastern" music.Encyclopedia of Jazz Musicians – Lateef, Yusef Abdul (William Evans). Retrieved 2013-04-06. Peter Keepnews, in his New York Times obituary of Lateef, wrote that the musician "played world music before world music had a name."Peter Keepnews "Yusef Lateef, Innovative Jazz Saxophonist and Flutist, Dies at 93", New York Times, 24 December 2013
Lateef wrote and published a number of books including two novellas entitled A Night in the Garden of Love and Another Avenue, the short story collections Spheres and Rain Shapes, also his autobiography, The Gentle Giant, written in collaboration with Herb Boyd.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.beyondchron.org/articles/Yusef_Lateef_Comes_to_Grace_Cathedral_8615.html|title=Yusef Lateef Comes to Grace Cathedral|publisher=Beyondchron.org|accessdate=2010-11-11[/tpl]  Along with his record label YAL Records, Lateef owned Fana Music, a music publishing company. Lateef published his own work through Fana, which includes Yusef Lateef's Flute Book of the Blues and many of his own orchestral compositions.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===

Lateef was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee. His family moved, in 1923, to Lorain, Ohio, and again in 1925, to Detroit, Michigan, where his father changed the family's name to "Evans".Ronald Atkins, "Yusef Lateef obituary", The Guardian, December 30, 2013.
Throughout his early life Lateef came into contact with many Detroit-based jazz musicians who went on to gain prominence, including vibraphonist Milt Jackson, bassist Paul Chambers, drummer Elvin Jones and guitarist Kenny Burrell. Lateef was a proficient saxophonist by the time of his graduation from high school at the age of 18, when he launched his professional career and began touring with a number of swing bands. The first instrument he bought was an alto saxophone but after a year he switched to the tenor saxophone, influenced by the playing of Lester Young.Bryan Marquard, "Dr. Yusef Lateef, 93; UMass professor embraced world music", The Boston Globe, December 27, 2013.
In 1949, he was invited by Dizzy Gillespie to tour with his orchestra. In 1950, Lateef returned to Detroit and began his studies in composition and flute at Wayne State University. It was during this period that he converted to Islam as a member of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community.[tpl]Cite web | title=About Yusef Lateef | url=http://www.yuseflateef.com/index.php/about-yusef-lateef | work=Yuseflateef.com | publisher=FANA Music/YAL Records | accessdate=December 5, 2012[/tpl] He twice made the pilgrimage to Mecca."Yusef Lateef - obituary", The Telegraph, December 27, 2013.

===Prominence===

Lateef began recording as a leader in 1957 for Savoy Records, a non-exclusive association which continued until 1959; the earliest of Lateef's album's for the Prestige subsidiary New Jazz overlap with them. Musicians such as Wilbur Harden (trumpet, flugelhorn), bassist Herman Wright, drummer Frank Gant, and pianist Hugh Lawson were among his collaborators during this period.
By 1961, with the recording of Into Something and Eastern Sounds, Lateef's dominant presence within a group context had emerged. His 'Eastern' influences are clearly audible in all of these recordings, with spots for instruments like the rahab, shanai, arghul, koto and a collection of Chinese wooden flutes and bells along with his tenor and flute. Even his use of the western oboe sounds exotic in this context; it is not a standard jazz instrument. Indeed the tunes themselves are a mixture of jazz standards, blues and film music usually performed with a piano/bass/drums rhythm section in support. Lateef made numerous contributions to other people's albums including his time as a member of saxophonist Cannonball Adderley's Quintet during 1962–64.
Lateef's sound has been claimed to have been a major influence on the saxophonist John Coltrane, whose later period free jazz recordings contain similarly "Eastern" traits. For a time (1963–66) Lateef was signed to Coltrane's label, Impulse. He had a regular working group during this period, with trumpeter Richard Williams and Mike Nock on piano.
In the late 1960s he began to incorporate contemporary soul and gospel phrasing into his music, still with a strong blues underlay, on albums such as Detroit and Hush'n'Thunder.  Lateef expressed a dislike of the terms "jazz" and "jazz musician" as musical generalizations.Don Heckman, "Yusef Lateef dies at 93; Grammy winner blended jazz, world music", Los Angeles Times, December 24, 2013. As is so often the case with such generalizations, the use of these terms do understate the breadth of his sound. For example, in the 1980s, Lateef experimented with new age and spiritual elements.
In 1960, Lateef again returned to school, studying flute at the Manhattan School of Music in New York City. He received a Bachelor's Degree in Music in 1969 and a Master's Degree in Music Education in 1970. Starting in 1971, he taught courses in "autophysiopsychic music" at the Manhattan School of Music, and he became an associate professor at the Borough of Manhattan Community College in 1972.
In 1975, Lateef completed his dissertation on Western and Islamic education and earned a Ed.D. in Education from the University of Massachusetts Amherst.  In the early 1980s Lateef was a Senior Research Fellow at the Center for Nigerian Cultural Studies at Ahmadu Bello University in the city of Zaria, Nigeria. Returning to the US in 1986 he took a joint teaching position at the University of Massachusetts and Hampshire College.

His core influences, however, were clearly rooted in jazz, and in his own words: "My music is jazz."A Fireside Chat With Yusef Lateef
In 1992, Lateef founded YAL Records.  In 1993, Lateef was commissioned by the WDR Radio Orchestra Cologne to compose The African American Epic Suite, a four-part work for orchestra and quartet based on themes of slavery and disfranchisement in the United States. The piece has since been performed by the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and the Detroit Symphony Orchestra.
In 2010 he received the lifetime Jazz Master Fellowship Award from the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), an independent federal agency.[tpl]cite web|url=http://arts.endow.gov/honors/jazz/jmCMS/master.php?id=2010_06&type=bio|title=Lateef Being Honored With Jazz Master Fellowship Award in 2010|publisher=Arts.endow.gov|accessdate=2010-11-10[/tpl] Established in 1982, the National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Masters award is the highest honor given in jazz.[tpl]cite web|url=http://arts.endow.gov/honors/jazz/jmCMS/JMbyYear.php|title=Jazz Master Fellowship Award Winners Through 1982–2011|publisher=Arts.endow.gov|accessdate=2010-11-10[/tpl]
Manhattan School of Music, where Lateef had earned a bachelor's and a master's degree, awarded him its Distinguished Alumni Award in 2012.
Lateef's last albums were recorded for Adam Rudolph's "Meta Records".  To the end of his life, he continued to teach at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and Hampshire College in western Massachusetts.  Lateef died on the morning of December 23, 2013, at the age of 93, after suffering from prostate cancer."Yusef Lateef, Grammy-winning musician, composer, dies at 93", Gazettenet.com
