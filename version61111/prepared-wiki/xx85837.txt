Kintbury was spelt Cynetanbyrig in the 10th century and Kenetebury in the 13th century. After Saint Birinus converted the people of Berkshire to Christianity in the mid 7th century, minsters soon became established in the county from which priests were sent out into the countryside. One such was founded at Kintbury, possibly it was the 'holy place' mentioned in the will of the Saxon thegn, Wulfgar, in 935. Although this is often considered to have been a monastery, Kintbury Abbey.
