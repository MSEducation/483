An EMD MP15T is a 4-axle diesel switcher locomotive built by General Motors Electro-Motive Division between October 1984 and November 1987. Instead of a non-turbocharged 12-cylinder EMD 645 engine it uses a turbocharged 8-cylinder engine. The external appearance of the engine remains similar to other MP15 models.
42 of these locomotives were built for the Seaboard System Railroad, 1200-1241 (later merged into CSX where they kept their numbers) and one unit for Dow Chemical Company, number 957
In 2010 Progress Rail Services, A Caterpillar Company, purchased MP15T 1220 from CSX making CSX's total count 41.
