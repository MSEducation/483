The Osbournes was an American reality television program featuring the domestic life of heavy metal singer Ozzy Osbourne and his family. The series premiered on MTV on March 5, 2002, and in its first season, was cited as the most-viewed series ever on MTV. The final episode of the series aired March 21, 2005. 

==Overview==

In addition to metal musician Ozzy, the show features his wife and manager Sharon, and their children Jack and Kelly. The Osbournes have another daughter, Aimee, who refused to participate in the show, and publicly criticized her parents for their antics on the show. In most family photos shown on the show, she is either absent or blurred. The series also followed the family as they dealt with major events such as Sharon's battle with cancer, and the aftermath of an ATV accident that nearly killed Ozzy.
The theme song for the show is a cover of Ozzy's song "Crazy Train", done in a jazz-swing style reminiscent of Pat Boone.[tpl]cite journal |url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,235237,00.html|title = Mighty Neighborly|date = 10 May 2002| issue = 653|journal = Entertainment Weekly|first = Nancy |last = Miller |accessdate = 30 October 2010[/tpl]
Concurrent with the success of the series, Kelly Osbourne launched a brief career as a singer, while Sharon Osbourne hosted The Sharon Osbourne Show. The family also parodied their TV series during a cameo appearance in Austin Powers in Goldmember. 
Jack and Kelly's friend Robert made regular appearances on the show; Sharon took him in during the second season after his mother died of cancer. While a constant presence in front of the camera, few plots revolved around Robert and he had few lines. After the series ended, it was reported that the Osbournes had sent Robert back to Rhode Island to live with his father after spending a week at a psych ward. The Osbournes were assumed to have adopted Robert, but Sharon Osbourne has denied it.
Another person making recurring appearances on the show is Melinda, Sharon's executive assistant and nanny, who is also married to Ozzy's tour manager.Adams, Cameron. Ozzy Osbourne battles on.

Ozzy confirmed in an interview on BBC Radio 2 in May 2009 that he was "stoned during the entire filming of The Osbournes" and will not watch the episodes for this reason.[tpl]cite news | title = Reality Is I Was Stoned | first = Rick |last = Fulton  | newspaper = Daily Record | pages = 14–15| date= 4 May 2009 |location = Glasgow, Scotland|accessdate = 21 April 2010 |url = http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-news/2009/05/04/i-was-stoned-while-filming-the-osbournes-admits-ozzy-osbourne-86908-21330497/[/tpl] 
Profanity was censored during MTV broadcasts of the series in the United States. In an interview Ozzy himself stated that while he was happy that the Canadian broadcasts were uncensored, he preferred the censored version because the cursing was more noticeable due to the bleeps.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2010[/tpl] The Canadian broadcasts on CTV and UK broadcasts on MTV and Channel 4 are uncensored.[tpl]cite news  | title = The Osbournes premiere sans `bleeping' nets CTV 1.67 million viewers   | first = Angela   | last = Pacienza  | url = | agency = The Canadian Press  | publisher =   | location =  Toronto, Canada  | date = 19 September 2002 [/tpl] Some episodes were also aired uncensored to Australian audiences when shown on Network Ten.[ref]
