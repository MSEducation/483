Savannah Danse Theatre is the largest, not-for-profit dance company in Savannah, Georgia. The company is the brain-child of Suzanne Braddy. Sue founded the Islands Dance Academy on Wilmington Island, and has been teaching kids from three years old to adult since 1988. Ten years later she started the Savannah Danse Theatre. The new company's first show was a full-length production of The Nutcracker. In addition to The Nutcracker, the company has performed Sleeping Beauty, Swan Lake, as well as the widely popular The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe.
The Nutcracker has since become known as The Nutcracker in Savannah. Every year the show features a special guest. Guests such as Paula Deen, Mary and Stratton Leopold, and Bobby Deen have been in the show.
Dancers such as Caroline Bragg-Brennan, Amber Amick, Colleen McCarthy, Abigail Braddy, Maggie de la Sierra, and Megan Foster have come out of Savannah Danse Theatre. Most members go on to dance in college and some have received dance degrees. Abigail Braddy has since choreographed several pieces on the company.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl]
