Hazit HaAm ([tpl]lang-he|חזית העם[/tpl], lit. Front of the People) was a newspaper associated with Revisionist Zionism published in Palestine between 1931 and 1934.
The paper was established in 1931 by Yehoshua Lichter. It closed in 1934, and was succeeded by HaYarden and HaMashkif.
The newspaper is noted for its tolerant or even supportive attitude towards some aspects of Nazi ideology. When Adolf Hitler rose to power in 1933, it stated that "If some segments of our people draw the appropriate conclusions from the Hitlerism sic, then we will be able to say that something good came out of a bad situation." The newspaper also approved of Hitler's anti-communism, stating that "the anti-Semitic husk should be discarded, but not its anti-Marxist inside." The praise of Nazism reportedly stopped after leading Revisionist thinker Ze'ev Jabotinsky called for "a total end to this abomination."When the first draft of history fails the test of time Haaretz, 29 April 2008
