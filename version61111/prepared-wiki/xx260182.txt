==Career==

The father of guitarist Ninine Garcia, Mondine Garcia had a long, highly respected career in France as a notable part of the second generation of gypsy guitarists after Django Reinhardt. He often performed at the same venues and festivals alongside such contemporaries as Moreno Winterstein, Dorado Schmitt and Marcel Campion, and is succeeded by such “third generation” players as Angelo Debarre. His regular venue was La Chope des puces at Porte de Clignancourt on rue Des Rosiers, Saint-Ouen.http://translate.google.ca/translate?hl=en&sl=fr&u=http://www.lachopedespuces.fr/default.html&ei=LT0eTZWdDcmXnAeQs9j9BQ&sa=X&oi=translate&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CDkQ7gEwBAprev=/search%3Fq%3Dmarcel%2Bcampion%2Bmundine%2Bgarcia%26hl%3Den%26biw%3D1280%26bih%3D672%26prmd%3Divnso
