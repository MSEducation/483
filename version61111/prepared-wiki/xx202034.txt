==Lyrics==

How he sleepeth!
Vision unto vision calleth,

While the young child dreameth on.

Fair, O dreamer, thee befalleth

With the glory thou hast won!

Darker wert thou in the garden, yestermorn, by summer sun.
We should see the spirits ringing

Round thee, - were the clouds away.

'Tis the child-heart draws them, singing 

In the silent-seeming clay -

Singing! - Stars that seem the mutest, go in music, music all the day.

Softly! softly, make no noises!

Now he lieth still and dumb -

Now he hears the angels' voices

Folding silence in the room -

Now he muses deep the meaning of the Heaven-words as they come.

Floweth outward with increase -

Dare not bless him! but be bless√®d by his peace - and go in peace.
