[[Kozyrev (crater)]]

CATEGORIES: Impact craters on the Moon

Kozyrev is an impact crater on the far side of the Moon. It lies to the south-southeast of the crater Carver, and to the southwest of the Rocheâ€“Pauli crater pair.
This is an eroded crater formation, although most of the outer rim remains well-defined. There is a small, slightly skewed crater laid across the north-northwestern rim. Attached to the southeast of this feature in the northern part of Kozyrev's interior floor is a smaller, bowl-shaped crater. The remainder of the interior is marked only by tiny craterlets. The inner wall is slightly wider along the eastern side than elsewhere.
