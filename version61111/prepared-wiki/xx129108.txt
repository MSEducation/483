[[Global Directory Server]]

CATEGORIES: Internet terminology

A Global Directory Server (GDS) is a central repository for user information and application data that spans the Internet, intranets and organization-specific extranets. Based on the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) these databases of user information provide a single place to centrally manage directory data across workgroups, companies, applications and languages.
It offers support for international character sets, which enables multi-lingual directory data from around the world to be managed in the global directory. Stored data and user preferences enable roaming users to access applications and data as if they were using their own desktop machine.
