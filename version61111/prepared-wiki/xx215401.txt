U.S. swimmer Michael Phelps blasted a new world record to defend his title in the event, and more importantly, claim his first Olympic gold, seventh career, and ninth overall. Phelps expected to get a major challenge from teammate Ryan Lochte, but he pulled away from the field on the breaststroke leg, and then opened up his lead on the freestyle leg to a strong finish in 4:03.84, more than a second faster than his world record from the U.S. Olympic Trials.[tpl]cite news|last=Newberry|first=Paul|title=Michael Phelps sets world record in 400 IM, 1 gold down, 7 to go|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/olympics/2008103264_olyphelps10.html|publisher=New York Times|date=10 August 2008|accessdate=17 May 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Opening statement: Phelps grabs gold, WR in 400 IM|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/oly/summer08/swimming/news/story?id=3527615|publisher=ESPN|date=10 August 2008|accessdate=17 May 2013[/tpl] Hungary's László Cseh earned his first ever Olympic silver medal at these Games, in a European record of 4:06.16.
