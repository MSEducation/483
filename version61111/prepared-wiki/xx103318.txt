===1957 liquor plebiscite===

On October 30, 1957 a stand alone plebiscite was held province wide in all 50 of the then current provincial electoral districts in Alberta. The government decided to consult Alberta voters to decide on liquor sales and mixed drinking after a divisive debate in the Legislature. The plebiscite was intended to deal with the growing demand for reforming antiquated liquor control laws.[tpl]cite news|title=Albertans Vote 2 to 1 For More Liquor Outlets|publisher=The Lethbridge Herald|date=October 31, 1957|pages=1â€“2|work=Vol L No 273[/tpl]
The plebiscite was conducted in two parts. Question A asked in all districts, asked the voters if the sale of liquor should be expanded in Alberta, while Question B asked in a handful of districts within the corporate limits of Calgary and Edmonton asked if men and woman were allowed to drink together in establishments.
Province wide Question A of the plebiscite passed in 33 of the 50 districts while Question B passed in all five districts. Cardston recorded the strongest vote in the province against the proposal, this was likely due to the strong Mormon communities in the district. The district also recorded a strong voter turnout. It was well above the province wide average of 46%.
Official district returns were released to the public on December 31, 1957. The Social Credit government in power at the time did not considered the results binding.[tpl]cite news|title=No Sudden Change In Alberta Drinking Habits Is Seen|publisher=The Lethbridge Herald|date=October 24, 1957|page=1|work=Vol L No 267[/tpl] However the results of the vote led the government to repeal all existing liquor legislation and introduce an entirely new Liquor Act.[tpl]cite news|title=Entirely New Act On Liquor|publisher=The Lethbridge Herald|date=March 5, 1968|page=1|work=Vol LI No 72[/tpl] 
Municipal districts lying inside electoral districts that voted against the Plebiscite such as Cardston were designated Local Option Zones by the Alberta Liquor Control Board and considered effective dry zones, business owners that wanted a license had to petition for a binding municipal plebiscite in order to be granted a license.[tpl]cite book|title=Alberta Bills 12th Legislature 1st Session|publisher=Government of Alberta|chapter=Bill 81|page=40|year=1958[/tpl]
