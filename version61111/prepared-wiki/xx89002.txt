Suppose that a nonsense mutation was introduced at the fourth triplet in the DNA sequence (CGA) causing the cytosine to be replaced with thymine, yielding TGA in the DNA sequence. Since TGA is transcribed-then-translated as UGA, the resulting transcript and protein product would be:
     DNA: 5' - ATG ACT CAC <span style="background-color:#ccf">TGA</span> GCG CGA AGC TGA - 3'
          3' - TAC TGA GTG <span style="background-color:#ccf">ACT</span> CGC GCT TCG ACT - 5'
    mRNA: 5' - AUG ACU CAC <span style="background-color:#fcc">UGA</span> GCG CGU AGC UGA - 3'
