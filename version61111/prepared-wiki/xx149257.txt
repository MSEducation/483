Black Saint and Soul Note  are two affiliated Italian jazz independent record labels.  Since their conception in the 1970s, they have released albums from a variety of influential jazz musicians, particularly in the genre of free jazz.

==History==

Black Saint was established in 1975 by Giacomo Pelliciotti and devoted to recording avant-garde musicians who might not have an opportunity elsewhere.  In 1979, a sister label, Soul Note, was established as a home for artists who, while being no less creative, might be considered slightly closer to the mainstream.  Giovanni Bonandrini, owner of Black Saint since 1977,Liner notes by Frank Tafuri, on "Black Saint/Soul Note: Critics' Pick Sampler" (Vol. 1) BS/SN-C001 admits that the line between the two labels is somewhat nebulous.
The labels specialize in avant garde jazz stemming from the free jazz tradition.  Its roster of artists includes many of the most illustrious jazz performers of the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.  Several of the performers had been members of the Chicago-based music association Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians and the St. Louis-based multidisciplinary arts collectives Black Artists Group and the Human Arts Ensemble.
The company was based in Tribiano, Italy.  Many of the recordings were made in Milan, as the performers passed through the area on tour,[ref]Liner notes by Frank Tafuri, on "Black Saint/Soul Note: Critics' Pick Sampler" (Vol. 1) BS/SN-C001
