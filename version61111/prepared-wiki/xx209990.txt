Unfortunately, this is a misquotation (those, not us; died, not die; and In, not On), of the actual poem by John McCrae,

Take up our quarrel with the foe
To you from failing hands we throw
       The torch; be yours to hold it high.
   If ye break faith with us who die
We shall not sleep, though poppies grow
         In Flanders fields.<ref>[tpl]cite book | title=In Flanders Fields and Other Poems | year=1919 | publisher=G. P. Putnam's Sons|page=3 | accessdate=5 November 2010[/tpl]</ref></poem>]]
In 1930 a sculpture Flanders Field Memorial featuring a doughboy by Burt Johnson, a brother-in-law of Augustus Saint-Gaudens, was dedicated in the park.  Johnson also designed a similar statue in Doughboy Park in Woodside, Queens.
The gardens were discontinued in 1932 when [tpl]convert|250|ft|m|sing=on[/tpl] wide swath on the west side of the park was removed to be used as part of the West Side Elevated Highway.  The removed earth was transported to Central Park where it was used to fill in the Lower Reservoir for what would become the park's Great Lawn.  The park's unobstructed views of the Hudson were further diminished with the construction in 1935 of the New York Passenger Ship Terminal.
In 1959 residents sought to soften the Hell's Kitchen and decided to name the neighborhood after the park.[tpl]cite news |title=If You're Thinking of Living In/Clinton; Gritty Gives Way to Gentrification |first=Joyce |last=Cohen |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9405E2DA1F39F934A35756C0A9669C8B63 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=May 7, 2000 |accessdate=2010-03-05[/tpl]
In the 1980s and 1990s the area around the park had little residential population and it developed a reputation as an outpost for illegal drug use and homeless encampments. In October 1986 three teenagers murdered a homeless man in the park with a kitchen knife.[tpl]cite news |title=3 Teen-agers Held in Death |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE7D81531F93BA25753C1A960948260 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 18, 1986 |accessdate=2010-03-05[/tpl]
Various attempts to clean the park included an instance in 1995 a German company set up a tent for seven months on the lawn for a dinner show production of Pomp Duck and Circumstance.  The company promised to pay $100,000 for improvements to the park.  The dinner show was intensely opposed by residents objected to commercialization of the neighborhood lone major park (Hell's Kitchen is the jurisdiction of Manhattan Community Board 4 which ranked 57th out of 59 Community Boards for open space in New York City).[tpl]cite news |title=Park, in Difficult Circumstances, May Welcome 'Pomp' |first=Bruce |last=Lambert |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE2DC113FF936A35750C0A963958260 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=March 5, 1995 |accessdate=2010-03-05[/tpl]
Following the dinner show the park was extensively renovated with a new Erie Canal Playground designed around a granite outcropping.  Other changes included new fencing and gates so that the park could be locked at night.  A dog park was added to a converted Bocce court.
In 1998, legislation passed creating the [tpl]convert|550|acre|km2|sing=on[/tpl] Hudson River Park across the West Side Highway from the park along the Hudson River between 59th Street (Manhattan) and Battery Park.  The new park is a joint New York City and New York State park whereas the DeWitt Clinton Park is a city park.  Currently there is no direct connection between the two parks.  The New York Passenger Terminal is built along the entire west side.
In 2005, ENK International Trade Events applied to erect a tent for two weeks in September over the handball and basketball courts in exchange for some minor repairs to the park facilities for a Fashion week event.  After a subcommittee approved it, a storm of protest prompted the Community Board to veto it.[tpl]cite news |title=A Catwalk Is Rejected As Locals Mark Turf |first=Matthew |last=Grace |url=http://www.observer.com/node/37445 |newspaper=The New York Observer |date=August 7, 2005 |accessdate=2010-03-05[/tpl]
The fourth International Quidditch Association's World Cup was held in the park November 13â€“14, 2010.http://www.newser.com/article/d9jfmln80/broomstick-riding-muggle-teams-compete-in-2-day-quidditch-world-cup-tournament-in-nyc.htmlhttp://www.internationalquidditch.org/
