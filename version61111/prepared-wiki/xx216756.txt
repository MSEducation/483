The Walnut Street Historic District in Augusta, Missouri is located at the northern end of the town. The District includes residential and commercial buildings constructed from the mid-19th to mid-20th centuries. Although there have been some minor modifications, the District appears as it did when the town was founded, and many buildings are still owned by descendants of German settlers.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://dnr.mo.gov/shpo/nps-nr/94001142.pdf|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration Form|accessdate=2008-08-19|publisher=United States Department of the Interior|year=1994|author=Claire F.
