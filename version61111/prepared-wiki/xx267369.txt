==Biography==

Fondeville was born after Béarn's integration into the French Kingdom in 1621. 
Before this event Béarn has been an independent state and also the main part of the Kingdom of Navarre. When its Queen Jeanne d'Albret chose Calvinism, Navarre and Béarn became a Protestant kingdom that kept the use of Béarnese dialect as its administrative language. When Jeanne d'Albret's son (Henry III of Navarre) became Henry IV of France he maintained Navarre's independence as a Calvinist kingdom. His son, Louis XIII of France, decided to integrate Béarn into the French Kingdom and to reestablish Catholicism.
During this process, Fondeville's father, a Protestant priest, was offered a lifetime annuity in order to choose Catholicism. Fondeville's God father was Jean-Henri de Salette, bishop of Lescar (city in which he is buried under the Latin inscription Patronus et poeta facundus). Aside from being a writer, Jean-Henri Fondeville was also a lawyer.
