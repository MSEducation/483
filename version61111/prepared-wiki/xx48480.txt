He also declined consideration for the vice-presidential spot. George McGovern remained the symbolic standard-bearer for Robert's delegates instead.

===Chappaquiddick incident===

On the night of July 18, 1969, Kennedy was on Martha's Vineyard's Chappaquiddick Island at a party he gave for the "Boiler Room Girls", a group of young women who had worked on his brother Robert's presidential campaign the year before. Kennedy left the party, driving a 1967 Oldsmobile Delmont 88 with one of the women, 28-year-old Mary Jo Kopechne, and later drove off Dike Bridge into the Poucha Pond inlet, a tidal channel on Chappaquiddick Island. Kennedy escaped the overturned vehicle, and, by his description, dove below the surface seven or eight times, vainly attempting to reach Kopechne. Ultimately, he swam to shore and left the scene. He contacted authorities the next morning, but Kopechne's body had already been discovered.
On July 25, Kennedy pleaded guilty to leaving the scene of an accident and was given a sentence of two months in jail, suspended. That night, he gave a national broadcast in which he said, "I regard as indefensible the fact that I did not report the accident to the police immediately," but denied driving under the influence of alcohol and denied any immoral conduct between him and Kopechne. Kennedy asked the Massachusetts electorate whether he should stay in office or resign, after getting a favorable response in messages sent to him, announced on July 30 that he would remain in the Senate and run for re-election the next year.[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4AwwAAAAIBAJ&sjid=7QEEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6648,3488972 | title=Kennedy Stays In Senate; Will Seek New Term | agency=Associated Press | newspaper=The Blade | location=Toledo | date=July 31, 1969 | page=1[/tpl]
In January 1970, an inquest into Kopechne's death was held in Edgartown, Massachusetts. At the request of Kennedy's lawyers, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ordered the inquest be conducted in secret.[tpl]cite book|title=Fighting for Air: In the Trenches With Television News|isbn=0-8262-0952-1|year=1994|first=Liz|last=Trotta|location=Columbia, MO|publisher=University of Missouri Press[/tpl] p. 184Bly, The Kennedy Men, p. 213  The presiding judge, James A. Boyle, concluded that some aspects of Kennedy's story of that night were not true, and that negligent driving "appears to have contributed to the death of Mary Jo Kopechne". A grand jury on Martha's Vineyard conducted a two-day investigation in April 1970 but issued no indictment, after which Boyle made his inquest report public. Kennedy deemed its conclusions "not justified". Questions about the Chappaquiddick incident generated a large number of articles and books over the next several years.

===1970s===

At the end of 1968, Kennedy had joined the new Committee for National Health Insurance at the invitation of its founder, United Auto Workers president Walter Reuther.[tpl]cite book|last=Jacobs|first=David C.|year=1987|editor1-last=Lewin|editor1-first=David|editor2-last=Lipsky|editor2-first=David|editor3-last=Sockell|editor3-first=Donna|chapter=The UAW and the Committee for National Health Insurance: the contours of social unionism|title=Advances in industrial and labor relations: a research annual|volume=4|location=Greenwich, Conn.|publisher=JAI Press|isbn=0-89232-909-2|pages=119–140[/tpl]Clymer, A Biography, p. 159. In May 1970, Reuther died and Senator Ralph Yarborough, chairman of the full Senate Labor and Public Welfare Committee and its Health subcommittee, lost his primary election, propelling Kennedy into a leadership role on the issue of national health insurance.Clymer, A Biography, pp. 159–160, 173. In August 1970, Kennedy introduced a bipartisan bill for universal national health insurance with no cost sharing, paid for by payroll taxes and general federal revenue.[tpl]cite book|author=.|year=1971|chapter=National health insurance|title=Congressional Quarterly almanac, 91st Congress 2nd session....1970|volume=26|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=Congressional Quarterly|pages=603–605|issn=0095-6007|oclc=1564784[/tpl]
Kennedy easily won re-election to another term in the Senate in November 1970 with 62 percent of the vote against underfunded Republican candidate Josiah Spaulding, although he received about 500,000 fewer votes than in 1964.
In January 1971, Kennedy lost his position as Senate Majority Whip when he lost the support of several members and was defeated by Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia, 31–24.Clymer, A Biography, pp. 171–173. He would later tell Byrd that the defeat was a blessing, as it allowed him to focus more on issues and committee work, where his best strengths lay and where he could exert influence independently from the Democratic party apparatus,Hersh, The Shadow President, p. 13. and began a decade as chairman of the Subcommittee on Health and Scientific Research of the Senate Labor and Public Welfare Committee.
In February 1971, President Nixon proposed health insurance reform—an employer mandate to offer private health insurance, federalization of Medicaid, and support for health maintenance organizations.[tpl]cite book|author=.|year=1972|chapter=Health insurance: hearings on new proposals|title=Congressional Quarterly almanac, 92nd Congress 1st session....1971|volume=27|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=Congressional Quarterly|pages=541–544|issn=0095-6007|oclc=1564784[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=.|year=1974|chapter=Limited experimental health bill enacted|title=Congressional Quarterly almanac, 93rd Congress 1st session....1973|volume=29|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=Congressional Quarterly|pages=499–508|issn=0095-6007|oclc=1564784[/tpl] Hearings on national health insurance were held in 1971, but no bill had the support of House Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committee chairmen Wilbur Mills and Russell Long.Clymer, A Biography, p. 187. Kennedy sponsored and helped pass the limited Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973.Clymer, A Biography, p. 198–199. He also played a leading role, with Senator Jacob Javits, in the creation and passage of the National Cancer Act of 1971.Clymer, A Biography, pp. 173–177.
In October 1971, Kennedy made his first speech about The Troubles in Northern Ireland: he said that "Ulster is becoming Britain's Vietnam", demanded that British troops leave the northern counties, called for a united Ireland,Clymer, A Biography, pp. 180–183. and declared that Ulster Unionists who could not accept this "should be given a decent opportunity to go back to Britain" (a position he backed away from within a couple of years).[tpl]cite book|last=Hachey|first=Thomas E.|title=The Irish Experience: A Concise History|edition=Revised|publisher=M.E.

In scores of anti-war speeches, Kennedy opposed President Richard Nixon's policy of Vietnamization, calling it "a policy of violence that means more and more war."  In December 1971, Kennedy strongly criticized the Nixon administration's support for Pakistan and its ignoring of "the brutal and systematic repression of East Bengal by the Pakistani army".[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,878970,00.html | title=A Policy in Shambles | magazine=Time | date=November 29, 1971[/tpl]  He traveled to India and wrote a report on the plight of the 10 million Bengali refugees.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/08/27/bangladesh.kennedy.impact/ | title=In Bangladesh, Ted Kennedy Revered | author=Ahmed, Saeed | date=August 27, 2009 | publisher=CNN[/tpl] In February 1972, Kennedy flew to Bangladesh and delivered a speech at Dhaka University, where a killing rampage had begun a year earlier.
Chappaquiddick had greatly damaged Kennedy's future presidential prospects[tpl]r|time19680801[/tpl] and he had declared, shortly after the incident, that he would not be a candidate in the 1972 U.S. presidential election. Nevertheless, polls in 1971 suggested he could win the nomination if he tried, and Kennedy gave some thought to running. In May of that year he decided not to, saying he needed "breathing time" to gain more experience and to take care of the children of his brothers and that in sum, "It feels wrong in my gut."[tpl]cite news |url=http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F10B1FFB355F127A93C1AB178ED85F458785F9|title=Despite His Lead in the Gallup Poll, Kennedy Insists He Won't Run for President in '72|last=Apple, Jr.|first=R.J.|authorlink=R.

At the 1972 Democratic National Convention McGovern repeatedly tried to recruit Kennedy as his vice presidential running mate, but was turned down. When McGovern's choice of Thomas Eagleton stepped down soon after the convention, McGovern again tried to get Kennedy to take the nod, again without success. McGovern instead chose Kennedy's brother-in-law Sargent Shriver.
In 1973, Kennedy's son Edward Kennedy, Jr., was discovered to have chondrosarcoma; his leg was amputated and he underwent a long, difficult, experimental two-year drug treatment.Clymer, A Biography, pp. 205–208.

In February 1974, President Nixon proposed more comprehensive health insurance reform—an employer mandate to offer private health insurance and replacement of Medicaid by state-run health insurance plans available to all with income-based premiums and cost sharing.[tpl]cite book|author=.|year=1975|chapter=National health insurance: no action in 1974|title=Congressional Quarterly almanac, 93rd Congress 2nd session....1974|volume=30|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=Congressional Quarterly|pages=386–394|issn=0095-6007|oclc=1564784[/tpl]Clymer, A Biography, pp. 199–200. In April 1974, Kennedy and Mills introduced a bill for near-universal national health insurance with benefits identical to the expanded Nixon plan, both of which were criticized by labor and senior citizen organizations because of their substantial cost sharing.Clymer, A Biography, pp. 217–219. In August 1974, after Nixon's resignation and President Ford's call for health insurance reform, Mills tried to advance a compromise based on Nixon's plan, but gave up when the conservative half of his committee instead backed the American Medical Association's limited voluntary tax credit plan.[tpl]cite journal|last=Wainess|first=Flint J.|date=April 1999|title=The Ways and Means of national health care reform, 1974 and beyond|journal=Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Law|volume=24|issue=2|pages=305–333|issn=0361-6878|oclc=2115780|url=http://jhppl.dukejournals.org/content/24/2/305.abstract|pmid=10321359|doi=10.1215/03616878-24-2-305[/tpl]
In the wake of the Watergate scandal, Kennedy pushed campaign finance reform; he was a leading force behind passage of the Federal Election Campaign Act Amendments of 1974, which set contribution limits and established public financing for presidential elections.Moritz (ed.), Current Biography Yearbook 1978, p. 228.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2008-05-17-3340753434_x.htm | title=Kennedy: liberal legend, able legislator | author=Babington, Charles | agency=Associated Press | newspaper=USA Today | date=May 17, 2008 | accessdate=June 11, 2009[/tpl]  In April 1974, Kennedy travelled to the Soviet Union, where he met with leader Leonid Brezhnev and advocated a full nuclear test ban as well as relaxed emigration, gave a speech at Moscow State University, met with Soviet dissidents, and secured an exit visa for famed cellist Mstislav Rostropovich.Clymer, A Biography, pp. 212–215.  Kennedy's Subcommittee on Refugees and Escapees continued to focus on Vietnam, especially after the Fall of Saigon in 1975.
Kennedy had initially opposed busing schoolchildren across racial lines, but grew to support the practice as it became a focal point of civil rights efforts. After federal judge W. Arthur Garrity ordered the Boston School Committee in 1974 to racially integrate Boston's public schools via busing, Kennedy made a surprise appearance at a September 1974 anti-busing rally in City Hall Plaza to express the need for peaceful dialogue and was met with extreme hostility.Canellos, The Last Lion, pp. 236–237.

The eventual Democratic nominee, Jimmy Carter, built little by way of a relationship with Kennedy during his primary campaign, the convention, or the general election campaign.Clymer, A Biography, pp. 245–250. Kennedy was up for Senate re-election in 1976; he defeated a primary challenger angry at his support for school busing in Boston, then won the general election with 69 percent of the vote.
The Carter administration years were difficult for Kennedy; he had been the most important Democrat in Washington ever since his brother Robert's death, but now Carter was, and Kennedy at first did not have a full committee chairmanship with which to wield influence.Clymer, A Biography, pp. 252–256.

He became chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1978, by which time he had amassed a wide-ranging Senate staff of a hundred.Hersh, The Shadow President, p. 27.
As a candidate, Carter had proposed health care reform that included key features of Kennedy's national health insurance bill, but in December 1977, President Carter told Kennedy his bill must be changed to preserve a large role for private insurance companies, minimize federal spending (precluding payroll tax financing), and be phased-in so as to not interfere with Carter's paramount domestic policy objective—balancing the federal budget.[tpl]cite book|last=Morris|first=Jonas|year=1984|chapter=The Carter years|title=Searching for a cure: national health policy considered|location=New York|publisher=Pica Press|pages=92–171|isbn=0-87663-741-1[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Gottschalk|first=Marie|year=2000|chapter=Labor embraces a new idea: the journey from national health insurance to an employer mandate|title=The shadow welfare state: labor, business, and the politics of health care in the United States|location=Ithaca, N.Y.|publisher=ILR Press|pages=65–85|isbn=0-8014-3745-8|chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=iJ5X5AT1xbYC&pg=PA79[/tpl]Clymer, A Biography, pp. 245–247.

In May 1979, Kennedy proposed a new bipartisan universal national health insurance bill—choice of competing federally-regulated private health insurance plans with no cost sharing financed by income-based premiums via an employer mandate and individual mandate, replacement of Medicaid by government payment of premiums to private insurers, and enhancement of Medicare by adding prescription drug coverage and eliminating premiums and cost sharing.[tpl]cite book|author=.|year=1980|chapter=National health insurance|title=Congressional Quarterly Almanac, 96th Congress 1st Session....1979|volume=35|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=Congressional Quarterly|pages=536–540|issn=0095-6007|oclc=1564784[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Starr|first=Paul|year=2011|chapter=Stumbling toward comprehensive reform: Political deadlock, 1969–1980|title=Remedy and reaction: the peculiar American struggle over health care reform|location=New Haven|publisher=Yale University Press|pages=52–63[/tpl] In June 1979, Carter proposed more limited health insurance reform—an employer mandate to provide catastrophic private health insurance plus coverage without cost sharing for pregnant women and infants, federalization of Medicaid with extension to all of the very poor, and enhancement of Medicare by adding catastrophic coverage.

===1980 presidential campaign===

Kennedy finally decided to seek the Democratic nomination in the 1980 presidential election by launching an unusual, insurgent campaign against the incumbent Carter, a member of his own party. A midsummer 1978 poll had shown Democrats preferring Kennedy over Carter by a 5-to-3 margin.Moritz (ed.), Current Biography Yearbook 1978, p. 227. During spring and summer 1979, as Kennedy deliberated whether to run, Carter was not intimidated despite his 28 percent approval rating, saying publicly: "If Kennedy runs, I'll whip his ass."[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,912449,00.html | title=On Who Will Whip Whom | magazine=Time | date=June 25, 1979[/tpl] Carter later asserted that Kennedy's constant criticism of his policies was a strong indicator that Kennedy was planning to run for the presidency.Carter, Keeping Faith, p. 463. Labor unions urged Kennedy to run, as did some Democratic party officials who feared that Carter's unpopularity could result in heavy losses in the 1980 congressional elections. By August 1979, when Kennedy decided to run, polls showed him with a 2-to-1 advantage over Carter,Clymer, A Biography, pp. 284–285. and Carter's approval rating slipped to 19 percent.Hersh, The Shadow President, pp. 38–39. Kennedy formally announced his campaign on November 7, 1979, at Boston's Faneuil Hall.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2009/02/18/chapter_4_sailing_into_the_wind/ | title=Chapter 4: Sailing Into the Wind: Losing a quest for the top, finding a new freedom | author=Allis, Sam | newspaper=The Boston Globe | date=February 18, 2009 | accessdate=March 10, 2009[/tpl] He had already received substantial negative press from a rambling response to the question "Why do you want to be President?" during an interview with Roger Mudd of CBS News broadcast a few days earlier.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.q-and-a.org/transcript/?programid=1174 | title=Roger Mudd: Fmr.

Kennedy's campaign staff were disorganized and Kennedy was initially an ineffective campaigner.Hersh, The Shadow President, pp. 45–47. The Chappaquiddick incident emerged as a more significant issue than the staff had expected, with several newspaper columnists and editorials criticizing Kennedy's answers on the matter.  In the January 1980 Iowa caucuses, which initiated the primaries season, Carter demolished Kennedy by a 59–31 percent margin.  Kennedy's fundraising immediately declined and his campaign had to downsize, but he remained defiant, saying "Now we'll see who is going to whip whose what."[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,950228,00.html | title=To Sail Against the Wind | magazine=Time | date=February 11, 1980[/tpl] Nevertheless, Kennedy lost three New England contests. Kennedy did form a more coherent message about why he was running, saying at Georgetown University: "I believe we must not permit the dream of social progress to be shattered by those whose premises have failed."Hersh, The Shadow President, p. 50.  However, concerns over Chappaquiddick and issues related to personal character prevented Kennedy from gaining the support of many people who were disillusioned with Carter.[tpl]cite news |newspaper=The New York Times |date= March 18, 1980 |page=A1 | url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70C16FC395C12728DDDA10994DB405B8084F1D3 | author=Smith, Hedrick | title=Carter's On-Job Rating Falls in Poll Because of Foreign Policy Concerns | format=fee required |authorlink= Hedrick Smith[/tpl] During a St. Patrick's Day Parade in Chicago, Kennedy had to wear a bullet-proof vest due to assassination threats, and hecklers yelled "Where's Mary Jo?" at him.Clymer, A Biography, pp. 303–304. In the key March 18 primary in Illinois, Kennedy failed to gain support of Catholic voters, and Carter crushed him, winning 155 of 169 delegates.
With little mathematical hope of winning the nomination, and polls showing another likely defeat in the New York primary, Kennedy prepared to withdraw from the race. However, partially due to Jewish voter unhappiness with a U.S. vote at the United Nations against Israeli settlements in the West Bank, Kennedy staged an upset and won the March 25 vote by a 59–41 percent margin.  Carter responded with an advertising campaign that attacked Kennedy's character in general without explicitly mentioning Chappaquiddick, but Kennedy still managed a narrow win in the April 22 Pennsylvania primary.  Carter won 11 of 12 primaries held in May, while on the June 3 Super Tuesday primaries, Kennedy won California, New Jersey, and three smaller states out of eight contests.Clymer, A Biography, pp. 309, 312. Overall, Kennedy had won 10 presidential primaries against Carter, who won 24.[tpl]cite book | last=Alexander | first=Herbert E. | title=Financing the 1980 Election | publisher=Lexington Books | year=1983 | isbn=0-669-06375-4 | page=229[/tpl]
Although Carter now had enough delegates to clinch the nomination, Kennedy carried his campaign on to the 1980 Democratic National Convention in August in New York, hoping to pass a rule there that would free delegates from being bound by primary results and open the convention.  This move failed on the first night of the convention, and Kennedy withdrew.  On the second night, August 12, Kennedy delivered the most famous speech of his career.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/aug/26/democrats2008.uselections2008 | title=Ted Kennedy defies cancer diagnosis to inspire Democrats in Denver | author=Goldberg, Suzanne | newspaper=The Guardian | date=August 26, 2008 | accessdate=March 18, 2009 | location=London[/tpl]  Drawing on allusions to and quotes of Martin Luther King, Jr., Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and Alfred Lord Tennyson to say that American liberalism was not passé,Clymer, A Biography, pp. 316–319. he concluded with the words:[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/tedkennedy1980dnc.htm | title=Ted Kennedy: 1980 Democratic National Convention Address | publisher=americanrhetoric.com | date=August 12, 1980 | accessdate=March 18, 2009[/tpl]
The Madison Square Garden audience reacted with wild applause and demonstrations for half an hour.  On the final night, Kennedy arrived late after Carter's acceptance speech and while he shook Carter's hand, he failed to raise Carter's arm in the traditional show of party unity.Barone and Cohen, Almanac of American Politics 2008, p. 792.  Carter's difficulty in securing Kennedy supporters during the election campaign was a contributory factor that led to his defeat in November by Ronald Reagan.

===1980s===

The 1980 election saw the Republicans capture not just the presidency but control of the Senate as well, and Kennedy was in the minority party for the first time in his career. Kennedy did not dwell upon his presidential loss, but instead reaffirmed his public commitment to American liberalism.Clymer, A Biography, pp. 321–322.  He chose to become the ranking member of the Labor and Public Welfare Committee rather than of the Judiciary Committee, which he would later say was one of the most important decisions of his career.  Kennedy became a committed champion of women's issues and of gay rights, and established relationships with select Republican senators to block Reagan's actions and preserve and improve the Voting Rights Act, funding for AIDS treatment, and equal funding for women's sports under Title IX.  To combat being in the minority, he worked long hours and devised a series of hearings-like public forums to which he could invite experts and discuss topics important to him.  Kennedy could not hope to stop all of Reagan's reshapings of government, but was often nearly the sole effective Democrat battling him.Hersh, The Shadow President, pp. 55–58.
In January 1981, Ted and Joan Kennedy announced they were getting a divorce.Clymer, A Biography, pp. 325, 354.  The proceedings were generally amicable, and she received a reported $4 million settlement when the divorce was granted in 1982.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2005/02/25/kennedys_children_become_her_guardians/ | title=Kennedy's children become her guardians | author=Johnson, Glen | newspaper=The Boston Globe | date=February 25, 2005 | accessdate=April 11, 2009[/tpl] Later that year, Kennedy created the Friends of Ireland organization with Senator Daniel Moynihan and House Speaker Tip O'Neill to support initiatives for peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland.Providing a Leading Voice for Human Rights and Democracy around the Globe TedKennedy.org. Retrieved: 2012-04-27.
Kennedy easily defeated Republican businessman Ray Shamie to win re-election in 1982.Hersh, The Shadow President, p. 63. Senate leaders granted him a seat on the Armed Services Committee, while allowing him to keep his other major seats despite the traditional limit of two such seats.Hersh, The Shadow President, pp. 60–63.  Kennedy became very visible in opposing aspects of the foreign policy of the Reagan administration, including U.S. intervention in the Salvadoran Civil War and U.S. support for the Contras in Nicaragua, and in opposing Reagan-supported weapons systems, including the B-1 bomber, the MX missile, and the Strategic Defense Initiative.  Kennedy became the Senate's leading advocate for a nuclear freeze and was a critic of Reagan's confrontational policies toward the Soviet Union.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/22/world/kennedy-denouces-regan-for-voodoo-arms-control.html |title=Kennedy Denounces Reagan for 'Voodoo Arms Control' |agency=United Press International |newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 22, 1982[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/09/world/reagan-finds-a-lesser-evil-in-indefinite-recess-of-talks.html |title=Reagan Finds a Lesser Evil in Indefinite Recess of Talks |author=Smith, Hedrick |newspaper=The New York Times |date=December 9, 1983 |authorlink=Hedrick Smith[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/29858499/edward_kennedy_on_president_reagan_a_state_of_disunion/print |title=Edward Kennedy on President Reagan: A State of Disunion |author=Kennedy, Edward M. |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=March 15, 1984[/tpl]  A 1983 memorandum from KGB Chairman Viktor Chebrikov to General Secretary Yuri Andropov noted this stance and asserted that Kennedy, through former Senator John Tunney's discussions with Soviet contacts, had suggested that U.S.-Soviet relations might be improved if Kennedy and Andropov could meet in person to discuss arms control issues and if top Soviet officials, via Kennedy's help, were able to address the American public through the U.S. news media.

Kennedy's staff drew up detailed plans for a candidacy in the 1984 presidential election that he considered, but with his family opposed and his realization that the Senate was a fully satisfying career, in late 1982 he decided not to run.Clymer, A Biography, pp. 341–342.  Kennedy campaigned hard for Democratic presidential nominee Walter Mondale and defended vice presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro from criticism over being a pro-choice Catholic, but Reagan was re-elected in a landslide.Clymer, A Biography, pp. 360–361.
Kennedy staged a tiring, dangerous, and high-profile trip to South Africa in January 1985.Hersh, The Shadow President, pp. 77–78. He defied both the apartheid government's wishes and militant anti-white AZAPO demonstrators by spending a night in the Soweto home of Bishop Desmond Tutu and also visited Winnie Mandela, wife of imprisoned black leader Nelson Mandela.  Upon returning, Kennedy became a leader in the push for economic sanctions against South Africa; collaborating with Senator Lowell Weicker, he secured Senate passage, and the overriding of Reagan's veto, of the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986.  Despite their many political differences, Kennedy and Reagan had a good personal relationship,Clymer, A Biography, p. 326. and with the administration's approval Kennedy traveled to the Soviet Union in 1986 to act as a go-between in arms control negotiations with reformist Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.  The discussions were productive, and Kennedy also helped gain the release of a number of Soviet Jewish refuseniks, including Anatoly Shcharansky.Clymer, A Biography, pp. 391–393.
Although Kennedy was an accomplished legislator, his personal life was troubled during this time.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2009/02/19/chapter_5_trials__redemption/ | title=Chapter 5: Trials & Redemptions: An untidy private life, then a turn to stability | author=Kahn, Joseph P. | newspaper=The Boston Globe | date=February 19, 2009 | accessdate=April 11, 2009[/tpl]  His weight fluctuated wildly, he drank heavily at times – although not when it would interfere with his Senate duties – and his cheeks became blotchy.Hersh, The Shadow President, pp. 66–67. Kennedy later acknowledged, "I went through a lot of difficult times over a period in my life where drinking may have been somewhat of a factor or force."  He chased women frequently, and also was in a series of more serious romantic relationships but did not want to commit to anything long-term.Hersh, The Shadow President, pp. 83–84. He often caroused with fellow Senator Chris Dodd; twice in 1985 they were in drunken incidents in Washington restaurants, with one involving unwelcome physical contact with a waitress.Clymer, A Biography, p. 385. In 1987 Kennedy and a young female lobbyist were surprised in the back room of a restaurant in a state of partial undress.
After again considering a candidacy for the 1988 presidential election, influenced by his personal difficulties and family concerns, and content with remaining in the Senate, in December 1985 Kennedy publicly cut short any talk that he might run.  He added: "I know this decision means I may never be president. But the pursuit of the presidency is not my life. Public service is."  Kennedy used his legislative skills to get passed the COBRA Act, which extended employer-based health benefits after leaving a job.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2009/02/20/a_towering_record_painstakingly_built/ | title=Chapter 6: Master of the Senate: A towering record, painstakingly built | author=Milligan, Susan | newspaper=The Boston Globe | date=February 20, 2009 | accessdate=May 21, 2009[/tpl]Clymer, A Biography, pp. 382–383.  Following the 1986 congressional elections, the Democrats regained control of the Senate and Kennedy became chair of the Labor and Public Welfare Committee.  By now Kennedy had become what colleague Joe Biden termed "the best strategist in the Senate," who always knew when best to move legislation.  Kennedy continued his close working relationship with ranking Republican Senator Orrin Hatch, and they were close allies on many health-related measures.Clymer, A Biography, p. 415.
One of Kennedy's biggest battles in the Senate came with Reagan's July 1987 nomination of Judge Robert Bork to the U.S. Supreme Court.  Kennedy saw a possible Bork appointment as leading to a dismantling of civil rights law that he had helped put into place, and feared Bork's originalist judicial philosophy.  Kennedy's staff had researched Bork's writings and record, and within an hour of the nomination – which was initially expected to succeed – Kennedy went on the Senate floor to announce his opposition:Hersh, The Shadow President, pp. 73–75.
The incendiary rhetoric of what became known as the "Robert Bork's America" speech enraged Bork supporters, who considered it slanderous, and worried some Democrats as well.[tpl]cite news|title=The Original Borking|author=Miranda, Manuel|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=August 24, 2005|accessdate=August 10, 2007|url=http://www.opinionjournal.com/nextjustice/?id=110007149[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title= Kennedy And Bork |accessdate=April 28, 2008 |url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5DF1E3EF936A35754C0A961948260 |author=Reston, James |date=July 5, 1987|newspaper=The New York Times |authorlink= James Reston[/tpl] But the Reagan administration was unprepared for the assault, and the speech froze some Democrats from supporting the nomination and gave Kennedy and other Bork opponents time to prepare the case against him.[tpl]cite news|title=Court nominees will trigger rapid response|newspaper=Christian Science Monitor|date=July 7, 2005|accessdate=August 10, 2007|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0707/p02s01-uspo.html|author=Chaddock, Gail Russell[/tpl]  When the September 1987 Judiciary Committee hearings began, Kennedy challenged Bork forcefully on civil rights, privacy, women's rights, and other issues.  Bork's own demeanor hurt him, and the nomination was defeated both in committee and the full Senate.  The tone of the Bork battle changed the way Washington worked – with controversial nominees or candidates now experiencing all-out war waged against them – and the ramifications of it were still being felt two decades later.Clymer, A Biography, p. 428.
During the 1988 presidential election, Kennedy supported the eventual Democratic nominee, Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis, from the start of the campaign.Clymer, A Biography, pp. 407, 439.  In the fall, Dukakis lost to George H. W. Bush, but Kennedy won re-election to the Senate over Republican Joseph D. Malone in the easiest race of his career.Clymer, A Biography, p. 443.  Kennedy remained a powerful force in the Senate.  In 1988 Kennedy co-sponsored an amendment to the Fair Housing Act of 1968, which prohibits discrimination in the rental, sale, marketing, and financing of the nation's housing; the amendment strengthened the ability of the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity to enforce the Act and expanded the protected classes to include disabled persons and families with children.[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sGsaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=1ioEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6887,1166518&dq=kennedy+fair-housing-act&hl=en | title=Senate approves fair housing bill | agency=Los Angeles Times | newspaper=The Milwaukee Journal | date=August 3, 1988 | page=3A[/tpl] After prolonged negotiations during 1989 with Bush chief of staff John H. Sununu and Attorney General Richard Thornburgh to secure Bush's approval, he directed passage of the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.Hersh, The Shadow President, p. 73. Kennedy had personal interest in the bill due to his sister Rosemary's condition and his son's lost leg, and he considered its enactment one of the most important successes of his career.  In the late 1980s Kennedy and Hatch staged a prolonged battle against Senator Jesse Helms to provide funding to combat the AIDS epidemic and provide treatment for low-income people affected; this would culminate in passage of the Ryan White Care Act.Clymer, A Biography, pp. 437–439, 463–466.  In late November 1989, Kennedy traveled to see first-hand the newly fallen Berlin Wall; he spoke at John-F.-Kennedy-Platz, site of the famous "Ich bin ein Berliner" speech in 1963, and said "Emotionally, I just wish my brother could have seen it."Clymer, A Biography, pp. 457–459.

===Fall and rise===

Kennedy's personal life came to dominate his image. In 1989 the European paparazzi stalked him on a vacation there and photographed him having sex on a motorboat. In February 1990, Michael Kelly published his long, thorough profile "Ted Kennedy on the Rocks" in GQ magazine.[tpl]cite news | url=http://men.style.com/gq/features/landing?id=content_5585 | title=Ted Kennedy on the Rocks | author=Kelly, Michael | magazine=GQ | date=February 1990 | accessdate=April 19, 2009 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071101021225/http://men.style.com/gq/features/landing?id=content_5585 |archivedate = November 1, 2007 | authorlink= Michael Kelly (editor)[/tpl] It captured Kennedy as "an aging Irish boyo clutching a bottle and diddling a blonde," portrayed him as an out-of-control Regency rake, and brought his behavior to the forefront of public attention.  The death from cancer of brother-in-law Stephen Edward Smith in August 1990 left Kennedy emotionally bereft at the loss of a close family member and troubleshooter.Hersh, The Shadow President, pp. 86–88. Kennedy pushed on, but even his legislative successes, such as the Civil Rights Act of 1991, which expanded employee rights in discrimination cases, came at the cost of being criticized for compromising with Republicans and Southern Democrats.
On Easter weekend 1991, Kennedy was at a get-together at the family's Palm Beach, Florida, estate when, restless and maudlin after reminiscing about his brother-in-law, he left for a late-night visit to a local bar, getting his son Patrick and nephew William Kennedy Smith to accompany him.Hersh, The Shadow President, pp. 89, 94–97. Patrick Kennedy and Smith returned with women they met there, Michelle Cassone and Patricia Bowman.  Cassone said that Ted Kennedy subsequently walked in on her and Patrick, dressed only in a nightshirt and with a weird look on his face.  Smith and Bowman went out on the beach, where they had sex that he said was consensual and she said was rape.  The local police made a delayed investigation; soon Kennedy sources were feeding the press with negative information about Bowman's background and several mainstream newspapers broke a taboo by publishing her name.  The case quickly became a media frenzy.  While not directly implicated in the case, Kennedy became the frequent butt of jokes on The Tonight Show and other late-night television programs.Clymer, A Biography, p. 487. Time magazine said Kennedy was being perceived as a "Palm Beach boozer, lout and tabloid grotesque" while Newsweek said Kennedy was "the living symbol of the family flaws."Hersh, The Shadow President, p. 100.
Along with Bork, the other most contentious Supreme Court nomination in United States history has been the one for Clarence Thomas.Barone and Cohen, Almanac of American Politics 2008, p. 364.  When the Thomas hearings began in September 1991, Kennedy pressed Thomas on his unwillingness to express an opinion about Roe v. Wade, but the nomination appeared headed for success.Clymer, A Biography, p. 495.  But when the sexual harassment charges by Anita Hill broke the following month, and the nomination battle dominated public discourse, Kennedy was hamstrung by his past reputation and the ongoing developments in the William Kennedy Smith case. He said almost nothing until the third day of the Thomas–Hill hearings, and when he did it was criticized by Hill supporters for being too little, too late.
Biographer Adam Clymer rates Kennedy's silence during the Thomas hearings as the worst moment of his Senate career.Clymer, A Biography, pp. 493–499.  Writer Anna Quindlen said "Kennedy let us down because he had to; he was muzzled by the facts of his life." On the day before the full Senate vote, Kennedy gave an impassioned speech against Thomas, declaring that the treatment of Hill had been "shameful" and that "to give the benefit of the doubt to Judge Thomas is to say that Judge Thomas is more important than the Supreme Court."[tpl]cite news | author=Welch, William | title='Benefit of the Doubt' – Key Senators Give Thomas Support for Confirmation | newspaper=The Seattle Times | date=October 15, 1991 | url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19911015&slug=1311090[/tpl]  He then voted against the nomination.  Thomas was confirmed by a 52–48 margin, the narrowest ever for a successful nomination.
Due to the Palm Beach media attention and the Thomas hearings, Kennedy's public image suffered. A Gallup Poll gave Kennedy a very low 22 percent national approval rating.  A Boston Herald/WCVB-TV poll found that 62 percent of Massachusetts citizens thought Kennedy should not run for reelection, by a 2-to-1 margin thought Kennedy has misled authorities in the Palm Beach investigation, and had Kennedy losing a hypothetical Senate race to Governor William Weld by 25 points.Hersh, The Shadow President, p. 98.
Meanwhile, at a June 17, 1991 dinner party, Kennedy saw Victoria Anne Reggie, a Washington lawyer at Keck, Mahin & Cate, a divorced mother of two, and the daughter of an old Kennedy family ally, Louisiana judge Edmund Reggie.Clymer, A Biography, pp. 492–493.  They began dating and by September were in a serious relationship.  In a late October speech at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, Kennedy sought to begin a political recovery, saying: "I am painfully aware that the criticism directed at me in recent months involves far more than disagreements with my positions ... It involves the disappointment of friends and many others who rely on me to fight the good fight. To them I say, I recognize my own shortcomings — the faults in the conduct of my private life. I realize that I alone am responsible for them, and I am the one who must confront them."  In December 1991, the William Kennedy Smith rape trial was held; it was nationally televised and the most watched until the O. J. Simpson murder case several years later.  Kennedy's testimony at the trial seemed relaxed, confident, and forthcoming, and helped convince the public that his involvement had been peripheral and unintended.Hersh, The Shadow President, p. 104. Smith was acquitted.
Kennedy and Reggie continued their relationship and he was devoted to her two children, Curran and Caroline.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.theledger.com/article/20080607/NEWS/806070382/1326& | title=Senator's Wife Is His First Mate, Adviser and Caregiver | author=Romano, Lois | publisher=The Washington Post via The Ledger | date=June 7, 2008[/tpl]  They became engaged in March 1992,[tpl]cite news | author=Trueheart, Charles | title=Kennedy Announces Plans to Wed Washington Lawyer | publisher=Washington Post | date=March 15, 1992 | page=A05[/tpl] and were married by Judge A.

She would gain credit with stabilizing his personal life and helping him resume a productive career in the Senate.
With no presidential ambitions left, Kennedy formed a good relationship with Democratic President Bill Clinton upon the latter taking office in 1993,Clymer, A Biography, pp. 519–523. despite his having initially backed former fellow Massachusetts Senator Paul Tsongas in the 1992 Democratic presidential primaries.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/CandidateDetail.html?CandidateID=200 |title=Candidate – Edward "Ted" Kennedy |publisher=Our Campaigns |accessdate=July 5, 2010[/tpl]  Kennedy floor managed successful passage of Clinton's National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993 that created the AmeriCorps program, and despite reservations supported the president on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).Hersh, The Shadow President, p. 114. On the issue Kennedy cared most about, national health insurance, he supported but was not much involved in formation of the Clinton health care plan, which was run by First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and others.  It failed badly and damaged the prospects for such legislation for years to come. In 1994, Kennedy's strong recommendation of his former Judiciary Committee staffer Stephen Breyer played a role in Clinton appointing Breyer to the U.S. Supreme Court.Clymer, A Biography, pp. 539–541.
In the 1994 U.S. Senate election in Massachusetts, Kennedy faced his first serious challenger, the young, telegenic, and very well-funded Mitt Romney. Romney ran as a successful entrepreneur and Washington outsider with a strong family image and moderate stands on social issues, while Kennedy was saddled not only with his recent past but the 25th anniversary of Chappaquiddick and his first wife Joan seeking a renegotiated divorce settlement. By mid-September 1994, polls showed the race to be even.[tpl]cite news|first=Sarah |last=Rimer  |title=Kennedy's Wife Is Giving Him a Political Advantage in a Difficult Contest |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E00EEDF123AF937A1575AC0A962958260|newspaper=The New York Times  |date=September 24, 1994[/tpl]  Kennedy's campaign ran short on money, and belying his image as endlessly wealthy, he was forced to take out a second mortgage on his Virginia home.Hersh, The Shadow President, pp. 137–139. Kennedy responded with a series of attack ads, which focused both on Romney's shifting political views and on the treatment of workers at a paper products plant owned by Romney's Bain Capital.Hersh, The Shadow President, pp. 141–142. Kennedy's new wife Vicki proved to be a strong asset in campaigning. Kennedy and Romney held a widely watched late October debate without a clear winner, but by then Kennedy had pulled ahead in polls and stayed ahead afterward.[tpl]cite news | url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60D10FA395B0C748EDDA90994DC494D81 | title=Kennedy and Romney Look to Round 2 | author=Clymer, Adam | newspaper=The New York Times | date=October 27, 1994 | authorlink=Adam Clymer[/tpl] In the November election, despite a very bad outcome for the Democratic Party nationally, Kennedy won re-election by a 58 percent to 41 percent margin,Hersh, The Shadow President, pp. 152, 153. the closest re-election race of his career.
Kennedy's mother Rose died in January 1995 at the age of 104. Kennedy intensified practice of his Catholicism from then on, often attending Mass several times a week.

Kennedy's role as a liberal lion in the Senate came to the fore in 1995, when the Republican Revolution took control and legislation intending to fulfill the Contract with America was coming from Newt Gingrich's House of Representatives.Hersh, The Shadow President, pp. 155–158. Many Democrats in the Senate and the country overall were depressed, but Kennedy rallied forces to combat the Republicans.  By the beginning of 1996, the Republicans had overreached; most of the Contract had failed to pass the Senate; and the Democrats could once again move forward with legislation, almost all of it coming out of Kennedy's staff.Hersh, The Shadow President, pp. 163–164.
In 1996, Kennedy secured an increase in the minimum wage law, a favorite issue of his;Clymer, A Biography, pp. 578–581. there would not be another increase for ten years.  Following the failure of the Clinton health care plan, Kennedy went against his past strategy and sought incremental measures instead.Clymer, A Biography, p. 570.  Kennedy worked with Republican Senator Nancy Kassebaum to create and pass the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act in 1996, which set new marks for portability of insurance and confidentiality of records.  The same year, Kennedy's Mental Health Parity Act forced insurance companies to treat mental health payments the same as others with respect to limits reached.  In 1997, Kennedy was the prime mover behind the State Children's Health Insurance Program,[tpl]cite news | first=Robert | last=Pear | title= Hatch Joins Kennedy to Back a Health Program | date=March 14, 1997 | newspaper=The New York Times | url =http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980CE4D81E39F937A25750C0A961958260 | accessdate = January 6, 2008 | language = [/tpl] which used increased tobacco taxes to fund the largest expansion of taxpayer-funded health insurance coverage for children in the U.S. since Medicaid began in the 1960s.

Kennedy was a stalwart backer of President Clinton during the 1998 Lewinsky scandal, often trying to cheer up the president when he was gloomiest and getting him to add past Kennedy staffer Greg Craig to his defense team, which helped improve the president's fortunes.Clymer, A Biography, pp. 600–603.  In the trial after the 1999 Impeachment of Bill Clinton, Kennedy voted to acquit Clinton on both charges, saying "Republicans in the House of Representatives, in their partisan vendetta against the President, have wielded the impeachment power in precisely the way the framers rejected, recklessly and without regard for the Constitution or the will of the American people."[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/13/us/clinton-s-acquittal-excerpts-senators-talk-about-their-votes-impeachment-trial.html?pagewanted=4 | title=Clinton's Acquittal: Excerpts: Senators Talk About Their Votes in the Impeachment Trial | newspaper=The New York Times | date=February 13, 1999 | accessdate=May 25, 2009[/tpl]
On July 16, 1999, tragedy struck the Kennedy family again when a Piper Saratoga light aircraft crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Martha's Vineyard. The accident killed its pilot John F. Kennedy, Jr., and also his wife and sister-in-law.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2009/02/22/chapter_7_the_patriarch/ | title=Chapter 7: The Patriarch: Their sorrows, his cause | author=Aucoin, Don | newspaper=The Boston Globe | date=February 22, 2009 | accessdate=May 25, 2009[/tpl] As patriarch, Ted consoled his extended family along with President Clinton at the public memorial service. He paraphrased William Butler Yeats by saying of his nephew: "We dared to think, in that other Irish phrase, that this John Kennedy would live to comb gray hair, with his beloved Carolyn by his side. But like his father, he had every gift but length of years." Ted now served as a role model for Maria Shriver, Kerry Kennedy Cuomo, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Joseph Patrick Kennedy II, and other family members.Clymer, A Biography, pp. 604–605. The Boston Globe wrote of the changed role: "It underscored the evolution that surprised so many people who knew the Kennedys: Teddy, the baby of the family, who had grown into a man who could sometimes be dissolute and reckless, had become the steady, indispensable patriarch, the one the family turned to in good times and bad."

===2000s===

Kennedy had an easy time with his re-election to the Senate in 2000, as Republican lawyer and entrepreneur Jack E. Robinson III was sufficiently damaged by his past personal record that Republican state party officials refused to endorse him.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.businessweek.com/archives/2000/b3706108.arc.htm | title=Commentary: A Two-Party System in Name Only  | author=Symonds, William | magazine=Business Week | date=November 6, 2000 | accessdate=June 10, 2009[/tpl]  Kennedy got 73 percent of the general election vote, with Robinson splitting the rest with libertarian Carla Howell.  During the long, disputed post-presidential election battle in Florida in 2000, Kennedy supported Vice President Al Gore's legal actions.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/09/us/contesting-vote-vice-president-miraculous-revival-brings-elation-but-no-rest-for.html | title=A Miraculous Revival Brings Elation but No Rest for Gore | author=Seelye, Katharine Q. | newspaper=The New York Times | date=December 9, 2000 | accessdate=June 11, 2009[/tpl]  After the bitter contest was over, many Democrats in Congress did not want to work with incoming President George W. Bush.  Kennedy, however, saw Bush as genuinely interested in a major overhaul of elementary and secondary education, Bush saw Kennedy as a potential major ally in the Senate, and the two partnered together on the legislation.  Kennedy accepted provisions governing mandatory student testing and teacher accountability that other Democrats and the National Education Association did not like, in return for increased funding levels for education.  The No Child Left Behind Act was passed by Congress in May and June 2001 and signed into law by Bush in January 2002.  Kennedy soon became disenchanted with the implementation of the act, however, saying for 2003 that it was $9 billion short of the $29 billion authorized.  Kennedy said, "The tragedy is that these long overdue reforms are finally in place, but the funds are not,"[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.amconmag.com/article/2005/aug/01/00025/ | title=Leaving No Child Left Behind  | author=Antle III, W. James | magazine=The American Conservative | date=August 1, 2005 | accessdate=June 10, 2009[/tpl] and accused Bush of not living up to his personal word on the matter.  Other Democrats concluded that Kennedy's penchant for cross-party deals had gotten the better of him.  The White House defended its spending levels given the context of two wars going on.
Kennedy was in his Senate offices meeting with First Lady Laura Bush when the September 11, 2001, attacks took place.  Two of the airplanes involved had taken off from Boston, and in the following weeks, Kennedy telephoned each of the 177 Massachusetts families who had lost members in the attacks. He pushed through legislation that provided healthcare and grief counseling benefits for the families, and recommended the appointment of his former chief of staff Kenneth Feinberg as Special Master of the government's September 11th Victim Compensation Fund.  Kennedy maintained an ongoing bond with the Massachusetts 9/11 families in subsequent years.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.necn.com/Boston/Politics/2009/06/16/911-widow-reflects-on/1245158107.html | title=9/11 widow reflects on relationship with Senator Kennedy | author=King, Alison | publisher=New England Cable News | date=June 16, 2009 | accessdate=June 22, 2009[/tpl]
In reaction to the attacks, Kennedy was a supporter of the American-led 2001 overthrow of the Taliban government in Afghanistan. However, Kennedy strongly opposed the Iraq War from the start, and was one of 23 senators voting against the Iraq War Resolution in October 2002.  As the Iraqi insurgency grew in subsequent years, Kennedy pronounced that the conflict was "Bush's Vietnam."  In response to losses of Massachusetts service personnel to roadside bombs, Kennedy became vocal on the issue of Humvee vulnerability, and co-sponsored enacted 2005 legislation that sped up production and Army procurement of up-armored Humvees.
Despite the strained relationship between Kennedy and Bush over No Child Left Behind spending, the two attempted to work together again on extending Medicare to cover prescription drug benefits.  Kennedy's strategy was again doubted by other Democrats, but he saw the proposed $400 billion program as an opportunity that should not be missed.  However, when the final formulation of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act contained provisions to steer seniors towards private plans, Kennedy switched to opposing it.  It passed in late 2003, and led Kennedy to again say he had been betrayed by the Bush administration.
In the 2004 Democratic Party presidential primaries, Kennedy campaigned heavily for fellow Massachusetts Senator John Kerry. and lent his chief of staff, Mary Beth Cahill, to the Kerry campaign.  Kennedy's appeal was effective among blue collar and minority voters, and helped Kerry stage a come-from-behind win in the Iowa caucuses that propelled him on to the Democratic nomination.
After Bush won a second term in the 2004 general election, Kennedy continued to oppose him on Iraq and many other issues.  However, Kennedy sought to partner with Republicans again on the matter of immigration reform in the context of the ongoing United States immigration debate.  Kennedy was chair of the United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Border Security, and Refugees, and in 2005, Kennedy teamed with Republican Senator John McCain on the Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act.  The "McCain-Kennedy bill" did not reach a Senate vote, but provided a template for further attempts at dealing comprehensively with legalization, guest worker programs, and border enforcement components.  Kennedy returned again with the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, which was sponsored by an ideologically diverse, bipartisan group of senators[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18842287/ | title='Gang of 12' mulls over immigration bill | agency=Associated Press | publisher=MSNBC | date=May 24, 2007 | accessdate=May 11, 2009[/tpl] and having strong support from the Bush administration.  The bill aroused furious grassroots opposition among talk radio listeners and others as an "amnesty" program,[tpl]cite news | author=Preston, Julia | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/10/washington/10oppose.html | title=Grass Roots Roared and Immigration Plan Collapsed | newspaper=The New York Times | date=July 10, 2007 | accessdate=July 27, 2008[/tpl] and despite Kennedy's last-minute attempts to salvage it, failed a cloture vote in the Senate.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/09/washington/09immig.html | title=Kennedy Plea Was Last Gasp for Immigration Bill | author=Hulse, Carl | newspaper=The New York Times | date=June 9, 2007 | accessdate=June 11, 2009[/tpl]  Kennedy was philosophical about the defeat, saying that often took several attempts across multiple Congresses for this type of legislation to build enough momentum for passage.
In 2006, Kennedy released a children's book from the view of his dog Splash, My Senator and Me: A Dog's-Eye View of Washington, D.C.[tpl]cite news | title=Ted Kennedy pens children's book | publisher=CBC News | date=January 9, 2006[/tpl] Also in 2006, Kennedy released a political history entitled America Back on Track.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5353270 | title=Sen.

Kennedy again easily won re-election to the Senate in 2006, winning 69 percent of the vote against Republican language school owner Kenneth Chase, who suffered from very poor name recognition.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/vote2006/MA/MA.htm | title=Democrat Deval Patrick elected governor in Massachusetts, Kennedy re-elected | agency=Associated Press | newspaper=USA Today | date=November 8, 2006 | accessdate=June 11, 2009[/tpl]

===Illness and a new president===

Doctors initially told Kennedy the tumor was inoperable, but he looked around for other opinions and decided on the most aggressive and exhausting course of treatment possible.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2009/05/10/the_man_at_the_center/ | title=The man at the center | last=Milligan|first=Susan|last2=Wangsness|first2=Lisa | newspaper=The Boston Globe | date=May 10, 2009 | accessdate=June 20, 2009[/tpl] On June 2, 2008, Kennedy underwent brain surgery at Duke University Medical Center in an attempt to remove as much of the tumor as possible.[tpl]cite news | author=Viser, Matt and Levenson, Michael | url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/breaking_news/2008/06/sen_kennedy_to.html | title=Kennedy's brain tumor surgery deemed a success | newspaper=The Boston Globe | date= June 2, 2008 | accessdate=June 3, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite news | last=Cortez|first=Michelle Fay  | url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&sid=aM7kTi777dTo&refer=us | title=Kennedy's Brain Surgery Can Reduce, Not Cure, Tumor (Update 2) | publisher=Bloomberg News | date= June 2, 2008 | accessdate=June 19, 2009[/tpl] The 3½-hour operation, conducted by Dr. Allan Friedman while Kennedy was conscious to minimize any permanent neurological effects, was deemed successful in its goals.

The operation and follow-up treatments left Kennedy thinner, prone to seizures, weak and short on energy, and hurt his balance.

Introduced by his niece, Caroline Kennedy, the senator said, "It is so wonderful to be here. Nothing – nothing – is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight." He then delivered a speech to the delegates (which he had to memorize, as his impaired vision left him unable to read a teleprompter) in which, reminiscent of his speech at the 1980 Democratic National Convention, he said, "this November, the torch will be passed again to a new generation of Americans.

==Political positions==

Political scientists gauge ideology in part by comparing the annual ratings by the Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) with the ratings by the American Conservative Union (ACU).[tpl]cite news|author=Mayer, William|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A28761-2004Mar27?language=printer|title=Kerry's Record Rings a Bell|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=August 24, 2008|date=March 28, 2004|quote=The question of how to measure a senator's or representative's ideology is one that political scientists regularly need to answer. For more than 30 years, the standard method for gauging ideology has been to use the annual ratings of lawmakers' votes by various interest groups, notably the Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) and the American Conservative Union (ACU).[/tpl] Kennedy had a lifetime liberal 90 percent score from the ADA through 2004,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/judicial/2005-09-11-judiciarycommitteeprofiles_x.htm|title=Judging Judge Roberts: A look at the Judiciary Committee | newspaper=USA Today | date=September 12, 2005 | accessdate=March 2, 2009|author=Kiely, Kathy[/tpl] while the ACU awarded Kennedy a lifetime conservative rating of 2 percent through 2008.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.acuratings.org/2008senate.htm|title= 2008 U.S. Senate Votes|publisher=American Conservative Union|accessdate=March 20, 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Lifetime rating is given.
Using another metric, Kennedy had a lifetime average liberal score of 88.7 percent, according to a National Journal analysis that places him ideologically as the third-most liberal senator of all those in office in 2009.[tpl]cite journal|title=Committed Senate Liberals|url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/njmagazine/cs_20090228_5247.php|date=February 28, 2009|accessdate=March 3, 2009|magazine=National Journal[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Kennedy's composite average only goes back to 1981, when National Journal began their ratings.
A 2004 analysis by political scientists Joshua D. Clinton of Princeton University and Simon Jackman and Doug Rivers of Stanford University examined some of the difficulties in making this kind of analysis, and found Kennedy likely to be the 8th-to-15th-most liberal Senator during the 108th Congress.[tpl]cite journal |format=PDF |url=http://www.apsanet.org/imgtest/TheMostLiberalSenator-Clinton.pdf |title="The Most Liberal Senator"?

The Almanac of American Politics rates congressional votes as liberal or conservative on the political spectrum, in three policy areas: economic, social, and foreign. For 2005–2006, Kennedy's average ratings were as follows: the economic rating was 91 percent liberal and 0 percent conservative, the social rating was 89 percent liberal and 5 percent conservative, and the foreign rating was 96 percent liberal and 0 percent conservative.Barone and Cohen, Almanac of American Politics 2008, p. 791. In 2005, the ratings were E 95 0, S 90 0, F 95 0; in 2006, E 87 0, S 88 11, F 98 0.  Examination of two previous volumes of The Almanac of American Politics shows similar scores for 2001–2002 and 1997–1998.
Various interest groups gave Kennedy scores or grades as to how well his votes aligned with the positions of each group.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.votesmart.org/issue_rating_category.php?can_id=53305 | title=Senator Edward M.

During the 1990s and 2000s, NARAL Pro-Choice America and Planned Parenthood typically gave Kennedy ratings of 100 percent, while the National Right to Life Committee typically gave him a rating of less than 10 percent.
The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence gave Kennedy a lifetime rating of 100 percent through 2002, while National Rifle Association gave Kennedy a lifetime grade of 'F' (failing) as of 2006.

==Cultural and political image==

When he died, Kennedy was the second-most senior member of the Senate, after President pro tempore Robert Byrd of West Virginia, and the third-longest serving senator of all time, behind Byrd and Strom Thurmond of South Carolina (he was passed later in 2009 by Daniel Inouye).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.senate.gov/senators/Biographical/longest_serving.htm |title=Longest Serving Senators|accessdate=November 17, 2009 |publisher=United States Senate[/tpl]

Kennedy co-sponsored another 550 bills that became law after 1973.  Kennedy was known for his effectiveness in dealing with Republican senators and administrations, sometimes to the irritation of other Democrats. During the 101st Congress under President George H. W. Bush, at least half of the successful proposals put forward by the Senate Democratic policy makers came out of Kennedy's Labor and Human Resources Committee.Hersh, The Shadow President, p. 82.  During the 2000s, almost every bipartisan bill signed during the George W. Bush administration had significant involvement from Kennedy. A late 2000s survey of Republican senators ranked Kennedy first among Democrats in bipartisanship.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1894410_1893847,00.html | title=The 2009 Time 100: Edward Kennedy | authorlink=Arnold Schwarzenegger|last=Schwarzenegger|first=Arnold| magazine=Time | accessdate=June 20, 2009 | date=April 30, 2009[/tpl] Kennedy strongly believed in the principle "never let the perfect be the enemy of the good," and would agree to pass legislation he viewed as incomplete or imperfect with the goal of improving it down the road. In April 2006, Kennedy was selected by Time as one of "America's 10 Best Senators"; the magazine noted that he had "amassed a titanic record of legislation affecting the lives of virtually every man, woman and child in the country" and that "by the late 1990s, the liberal icon had become such a prodigious cross-aisle dealer that Republican leaders began pressuring party colleagues not to sponsor bills with him".[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1183965,00.html | title=Ted Kennedy: The Dogged Achiever | publisher= Time | date=April 14, 2006 | accessdate=May 6, 2007[/tpl] In May 2008, soon-to-be Republican presidential nominee John McCain said, "Kennedy is a legendary lawmaker and I have the highest respect for him. When we have worked together, he has been a skillful, fair and generous partner."  Republican Governor of California and Kennedy relative Arnold Schwarzenegger described "Uncle Teddy" as "a liberal icon, a warrior for the less fortunate, a fierce advocate for health-care reform, a champion of social justice here and abroad" and "the rock of his family".  At the time of Kennedy's death, sociologist and Nation board member Norman Birnbaum wrote that Kennedy had come to be viewed as the "voice" and "conscience" of American progressivism.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20090914/birnbaum | title=Memories of Ted Kennedy | author= Birnbaum, Norman | publisher= The Nation | date=August 28, 2009 | accessdate=September 6, 2009 | authorlink= Norman Birnbaum[/tpl]

Ted Kennedy was, from 1968 on, the most prominent living member of the Kennedy family, and was the last surviving son of Joseph P. Kennedy and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy. John F. Kennedy had said in 1957, "Just as I went into politics because Joe died, if anything happened to me tomorrow, my brother Bobby would run for my seat in the Senate. And if Bobby died, Teddy would take over for him."[tpl]cite news | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ZlIEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT56&dq=eleanor+harris+%22just+as+i+went+into+politics%22&hl=en&ei=DPa3TdOUDemV0QHaqIjWDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=eleanor%20harris%20%22just%20as%20i%20went%20into%20politics%22&f=false | title=His Enduring Images and Words | format= | magazine=Life (John F.

The loss of life at Chappaquiddick and Kennedy's well-documented later personal problems further tarnished his image in relation to the Kennedy name, and Chappaquiddick significantly damaged Ted's chances of ever becoming president.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.politicsdaily.com/2009/08/26/mary-jo-kopechne-and-chappaquiddick-americas-selective-memory/ | title=Mary Jo Kopechne and Chappaquiddick: America's Selective Memory |last=Cannon|first=Carl M. |publisher=Politics Daily |date=August 26, 2009 |accessdate=August 28, 2009[/tpl] The Associated Press wrote that, "Unlike his brothers, Edward M.
