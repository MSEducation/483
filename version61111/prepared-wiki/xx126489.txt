KTBW-TV is a religious television station in Seattle, Washington, broadcasting locally on digital channel 14 as an affiliate of TBN. KTBW originally signed on the air with the call letters, KQFB on March 30, 1984.  As KQFB, the station was originally locally owned by Family Broadcasting based in University Place, WA.  Family Broadcasting originally was going to broadcast Christian programming from several sources.  Before the station went on the air, a minority interest in KQFB was acquired by the Trinity Broadcasting Network. When TBN acquired all the interest in Family Broadcasting, the call letters changed from KQFB to KTBW. KTBW's transmitter is located on Gold Mountain near Bremerton, Washington.
