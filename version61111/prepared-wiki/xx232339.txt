[[Diplosolenodes occidentalis]]

CATEGORIES: Veronicellidae

Diplosolenodes occidentalis is a species of air-breathing land slug, a terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusk in the family Veronicellidae, the leatherleaf slugs.

==Distribution==

Diplosolenodes occidentalis was originally discovered and described by Lansdown Guilding from the West Indian island of Saint Vincent. It seems likely that this species is native to most of the Lesser Antilles.
The distribution of Diplosolenodes occidentalis includes the Lesser Antilles:
It has been introduced to the Greater Antilles, Central America and northern South America:
It occurs in greenhouses in Logan County, Oklahoma.Branson B. A. (1980). "THE RECENT GASTROPODA OF OKLAHOMA, PART VIII. THE SLUG FAMILIES LIMACIDAE, ARIONIDAE, VERONICELLIDAE, AND PHILOMYCIDAE". Proc. Okla. Acad. Sci. 60: 29-35. PDF.
This species has not yet become established in the wild in the USA, but it is considered to represent a potentially serious threat as a pest, an invasive species which could negatively affect agriculture, natural ecosystems, human health or commerce. Therefore it has been suggested that this species be given top national quarantine significance in the USA.Cowie R. H., Dillon R. T., Robinson D. G. & Smith J. W. (2009). "Alien non-marine snails and slugs of priority quarantine importance in the United States: A preliminary risk assessment". American Malacological Bulletin 27: 113-132. PDF.

==Description==

This slug is most easily recognized by the black speckling on its mantle or hyponota. The body length can reach up to 60Â mm.

==Ecology==

This species may be found in undisturbed environments as well as in agricultural settings, where it may be regarded as a minor pest.
