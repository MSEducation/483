CATEGORIES: Italian cheeses, Cow's-milk cheeses

Morlacco or Morlacco di Grappa originates from Mount Grappa (provinces of Vicenza, Treviso and Belluno in Italy) where cheesemakers once produced a soft cow's milk cheese, low in fat, with an uncooked curd that was named after their native region: Morlacchia. 
The local Burlina cows - a breed that is at risk of extinction - produced the milk used for this cheese. The Burlina cow is small and hardy and has a piebald black and white coat. 
Today, Morlacco di Grappa cheese is once again produced on Mount Grappa with skimmed milk from the eveningâ€™s milking mixed with whole milk from that of the morning. After 20 days of aging, the cheese is ready for consumption, but it can be left to age for up to three months.
