==History==

It was the first Greek manuscript discovered that contains the Comma Johanneum in 1 John 5:7-8. It was copied from a 10th-century manuscript at Lincoln College, Oxford, that did not have the Comma. The Comma was inserted from the Latin.Bruce M. Metzger, Bart D. Ehrman, The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption and Restoration, (Oxford University Press, 2005), p. 88, 147.  Its earliest known owner was Froy, a Franciscan friar, then Thomas Clement (1569), then William Chark (1582), then Thomas Montfort, from whom it derives its present name, then Archbishop Ussher, who caused the collation to be made which appears in Walton's Polyglott (Matthew 1:1; Acts 22:29; Romans 1), and presented the manuscript to Trinity College. S. P. Tregelles, "An Introduction to the Critical study and Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures", London 1856, p. 213-14. 
This codex was used by Erasmus in his third edition of Novum Testamentum (1522). Erasmus misprinted εμαις for εν αις in Apocalypse 2:13.
It was described by Wettstein
and Orlando Dobbin. C. R. Gregory saw it in 1883.
The codex now is located at Trinity College (Ms. 30) in Dublin.
