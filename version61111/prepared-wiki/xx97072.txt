[[Orange Catholic Bible]]

CATEGORIES: Fictional books, Fictional religions, Dune universe

The Orange Catholic Bible (abbreviated to O. C. Bible or OCB) is a fictional book from the Dune universe created by Frank Herbert. Created in the wake of the crusade against thinking machines known as the Butlerian Jihad, the Orange Catholic Bible is the primary orthodox religious text in the Dune universe and is described thus in the glossary of the 1965 novel Dune:
 
 ORANGE CATHOLIC BIBLE: the "Accumulated Book," the religious text produced by the Commission of Ecumenical Translators. It contains elements of most ancient religions, including the Maometh Saari, Mahayana Christianity, Zensunni Catholicism and Buddhislamic traditions. Its supreme commandment is considered to be: "Thou shalt not disfigure the soul."

==Origin of the name==

The name "Orange Catholic" was created by Frank Herbert as a combination of the symbolic colour of  Northern Irish Protestantism with Catholicism. As such it alludes to the union of what have been called "salvation by faith" (Protestantism) and "salvation by works" (Catholicism) into a single tradition.  As a result it is in keeping with the variety of other religious amalgams alluded to in the Dune series (such as the above-mentioned "Buddislamic" traditions), as well as the universalist nature of the sources listed above.

==Physical appearance==

In Dune, Dr. Yueh gives Paul Atreides his copy of the Orange Catholic Bible during their initial trip to Arrakis. This copy is a space-traveler's miniaturized edition of the book, set in tiny print on fragile pages made from "filament paper." It is described as "black, oblong, no larger than the end of Paul's thumb" but contains eighteen hundred pages. Yueh instructs Paul in its use:
 
 It has its own magnifier and electrostatic charge system ... The book is held closed by the charge, which forces against spring-locked covers. You press the edge — thus, and the pages you've selected repel each other and the book opens ... the charge moves ahead one page at a time as you read. Never touch the actual pages with your fingers. The filament tissue is too delicate.

==Teachings==

The appendix to Dune also notes that the chief commandment of the Butlerian Jihad remains in the Orange Catholic Bible as "Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind."This edict is attributed directly to Rayna Butler in the Legends of Dune prequel trilogy by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson (2002-2004). It is further explained in the Dune appendix that the passage "Paradise on my right. Hell on my left, and the Angel of Death behind" describes human life as a journey across a narrow bridge.

===Original Dune series===

In the Dune universe, many references are made to the Orange Catholic Bible, sometimes in the form of epigraphs. The following quotations illustrate the nature of the Orange Catholic Bible, including how it pertains to the technophobic mindset resulting from the Butlerian Jihad, causing humans to become analytical devices. Probable source material has been cited, but quotations may not reference the same chapter and verse as the source material due to the text having been edited and condensed over time.
The original Dune series also includes quotations from the Orange Catholic Bible Commentaries by the Commission of Ecumenical Translators:

===Expanded Dune universe===

The Orange Catholic Bible is also quoted in the Prelude to Dune prequel trilogy by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson (1999–2001), as well as their 2007 conclusion to the original series, Sandworms of Dune. Though the authors have stated that Frank Herbert left behind unused epigraphs and notes which they later used in their prequels and sequels,Dune 7 Blog ~ DuneNovels.com "Frank Herbert wrote a detailed outline for 'Dune 7' and he left extensive 'Dune 7 notes,' as well as stored boxes of his descriptions, epigraphs, chapters, character backgrounds, historical notes — over a thousand pages worth." it is unknown which of these (if any) are from those notes.
