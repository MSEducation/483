"Born This Way" is a song by American recording artist Lady Gaga, from her second studio album of the same name. Written by Gaga and Jeppe Laursen, who produced along with Fernando Garibay and DJ White Shadow, it was developed while Gaga was on the road with The Monster Ball Tour. Inspired by the 1990s empowering music for women and the gay community, Gaga explained that "Born This Way" was her freedom song. She sang part of the chorus at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards in 2010 and announced the song as the lead single from the album. The single was released on February 11, 2011.
The song is backed by rumbling synth sounds, a humming bass and additional chorus percussion, with sole organ toward the end. The lyrics discuss the self-empowerment of minorities including the LGBT community as well as racial minorities, referring to "cholas" and "orients", which drew criticism from Latino and Asian communities. Critics positively reviewed the song, calling it a "club-ready anthem", though it faced criticism for having similarities with Madonna's 1989 single "Express Yourself". The song reached number one in over 25 countries and was her third single to top the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and the 1000th song in history to reach number one. "Born This Way" has sold 8.2 million copies worldwide, becoming one of the best-selling singles of all time.
Nick Knight directed the accompanying music video, which was inspired by painters like Salvador Dalí and Francis Bacon and their  surrealistic images. Gaga is depicted as giving birth to a new race during a prologue. A series of dance sequences later, the video concludes with the view of a city populated by this race. Critics noted cultural references to the work of Madonna, Michael Jackson, Björk, late fashion designer Alexander McQueen, as well as to Greek mythology and surrealism.
Gaga performed the song at the 53rd Grammy Awards after coming out of an incubating vessel. It was also performed during the last leg of The Monster Ball Tour and in television shows such as Saturday Night Live, Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve and Good Morning America. The song was treated with different remixes, including a Country Road version recorded by Gaga herself and another by Indian production duo Salim and Sulaiman Merchant. Alice Cooper, Madonna, Katy Perry, Maria Aragon, and the cast of the TV series Glee have covered the song.

==Background==

In 2010, Lady Gaga was touring for her second world tour, The Monster Ball. At that time she started developing ideas for her second studio album, Born This Way.[tpl]cite journal |last=Strauss |first=Neil |title=Lady Gaga Tells All|date=June 23, 2010 |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lady-gaga-tells-all-rolling-stones-new-issue-20100621 |work=Rolling Stone |publisher=Jann Wenner|accessdate=June 21, 2010|date=June 21, 2010[/tpl] The first song written and recorded for the album was the title track itself which she wrote in Liverpool and Manchester, England,[tpl]cite news|last=Wightman|first=Catriona|title=Lady GaGa wrote new single in Liverpool|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a212246/lady-gaga-wrote-new-single-in-liverpool.html|accessdate=July 12, 2013|newspaper=DigitalSpy|date=April 2, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Lady Gaga Born This Way album 'outsells all of UK top 10 charts'|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/8545415/Lady-Gaga-Born-This-Way-album-outsells-all-of-UK-top-10-charts.html|accessdate=July 12, 2013|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=May 30, 2011[/tpl] described by Gaga as a "magical message" song.

"We recorded it around the world, on the road, in whatever was available. It sounds like it reads, but not like you think until you hear it," he added.[tpl]cite news |last=Lipschultz |first=Jason |title=Lady Gaga Collaborator Talks 'Born This Way' Album |url=http://ca.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idCATRE71408Y20110205?sp=true |date=February 4, 2011 |accessdate=February 12, 2011 |work=Billboard |publisher=Prometheus Global Media[/tpl] Gaga wanted to record her own freedom song, and explained with Billboard her inspiration behind the song:
 
 "I want to write my this-is-who-the-fuck-I-am anthem, but I don't want it to be hidden in poetic wizardry and metaphors. I want it to be an attack, an assault on the issue because I think, especially in today's music, everything gets kind of washy sometimes and the message gets hidden in the lyrical play. Harkening back to the early '90s, when Madonna, En Vogue, Whitney Houston and TLC were making very empowering music for women and the gay community and all kind of disenfranchised communities, the lyrics and the melodies were very poignant and very gospel and very spiritual and I said, 'That's the kind of record I need to make. That's the record that's going to shake up the industry.' It's not about the track. It's not about the production. It's about the song. Anyone could sing 'Born This Way'. It could've been anyone."[tpl]cite news |last=Werde |first=Bill |title=Lady Gaga 'Born This Way' Cover Story |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/472976/lady-gaga-born-this-way-cover-story |page=4 |date=April 18, 2011 |accessdate=April 20, 2011 |work=Billboard |publisher=Prometheus Global Media[/tpl]

On the  43rd episode of her web video series, Transmission Gagavision, Gaga told the interviewer that the greatest challenge she faced while writing "Born This Way" was how she could leave her insecurities behind her, and become confident. "'Born This Way' is who I am. An artist in a constant state of half-fantasy/half-reality at all times," she added.[tpl]cite news |title=Looks like those horns are spreading...

On February 8, 2011, Gaga tweeted the words "Trois Jours" ("Three Days"), along with a picture of the official single artwork, via TwitPic.

==Composition==

"Born This Way" was written by Gaga and Jeppe Laursen (formerly of the band Junior Senior), and produced with Paul Blair (a.k.a. DJ White Shadow) and Fernando Garibay,[tpl]cite web|title=Born This Way (Legal Title) – BMI Work #12342685  |publisher=Broadcast Music Incorporated |url= http://repertoire.bmi.com/title.asp?blnWriter=True&blnPublisher=True&blnArtist=True&keyID=12342685&ShowNbr=0&ShowSeqNbr=0&querytype=WorkID |accessdate=March 19, 2011[/tpl] while it was mixed at Abbey Road Studios in London and Germano Studios in New York. The club-beat influenced song begins with Gaga's voice uttering the line "It doesn't matter if you love him or capital H-I-M" on a loop, backed by a rumbling synth sound and a humming bass.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1657726/lady-gaga-born-this-way.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga's 'Born This Way' Premieres |last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|date=February 10, 2011|accessdate=February 12, 2011|publisher=MTV (MTV Networks)[/tpl] As the synths change into a beat, Gaga belts out the song's first verse, followed by the bass dropping off and the percussion-backed chorus, "I'm beautiful in my way, 'cause God makes no mistakes; I'm on the right track, baby, I was born this way", which Jocelyn Vena from MTV likened as being "meant to be heard in a big space. It's fast and hard-hitting." After the chorus she chants the line "Don't be a drag, Just be a queen" a number of times on top of handclaps, before moving to the second verse. After the second chorus an interlude follows, where Gaga chants the names of various communities. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine felt that the interlude is a mixture of the music from American television show, Glee, and the song "There But For the Grace of God Go I" by Machine. The music fades out for a moment as Gaga sings a capella, before the addition of an organ and Gaga closes the song. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, "Born This Way" is written in the time signature of common time, with a moderate dance beat tempo of 124 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of B major as Gaga's voice spans the tonal nodes of F[tpl]music|sharp[/tpl]3 to C[tpl]music|sharp[/tpl]5. "Born This Way" follows a chord progression of F[tpl]music|sharp[/tpl]5–F[tpl]music|sharp[/tpl]–E–B–F[tpl]music|sharp[/tpl] in the chorus.[tpl]cite web |title=Digital Sheet Music – Lady Gaga – Born This Way |last=Germanotta |first=Stefani |last2=Laursen |first2=Jeppe |year=2011 |publisher=Musicnotes.com.

The lyrics during the verses talk about empowerment, while the chorus talks about making no apologies and accepting one as themselves.[tpl]cite news |last=Stransky |first=Tanner |title=Lady Gaga releases full lyrics to forthcoming single 'Born This Way': Read them here |work=Entertainment Weekly |url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2011/01/27/lady-gaga-born-this-way-full-lyrics/ |date=January 27, 2011 |accessdate=February 12, 2011 |publisher=Time Inc[/tpl] It features the names of LGBT and other minority communities, which was due to the support Gaga had received from the community over the years. She also explained that since The Fame and The Fame Monster did not directly address those communities, "Born This Way" was her chance to create something that not only supported her political and social beliefs, but also empowered her to artistically say, "'I'm not being safe with this record.' I'm not trying to gain new fans. I love the fans I already have, and this is for them."

Not all Latino ladies are 'cholas' in the barrio, some of them are teachers, writers, engineers and nurses and doctors." Radio stations in Malaysia chose to garble the part of the lyrics dealing with the acceptance of the LGBT community, due to censorship in the country, on content that may be deemed offensive.[tpl]cite news |last=Yoong |first=Sean |title=Malaysia gags Lady Gaga, garbles gay lyrics |agency=Associated Press |location=Kuala Lumpur |work=msnbc.com |publisher=NBCUniversal |url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/42133505/ns/today-entertainment/ |date=March 17, 2011 |accessdate=April 12, 2011[/tpl] In response, Gaga urged her Malaysian fans, who wanted the uncensored version to be played, to take action by stating: "It is your job and it is your duty as young people to have your voices heard. You must do everything that you can if you want to be liberated by your society. You must call, you must not stop, you must protest peaceably."[tpl]cite news |last=MacKinnon |first=Ian |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/malaysia/8403613/Lady-Gaga-takes-on-Malaysias-censors.html |title=Lady Gaga takes on Malaysia's censors |date=March 24, 2011 |publisher=Telegraph Media Group |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |accessdate=April 12, 2011[/tpl]

==Remixes==

A number of remixes were commissioned by Interscope Records, to accompany the song. The first set of remixes were done by LA Riots, Chew Fu and DJ White Shadow.

Once the first chorus starts, the song chugs alongside the harmonica sounds. Just before the three-minute mark, Gaga sings new lyrics, "If I wanna make it country, baby, then it's OK, cuz I was born, I was born, I was born this way," over a picked mandolin. According to Gil Kaufman of MTV, the song breaks into full-on country-rock mode, reminiscent of late-period Bon Jovi music, in the final minute. A portion of the money earned from sales of "Country Road Version" went to the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN).[tpl]cite news |last=Vena |first=Jocelyn |title=Lady Gaga To Donate 'Born This Way' Country Remix Proceeds To Charity |publisher=MTV (MTV Networks) |date=April 5, 2011 |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1661315/lady-gaga-born-this-way-country-road-version.jhtml |accessdate=April 19, 2011[/tpl]

A Bollywood version of the song was done by Indian music producer duo Salim and Sulaiman Merchant. The remix was released on DesiHits.com, a website for South Asian music and entertainment news. The Merchants were discussing music projects with Anjula Acharia-Bath of DesiHits.com, when they came to learn that Gaga, who did not have much reach within the Indian diaspora, was interested in a Bollywood remix for "Born This Way". The Merchants were contacted by Gaga's manager, Troy Carter, and the remix was finalized. Sulaiman explained that they received Gaga's raw vocals from "Born This Way", and using it as a base, they designed the remix. "We sent her a rough cut of our composition for initial feedback on whether we were giving it the right groove. She loved it and that's how we went about it," he added.[tpl]cite journal |last=Das |first=Mohua |title=Gaga Over Bollywood |work=The Kolkata Telegraph |publisher=Ananda Publishers |oclc=271717941 |location=Kolkata, India |date=April 15, 2011 |url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1110415/jsp/entertainment/story_13854758.jsp |accessdate=April 19, 2011[/tpl] The Merchants used a number of Indian musical instruments like the dugi, sitar by Sunil Das, and the dhol and dholak in the chorus. Sulaiman told MTV News' Jocelyn Vena:
 
 "It's been such a big track, it's been very popular, and when you consider the style, it's very aggressive. It's got all the stuff that's required to make it a nice clubby track, so for us, the most important thing was: How do you get it into a zone where it's palpable to the Indian flavor? And the first thing we did was bring in a sitar, and that changed the flavor a little bit. We kept the aggression but changed the style and made it a little more four on the floor, a little more house."[tpl]cite news |last=Vena |first=Jocelyn |title=Lady Gaga's 'Born This Way' Bollywood Remix Is 'Magical,' Producers Say |publisher=MTV (MTV Networks) |date=April 13, 2011 |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1661911/lady-gaga-born-this-way-bollywood-remix.jhtml |accessdate=April 19, 2011[/tpl]

Salim said that he sang a little bit of alaap to give the remix a Sufi touch, "as that's the kind of music we do and it was also about adding our signature." Gaga's management team were satisfied with their remix and wanted them to do another remix of her next song, "Judas". The Bollywood remixes were a part of the Indian tracklist of Born This Way.

==Critical reception==

"Born This Way" received generally positive reviews from music critics upon its release. Michael Cragg from The Guardian called the song a "disco anthem", and said the chorus "crashes in with the weight of a discarded meat dress".

According to Gaga, she was inspired by the paintings of Salvador Dalí and Francis Bacon, and their surrealistic images.[tpl]cite web|title=Lady Gaga Says 'Born This Way' Video Shows 'The Birth Of A New Race'|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1658874/lady-gaga-born-this-way-video.jhtml|publisher=MTV (MTV Networks)|first=Jocelyn|last=Vena|date=February 8, 2011|accessdate=March 25, 2011[/tpl] Gibson explained the inspiration behind the video to MTV News:
 
 "When she played it for me, it took me a while to find out the visual interpretation that I could give back to her. And so I woke up one night and I got it, and I said, 'I got it: We have to birth a new race.' From the gate, Gaga was like, 'I want Nick Knight for this video. I want a visual.' She was always birthing something visual in her head, and Nick Knight is just, well, he's prolific but he's so genius. It was about pushing the bar of what a music video should be and can be. ... It's a different time; it's a different era; there are no limits. It is a viral message. I think that there's something in there for everyone, and that's what's so amazing about the video and so specific about the message."

Gibson recalled having to work with Gaga on her dancing in the video, and to make her a better dancer she wanted Gaga to be confident.[tpl]cite web|title=Lady Gaga's 'Born This Way' Video, Frame By Frame|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1659008/lady-gaga-born-this-way-video.jhtml|publisher=MTV (MTV Networks)|first=Jocelyn|last=Vena|date=March 1, 2011|accessdate=March 25, 2011[/tpl] Gaga chose New York to shoot the video because the city is her birthplace. Before shooting started, Gibson and Gaga decided there was only one place to work on the avant-garde, modern dance routine for the video, Alvin Alley, where Gibson had studied dance. "We rehearsed there because the choreography is really modern-based. It's, like, more technical than anything she's ever done," she recalled. Shooting also took place in Brooklyn for two days. Since Gaga did not want set pictures to be taken before the video was ready, her team had to hide the location and were successful, except at the last day when paparazzi started sneaking around.[tpl]cite web |title=Lady Gaga's 'Born This Way' Creative Director Explains: Why NYC? |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1658982/lady-gaga-born-this-way-video.jhtml |publisher=MTV (MTV Networks) |first=Jocelyn |last=Vena |date=March 1, 2011 |accessdate=March 25, 2011[/tpl]

===Synopsis===

Released on Monday, February 28, 2011, the video begins with a brief shot of a unicorn's silhouette in a steam-filled alley, inside a pink triangle frame. The triangle transitions to a shot of Gaga, with two opposite facing heads, inspired by Janus, the Roman god of transition and beginnings, sitting in an ornate glass throne amidst a star-filled space. As Bernard Herrmann's prelude to the movie Vertigo plays,[tpl]cite news|url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2011/02/28/lady-gaga-born-this-way-video/|title=Lady Gaga Debuts first 'Born This Way' video|last=Blauvelt|first=Christian|date=February 28, 2011|accessdate=June 23, 2011|work=Entertainment Weekly|publisher=Time Inc[/tpl] Gaga tells the story of the creation of an extraterrestrial race that "bears no prejudice, no judgment, but boundless freedom." Gaga sits in the throne, giving birth to a "new race within the race of humanity." She explains that this was followed by the birth of evil, due to which Gaga splits into two opposing forces of good and evil. Her new half gives birth to a machine gun and fires it. The prologue concludes with Gaga questioning, "How can I protect something so perfect, without evil?"
Gaga, with shoulder and facial protrusions (prosthetic makeup mimicking subdermal implants) walks in a seemingly endless black space, where people are on their hands and knees in an organized pattern. She raises her hand and crouches down to join them. When the first verse begins, everyone dances to choreography. The scenes alternate between the dance, and Gaga singing on her throne in space. In the second verse, Gaga and Rico are in tuxedos, with her face painted to mirror his. Alternating clips show Gaga caressing and attempting to dance with him while he stays expressionless and motionless for the most part. When the chorus plays for the second time, Gaga sings in a room of mirrors, with her head displayed in a glass box among oddly distorted mannequin heads. In the succeeding shots, she is once again shown on her throne giving birth to more members of the new race. After choreographed routines by Gaga and her dancers, they all gather in a circle and embrace in a hug.
In the video's conclusion, Gaga's silhouette struts in an alley in a tribute to Jackson's "The Way You Make Me Feel" video. Her face is misconstrued, with sharp horns protruding from her face, glowing eyes, uneven hair, and a distinct Madonna-esque gap between her front teeth.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1361570/Lady-Gaga-Born-This-Way-video-Singer-gives-birth-provocative-new-clip.html |title=Lady Gaga gives birth in her provocative new music video for Born This Way|last=Bambigboye|first=Baz|date=February 28, 2011|accessdate=April 22, 2011|work=Daily Mail|publisher=Associated Newspapers[/tpl] Gaga has commented that she was teased as kids would call her "rabbit teeth".[tpl]cite news|url=http://patriotpost.us/opinion/suzanne-fields/2011/02/18/superstar-meets-supermom/ |title=Superstar meets Supermom|last=Fields|first=Suzanne|date=February 18, 2011|accessdate=August 4, 2011 |work=The Patriot-News|publisher=Advance Publications[/tpl] She sheds a single tear as the pink triangle frame appears again, and inside it, a silhouette of Gaga sitting atop the unicorn. A city and a rainbow appear in the background, and Gaga is seen in her zombie makeup, chewing bubble gum and blowing it, as the pink triangle zooms away.

===Reception===

The music video for "Born This Way" was met with generally positive reception among music critics. James Montgomery of MTV praised the overall creationism concept of the music video, adding that it "sort of makes sense, it sort of doesn't, but that 100 percent doesn't really matter much. This is Gaga at her most fabulous, her most out-there, her most, well, Gaga."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1658858/lady-gaga-born-this-way-video.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga's 'Born This Way' Video Premieres|last=Montgomery|first=James|date=February 28, 2011|publisher=MTV (MTV Networks)|accessdate=February 28, 2011[/tpl] In conclusion of his review, he wrote that the fantasy aspects of the video is overshadowed by the overall spectacle, which he believed was analogous to Gaga, "after thoroughly dominating this world with 'Born This Way,' she seems content to create brand-new worlds to tower over." Myrddin Gwynedd of The New Zealand Herald felt that Gaga's penchant for eccentric and provocative imagery, was extreme in the video.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&objectid=10709461|title=Lady Gaga: 'Born This Way' video premieres|last=Gwynedd|first=Myrddin|date=February 28, 2011|work=The New Zealand Herald|publisher=APN News & Media|accessdate=January 1, 2011[/tpl] Raphael Chestang from Entertainment Tonight praised the performance of Gaga and her dancers in the video, also complimenting the fashion.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.etonline.com/music/108204_Lady_Gaga_Debuts_New_Born_This_Way_Music_Video/index.html|title= Lady Gaga Debuts New 'Born This Way' Music Video|last=Chestang|first=Raphael|work=Entertainment Tonight|publisher=2011-04-22|date=February 28, 2011[/tpl] Monica Herrera from Billboard noticed that the video bore similarities to the music video of Madonna's "Vogue" and "Borderline" (1984), while believing it to be "more of a high-fashion short film than a conventional music video".[tpl]Cite news|last=Herrera|first=Monica |url= http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/472844/lady-gagas-born-this-way-video-premieres |title=Lady Gaga's 'Born This Way' Video Premieres |work=Billboard|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|date=March 4, 2011 |accessdate=March 5, 2011[/tpl] Jim Farber from New York Daily News wanted Gaga to add more humor in her videos, adding that although the video had "joyous" shock value, it definitely lacked creativity.[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2011-02-28/entertainment/28656490_1_lady-gaga-la-gaga-taboos|title=Lady Gaga 'Born This Way' music video premieres: Graphic birth imagery breaks taboos|last=Farber|first=Jim|date=February 28, 2011|accessdate=April 22, 2011|work=New York Daily News|publisher=Mortimer Zuckerman[/tpl]
Oscar Moralde from Slant Magazine noted that in the video, "Gaga fully embraces the monstrous as a part of her." Moralde further explained that previously the singer had acknowledged her role as "Mother Monster", but never to the visceral, fully embodied extent that she does in the video. "The things that are monstrous, the things that are different—for Gaga, those are the things that are beautiful," he concluded.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/house/2011/03/video-review-lady-gagas-born-this-way/|title=Video Review: Lady Gaga's "Born This Way|last=Moralde|first=Oscar|date=March 4, 2011|accessdate=April 22, 2011|publisher=Slant Magazine[/tpl] Gina Serpe from E!

Examples given by her included the portrayal of Rico as her partner, instead of a conventional-looking male or female consort. Powers further added that "Gaga has found a way to place female empowerment at the center of her vision without sacrificing the gains she makes by being a daddy's girl or a 'boy toy'."[tpl]cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2011/03/lady-gagas-born-this-way-video-ann-powers.html|title=Lady Gaga's 'Born This Way' video: Making goddess culture accessible|last=Powers|first=Ann|authorlink=Ann Powers|date=March 1, 2011|accessdate=April 22, 2011|work=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Tribune Company[/tpl] Megan Powers from Time criticized the video and Gaga's usage of shock-imagery, which she still found "strange".[tpl]Cite news|url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2011/02/28/lady-gagas-born-this-way-video-in-case-you-forgot-gagas-still-weird/|title=Lady Gaga's 'Born this Way' Video: In Case You Forgot, Gaga's Still Weird|last=Gibson|first=Megan|date=March 1, 2011|accessdate=April 22, 2011|work=Time|publisher=Time Inc.[/tpl] The video has been noted for its cultural references and artistic similarities, not only to other recording artists such as Jackson and Madonna, but to Greek and Roman mythology, surrealism and the work of Swiss painter H.

The "Born This Way" performance was introduced by Ricky Martin. In the first few seconds after performing the intro of the song, Gaga emerged from the egg, and after the first chorus, she whipped her hair in a manner similar to singer Willow Smith. Before the "No matter gay, straight or bi" line of the song, an organ emerged from the stage floor.[tpl]Cite news|url =http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/lady-gaga-hatches-egg-grammy-99189|title =Lady Gaga Hatches From Egg During Grammy Performance (VIDEO)|work=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|date =February 13, 2011|accessdate =February 15, 2011|last=Powers|first=Lindsay[/tpl] Gaga played the music on the organ, which was surrounded by mannequin heads submerged in gel, before belting out the rest of the bridge as her dancers surrounded her. Before leaving the stage, Gaga put on her trench and hat as the song faded out and Gaga and her dancers ended the performance with their hands put up in paws.
According to Gaga the Grammy performance was inspired by many things, including Gregorian music, Alvin Ailey dance moves and Martha Graham's dance energy. On The Tonight Show with Jay Leno she explained that Smith inspired her to "whip my hair back and forth on stage," referring to Smith's similar named song. Gaga continued that the incubating vessel was meant to signify an artistic statement of birthing a new race with no prejudice.[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2011-02-15/entertainment/28619642_1_monster-ball-tour-love-and-complete-support-grammy-performance|title=Lady Gaga Grammys 2011 performance egg explained; Says Madonna 'supports' 'Born This Way'|last=Roberts|first=Soraya|date=February 14, 2011|accessdate=April 23, 2011|work=New York Daily News|publisher=Mortimer Zuckerman[/tpl] The idea occurred to her when she was in Amsterdam on her tour bus, and was thinking about birth and embryos.

I don't want to exist in this machine or this circus that is the industry. I wish I could be encapsulated for three days and just think only about my performance, think only about the album, think only about the future of my fans. So that's what I did." Jocelyn Vena from MTV felt that the performance was "surprisingly" sparse compared to Gaga's previous "over-the-top" endeavors. Soraya Roberts from New York Daily News was disappointed with the "highly expected" performance, feeling that it had copied Madonna and her Blond Ambition World Tour choreography.[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2011-02-14/entertainment/28616090_1_puppets-cee-lo-green-53rd-annual-grammy-awards|title=Cee Lo Grammy performance with puppets beats Lady Gaga 'Born This Way' egg arrival|last=Roberts|first=Soraya|date=February 14, 2011|accessdate=April 23, 2011|work=New York Daily News|publisher=Mortimer Zuckerman[/tpl] Jason Lipscultz from Billboard described the performance as "spirited", and felt that Gaga's appearance inside the egg was one of the memorable moments of the Grammy Awards.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/473063/lady-gaga-hits-grammys-in-giant-egg-rocks-born-this-way|title=Lady Gaga Hits Grammys in Giant Egg, Rocks 'Born This Way'|date=February 14, 2011|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|last=Lipschultz|first=Jason|work=Billboard|accessdate=February 27, 2011[/tpl] Jennifer Armstrong from Entertainment Weekly praised the performance saying that although there were definite influences of Madonna in it, the performance was one of the highlights of the show.[tpl]cite news|url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2011/02/13/lady-gagas-grammy-performance-born-this-way-hatches-from-a-giant-egg/|title=Lady Gaga's Grammy performance: 'Born This Way' hatches from a giant egg|last=Armstrong|first=Jennifer|date=February 13, 2011|accessdate=April 23, 2011|work=Entertainment Weekly|publisher=Time Inc[/tpl] Matthew Perpetua from Rolling Stone concurred that "It should come as no surprise that Lady Gaga's performance of her new single 'Born This Way' was the evening's most visually stunning and bizarre spectacle."[tpl]cite news|last=Perpetua|first=Matthew|date=February 14, 2011|accessdate=April 23, 2011|work=Rolling Stone|publisher=Jann Wenner|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/arcade-fire-lady-antebellum-lady-gaga-win-big-at-the-grammys-20110214|title=Arcade Fire, Lady Antebellum, Lady Gaga Win Big at the Grammys[/tpl]

At the February 19, 2011, date of The Monster Ball Tour, Gaga performed "Born This Way" as a second encore, using the same general attire and choreography as the Grammy performance, however the incubation vessel was not present and slight alterations were made in the outfits of her dancers.[tpl]cite web|url =http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1658379/lady-gaga-atlantic-city.jhtml|title =Lady Gaga Has Her 'Way' With Atlantic City|accessdate =April 24, 2011|date=February 20, 2011| first=Vaughn |last=Schoonmaker|publisher=MTV (MTV Networks) [/tpl] The track was then added to the set-list of the concert tour. Tris McCall from The Star-Ledger was most impressed with the performance, calling it one of the highlights of the concert. He added that "reinterpretation of the single, which was far more Laura Nyro than Madonna, was such an improvement over the mechanized, tricked-out hit version that it was hard not to wish she could get back to the studio and re-cut it before the album comes out."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/music/index.ssf/2011/04/lady_gaga_shows_her_teeth_at_p.html|title=Lady Gaga shows her teeth at Prudential Center|last=McCall|first=Tris|authorlink=Tris McCall|date=April 23, 2011|accessdate=April 23, 2011|work=The Star-Ledger|publisher=Advance Publications[/tpl] Gaga performed an acoustic version on The Oprah Winfrey Show, in May 2011, along with another song from Born This Way, "You and I".

American singer-songwriter and parodist "Weird Al" Yankovic had sought permission from Gaga to parody "Born This Way", providing a brief description of the concept for his song. Her management responded that she must hear the song before providing approval.
