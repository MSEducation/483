Pierino Ronald "Perry" Como (May 18, 1912 – May 12, 2001) was an American singer and television personality. During a career spanning more than half a century, he recorded exclusively for the RCA Victor label after signing with them in 1943. "Mr. C.", as he was nicknamed, sold millions of records for Radio Corporation of America (RCA) and pioneered a weekly musical variety television show, which set the standards for the genre and proved to be one of the most successful in television history. Como was seen weekly on television from 1949 to 1963, then continued hosting the Kraft Music Hall variety program monthly until 1967. His television shows and seasonal specials were broadcast throughout the world.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=O10rAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Pp0FAAAAIBAJ&pg=4607,1387297&dq=perry+como&hl=en |title=Como's Best Liked of Shows Abroad|date= 8 November 1960|author=Bacon, James|publisher=Montreal Gazette|accessdate=4 May 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XJEtAAAAIBAJ&sjid=EY0EAAAAIBAJ&pg=7410,169430&dq=perry+como+pope&hl=en|title=Como Far From Retired But He Fishes A Lot|author=O'Brian, Jack|date=1 July 1971|publisher=Sarasota Journal|accessdate=19 July 2010[/tpl] Also a popular recording artist, Perry Como produced numerous hit records; his combined success on television and popular recordings was not matched by any other artist of the time. Como's appeal spanned generations and he was widely respected for both his professional standards and the conduct in his personal life. In the official RCA Records Billboard magazine memorial, his life was summed up in these few words: "50 years of music and a life well lived. An example to all."[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jhMEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA79&dq=perry+como+intitle:billboard&lr=&as_drrb_is=b&as_minm_is=1&as_miny_is=2001&as_maxm_is=12&as_maxy_is=2001&as_brr=0&as_pt=MAGAZINES&cd=6#v=onepage&q=perry%20como%20intitle%3Abillboard&f=false|title=RCA Memorial-Perry Como (page 79)|date=26 May 2001|publisher= Billboard|accessdate=4 April 2010[/tpl] Composer Ervin Drake said of him, "... occasionally someone like Perry comes along and won't 'go with the flow' and still prevails in spite of all the bankrupt others who surround him and importune him to yield to their values.

One of the many factors in his success was Como's insistence on his principles of good taste; if he considered something to be in bad or poor taste, it was not in the show or broadcast.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7AodAAAAIBAJ&sjid=K2UEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7140,3031083&dq=perry+como+ace+goodman&hl=en|title=Perry Como's Success: It's Good Taste|date=18 January 1958|publisher=Sarasota Herald-Tribune|accessdate=25 June 2010[/tpl]  When a remark made by Julius La Rosa about television personality Arthur Godfrey on The Perry Como Show was misconstrued, Como offered an on-air apology at the beginning of his next show, against the advice of his staff.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lngcAAAAIBAJ&sjid=5GQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1938,3527518&dq=perry+como&hl=en|title=Como Reconstruction To Comedy Isn't Easy|author=Wilson, Earl|date=17 October 1955|publisher=Sarasota Herald-Tribune|accessdate=24 October 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qNMxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cuQFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3365,1480593&dq=perry+como&hl=en|title=Perry Como Just Takes It Easy|author=Kleiner, Dick|date=21 April 1956|publisher=Ottawa Citizen|accessdate=24 October 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JKEyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=fOoFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2435,3290890&dq=perry+como&hl=en|title=Como Keeps Shady Stuff Off Show|author=Wilson, Earl|date=8 June 1957|publisher=The Miami News|accessdate=19 November 2010[/tpl]  While his performance of "Ave Maria" was a tradition of his holiday television programs, Como refused to sing it at live performances, saying, "It's not the time or place to do it", even though it was the number-one request of his audiences.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jdwqAAAAIBAJ&sjid=WNoFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2594,4899789&dq=perry+como&hl=en|title=Como Gets The Christmas Spirit|date=23 November 1986|author=Bark, Ed|publisher=Beaver Country Times|accessdate=7 May 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Ukk0AAAAIBAJ&sjid=X2cEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5157,5588917&dq=perry+como+marilyn+maxwell&hl=en|title=People in the News-Hope Favors 'Silver Bells'|date=14 November 1977|publisher=Sarasota Herald-Tribune|accessdate=5 November 2010[/tpl]  Another was his naturalness; the man viewers saw on the screen was the same person who could be encountered behind a supermarket shopping cart, at a bowling alley, or in a kitchen making breakfast.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=mjQaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ByYEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4410,1845591&dq=perry+como+show+nbc&hl=en|title=Pin Splinters|date=24 March 1956|publisher=Milwaukee Journal|accessdate=6 August 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KP0sAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Lc0FAAAAIBAJ&pg=1433,5496189&dq=mitchell+ayres&hl=en|title=Eggs Ala Como For Toney's Gal|author=Taylor, Dick|date=29 January 1956|publisher=Palm Beach Post|accessdate=27 July 2010[/tpl] From his first Chesterfield Supper Club television show, if scripts were written at all, they were based on the way Como would say something. Como was not devoid of a temper, and it could be seen at times as a result of the frustrations of daily life.  His music director from 1948 – 1963, Mitchell Ayres, said, "Perry has a temper like everyone else.  And he loses his temper at the normal things everyone else does.  When we're driving, for instance, and somebody cuts him off, he really lets the offender have it."[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8QEvAAAAIBAJ&sjid=xqkFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3531,768619&dq=mitchell+ayres&hl=en|title=Pops To Met-The Hard Way|author=Kleiner, Dick|date=12 January 1961|publisher=The Sumter Daily Item|accessdate=27 July 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-XosAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Y8wEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5454,1647656&dq=ray+charles+como&hl=en|title=Who Says I'm So Relaxed?|author=Como, Perry, Jablons, Beverly|date=10 May 1959|publisher=Herald-Journal|accessdate=8 January 2010[/tpl]

His father, a mill hand and an amateur baritone, had all his children attend music lessons even if he could barely afford them. In a rare 1957 interview, Como's mother, Lucia, described how her young son also took on other jobs to pay for more music lessons; Como learned to play many different instruments, but never had a voice lesson.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GrAVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=RBAEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7181,550250&dq=perry+como&hl=en|title=Perry Como a Nice Boy Who Grew Up to Be a Nice Guy|author=Carlin, Margie|date=11 May 1957|publisher=The Milwaukee Sentinel|accessdate=7 January 2011[/tpl] Perry showed more musical talent in his teenage years as a trombone player in the town's brass band, playing guitar, singing at weddings, and as an organist at church.[tpl]cite news|title=In search of the soul of Perry Como|date=17 December 1995|author=Nelson Jones, Diana|publisher= Pittsburgh Post-Gazette[/tpl] Retrieved 4 May 2010.

Young Como started helping his family at age 10, working before and after school in Steve Fragapane's barber shop for 50¢ a week. By age 13, he had graduated to having his own chair in the Fragapane barber shop, although he stood on a box to tend to his customers.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hzUaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=xA8EAAAAIBAJ&pg=6207,6132686&dq=perry+como&hl=en|title=My Story-Perry Como (pages 21-22)|date=10 January 1954|author= Como.Perry, Zolotow, Maurice|publisher=Milwaukee Sentinel/American Weekly|accessdate=11 May 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.webcitation.org/60FwTzCFz|title=My Story-Perry Como Part 2|date=17 January 1954|author= Como.Perry, Zolotow, Maurice|publisher=The American Weekly|accessdate=17 July 2011[/tpl]  It was also around this time that young Como lost his week's wages in a dice game. Filled with shame, he locked himself in his room and did not come out until hunger got the better of him.  He managed to tell his father what had happened to the money his family depended on. His father told him he was entitled to make a mistake and that he hoped his son would never do anything worse than this. When Perry was 14, his father became unable to work because of a severe heart condition. Como and his brothers became the support of the household.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BcQwAAAAIBAJ&sjid=4moDAAAAIBAJ&pg=1185,2940254&dq=perry+como&hl=en|title=Success Is Result of Faith|author=Como, Perry|date=11 March 1955|publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|accessdate=24 October 2010|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BcQwAAAAIBAJ&sjid=4moDAAAAIBAJ&pg=1185,2940254&dq=perry+como&hl=en[/tpl]
Despite his musical ability, Como's primary ambition was to become the best barber in Canonsburg. Practicing on his father, young Como mastered the skills well enough to have his own shop at age 14.[tpl]Citation | editor-last = Macfarlane | editor-first = Malcolm | title = Perry Como: A Biography and Complete Career Record | year = 2009 | page = 310 | publisher = McFarland | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=iymN4zko8JkC&pg=PA76&lpg=PA76&dq=perry+como+sands+point&source=bl&ots=jS2EmKP72m&sig=kn-5GRUFqADRo4Kxm1vsvffZaTo&hl=en&ei=tkrWS4fpBoTcM7DQyc8D&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CBgQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=perry%20como%20sands%20point&f=false | isbn = 0-7864-3701-4 | accessdate = 28 April 2010[/tpl][tpl]Citation | editor-last = Grudens | editor-first = Richard | title = The Italian Crooners Bedside Companion | year = 1986 | pages = 63–69 | publisher = Celebrity Profiles Publishing | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=2nryuOQJP_MC&pg=PA62&dq=perry+como&lr=&cd=25#v=onepage&q=perry%20como&f=false | isbn = 0-9763877-0-0 | accessdate = 14 April 2010[/tpl]  One of Como's regular customers at the barber shop owned a Greek coffee house that included a barber shop area, and asked the young barber whether he would like to take over that portion of his shop.  Como had so much work after moving to the coffee house, he had to hire two barbers to help with it. His customers worked mainly at the nearby steel mills. They were well-paid, did not mind spending money on themselves and enjoyed Como's song renditions. Perry did especially well when one of his customers would marry.  The groom and his men would avail themselves of every treatment Como and his assistants had to offer.  Como sang romantic songs while busying himself with the groom as the other two barbers worked with the rest of the groom's party.  During the wedding preparation, the groom's friends and relatives would come into the shop with gifts of money for Como.  He became so popular as a "wedding barber" in the Greek community that he was asked to provide his services in Pittsburgh and Ohio.
In 1929, the 17-year-old Como met Roselle Belline at a picnic on Chartiers Creek that attracted many young people from the Canonsburg area.  Como, who attended the cookout with another girl, did not spot Roselle until everyone was around the campfire singing and the gathering was coming to a close. When it came Como's turn to sing, he chose More Than You Know, with his eyes on Roselle for the entire song.  The teenage sweethearts were married July 31, 1933.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=MF4xAAAAIBAJ&sjid=S28DAAAAIBAJ&pg=2380,114079&dq=perry+como&hl=en|title=Perry Como's Wife Sings His Praises At 65th Wedding Anniversary |date=1 August 1998|author=Fitch, Antoinette|publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|accessdate=8 May 2010[/tpl]  They raised three children, Ronnie, David, and Terri, with traditional, non-show-business values.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kokomo.ca/cd_review/press/earlybio.htm |title=Perry Como, An Early Biography-RCA Records-Perry Como at Home|year=1957|publisher=RCA Records|accessdate=4 April 2010[/tpl] Because Perry Como believed his professional life and his personal life should be kept separate, he declined repeated interview requests from Edward R.

A thorough check of both the Como and National Broadcasting Company (NBC) publicity offices found that neither was responsible for the release of the photos to the media; it was done by the Vatican's press department.  When Perry and Roselle became Knight Commander and Lady Commander of the Equestrian Order of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre in 1952, it was a news item only after Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen, who had been honored at the same ceremony, mentioned it some time later.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=N2wsAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-8wEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4458,403214&dq=perry+como&hl=en|title=Como Wears White Hat|date=4 January 1973|author=O'Brian, Jack| publisher=Spartanburg Herald-Journal|accessdate=7 May 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZYcsAAAAIBAJ&sjid=tIoFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4780,4348004&dq=nick+perito&hl=en|title=Never Far From Tee|author=O'Brien, Jack|date=26 June 1971|publisher=Herald-Journal|accessdate=23 August 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/institutions_connected/oessh/en/cenni_storici_en.html|title=Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem-What it means to be a Member of the Order|publisher=Vatican.va|accessdate=9 May 2011[/tpl]

==Como's career as a professional singer==

===Freddy Carlone and Ted Weems===

In 1932, Como left Canonsburg, moving about 100 miles away to Meadville, Pennsylvania, where his uncle had a barber shop in the Hotel Conneaut. About 80 miles from Cleveland, it was a stop on the itinerary for dance bands who worked up and down the Ohio Valley. Como, Roselle, and their friends had gone to nearby Cleveland; their good times took them to the Silver Slipper Ballroom where Freddy Carlone and his orchestra were playing. Carlone invited anyone who thought he might have singing talent to come up and sing with his band. Young Como was terrified, but his friends urged him onto the stage. Carlone was so impressed with his performance that he offered him a job.
The young man was not certain whether he should accept the offer Freddy Carlone had made, so he returned to Canonsburg to talk the matter over with his father. Perry expected he would tell him to stay in the barber business, but to his surprise, the senior Como told him if he did not try this, he would never know whether or not he could be a professional singer.  The decision was also made with an eye on finances; Como earned $125 per week from his barber shop while the job with Carlone paid $28 per week."Turns Down">[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8h0fAAAAIBAJ&sjid=25kEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7237,2740891&dq=perry+como&hl=en|title=Perry Como Turns Down $250,000 A Year To Relax|date=25 January 1955|author= Boyle, Hal|publisher= The Tuscaloosa News|accessdate=4 May 2010[/tpl][/ref] Roselle was willing to be a wife on the road, traveling with her husband and the band, but the salary could not support two people like this.

It was here where the young Como acquired polish and his own unique style, with the help of Ted Weems. Mutual Broadcasting System member WGN radio threatened to stop carrying the Weems broadcasts from Chicago's Palmer House if Weems's new singer did not improve. Weems had recordings of some previous radio programs; one evening he and Como listened to them after the show. From listening to them, Como was shocked to realize that no one could make out the words to the songs he was singing.  Weems told Como there was no need for him to resort to vocal tricks; what was necessary was to sing from the heart.[tpl]cite web|url=http://kokomo.ca/cd_review/_perito/perito_01.htm|title=The Big Bands-Ted Weems|author=Simon, George T.|year=1967|accessdate=25 November 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=02UzLwNB_jMC&pg=PA29&dq=nick+perito&hl=en&ei=S-aTTffFF8iD0QHQsOD-Cw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CEwQ6AEwBzgU#v=onepage&q=nick%20perito&f=false|title=The American Songbook: The Singers, Songwriters & The Songs|editor-last=Bloom|editor-first=Ken|editor2-last=Feinstein|editor2-first=Michael|year=2005|publisher=Black Dog & Leventhal|page=320|isbn=978-1-57912-448-9|accessdate=30 March 2011[/tpl]
Como's first recording with the Weems band was a novelty tune called "You Can't Pull the Wool Over My Eyes", recorded for the Decca Records label in May, 1936. During one of Como's early Decca recording sessions with the Weems orchestra, Weems was told to get rid of "that kid" (Como) because he sounded too much like Bing Crosby. Before Como could reply, Ted Weems spoke up, saying that Como was part of the session or it was over. By the time Como had been with Ted Weems about a year, he was mentioned in a 1937 Life magazine NBC Radio ad for Fibber McGee and Molly as "causing cardiac flutters with his crooning."[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=gUsEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA7&dq=perry+como+ted+weems&hl=en&ei=Vq3uTL-TN5btnQedxficCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CEAQ6AEwBTge#v=onepage&q=perry%20como%20ted%20weems&f=false|title=Monday Night Comes To Life|date=12 April 1937|publisher=Life|accessdate=25 November 2010[/tpl] The weekly radio show, Beat the Band,, which ran on NBC from 1940 – 1944, was a "stump the band" type musical quiz show where Weems and his orchestra were the featured band from 1940 – 1941.

===RCA Victor and radio===

The Como's first child, Ronnie, was born in 1940 while the Weems band was working in Chicago. Como left the performance to be at his wife's side even though he was threatened with dismissal if he did so. Though Perry was now making $250 a week and travel expenses for the family were no problem, young Ronnie could not become used to a normal routine when they were able to stay in one place for a period of time. The radio program Beat the Band did not always originate from Chicago, but was often done from locations such as Milwaukee, Denver and St. Louis, as the band continued to play road engagements while part of the radio show cast.[tpl]cite web|url=http://radiogoldindex.com/cgi-local/p2.cgi?ProgramName=Beat+The+Band|title=list of 'Beat the Band' episodes|author=Goldin, David|publisher=RadioGold|accessdate=13 April 2011[/tpl] The Comos decided road life was no place to try raising a child, and Roselle and the baby went back to Canonsburg.
In late 1942, Como made the decision to quit the Weems band, even if it meant giving up singing. He returned to Canonsburg, his family, and his trade, tired of life on the road without his wife and young son.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2bQRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=iOkDAAAAIBAJ&pg=2451,3760562&dq=perry+como&hl=en|title=Cool, calm singer Perry Como just missed being a barber|date=25 August 1985|author=Thomas, Bob|publisher=Gainesville Sun|accessdate=7 May 2010[/tpl]  Como received an offer to become a Frank Sinatra imitator, but chose to keep his own style.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0CwaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=8SQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4114,3601061&dq=perry+como&hl=en|title=Perry Como Sings For His Supper|date=23 June 1946|author=Daniel, Jesse|publisher=Milwaukee Journal|accessdate=7 May 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZjArAAAAIBAJ&sjid=CZkFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5309,935464&dq=perry+como&hl=en|title=Perry Como Abjured Imitation, Rose to Top on His Own Merits|date=7 January 1947|publisher=Montreal Gazette|accessdate=24 June 2010[/tpl] While Perry was negotiating for a store lease to re-open a barber shop, he had a call from Tommy Rockwell at General Artists Corporation, who also represented Ted Weems.

Doug Storer, who was an advertising manager with the Blackman Company at the time, became convinced of Como's abilities after hearing him on his non-sponsored CBS Radio show. Storer produced a demo radio program recording with Como and the Mitchell Ayres Orchestra which he brought to the advertising agency that handled the Chesterfield Cigarettes account. Initially, the agency liked the format of the show, but wanted someone else as the star, asking Storer to obtain the release of the singer they preferred, so he would be free for their new program. Storer decided to do nothing about getting the singer released from his contract. When he was contacted by the agency some weeks later, saying they were ready to put the program on the air on NBC, Storer bluntly told them the man for their show was the man they had heard on the demo recording. The program was scheduled to make its debut in about a week; the only option was to hire Como for the show. Storer then arranged for Como's release from his CBS contract.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sLhaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=zFkDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5363,3399391&dq=perry+como+fifty&hl=en|title=Doing it his way paid off for famous trio|author=Storer, Doug|date=14 October 1983|publisher=The Evening Independent|accessdate=1 April 2011[/tpl] On December 11, 1944, he moved from CBS to NBC for a new radio program, Chesterfield Supper Club.[tpl]Citation | editor-last = Mackenzie | editor-first = Harry | title = The Directory of the Armed Forces Radio Service Series | year = 1999 | pages = 87–88 | publisher = Greenwood Press | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=L3WyZ9A4_XEC&pg=PA87&dq=perry+como&lr=&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&as_brr=3&cd=28#v=onepage&q=perry%20como&f=false | isbn = 0-313-30812-8 | accessdate = 14 April 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wR4aAAAAIBAJ&sjid=5iQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3453,1443618&dq=perry+como&hl=en|title=Crosby Takes It Easy, But So Does Perry Como|date=23 November 1947|author=Fleming, Robert|publisher=Milwaukee Journal|accessdate=June 24, 2010[/tpl]

===Vocal characteristics===

Perry Como credited Bing Crosby for influencing his voice and style.[tpl]Citation | editor-last = Hemming | editor-first = Roy |editor2-last = Hajdu | editor2-first = David | title = Discovering Great Singers of Classic Pop: | year = 1999 | pages = 130–133 | publisher = Newmarket Press | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=zbYtmOIHvfcC&pg=PA130&dq=perry+como&lr=&cd=13#v=onepage&q=perry%20como&f=false | isbn = 1-55704-148-2 | accessdate = 13 April 2010[/tpl][ref]
, tape 1, side B.[/ref] Perry Como's voice is widely known for its good-natured vocal acrobatics as portrayed in his highly popular novelty songs such as "Hot Diggity (Dog Ziggity Boom)," but there was another side to Perry Como. Music critic Gene Lees describes it in his sleeve note to Como's 1968 album Look To Your Heart:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kokomo.ca/_private/album222.htm|title=Look to Your Heart-Liner Notes|author=Lees, Gene|publisher=RCA Victor|year=1968|accessdate=30 June 2010[/tpl]
 Despite his immense popularity, Como is rarely given credit for what, once you stop and think of it, he so clearly is: one of the great singers and one of the great artists of our time.
  Perhaps the reason people rarely talk about his formidable attributes as a singer is that he makes so little fuss about them. That celebrated ease of his has been too little understood. Ease in any art is the result of mastery over the details of the craft. You get them together to the point where you can forget about how you do things and concentrate on what you are doing. Como got them together so completely that the muscles don’t even show. It seems effortless, but a good deal of effort has gone into making it seem so. Como is known to be meticulous about rehearsal of the material for an album. He tries things out in different keys, gives the song thought, makes suggestions, tries it again, and again, until he is satisfied. The hidden work makes him look like Mr. Casual, and too many people are taken in by it — but happily so.
  –Gene Lees-sleeve note, Look To Your Heart

Some misguided advisers sought to alter Como's life story by changing his previous occupation from barber to coal miner, claiming it would make for better press. Fred Othman, a Hollywood columnist, publicly stated he believed Como the barber was just a publicity gimmick.

He was put into a sort of stock company, where the actors or actresses worked only when the studio needed to fill out a schedule.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=i3cjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=9MkEAAAAIBAJ&pg=861,3272448&dq=perry+como+director&hl=en|title=Perry's Doing a Bit Better, These Days|date=21 January 1960|author=Thomas, Bob|publisher= Daytona Beach Morning Journal|accessdate=4 May 2010[/tpl] Though his last movie, Words and Music, was a Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer production, Como fared no better.

===Early years: 1948 – 1955===

Perry Como made the move to television when NBC initially televised the Chesterfield Supper Club radio program on December 24, 1948. A very special guest on that first television show was Como's eight-year-old son, Ronnie, as part of a boys' choir singing "Silent Night" with his father.[tpl]Citation | editor-last = Brooks | editor-first = Tim |editor2-last = Marsh|editor2-first = Earle F.| title = The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows | year = 1987 | pages = 1071–1072 | publisher = Ballantine Books | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=flZ0wqsOnjkC&pg=PA1071&dq=perry+como&lr=&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&as_brr=3&cd=16#v=onepage&q=perry%20como&f=false | isbn = 0-345-49773-2 | accessdate = 14 April 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://ctva.biz/US/MusicVariety/PerryComoShow_1948-55.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20101224225533/http://ctva.biz/US/MusicVariety/PerryComoShow_1948-55.htm|archivedate=2010-12-24|title=Perry Como Show-1948-1955|publisher=CTVA-Classic TV Archive|accessdate=18 August 2010[/tpl] The show was the usual Friday night Chesterfield Supper Club with an important exception—it was also being broadcast on television.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6BIxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=uAEEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7059,633494&dq=perry+como&hl=en|title=Perry Como's Relaxed As Ever|author=Smith, Cecil|date=22 January 1970|publisher=Toledo Blade|accessdate=8 January 2011[/tpl] The experimental simulcast was to continue for three Friday "Supper Club" shows, but had gone so well, NBC decided to extend the televised version through August 1949.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=01VgAAAAIBAJ&sjid=p3ENAAAAIBAJ&pg=5914,6367171&dq=mitchell+ayres&hl=en|title=Perry Como Will Salute Azalea Fete|date=24 March 1949|publisher=Star-News|accessdate=18 April 2011[/tpl]  Years later, Como admitted to being scared and feeling awkward initially, but somehow managed to just be himself.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/30/magazine/the-lives-they-lived-50-s-perry-como-b-1912-troy-donahue-b-1936-pretty-boys.html?pagewanted=1|title=The Lives They Lived-50's-Perry Como B. 1912|date=30 December 2001|author=Rich, Frank|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=19 July 2010|archiveurl =http://www.webcitation.org/5xGGC4EYl|archivedate=17 March 2011[/tpl]  Said Como, "You can't act on TV.  With me, what you see is what you get."  While still in its experimental phase, Como and the television show survived an on location broadcast in Durham, North Carolina, on April 15, 1949.
On September 8, 1949, it became a weekly half-hour offering on Sunday nights, directly opposite Ed Sullivan's Toast of the Town.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8mEvAAAAIBAJ&sjid=49wFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4280,2872001&dq=perry+como&hl=en|title=Two Gypsy Folk Tales|date=8 August 1949|author=Hammerston, Claude|publisher=Ottawa Citizen|accessdate=24 June 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.archive.org/details/ChesterfieldSupperClub-27november1949|title= Chesterfield Supper Club|date= 27 November 1949|publisher=Internet Archives|accessdate=9 May 2010[/tpl] In 1950, Perry moved to CBS and the show's title was changed to The Perry Como Chesterfield Show, again sponsored by Liggett & Myers' Chesterfield cigarettes. Como hosted this informal 15 minute musical variety series on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, immediately following the CBS Television News. The Faye Emerson Show was initially broadcast in the same time slot on Tuesday and Thursday.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.archive.org/details/Perry_Como_1952|title=The Perry Como Show (video)|year=1952|publisher=Internet Archives|accessdate=9 May 2010[/tpl] By 1952, it was evident that television would replace radio as the major entertainment medium.  Gary Giddins, the biographer of Bing Crosby, said in 2001, "He (Como) came from this whole generation of crooners--Crosby and Sinatra, but he was the only one of them who figured out TV."  Como's 15-minute television show was also simulcast on radio via the Mutual Broadcasting System beginning on August 24, 1953; while the Chesterfield Supper Club broadcasts were simulcast on radio and television, this was the first instance of a simulcast between two networks.
Como's CBS contract was to expire on July 1, 1955.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SAwrAAAAIBAJ&sjid=VJoFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4481,387375&dq=perry+como+contract&hl=en|title=Perry Como Signs With NBC For One-Hour Show Weekly|author=Baft, Atra|date=1 April 1955|publisher=Reading Eagle|accessdate=19 November 2010[/tpl]  The year before, he had been asked to be the master of ceremonies and narrator of the NBC Radio 35th anniversary special.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=THgbAAAAIBAJ&sjid=HE4EAAAAIBAJ&pg=4857,2404314&dq=perry+como&hl=en|title=Old Voices Return to Network|author=Ward, Henry|date=24 June 1954|publisher=The Pittsburgh Press|accessdate=19 November 2010[/tpl] That April, Perry Como signed a 12 year "unbreakable" contract with NBC. On his last CBS show, June 24, 1955, Como was in high spirits, bringing all those who worked off camera on the air for introductions.  Perry tried his hand at camera work, getting a picture on the air but one that was upside-down.  In appreciation for the 11 year association, his sponsor, Chesterfield, presented him with all the musical arrangements used during this time as a parting gift.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BwcrAAAAIBAJ&sjid=TpgFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3299,5716118&dq=perry+como&hl=en|title=Value of $350,000 Is Placed On Farewell Gift to Como|author=O'Brian, Jack|date=30 June 1955|publisher=Reading Eagle|accessdate=19 November 2010[/tpl]

===Sing to me, Mr. C.: 1955 – 1959===

He moved back to NBC with a weekly hour long variety show featuring additional musical and production numbers, comedy sketches and guest stars called  The Perry Como Show, premiering Saturday, September 17, 1955. This version of his show was also so popular that in the 1956 – 1957 television season, it reached ninth in the Nielsen ratings, the only show on NBC that season to land in the top ten.

When cameras entered the "Supper Club" radio studio, they found Como and his guests sitting on stools behind music stands. The show's closing theme was, "You Are Never Far Away From Me".
Perry's announcer on the broadcasts, Frank Gallop, became a foil for Como's jokes. When the television show began, there was not enough room for Gallop to appear on stage; he was an invisible "voice from the clouds" until the show's 1958 – 1959 season.[tpl]cite news|title=Perry Como's Announcer Comes Down to Earth|date=25 January 1959|author=Dornbrook, Don|publisher=Milwaukee Journal[/tpl]Retrieved 7 May 2010[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xTkxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=5wAEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7518,1302576&dq=frank+gallop&hl=en|title=Frank Gallop: The Man Who Goes for 'Breaks'|author=Oviatt, Ray|date=23 November 1958|publisher=Toledo Blade|accessdate=17 August 2010[/tpl] There was as much fun at rehearsals as on the show itself.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PgUdAAAAIBAJ&sjid=w4oEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4330,3096686&dq=perry+como&hl=en|title=Perry Como's Plan: Just Take It Easy|date=21 November 1955|author=Kleiner, Dick|publisher=Sarasota Journal|accessdate=7 May 2010[/tpl] Como's relaxed and fun-loving manner at rehearsals put many nervous guests at ease.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fjgeAAAAIBAJ&sjid=k8sEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1931,1891441&dq=perry+como&hl=en|title=Perry Como Never Bothers To Worry|date=13 October 1956|publisher=Daytona Beach Morning Journal|accessdate=8 January 2011[/tpl] It was common for Como to leave the Saturday afternoon rehearsal for about a half-hour to go to confession.  He managed to save some time by asking his music publisher, Mickey Glass, to wait in line for him at the confessional.  Glass, who was Jewish, was most agreeable to this, but wondered what to do if his turn came before Como arrived.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=yGpQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=RxAEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3600,3380106&dq=perry+como+klatsch&hl=en|title=Coffee Klatsch, Break for Como|author=Wilson, Earl|date=27 May 1956|publisher=The Milwaukee Sentinel|accessdate=22 May 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nCEhAAAAIBAJ&sjid=7mQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4973,4391205&dq=perry+como+mickey+glass&hl=en|title=Talk is Again Boosting Perle Mesta|author=Wilson, Earl|date=17 February 1956|publisher=Sarasota Herald-Tribune|accessdate=22 May 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/tv/starr_report_mb1xB4d4k6q3WIYuoQGo2K|title=Starr Report-Death of Mickey Glass|author=Starr, Michael|date=6 August 2007|publisher=The New York Post|accessdate=1 September 2011[/tpl]
Perry thoroughly enjoyed what he was doing, saying in a 1989 interview, "I got a kick out of live television.  The spontaneity was the fun of it."  Spontaneity and the ability to be himself came in handy for swimmer/actress Esther Williams' guest appearance of March 16, 1957.  A wardrobe malfunction meant that viewers were seeing more of Esther than 1950s television considered to be in good taste; more live show mishaps followed. At the show's end, Williams was swimming in a pool specially constructed on the set for her appearance.  Como simply said, "Goodnight, folks," and leaped, fully clothed, into the swimming pool.
On December 17, 1955, viewers were able to see first-hand what Perry did for a living before he was a professional singer. Actor Kirk Douglas was one of Como's television guests; Douglas had grown a beard for his Vincent van Gogh role in Lust For Life, which finished filming that week. Como shaved Douglas' movie beard live on national television.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=iwcpAAAAIBAJ&sjid=dUkDAAAAIBAJ&pg=7160,3929519&dq=perry+como&hl=en|title=Perry Como To Wield Razor On Kirk Douglas|date=15 December 1955|author=Mosby, Aline|publisher=Deseret News|accessdate=7 May 2010[/tpl] On September 15, 1956, the season premiere of The Perry Como Show was broadcast from NBC's new color television studios at the New York Ziegfeld Theatre, making it one of the first weekly color TV shows.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=dAcjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=i80FAAAAIBAJ&pg=2666,1834453&dq=perry+como&hl=en|title=Perry Como's Formula For Success|date=9 March 1958|author=Bell, Joseph N.|publisher=The Palm Beach Post|accessdate=7 May 2010[/tpl] In addition to this season premiere as a color television show, there was also a royal visit from Prince Rainier of Monaco and his bride of six months, Grace Kelly.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ctva.biz/US/MusicVariety/PerryComoShow_1955-59.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20101224230423/http://ctva.biz/US/MusicVariety/PerryComoShow_1955-59.htm|archivedate=2010-12-24|title=Perry Como Shows-1956-1959|publisher=CTVA-Classic TV Archive|accessdate=18 August 2010[/tpl]

Though Mrs. Belline spoke no English and Gleason no Italian, Roselle's mother was thrilled.  Como's words to Gleason after the visit, "Anything you want, you got it.

Another way to judge the value of the Como show to the network can be found in the following: during sound checks at rehearsals, it was often difficult to hear Como's soft voice without having a large microphone ruin a camera shot.  NBC had RCA design a microphone for the show, which was known as the "Como mike"; the microphone was able to pick up Como's voice properly and was small enough not to interfere with camera shots.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.coutant.org/bk10a/|title=RCA BK-10A|publisher=Coutant.org|accessdate=9 July 2010[/tpl]

===Kraft Music Hall: 1959 – 1967===

In 1959, Como moved to Wednesday nights, hosting Perry Como's Kraft Music Hall weekly for the next eight years; the last four seasons from 1963 to 1967 were done as monthly specials alternating with Kraft Suspense Theatre, The Andy Williams Show, and finally The Road West.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jV4bAAAAIBAJ&sjid=QE8EAAAAIBAJ&pg=6974,2398673&dq=perry+como&hl=en|title=What Perry Como Is Doing Now|author=Altschuler, Harry|date=29 Mau 1965|publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|accessdate=10 December 2010[/tpl]  Como became the highest-paid performer in the history of television to that date, earning mention in the Guinness Book of World Records.

==A farewell concert from Ireland==

Como's final Christmas special was filmed in January 1994 in Dublin's Point Theatre before an audience of 4,500 people, including Irish President Mary Robinson and Como's friend, the actress Maureen O'Hara. Perry Como's Irish Christmas was a Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) production, made by an Irish independent production company in association with RTE. It was directed by Bob Wynn and scripted and co-produced by Irish writer Michael Feeney Callan, who worked closely with Como on what Como viewed as a farewell performance. Como had flu during the show, which took four hours to record.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.michaelfeeneycallan.com |title=Michael Feeney Callan |publisher=Michael Feeney Callan |date= |accessdate=2012-06-28[/tpl] At the show's conclusion, Como apologized to his Dublin audience for a performance he felt was not up to his usual standards.
During his visit to Dublin, Como visited a barber shop called "The Como" on Thomas Street. The owners, lifelong fans who named their business in his honor, had sent photographs of the shop and letters to Como inviting him to visit. Photos of Como with the barbers were framed in the shop. "The Como" closed in 2002 but it remains a household name in The Liberties.

Canonsburg has always been very proud to be the birthplace of Perry Como; the local newspaper of the time, Canonsburg Daily Notes, seems to have been the first to write an article about him.  Their edition of July 19, 1934, featured a photo and the following: "A young Canonsburg boy threatens to snatch the crown from Bing Crosby's head.  Perry Como, son of Mr. and Mrs. Pietro Como of 530 Franklin street is said to have one of the grandest baritone voices in the country."

Perry, Roselle, and Como's mother, Lucy, attended the ceremonies and banquet held at the State Armory.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fWYcAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Jk4EAAAAIBAJ&pg=5393,2644286&dq=perry+como&hl=en|title=Canonsburg Bride He "Saved" Will Be Perry Como's Guest|date=21 November 1948|author=Steinhauser, Si|publisher=Pittsburgh Press|accessdate=7 May 2010[/tpl]
A second ceremony marking Perry Como Day took place August 24, 1977, but the most ambitious project began in 1997 – a statue of the singer.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1129&dat=19971224&id=_IYNAAAAIBAJ&sjid=4m8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=6761,247218 |title=Canonsburg mayor wants statue of Perry Como|date=24 December 1997|author=Niederberger, Mary|publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|accessdate=30 April 2010[/tpl] The planned statue had the blessing of Como's wife, Roselle, who died the year before it was unveiled on May 15, 1999. As part of the festivities, Como's stool and music stand from The Perry Como Show and the equipment he used at Steve Fragapane's barber shop were donated to the borough. Como was not present at the unveiling because of poor health. The inscription on the base, "To This Place God Has Brought Me", was a favorite saying of Como's; the musical feature was added in 2002.[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.archive.bibalex.org/web/20030816144805/broadwaytovegas.com/October 27, 2002.html |title=Perry Como Statue Sings Out for Tourists|date=20 October 2002|author=Deni, Laura|publisher=Broadway to Vegas|accessdate=30 April 2010[/tpl]
