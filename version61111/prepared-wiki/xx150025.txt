==Overview==

The album was a success and charted at number 5 in the UK Albums Chart in 1995. Eternal worked with new producers, giving them a slightly more R&B feel than their previous album Always & Forever. Power of a Woman received a positive reaction from critics, and the album was later re-released with a bonus disc featuring dance remixes.Kéllé Bryan's Official site Power of a Woman page.

Power of a Woman gave Eternal another 4 top 10 singles, "Power of a Woman", "I Am Blessed", and remixed versions of "Good Thing" and "Secrets". "It Will Never End" was planned to be the fifth release, but this was later cancelled due to Eternal releasing "Someday", which was the theme tune to Disney's 1996 film The Hunchback of Notre Dame.
