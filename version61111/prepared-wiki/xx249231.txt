==Description==

De Mearmin is what the Dutch describe as a "grondzeiler" . It is a two-storey smock mill on a single-storey base. There is no stage, the sail reaching almost to the ground. The smock and cap boarded. The mill is winded by tailpole and winch. The sails are Common sails. They have a span of [tpl]convert|15.10|m|ftin[/tpl]. The sails are carried on a cast-iron windshaft, which was cast by Koning of Foxham, Groningen in 1903. The windshaft also carries the brake wheel which has 50 cogs. This drives the wallower (29 cogs) at  the top of the upright shaft. At the bottom of the upright shaft, the crown wheel, which has 37 cogs drives a gearwheel with 34 cogs on the axle of the Archimedes' screw. The axle of the screw is [tpl]convert|470|mm|ftin[/tpl] diameter and the screw is [tpl]convert|1.17|m|ftin[/tpl] diameter and [tpl]convert|3.75|m|ftin[/tpl] long. The screw is inclined at 22½°. Each revolution of the screw lifts [tpl]convert|480|l|impgal[/tpl] of water.
