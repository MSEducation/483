[[Edalakudy tamil]]

CATEGORIES: Kanyakumari district

Edalakudy (Tamil: இடலாகுடி) is a well populated Muslim area about 3 km from the Nagercoil town in Kanyakumari district. It is located in the Kanyakumari highway (NH 47) and about 17 km from the beach of Kanyakumari, 5 km from Chothavilai Beach and 10 km from Chankuthurai Beach. Edalakudy forms the formal end of the Nagercoil Municipality. Muslims are the majority of this area. 
The Muslims of native edalakudy have a distinct form of tamil spoken among themselves. Though it is largely because of the mix of people from Tamil Nadu and Kerala, there are a lot of words of unknown origin found in the vocabulary. Some words here do not have anything in common with other Muslim settlements in Tamil Nadu. Here are a list of words in use today.
