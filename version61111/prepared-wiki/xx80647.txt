The Legislative Assembly of Quebec (French: Assemblée Législative du Québec) was the name of the lower house of Quebec's legislature until December 31, 1968, when it was renamed the National Assembly of Quebec.  At the same time, the upper house of the legislature, the Legislative Council, was abolished.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.revolutiontranquille.gouv.qc.ca/index.php?id=104&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=185 |title=L’Assemblée législative devient l’Assemblée nationale: 31 décembre 1968 |language=French |work=Révolution tranquille |publisher=Government of Quebec |accessdate=February 19, 2012[/tpl]  Both were initially created by the Constitutional Act of 1791.
It was the Union Nationale government of Premier Jean-Jacques Bertrand that passed the "Bill 90" legislation to abolish the upper house, although earlier unsuccessful attempts had been made by earlier governments.
The presiding officer of the Assembly was known in French as "''Orateur,''" a literal translation of the English term, "speaker".   When the Assembly was renamed so too was the title of its presiding officer, becoming known as the President.
Today Quebec has a unicameral legislature, whose single house is the National Assembly.
The large chamber housing the assembly is also known as le salon bleu (the blue hall) because of the predominance of this colour on the walls.  It used to be known as le salon vert (the green hall) until 1978, when the colour was changed to suit televising of parliamentary debates.
