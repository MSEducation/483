[[Blind carbon copy]]

CATEGORIES: Email

In the context of correspondence, blind carbon copy (abbreviated Bcc:) allows the sender of a message to conceal the person entered in the Bcc: field from the other recipients. This concept originally applied to paper correspondence and now also applies to email.Stout, Chris. "DEAR NERD: Blind carbons hide addresses." Charleston Gazette (West Virginia, USA). 1998-01-18. page P5B. NewsBank record number 100F35638A890441. BCC has also been redescribed after the demise of carbon paper, as "Blind Copy Circulated"; the meaning remains the same. 
In some circumstances, the typist creating a paper correspondence must ensure that multiple recipients of such a document do not see the names of other recipients. To achieve this the typist can: 
With email, recipients of a message are specified using addresses in any of these three fields:
It is common practice to use the Bcc: field when addressing a very long list of recipients, or a list of recipients that should not (necessarily) know each other, e.g. in mailing lists.Husted, Bill.

==Benefits of Blind Carbon Copy== 
There are a number of reasons for using this feature:

==Visibility==

In most implementations, the recipient of an email can see any email address specified by the Sender in the To: or Cc: fields.  If, on the other hand, the Sender has specified addresses in the Bcc: field, the recipient in this case cannot see these Bcc addresses.
The internet standard for e-mail messages is RFC 2822 and the Bcc: header is discussed in section 3.6.3.  It is unclear whether Bcc: is designed to ensure the Bcc: addresses are hidden from each other. On the one hand, it says:
It also states:
Which method to use with Bcc: fields is implementation dependent and may depend on both one's mail user agent (e.g. Windows Live Mail, Outlook, Thunderbird) and mail submission agent (usually provided by one's ISP).
Since the hiding of the Bcc: addresses from other Bcc: addresses is not required by RFC 2822, one cannot assume the Bcc: addresses will be hidden from other Bcc: addresses

==Security considerations==

Both RFC 2821 and RFC 2822 discuss problems with Bcc: in their "Security Consideration" sections, in part because, as mentioned above, the processing for the Bcc: header is not standardized and there are several ways that it can commonly be implemented.

==Carbon vs. courtesy==

The interpretation of "Bcc:" as "blind courtesy copy" is a backronym and not the original meaning; the historic RFC 733 has an explicit "blind carbon" annotation in its definition of the Bcc: header field syntax. "Cc:" and "Bcc:" mean "carbon copy" and "blind carbon copy" respectively.
Sending courtesy copies of mailing list replies also directly to the author(s) of answered message(s) is a common practice on some lists[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2009[/tpl], and matches a new interpretation of "Cc:" as abbreviation for "courtesy copy".
