Honolulu International Airport [tpl]Airport codes|HNL|PHNL|HNL[/tpl] is the principal aviation gateway of the City & County of Honolulu and the State of Hawaii and is identified as one of the busiest airports in the United States, with traffic now exceeding 21 million passengers a year and rising."The State of Hawaii Airport Activity Statistics By Year 2007-1994", Department of Transportation, Airports Division, State of Hawaii.
It is located in the Honolulu census-designated place three miles (5 km) northwest of Oahu's central business district.[tpl]FAA-airport|ID=HNL|use=PU|own=PU|site=52161.*A[/tpl], effective 2007-12-20"Honolulu CDP, HI." U.S. Census Bureau. Retrieved on May 21, 2009. Main roads leading to the airport are Nimitz Highway and the Queen Liliuokalani Freeway of Interstate H-1.
Honolulu International Airport serves as the principal hub of Hawaiian Airlines, the largest Hawaii-based airline.  Hawaiian offers flights between the various airports of the Hawaiian Islands and also serves the continental United States, Australia, New Zealand, American Samoa, Tahiti, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. It is host to major United States and international airlines, with direct flights to American, Asian, and Pacific Rim destinations. In addition to not only serving most major western cities, and many smaller ones especially in California, recent announcements have revealed new routes on the East Coast to both New York-JFK, and Washington-Dulles joining the already established routes to Atlanta-Hartsfield and Newark-Liberty.
It is also the base for Aloha Air Cargo, which previously offered both passenger and cargo services under the name Aloha Airlines. This airline ceased passenger flights on March 31, 2008 and sold off its cargo services to Seattle-based Saltchuk Resources, Inc (also owners of inter-island sea-based shipping company Young Brothers and Hawaiian Tug & Barge.)
In 2012, the airport handled 19,291,412 passengers, 278,145 aircraft movements and processed 412,270 metric tonnes of cargo.

==History==

HNL opened in March 1927 as John Rodgers Airport, named after World War I naval officer John Rodgers.[tpl]cite web |url=http://hawaii.gov/hawaiiaviation/publications/hnl-gateway-brochure/Airport-timeline-web.pdf |title=Honolulu International Airport...Celebrating 80 years |accessdate=12 January 2009 |year=2007 |format= PDF|work=Gateway to the Pacific: Honolulu International Airport 80th Anniversary |publisher=Hawaii Department of Transportation, Airports Division |quote=John Rodgers Airport was dedicated March 21, 1927. The field was named in honor of the late Commander John Rodgers, who had been Commanding Officer of the Naval Air Station at Pearl Harbor from 1923 and 1925...[/tpl] It was funded by the territorial legislature and the Chamber of Commerce, and was the first full airport in Hawaii: aircraft had previously been limited to small landing strips, fields or seaplane docks. From 1939 to 1943, the adjacent Keehi Lagoon was dredged for use by seaplanes, and the dredged soil was moved to HNL to provide more space for conventional airplanes. [tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2008[/tpl]
The U.S. military grounded all civil aircraft and took over all civil airports after the attack on Pearl Harbor, and Rodgers Field was designated Naval Air Station Honolulu.  The Navy built a control tower and terminal building, and some commercial traffic was allowed during daylight hours.  Rodgers Field was returned to the Territory of Hawaii in 1946.  At the time, at [tpl]convert|4019|acre|km2[/tpl], it was one of the largest airports in the United States, with four paved land runways and three seaplane runways.
John Rodgers Airport was renamed Honolulu Airport in 1947; "International" was added to the name in 1951. Being near the center of the Pacific Ocean it was a stop for many transpacific flights. By 1950 it was the third-busiest airport in the United States in terms of aircraft operations, and its [tpl]convert|13097|ft|m|adj=on[/tpl] runway was the longest in the world in 1953. In summer 1959 Qantas began the first jet service to Honolulu on its flights between Australia and California.[tpl]cite web |url=http://hawaii.gov/hnl/airport-information/hnl-1960-1969 |title=HNL 1960-1969 |accessdate=8 July 2009 |year=2007 |publisher=Hawaii Department of Transportation, Airports Division[/tpl] Aeronautical engineer and airline consultant, Frank Der Yuen, advised in the design of the original building and founded its aerospace museum.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rainengineering.com/acknowledgments.html |title=ACKNOWLEDGMENTS: A detailed review of participants in and their contributions to etheric rain engineering since 1968 | author=Trevor James Constable |accessdate=8 July 2009 |year=2008 |publisher=Etheric Rain Engineering Pte.

The original terminal building on the southeast side of runways 4 was replaced by the John Rodgers Terminal, which was dedicated on August 22, 1962 and opened on October 14, 1962. From 1970 through 1978, the architect Vladimir Ossipoff designed a terminal modernization project that remodeled this terminal and created several additions,[ref][tpl]Cite news |first=Benjamin |last=Genocchio |authorlink=Benjamin Genocchio |title=A Hawaiian Modernist, by Way of Russia |newspaper=New York Times |location=New York, NY |publisher=The New York Times Company |date=2008-09-26 |accessdate=2013-09-28 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/28/nyregion/connecticut/28artsct.html[/tpl]

===Modernization and history since 2006===

On March 24, 2006 Hawaii Governor Linda Lingle unveiled a $2.3 billion modernization program for Hawaii airports over a 12-year period, with $1.7 billion budgeted for Honolulu International Airport.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.hawaiiairportsmodernization.com/12/about-the-program | title=About the Program | publisher = Hawaii Airports Modernization Project | accessdate = 8 July 2009[/tpl] The plan involves implementing short-term projects within the first five years to improve passenger service and increase security and operational efficiencies.[tpl]cite news | title=$2.3B airports upgrade proposed | work=Honolulu Star-Bulletin | url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/2006/03/25/news/story05.html | first=B.J. | last=Reyes | date=2006-03-25 | accessdate=2008-10-01[/tpl]
As part of the modernization, flight display monitors throughout the airport have been upgraded, new food and beverage vendors have been added, and a new parking garage across from the International Arrivals terminal has been completed.  Current projects include an international arrivals corridor with moving sidewalks built atop the breezeway leading to the Ewa Concourse.  The first phase of the project was completed in October 2009, while the remainder of the two phase project was completed in 2010.[tpl]cite web | title=New International Arrivals Corridor Opens at Honolulu International Airport | publisher = Office of the Governor | url=http://hawaii.gov/gov/news/files/2009/october/hnl | accessdate = 2010-01-03[/tpl]
In 2011, Hawaiian Airlines renovated the check-in lobby of the Interisland Terminal, replacing the traditional check-in counters with six circular check-in islands in the middle of the lobbies, which can be used for inter-island, mainland, and international flights. This renovation project was fully funded by Hawaiian Airlines and not a part of the modernization program.Hawaiian airlines renovating inter-island terminal check-in lobby at Honolulu International Airport, Honolulu Star Advertiser retrieved 2011-03-31
Future projects include construction of a Mauka Concourse branching off the Interisland Terminal, the first concourse expansion at HNL in 15 years.  Construction of the concourse will involve replacing the existing Commuter Terminal.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.hawaiiairportsmodernization.com/3/what-were-doing-now | title=What We're Doing Now: Honolulu International Airport | publisher = Hawaii Airports Modernization Project | accessdate = 8 July 2009[/tpl]

==Facilities and aircraft==

The airport has four major runways, which it shares with the adjacent Hickam Air Force Base.  The principal runway designated 8R/26L, also known as the Reef Runway, was the world's first major runway constructed entirely offshore.  Completed in 1977, the Reef Runway was a designated alternate landing site for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration space shuttle program in association with Hickam Air Force Base, which shares Honolulu International Airport's airfield operations.[tpl]cite web | url=http://hawaii.gov/hawaiiaviation/chronology-of-aviation-in-hawaii/1980-1989 | title=Chronology of Aviation in Hawaii: 1980-1989 | work=Hawaii Aviation | publisher=State of Hawaii Department of Transportation[/tpl]

==Terminals==

Honolulu International Airport has three terminal buildings. A fleet of Chance RT-52 buses provide interterminal transportation between the ticket counters of all three terminals and between the concourses in the Interisland and Main terminals.  These buses, known as "Wiki Wiki" buses (from the Hawaiian word for "quick"), are the namesake for the WikiWikiWeb, the first wiki.
The largest airline at Honolulu airport is Hawaiian Airlines offering 13,365 seats per day, which represents a 45% market share.  The #2 and #3 carriers are United and Japan Airlines (JAL) with 7.7% and 7.4% market share respectively.
Traffic between Honolulu and the mainland United States is dominated by flights to and from Los Angeles and San Francisco. These two cities, plus Seattle, account for around half of all flights between the mainland and Honolulu. Hawaiian Airlines, with 10 routes, has the highest market share on routes between Honolulu and the mainland.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.anna.aero/2008/09/19/not-so-happy-hawaii-sees-capacity-drop-by-30-percent/| title=Not so Happy Hawaii* sees capacity drop by 30% after Aloha’s collapse| date=19 September 2008| publisher=anna.aero[/tpl]
Internationally Japan is the dominant market. Two-thirds of international seats are heading either for Nagoya, Osaka, Tokyo (Haneda and Narita airports) with services provided by JALways/Japan Airlines, Air Japan, China Airlines, Delta, Hawaiian, or United. Narita alone is served with 61 weekly departures with Japanese carriers operating twice as many flights as US carriers.
Other major international routes are to Seoul (25 weekly departures operated by Korean Airlines, Asiana Airlines and Hawaiian), Sydney (12 weekly departures operated by Hawaiian, Jetstar and Qantas) and Vancouver (19 weekly departures spread between Air Canada and Westjet).  In October 2009, China-based Hainan Airlines was granted approval for a nonstop flight from Honolulu to Beijing.[tpl]cite web |title=Hainan Air approved for Honolulu-Beijing service |accessdate=2013-01-25 |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/travel/flights/2009-10-12-hainan-air-honolulu_N.htm |first=Robbie |last=Dingeman |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6DvUri1oW |archivedate=2013-01-25 |date=2009-10-12 |work=USA Today |location=Tysons Corner, VA, USA |publisher=Gannett Company[/tpl] It would be the first mainland Chinese carrier to serve Hawaii and the airline's second US destination after Seattle.

===Commuter Terminal (Gates 62–80)===

The Commuter Terminal serves smaller airlines which operate flights between both the smaller and major commercial airports in the island chain.
Boarding and deplaning is conducted directly on the tarmac, using an auxiliary incline ramp to avoid the air-stairs.
Passengers who depart from the commuter terminal, and is bound to another island, and wishing to connect to a flight bound for the U.S. Mainland may not have baggage checked all the way to their final destination. The bags must be claimed at the next airport and be re-checked after completing pre-departure agriculture inspection formalities.

===Interisland Terminal (Gates 49–61)===

The Interisland Terminal mainly serves the interisland and some US mainland flights and departing international flights (gate 54) of Hawaiian Airlines; most of Hawaiian's U.S. Mainland and International departures leave from Gates 15–34. It is designed to handle flights of jet aircraft between the major commercial airports in the Hawaiian Islands. The former Aloha Airlines and Mokulele Airlines Alii Lounge has been converted to a second Hawaiian Airlines Premier Club Lounge near Gate 56.
On the ground level, Hawaiian Airlines uses Baggage Claim B for U.S. Mainland arrivals, and Baggage Claim C is used for interisland and U.S. Mainland arrivals. International arrivals on Hawaiian use the International Arrivals Baggage Claim located in the Main Terminal. Mokulele Airlines and Aloha Airlines formerly occupied Baggage Claim C.

===Main Overseas Terminal (Gates 6–34)===

The Main Overseas Terminal serves U.S domestic and international destinations. All boarding gates in the Main Overseas Terminal at Honolulu International are common use, shared among all airlines, and may change daily as the need arises. No gates are assigned to any specific airline. The Main Overseas Terminal is divided into three concourses:
Gates 26–34 in addition to serving U.S. domestic flights can serve  International flights and provide arrivals access directly into the International Arrivals Building to CBP screening via an enclosed secure corridor. Prior to this opening fully in early 2012 arriving international passengers had to board a Wiki Wiki bus to International arrivals.[tpl]citation | url=http://www.cdsintl.com/projects_airport3rd.php | title=Honolulu International Airport 3rd Level International Arrivals Corridor | work=CDS International | first= | last= | year=2012 | accessdate=2012-07-29[/tpl]
