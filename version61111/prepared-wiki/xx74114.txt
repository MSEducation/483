[[Northeast Kingdom]]

CATEGORIES: Vermont culture, Northeast Kingdom, Vermont

The Northeast Kingdom is the northeast corner of the U.S. state of Vermont, comprising Essex, Orleans and Caledonia counties and having a population at the 2010 census of 64,764. In Vermont, the written term "NEK" is often used. The term "Northeast Kingdom" is attributed to George D. Aiken, former Governor of Vermont and a U.S. senator, who first used the term in a 1949 speech. The area is often referred to by Vermonters simply as "The Kingdom".

==Geography==

The Northeast Kingdom is bisected by Interstate 91 and U.S. Route 5. It is bordered on the east by the Connecticut River and on the west by the Green Mountains. The highest point is Jay Peak, a summit on the main ridge of the Green Mountains, at [tpl]convert|3858|ft[/tpl].Various Vermont Mountains The highest point outside of the Green Mountains is East Mountain in the town of East Haven, with a summit elevation of [tpl]convert|3439|ft[/tpl].U.S. Geological Survey Seneca Mountain, Vermont 7½-minute quadrangle, 1988
The Kingdom encompasses 55 towns and gores, with a land area of [tpl]convert|2027|mi2[/tpl], about 21% of the state of Vermont.http://web.archive.org/web/20030923160428/http://www.nvda.net/transportation/pdf/rtp.pdf The city of Newport is the single incorporated city in the tri-county area.
As of 1997, 80% of the Northeast Kingdom was covered by forest.http://www.nvda.net/pdf/regionalplan/Volume%20II.pdf 59% was northern hardwood, 29% spruce or fir.
The Northeast Kingdom has been listed in the North American and international editions of "1,000 Places to See Before You Die", the New York Times best-selling book by Patricia Schultz. In 2006, the National Geographic Society named the Northeast Kingdom as the most desirable place to visit in the country and the ninth most desirable place to visit in the world.[tpl]cite web|title=The National Geographic Society Press Room|work=Northeast Kingdom Geotourism Mapguide Debuts at Vermont Travel Industry Conference |url=http://press.nationalgeographic.com/pressroom/index.jsp?pageID=pressReleases_detail&siteID=1&cid=1164733316076|accessdate=2006-12-22[/tpl]
The largest municipalities in the Northeast Kingdom are the towns of St. Johnsbury (population 7,603), Lyndon (5,981), and Derby (4,621), and the city of Newport (4,589).United States 2010 census. See American Factfinder.

===Geology===

The presence of kame terraces in the counties are of interest in connection with the glacial drift that gave the Northeast Kingdom its soil and its surface stones and boulders. These terraces have beds of sand and clay from which bricks were once manufactured.[tpl]cite book | author = Child, Hamilton. |title = Gazetteer of Lamoille and Orleans Counties, VT.; 1883-1884  | publisher = Hamilton Child | year = May 1887[/tpl]
Two land masses collided at the end of the Ordovician Period about 466 million years ago. This collision first formed what are now the Green Mountains which extend into the westernmost part of the Northeast Kingdom.[tpl]cite web| title=Shelburne Geology| work=Geologic history of the Champlain Valley| url=http://www.uvm.edu/shelburnelandscape/nature/geology.html| accessdate=2006-12-24[/tpl] It also created great pressure within the earth, resulting in active volcanoes. The resultant eruptions produced igneous rock which became the granite found in many of the region's mountains and in the Connecticut River Valley.[tpl]cite web| title=Digital Commons - Middlebury| work=Depth Constraints on the Origins of Northeast Kingdom Granites, Vermont| url=http://digitalcommons.middlebury.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1002&context=theses | accessdate=2006-12-28[/tpl]
The remaining geology was created during the Silurian-Devonian Period, about 400 million years ago, and left behind slate, with some granite, schist, and limestone.[tpl]cite web| title=About Geology| work=Generalized Geologic Map of Vermont| url=http://geology.about.com/gi/dynamic/offsite.htm?zi=1/XJ/Ya&sdn=geology&cdn=education&tm=14&gps=79_7_796_432&f=20&su=p284.21.140.ip_&tt=14&bt=0&bts=0&zu=http%3A//www.anr.state.vt.us/dec/geo/images/geo5.JPG| accessdate=2006-12-24[/tpl][tpl]cite web| title=Geological Society of American Conference| work=Ordovician Sedimentary Breccia and Magnetite-Coticule Metasiltstone, Northeast Kingdom, Vermont| url=http://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2001NE/finalprogram/abstract_2396.htm| accessdate=2006-12-24[/tpl]
An expansion of the polar glaciers resulted in an ice age which greatly affected the geology. A [tpl]convert|1|mi|m|adj=mid|-thick[/tpl] sheet of ice covered the Kingdom several times, over one million years, until 13,500 years ago.[tpl]cite web| title=The University of Vermont| work=A Brief History and Overview of Vermont's Physical Landscape| url=http://www.uvm.edu/place/analyze/history_vt.php| accessdate=2006-12-24[/tpl] It brought the many boulders seen in the area and created many prominent features, including Lake Memphremagog, Lake Willoughby, and Crystal Lake.[tpl]cite web|title=America's Volcanic Past|work=Crystal Lake|url=http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/LivingWith/VolcanicPast/Places/volcanic_past_vermont.html|accessdate=2006-12-24[/tpl]

This incursion stopped 11,000 years ago and became fresh water. Forests later appeared after the water receded.

===Fauna===

In 1996, the moose population totalled 2,000, about 1.75/mi² (0.676/km²). In 2005, the population was 5,000; 3.4/mi² (1.313/km²). State officials determined that the herd had become stressed due to overpopulation, and that the 1996 figure was more desirable. As a result, 1,260 hunting permits were issued in 2008 to cull the herd.[tpl]cite book | author = Rathke, Lisa |title = State hopes moose season culls herd | publisher = Burlington Free Press | date = October 17, 2008[/tpl] In 2009, state officials aimed for 1 moose per [tpl]convert|1|mi2[/tpl].[tpl]cite web |url= |title=Cow are giving birth to fewer offspring|author=Richard Creaser |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2009-10-28 |year= |month= |work= the chronicle |publisher=Chris and Ellen Braithwaite |pages=13 |archiveurl= |archivedate= [/tpl]

==History==

===Early human history===

The retreating glacier allowed the northern migration of early humans around 9300 BCE, descendants of Asian immigrants during the Ice Age. By 7300 BCE, people and a changing environment had eliminated large game from the area such as caribou and mastodons.[tpl]cite web| title=The Flow of History| work=Native Americans in Vermont| url=http://www.flowofhistory.org/themes/movement_settlement/abenaki.php| accessdate=2006-12-24[/tpl]
From 1000 BCE to 1600 CE, Abenakis inhabited the Kingdom.
Perhaps as many as a thousand Cowasuck Indians lived in Essex County near the Connecticut River in 1500. This tribe included all people from the Cahass, Cohassiac, Coos, Coosuc, and Koes tribes.[tpl]cite web| title=First Nations Histories| work=Abenaki History| url=http://www.tolatsga.org/aben.html| accessdate=2006-12-02[/tpl] The Cowasucks were Abenakis, members of the Wabanaki Confederacy, the Algonquian pact of five tribes which banded together to combat Iroquois aggression perhaps about 1500, though the exact date of the Iroquois pact is unknown.[tpl]cite web| title=Native Languages| work=Wabanki Confederacy| url=http://www.native-languages.org/wabanaki.htm| accessdate=2006-12-24[/tpl][tpl]cite web| title=Native Languages| work=Iroquois Confederacy| url=http://www.native-languages.org/iroquois.htm| accessdate=2006-12-24[/tpl]
European diseases, such as typhus, contracted from exposure to traders, killed many of the Cowasucks until only a few hundred were left in the Northeast Kingdom by 1600.[tpl]cite web| title=Manataka American Indian Council| work=Abenaki History Part I| url=http://www.manataka.org/page380.html| accessdate=2006-12-24[/tpl]

==Demographics==

In all three counties, estimated population dropped between 2010 and 2012 by about 200 people. State population declined slightly as well.[tpl]Cite news | first=Tena | last=Starr | title=NEK population drops slightly, census estimates | url=| work= | newspaper=The Chronicle | location=Barton, Vermont | pages= 10-11 | date=May 15, 2013 | id= | accessdate=[/tpl]

==Government==

As in the rest of New England, there is a strong state government. Town government often uses unpaid volunteers for its services. There is a superficial county government, all funded by the state. The three counties each have sheriffs, judges, prosecutors, and other officers, all, except for judges, elected by the county, but funded by the state.
Recognizing the need for services on an intermediate level, state legislation created the Regional Planning Commissions (RPC), to aid the towns in land use issues, and Economic Development Commissions (EDC), tasked with fostering economic development in their jurisdictions. These RPCs and EDCs report to the Vermont Agency of Commerce and Community Development. They must also report to their boards, which are made up of representatives of each town in the commission. As with some state agencies there is provision for these commissions to also organize as nonprofit groups, yet still maintain status as government agencies. This method of organization permits RPCs and EDCs to augment their state and federal funding with other sources of income. This arrangement also allows the EDCs to own properties such as industrial parks and Business Incubator Facilities.
RPCs and EDCs have no taxing or regulatory authority. However, RPCs do write a regional plan (as towns can have town plans). Town plans can not run contrary to the regional plans. RPCs also have automatic party status to any ACT 250 applications. ACT 250 permits are the state's Land Use Permit issued by the Land Use Panel of the Vermont Natural Resources Board. ACT 250 applications must be in compliance with the RPC's Regional Plan. A copy of all ACT 250 permit applications must be submitted (by the applicants) to the RPCs for review. 
The Northeast Kingdom is unique, as they have the only agency that is both the Economic Development Commission as well as the Regional Planning Commission, known as the Northeastern Vermont Development Association and Regional Planning Commission (NVDA). Under the legislators' study to lower state government spending, they have been looking to the Northeast Kingdom's RPC/EDC as a model for possible consolidation of agencies throughout the state.
Municipalities are governed by an elected Board of Selectmen and managed by an elected town or city clerk.

==Public health==

Various organizations are tasked with aiding public health including the Northeast Kingdom Human Services.

===Farming===

In 2010 the largest dairy farmer in the state was in Orleans County with 5,000 head and 2,500 milkers, spread over five farms.[tpl]Cite news | first=Candace | last=Page | title=Potent Alliance | url=| work= | publisher=Burlington Free Press | location=Burlington, Vermont | pages= 1A, 4A | date=20 June 2010  | accessdate=[/tpl]

==Transportation==

In 2008, 74% of the roads were rated in poor or very poor condition. There were 480 bridges with spans of [tpl]convert|20|ft[/tpl] or more. There were a number of bridges deemed structurally deficient. 63 percent of those were municipally owned.[tpl]cite book | author = Creaser, Richard |title = State transportation money is based on traffic | publisher = the Chronicle | date = October 22, 2008[/tpl]

===Railroads===

Two railroads traverse the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont: 

===Bus===

Rural Community Transportation runs out of Saint Johnsbury and serves Caledonia, Essex, Lamoille and Orleans counties.

===Airports===

There are three state airports: Caledonia County State Airport in Lyndonville; Newport State Airport in Newport/Coventry, and John H. Boylan State Airport in Island Pond. Light private and business aircraft land there.
