Syrian Democratic Turkmen Movement asserts that there are 3,5 million Turkmens in Syria. However, the party is against a divided Syria because Syrian Turkmens live scatteredly in different cities such as Aleppo, Homs, Latakia, Azaz, Jarablus, Raqqah, Idlib, Hama and Damascus, and a parted Syria would give serious damage to the Turkmens. Syrian Democratic Turkmen Movement is also associated with Ali Basher, who commands the Turkmen Brigades in the province of Aleppo such as Sultan Mehmet the Conqueror, Zahir Baybars Brigade, Martyr Ali Yılmaz Troop, Suleiman Shah Troop, Alparslan Troop, Yıldırım Beyazıt Brigade, and Sultan Abdul Hamid Troops.Syrian Turkmens: Political Movements and Military Structures, ORSAM-Middle Eastern Turkmen Programme, Report No: 22, Page: 11-16 (Check English version), March 2013, Ankara
