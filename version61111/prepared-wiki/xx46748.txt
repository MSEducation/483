[[Degrees of freedom]]

CATEGORIES: Statistical terminology, Concepts in physics, Dimension

In many scientific fields, the degrees of freedom of a system is the number of parameters of the system that may vary independently. For example, the position of a figure in the plane has three degrees of freedom: its orientation and the two coordinates of any fixed point of the figure. 
In mathematics, this notion is formalized as the dimension of a manifold or an algebraic variety. When degrees of freedom is used instead of dimension, this usually means that the manifold or variety that models the system is only implicitly defined.
