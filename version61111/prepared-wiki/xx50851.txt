The War Resisters League (WRL) was formed in 1923[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.warresisters.org/history |title=WRL History |publisher=Warresisters.org |date= |accessdate=2013-12-04[/tpl] by men and women who had opposed World War I. It is a section of the London-based War Resisters' International.
Many of the organization's founders had been jailed during World War I for refusing military service.  From the Fellowship of Reconciliation many Jews, suffragists, socialists, and anarchists separated to form this more secular organization.
Although the WRL was opposed to US participation in World War II, it did not protest against it; the WRL
complied with the Espionage Act, ceased public protests, and did not solicit new
members during this period.Bennett, p. 74. During World War II, many members were 
imprisoned as conscientious objectors.Bennett, p. 69ff In the 1950s, WRL members worked in the US civil rights movement and organized protests against nuclear weapons testing and civil defense drills.  In the 1960s, WRL was the first pacifist organization to call for an end to the Vietnam War.  The organization's opposition to nuclear weapons was extended to include nuclear power in the 1970s and 1980s. The WRL has also been active in feminist and anti-racist causes and works with other organizations to reduce the level of violence in modern culture.

==Current activities==

Presently, the War Resisters League is actively organizing against the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as the impact of war at home.[tpl]cite journal |last=Barry |first=Dan |title=A nation at war: at war at home; as wars come and go, Ralph keeps protesting |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE6D91F31F931A15750C0A9659C8B63&&scp=9&sq=%22War%20Resisters%20League%22&st=cse |journal=New York Times |year=2003 |issue=March 22 |accessdate=2008-07-16[/tpl] Much of its organizing is focused on challenging military recruiters and ending corporate profit from war. It publishes an annual peace calendar, the quarterly magazine WIN: Through Revolutionary Nonviolence, and other materials and is involved in a number of national peace and justice coalitions, including United for Peace and Justice and the National War Tax Resistance Coordinating Committee. Since 1958, WRL has awarded almost annually the War Resisters League Peace Award to a person or organization whose work represents the League's radical nonviolent program of action.
The War Resisters League annually publishes a pie chart showing how much of the U.S. federal budget actually covers current and past military expenses, listing the total as 54%:
These figures are at odds with official government figures:
