Master of the Mint was an important office in the governments of Scotland and England, and later Great Britain, between the 16th and 19th centuries.  The Master was the highest officer in the Royal Mint.  Until 1699, appointment was usually for life.  Its holder occasionally sat in the cabinet.  The office was abolished as an independent position in 1870, thereafter being held as a subsidiary office of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
During the interregnum (1643-1660) the last Master of the Mint to King Charles, Sir Robert Harley, transferred his allegiance to Parliament and remained in office. After his death in 1656 Aaron Guerdon was appointed.
