[[Central Baseball League]]

CATEGORIES: Baseball leagues in Texas, Defunct minor baseball leagues in the United States, Baseball leagues in Louisiana

 The Central Baseball League, formerly the Texas-Louisiana League, was a minor league whose member teams were independent of any Major League Baseball affiliations.
  In 1991, potential owners, Dallas businessman Byron Pierce and U. S. Congressman John Bryant, became frustrated that the Texas League had no plans to expand into other Texas locations, and formed The Texas-Louisiana League. The league began play in 1994. After further expansion into Missouri and Mississippi, the Texas-Louisiana League changed its name to the Central Baseball League. In 12 seasons, the league produced 10 different champions; Alexandria and Edinburg were the only teams to win a title twice.
  After the 2005 season, the eight-team Central Baseball League disbanded.  Five teams joined the American Association: Pensacola, Shreveport, Fort Worth, Coastal Bend and El Paso; and one joined the United League, San Angelo. Edinburg also received a franchise in the United League, unrelated to the now-defunct Roadrunners of the Central League.
