===Players===

The rosters for the All-Star Game were chosen in two ways. The starters were chosen via a fan ballot. Two guards, two forwards and one center who received the highest vote were named the All-Star starters. This was also the first time that the league offered All-Star ballots in three languages — English, Spanish and Chinese — for fan voting of the starters.[tpl]cite news |last=Vecsey |first=George |authorlink=George Vecsey |title=Fans in Shanghai Are Voting in the Mainstream |date=January 12, 2003 |newspaper=The New York Times |publisher=The New York Times Company |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/12/sports/basketball/12VECS.html |archiveurl=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/12/sports/basketball/12VECS.html |archivedate=August 2, 2011[/tpl] The reserves were chosen by votes among the NBA head coaches in their respective conferences. The coaches were not permitted to vote for their own players. The reserves consist of two guards, two forwards, one center and two players regardless of position. If a player is unable to participate due to injury, the commissioner will select a replacement.
Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers led the ballots with 1,474,386 votes, which earned him a starting position as a guard in the Western Conference team for the fifth year in a row. Yao Ming, of the Houston Rockets, was the second player with the most votes for the West, becoming the first rookie starter in the All-Star Game since Grant Hill in 1995.[tpl]cite news |title=Growing pains |date=February 9, 2011 |work=SI.com |publisher=AOL Time Warner |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/nba/2003/all_star/news/2003/02/09/yao_struggles_ap/ |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/60eP7kqBe |archivedate=August 2, 2011[/tpl] Yao was voted to start over Shaquille O'Neal, who was coming off three consecutive NBA Finals MVP Awards, receiving nearly a quarter million more votes than the Lakers center.[tpl]cite news |title=Sizing up Yao Ming's NBA career, impact |date=July 19, 2011 |publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures |url=http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/page/5-on-5-110719/yao-ming-retirement-questions |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/60Loyfozg |archivedate=July 21, 2011[/tpl] Steve Francis, Kevin Garnett, and Tim Duncan completed the Western Conference starting positions. Bryant, Garnett, Francis, and Duncan were all starters for the previous year's Western Conference team. The Western Conference reserves included one first-time selection, Shawn Marion, of the Phoenix Suns. The team is rounded out by Gary Payton, Steve Nash, Dirk Nowitzki, Peja Stojaković, Stephon Marbury, and Shaquille O'Neal. Four teams, Los Angeles Lakers, Dallas Mavericks, Houston Rockets, and Phoenix Suns, had two representations at the All-Star Game with Bryant/O'Neal, Nash/Nowitzki, Francis/Yao, and Marion/Marbury.
The Eastern Conference's leading vote-getter was Tracy McGrady, who earned his third consecutive All-Star Game selection with 1,316,297 votes. Allen Iverson, Vince Carter, Jermaine O'Neal, and Ben Wallace completed the Eastern Conference starting position. This was Wallace's first All-Star selection, as he led the league in rebounding. This was also the fourth consecutive All-Star appearance by Iverson and Carter, and O'Neal's second appearance as an All-Star. The Eastern Conference reserves included three first-time selections, Brad Miller, Jamal Mashburn, and Žydrūnas Ilgauskas. Michael Jordan, Jason Kidd, Paul Pierce, and Antoine Walker rounded out the team. However, Carter surrendered his starting spot to Michael Jordan, so he could start his final All-Star Game.[tpl]cite news |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Basketball/NBA/Toronto/2004/12/18/788808-sun.html |title=Vince's wild ride |last=Zeisberger |first=Mike |date=December 18, 2004 |accessdate=April 18, 2007[/tpl] Two teams, Indiana Pacers and Boston Celtics, had two representations at the All-Star Game with O'Neal/Miller, and Walker/Pierce.

===Game===

The Western All-Stars won the game 155–145 in double overtime. It seemed the East were on way to a victory when Michael Jordan hit a jump shot to give the East a 138–136 lead with 4.8 seconds remaining in overtime. However, Jermaine O'Neal fouled West player Kobe Bryant while shooting a three-point field goal with one second remaining. Bryant hit two of the three shots to tie the game, resulting in the first double-overtime in All-Star history. In the second overtime, Kevin Garnett hit three jumpers in the post over a smaller Vince Carter to lead the West to victory. Garnett won the MVP award after scoring a game-high 37 points. It was Jordan's final All-Star game. After declining Allen Iverson's and Tracy McGrady's offers to give him their starting spot, he accepted Vince Carter's last minute offer.[tpl]cite news|title=Garnett Out duels Jordan in All-Star Classic|date=February 9, 2003|work=NBA.com|url=http://www.NBA.com/games/20030209/WSTEST/recap.html|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6D2SgRvim|archivedate=December 19, 2012|deadurl=no[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/celtics/news/garnett_allstar_mvp_030209.html|title=KG Named NBA All-Star MVP|work=NBA.com|author=|date=February 9, 2003[/tpl]
