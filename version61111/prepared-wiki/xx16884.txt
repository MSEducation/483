==First Fairport stint==

He replaced Martin Lamble, who had died on 12 May 1969 in a road accident, on the M1 motorway. Mattacks left Fairport Convention in early 1972 to join The Albion Country Band. Meanwhile he had also contributed to numerous studio recordings such as the Morris On project, Nick Drake's Bryter Layter, Steve Ashley's "Stroll On" sessions, Steeleye Span's debut album Hark! The Village Wait and Harvey Andrews' album "Writer of Songs". He returned to Fairport Convention in order to help complete the 1973 album Rosie with a revamped line up of the band.

==Second Fairport stint==

Mattacks also played on Nine (1974), but left halfway through the making of the follow-up Rising for the Moon following an altercation with engineer Glyn Johns.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl] Some of Mattacks' most notable participations in studio recordings in the late 1970s are the work on art rock studio albums by Brian Eno (Before and After Science) and 801's Listen Now, as well as several Ashley Hutchings-related folk rock projects (The Compleat Dancing Master, Son of Morris On etc.). He also established himself as a touring drummer for Richard Thompson, playing on several of Thompson's studio albums, too.

==Third Fairport stint==

When Fairport Convention reformed in 1985 after a six-year absence, Mattacks was recruited as drummer. He had already been playing with them again at annual reunions at the fledgling Cropredy Festival. Mattacks would remain with Fairport until 1997.
In 1998 "DM", as he is known, moved to Marblehead, Massachusetts, United States, where he is a sought-after studio musician, record producer, and member of the band, Super Genius, although he still tours the UK, Europe and Australia regularly with various acts.
