Fakir Aziz ud-Din ([tpl]lang-pa|ਫ਼ਕੀਰ ਅਜ਼ੀਜ਼ੁਦ੍ਦੀਨ/فکرعزیزادیں[/tpl])  was physician, linguist, diplomat, and foreign minister at the court of Mahārājā Raṇjīt Siṅgh[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.learnpunjabi.org/eos/ |title=AZĪZ UD-DĪN, FAQĪR (1780-1845) |last1=Aijāzūddīn   |first1= F. S. |website=Encyclopaedia of Sikhism |publisher=Punjabi University Patiala |accessdate=13 April 2014[/tpl] He was a Muslim, one of many non-Sikhs, in Ranjit Singh's secular government of the Sikh Empire.
He was the eldest son of Hakīm Ghulām Mohy ud-Dīn and had two brothers, Nūr ud-Dīn and Imām ud-Dīn. Both had senior military posts in the empire. He was apprenticed as a physician, and was originally known by the title Hakīm (physician). Later in life he adopted the title Fakir (beggar), as a mark of humility, that title appearing in British correspondence after 1826.
His first contact with Ranjit Singh was as a physician. The Maharaja was impressed by his medical skill and proficiency in languages – Arabic, Persian and English – and granted him a jagir and a position at court. His first major assignment was to assist the Maharaja in the negotiations with the British which led to the Treaty of Amritsar, 1809. Between 1810 and 1838 there followed a great number of diplomatic assignments and tasks as an interpreter. The Maharaja had complete trust in him and rewarded him with honours and jagirs.
Aziz ud-Din continued in the service of the Sikh Empire after the death of Ranjit Singh.
In December 1839 he represented Maharaja Kharak Singh on a mission to the British Governor-General, Lord Auckland. In 1842, on behalf of Maharaja Sher Singh, he welcomed the new Governor-General, Lord Ellenborough, at Firozpur. He remained scrupulously aloof from the factional intrigues which had overtaken the Empire after Ranjit Singh`s death.
Saddened at the turn events had taken and by the death of two of his sons, he died in Lahore on 3 December 1845.
