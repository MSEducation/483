CATEGORIES: Cocteau Twins albums, 1993 albums, Fontana Records albums

Four-Calendar Café is the seventh and penultimate album by three-piece Scottish band Cocteau Twins.  It was originally released in 1993 on Fontana. The album distinguishes itself from the rest of the Twins' catalogue in two major areas: the sound is much more pop-oriented and less ambient than previous works, and Liz Fraser's lyrics are much more intelligible than usual.
The album takes its title from William Least Heat-Moon's book Blue Highways, in which the author considers the quality of a restaurant by how many calendars it has hanging on its wall.[tpl]cite web|title=History|url=http://www.cocteautwins.com/html/history/history16.html|publisher=Cocteau Twins|accessdate=12 June 2013[/tpl]  NME named the album the 46th best record of 1993.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nme.com/bestalbumsandtracksoftheyear/1993 |title=Albums and Tracks of the Year: 1993|publisher=NME |accessdate=3 January 2013[/tpl]
