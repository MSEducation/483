Bounce is the eighth studio album by American rock band Bon Jovi, released on October 8, 2002 through Island Records. Produced by Luke Ebbin, Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora, the album was recorded at Sanctuary II Studio in New Jersey.
Bounce was heavily influenced by the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, owing in part to Jon Bon Jovi's proximity to New York. The title "Bounce" was a reference to New York City's and the United States' ability to bounce back from the World Trade Center attacks as a nation. The cover image for the album includes a stylized image of a radio telescope dish at the Very Large Array.

Interview with Jon Bon Jovi & Richie Sambora in the context of the release of the album Bounce
The lead single, "Everyday" was written as a response to how the band felt about how to move on after September 11. "Undivided" speaks more specifically of the aftermath of September 11. The song "Open All Night" was written in response to how Jon Bon Jovi felt about the ending of the TV series Ally McBeal. He portrayed the boyfriend of star Calista Flockhart in the final series, and was upset that his character was written out in the way it was. The producers of the show allegedly asked Jon to stay on for a few extra episodes, so that his character, Victor, could marry Ally. Jon Bon Jovi refused on the grounds that his wife was heavily pregnant with their son, Jake, and so Victor had to be written out quicker than was hoped. Jon Bon Jovi wrote "Open All Night" as his way of expressing how he wished the character had ended. The title track, "Bounce", was dedicated to NFL Head Coach Bill Belichick of the New England Patriots and close friend of Bon Jovi. The song alludes to the various hardships Belichick experienced before finally winning a Super Bowl. Alternatively, many also felt the song spoke of the nation's rebound following September 11.
