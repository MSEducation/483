The museum also contains a fine garden, with no charge for entry. The nearest métro and RER stations are Port-Royal and Vavin.
The museum was established by Valentine Prax, Zadkine's wife, who willed their home and studio since 1928, plus his personal collection, to the City of Paris. The museum was inaugurated in 1982 following her death, and has subsequently augmented its collection by purchases. It now contains about 300 sculptures, as well as drawings, gouaches, photographs, and tapestries. Since 1995 the museum has also presented 3 to 4 exhibits of contemporary art each year.
The Museum has been renovated in 2012 to ensure its accessibility to all visitors, it re-opened its doors for its thirtieth anniversary on the 10th of October 2012, the new museography was designed to more closely reflect the spirit of the workshop.
