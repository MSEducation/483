The battle helped to distract Reshid Pasha's forces from engaging the armies of British general Thomas Gordon while they were completing their defensive fortifications on the hill of Munychia. Colonel Bourbaki was a distinguished cavalry officer in the French military and was accompanied by [tpl]formatnum:800[/tpl] rebel soldiers. Moreover, he was supported by commanders Vassos Mavrovouniotis and Panayotaki Notaras who each led [tpl]formatnum:1000[/tpl] Greek soldiers. During the course of the battle, Colonel Bourbaki led his forces to a plain and rushed into battle while simultaneously expecting his colleagues to support him. Unfortunately, they fled and abandoned Colonel Bourbaki. Even though the colonel fought bravely alongside his men, he was ultimately killed along with [tpl]formatnum:500[/tpl] Greek soldiers.
