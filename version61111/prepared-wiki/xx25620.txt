Holocaust denial is the act of and theory behind denying the genocide of Jews in the Holocaust during World War II.Donald L Niewyk, The Columbia Guide to the Holocaust, Columbia University Press, 2000, p. 45: "The Holocaust is commonly defined as the murder of more than 5,000,000 Jews by the Germans in World War II."[tpl]cite web|title=Holocaust denial - The IHR's Questions & Answers, and Nizkor's Responses|url=http://www.nizkor.org/features/qar/qar00.html|work=Nizkor Project|accessdate=28 September 2013[/tpl] The key claims of Holocaust denial are that the German Nazi government had no Final Solution policy or intention of exterminating Jews, Nazi authorities did not use extermination camps and gas chambers to mass murder Jews, and the actual number of Jews killed was significantly (typically an order of magnitude) lower than the historically accepted figure of 5 to 6 million."How many Jews were murdered in the Holocaust?

Holocaust deniers generally do not accept the term denial as an appropriate description of their activities, and use the term revisionism instead.[ref]Refer to themselves as revisionists:
[/ref] Scholars use the term "denial" to differentiate Holocaust deniers from historical revisionists, who use established historical methodologies.[ref]Denial vs. "revisionism":
[/ref] The methodologies of Holocaust deniers are criticized as based on a predetermined conclusion that ignores extensive historical evidence to the contrary.[ref]Predetermined conclusion:
Most Holocaust denial claims imply, or openly state, that the Holocaust is a hoax arising out of a deliberate Jewish conspiracy to advance the interest of Jews at the expense of other peoples.[ref]A hoax designed to advance the interests of Jews:
Another belief of deniers is the death of the millions Jews was caused by sickness and disease.[tpl]cite web|title=Holocaust Denial and Distortion|url=http://www.ushmm.org/confront-antisemitism/holocaust-denial-and-dostortion|accessdate=6 November 2013[/tpl]

==Terminology and etymology==

Holocaust deniers prefer to refer to their work as historical revisionism, and object to being referred to as "deniers". Scholars consider this misleading, since the methods of Holocaust denial differ from those of legitimate historical revision. Legitimate historical revisionism is explained in a resolution adopted by the Duke University History Department, November 8, 1991, and reprinted in Duke Chronicle, November 13, 1991 in response to an advertisement produced by Bradley R Smith's Committee for Open Debate on the Holocaust:
[tpl]quote|That historians are constantly engaged in historical revision is certainly correct; however, what historians do is very different from this advertisement. Historical revision of major events ... is not concerned with the actuality of these events; rather, it concerns their historical interpretation – their causes and consequences generally.[tpl]cite book|title=Denying the Holocaust: the growing assault on truth and memory|edition=reprint |author=Lipstadt, Deborah E. |year=1994 |publisher=Plume |url=http://www.google.ie/search?hl=en&q=Resolution%20adopted%20by%20the%20Duke%20University%20History%20Department%2C%20Nov.%208%2C%201991%2C%20and%20reprinted%20in%20Duke%20Chronicle%2C%20Nov.%2013%2C%201991.&gs_sm=e&gs_upl=14061l14061l0l1l1l0l0l0l0l0l0ll0&um=1&ie=UTF-8&tbo=u&tbm=bks&source=og&sa=N&tab=wp |isbn=978-0-452-27274-3[/tpl][/tpl]
In The Holocaust: Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation, Donald L. Niewyk gives some examples of how legitimate historical revisionism—the re-examination of accepted history and its updating with newly discovered, more accurate, or less-biased information—may be applied to the study of the Holocaust as new facts emerge to change the historical understanding of it:
In contrast, the Holocaust denial movement bases its approach on the predetermined idea that the Holocaust, as understood by mainstream historiography, did not occur. Sometimes referred to as "negationism", from the French term négationnisme introduced by Henry Rousso,See Alain Finkielkraut, Mary Byrd Kelly, Richard J. Golsan. The Future of a Negation: Reflections on the Question of Genocide. University of Nebraska Press, 1998. Holocaust deniers attempt to rewrite history by minimizing, denying or simply ignoring essential facts. Koenraad Elst writes:

==Attempts at concealment by perpetrators==

Historians have documented evidence that as Germany's defeat became imminent and the Nazi leaders realized they would most likely be captured and brought to trial, great effort was made to destroy all evidence of mass extermination. Heinrich Himmler instructed his camp commandants to destroy records, crematoria, and other signs of mass extermination.[ref]
