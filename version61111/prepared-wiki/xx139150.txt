==History==

Koshekhablsky District was established within Azov-Black Sea Krai on December 31, 1934[tpl]cite book|last=Азаренкова|first=А. С.|coauthors=И. Ю. Бондарь, Н. С. Вертышева|title=Основные административно-территориальные преобразования на Кубани (1793–1985 гг.)|origyear=1986|year=1986|publisher=Краснодарское книжное издательство|language=Russian|page=180[/tpl] as a result of the downsizing of the krai's districts. On December 7, 1956, the district was enlarged as portions of abolished Shovgenovsky District were merged into it.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2012[/tpl] However, as the enlargement policy did not prove effective, the district was restored in its previous borders on March 21, 1958.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2012[/tpl] On February 1, 1963, Koshekhablsky District was abolished and merged into newly created Shovgenovsky Rural District.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2012[/tpl] As the new system of rural districts turned out to be inefficient as well, Koshekhablsky District was re-instated in its pre-1963 borders on January 12, 1965.
