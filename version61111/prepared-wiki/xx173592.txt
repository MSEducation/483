Successfully withstanding significant time constraint, arrests and political threats, Seeman campaigned in 59 of the 63 places the Congress party were contesting, and the party were defeated in all of those constituencies except for one. Wherever he went he was watched by people in numbers ranging from 5000 to 25000 as compared to the rest of the political parties which only attract a few 100s in their meetings.
