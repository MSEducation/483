A Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia ([tpl]lang-fr|Mille plateaux[/tpl]) is a 1980 book by French philosopher Gilles Deleuze and psychoanalyst Félix Guattari. It is the second volume of Capitalism and Schizophrenia, and the successor to Anti-Oedipus (1972).

==Relationship to Anti-Oedipus==

The second volume of Capitalism and Schizophrenia, A Thousand Plateaus was translated into English by Brian Massumi, who observes that it differs drastically in tone, content, and composition from its predecessor Anti-Oedipus. He sees A Thousand Plateaus, written over a seven-year period, as "less a critique than a sustained, constructive experiment in schizophrenic, or 'nomad', thought."[tpl]cite book |author=Massumi, Brian |title=A User's Guide to Capitalism and Schizophrenia: Deviations from Deleuze and Guattari |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=1993 |pages=1–4 |isbn=0-262-63143-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=[/tpl] Before the full translation appeared in 1988, the twelfth "plateau" was published separately as Nomadology: The War Machine (New York: Semiotext(e), 1986).
Deleuze critic Eugene Holland suggests that A Thousand Plateaus complicates the slogans and oppositions developed in its predecessor. Where Anti-Oedipus created binaries such as molar/molecular, paranoid/schizophrenic, and deterritorialization/reterritorialization, A Thousand Plateaus shows how such distinctions are operations on the surface of a deeper field with more complicated and multidimensional dynamics. In doing so, it also moves away from human history toward topics such as biology and geology.Eugene W.

==Style==

A Thousand Plateaus is written in a non-linear fashion, and the reader is invited to move among plateaux in any order. These stylistic choices are entangled in the book's content, as made apparent in the introductory section on "rhizomes".

==Influence==

A Thousand Plateaus served as a 'model' for Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri's book Empire.Hardt and Negri (2000). Janet Murray links the book to the aesthetic of hypertext.Janet Murray, Hamlet on the Holodeck, page 132) Bill Readings, in his book The University in Ruins, appropriates the term "singularity" from A Thousand Plateaus, "to indicate that there is no longer a subject-position available to function as the site of the conscious synthesis of sense-impressions."Page 115 John Urry treats them as one of the major metaphors of mobility that he deals with in his book Sociology Beyond Societies: Mobilities for the Twenty First Century.Page 27 Nikolas Rose claims that the book articulates "the most radical alternative to the conventional image of subjectivity as coherent, enduring, and individualized".Rose, Nikolas. Inventing our Selves: Psychology, Power, and Personhood. Page 170 Espen Aarseth equates their idea of the rhizome from this book with Umberto Eco's idea of the net.Aarseth, Espen. Cybertext: Perspectives on Ergodic Literature Page 6 Mark Poster proclaims that the book "contains promising elaborations of a postmodern theory of the social and political."Poster, Mark.

==Criticism==

Physicists Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont allege that A Thousand Plateaus contains many passages that use pseudo-scientific language.[tpl]cite book |author1=Sokal, Alan |author2=Bricmont, Jean |title=Fashionable Nonsense: Postmodern Intellectuals' Abuse of Science |publisher=Picador |location=New York |year=1999 |page=168 |isbn=0-312-20407-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=[/tpl]: "Should the reader entertain any further doubts about the ubiquity of pseudo-scientific language in Deleuze and Guattari's work, he or she is invited to consult, in addition to the references given in the footnotes, pages 20-24, 32, 36-42, 50, 117-133, 135-142, 151-162, 197, 202-207, and 214-217 of What Is Philosophy?, and pages 32-33, 142-143, 211-212, 251-252, 293-295, 361-365, 369-374, 389-390, 461, 469-473, and 482-490 of A Thousand Plateaus."
