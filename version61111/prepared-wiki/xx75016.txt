The name AltaVista was chosen in relation to the surroundings of their company at Palo Alto. AltaVista was publicly launched as an internet search engine on December 15, 1995 at <nowiki>altavista.digital.com</nowiki>.<ref>

At launch, the service had two innovations that put it ahead of other search engines available at the time: it used a fast, multi-threaded crawler (Scooter) that could cover many more webpages than were believed to exist at the time,  and it had an efficient search-running back-end on advanced hardware. 
  
  Thank you for your comments.  As we are starting up the Beta phase of
the  Alta Vista project, we are trying to respond individually to
some of the  messages we have received.
We are putting the following hardware information on the site. 
Alta Vista is a very large project, requiring the cooperation of at
least 5  servers, configured for searching huge indices and handling
a huge  Internet traffic load.  The initial hardware configuration
for Alta Vista is as  follows:
Alta Vista  -- AlphaStation 250 4/266 
             4 GB disk 
            196 MB memory 
            Primary web server for gotcha.com 
            Queries directed to WebIndexer or NewsIndexer 
NewsServer  -- AlphaStation 400 4/233 
            24 GB of RAID disks 
            160 MB memory 
            News spool from which news index is generated 
            Serves articles (via http) to those without news server 
NewsIndexer -- AlphaStation 250 4/266 
            13 GB disk 
            196 MB memory 
            Builds news index using articles from NewsServer 
            Answers news index queries from Alta Vista 
Spider -- DEC 3000 Model  900 (replacement for Model 500) 
            30 GB of RAID disk 
            1GB memory 
            Collects pages from the web for WebIndexer 
WebIndexer --  Alpha Server 8400 5/300 
            210 GB RAID disk (expandable) 
            4 GB memory (expandable) 
            4 processors (expandable) 
            Builds the web index using pages sent by Spider. 
            Answers web index queries from Alta Vista

As of 1998, it used 20 multi-processor machines using DEC's 64-bit Alpha processor. Together, the back-end machines had 130 GB of RAM and 500 GB of hard disk space, and received 13 million queries every day.Ricardo Baeza-Yates and Berthier Ribeiro-Neto (1999). Modern Information Retrieval. Addison-Wesley/ACM Press, pp. 374, 390. This made AltaVista the first searchable, full-text database of a large part of the World Wide Web.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl] Another distinguishing feature of AltaVista was its minimalistic interface, lost when it became a portal, but regained when it refocused its efforts on its search function.  It also allowed the user to limit search results from a domain, reducing the likelihood of multiple results from the same source.
AltaVista's site was an immediate success.  Traffic increased steadily from 300,000 hits on the first day to more than 80 million hits per day two years later.  The ability to search the web, and AltaVista's service in particular, became the subject of numerous articles and even some books.  AltaVista itself became one of the top destinations on the web, and in 1997 it earned US$50 million in sponsorship revenue.
By using the data collected by the crawler, employees from AltaVista, together with others from IBM and Compaq, were the first to analyze the strength of connections within the budding World Wide Web in a seminal study in 2000.Broder et al., "Graph structure in the web", 9th International WWW Conference (Amsterdam, May 2000) - http://www9.org/w9cdrom/160/160.html

==Business transactions==

In 1996, AltaVista became the exclusive provider of search results for Yahoo!.  In 1998, Digital was sold to Compaq and in 1999, Compaq redesigned AltaVista as a web portal, hoping to compete with Yahoo!.  Under CEO Rod Schrock, AltaVista abandoned its streamlined search page, and focused on added features such as shopping and free email.[ref]
