Rebelles Européens was one of the most prominent white power rock record labels in the 1980s, along with German Rock-O-Rama Records.  The label was formed in Brest, France by PNFE activist Bodilis Gael in 1987. Before Gael formed the label, he was a manager of French Rock Against Communism band Brutal Combat. Unlike Rock-O-Rama Records, Rebelles Européens releases were almost exclusively of white power/Rock Against Communism bands, whereas Rock-O-Rama also had hardcore, left-wing and apolitical punk bands in their releases. Rebelles Europeéns releases were also never censored, and the label was the first to release openly National Socialist rock music, including No Remorse's first album This Time The World (1988). The label's record covers were usually very provocative, including Swastikas and other racist themes.
From 1987 through 1994, the label released 45 12" records, 30 7" records and five CDs .
