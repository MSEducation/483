The legions I, II, and III Parthica were levied by Septimius Severus for his campaign against Parthian Empire. After the success this campaign, I and III Parthica remained in the region, in the camp of Singara (Sinjar, Iraq), in Mesopotamia, to avoid following rebellions and attacks from the Parthian Empire.
Legionaries from I Parthica were usually sent to other provinces, namely Lycia, Cilicia and Cyrenaica.
In 360, I Parthica unsuccessfully defended its camp against a Sassanid attack; after the defeat, the legion was moved to Nisibis (modern Turkey), where it remained until the city was surrendered to the Sassanid Persians in 363. After that, the legion was moved to Constantina, where it is last mentioned in the 5th century.
