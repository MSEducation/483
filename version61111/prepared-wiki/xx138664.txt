[[5th West Virginia Volunteer Infantry Regiment]]

CATEGORIES: West Virginia Civil War regiments

In the Second Battle of Bull Run (Manassas) this unit is listed by the Manassas Battlefield Park as an independent unit.  They were sent by Gen. Milroy during the battle to link up with an Ohio infantry troop to try to provide support for other units attempting to hold Gen. Stonewall Jackson's line at the unfinished railroad tracks just down from Henry Hill.  The units got lost and ended up right in the middle of Jackson's line.  After a short skirmish, the 5th WV infantry pulled back to re-group.  Eventually they were directed to try to support the Union troops trying to hold Henry Hill, with Gen. Milroy waving his saber in a desperate attempt to stop the tide of soldiers escaping the tremendous onslaught reigning down on them from the Confederates.
