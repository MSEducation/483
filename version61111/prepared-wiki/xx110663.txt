==History==

===Creation===

The idea of the tennis center came about in January, 1977, when W. E. "Slew" Hester (the then-incoming president of the USTA) saw the underused Singer Bowl / Louis Armstrong Stadium on a flight into New York's LaGuardia Airport. He asked New York City to let him use Louis Armstrong Stadium and adjoining land for a tennis facility to host the U.S. Open. The center opened in August, 1978.

===Expansion===

After rumors of a possible move to San Diego, a major upgrade and expansion began in March 1995. More land was committed to the USTA National Tennis Center, and in August 1997 the newly built Arthur Ashe Stadium replaced Louis Armstrong Stadium as the main court. The four-year expansion was completed in 1999. Arthur Ashe Stadium holds more than 22,000 spectators while Louis Armstrong Stadium was downsized to hold just 10,000 spectators (the original size was 18,000).
In 2006—at the location of the old indoor-tennis building near the East Gate—work began on a 245,000-square-foot, multi-purpose tennis pavilion. The new facility was completed in 2008 and includes 12 courts, classrooms, fitness facilities, and a pro shop. It also includes a hospitality center, museum, and food commissary. Other renovations included the players’ lounge, locker rooms, and medical, training and office space.
In 2011, the facility opened a new show court, Court 17, located in the southeast corner of the grounds, seating 2,500 3,000, making it intimate in comparison to the facility's other show courts. Next in size after those courts — Arthur Ashe Stadium, Louis Armstrong Stadium, and the Grandstand (capacity: 6,106) — the court has large television screens and Hawk-Eye electronic line-calling capability which allows for player challenges.  In constructing the new court, foundations from the 1939 New York World's Fair and 1964 World's Fair were discovered, and the water table was found to be several feet higher than expected.[tpl]cite web|first=Douglas|last=Robson|title=New show court draws a crowd, quietly|date=August 29, 2011|publisher=USA TODAY|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/tennis/story/2011-08-29/New-show-court-draws-a-crowd-quietly/50181576/1|accessdate=2011-09-04[/tpl] Because the playing surface of Court 17 is below ground level, the new court has received the nickname of "The Pit".
The center is currently in the beginning stages of a $550 million renovation that will see a retractable roof constructed on Arthur Ashe Stadium and a new, 15,000-seat Louis Armstrong Stadium (also with a retractable roof) built.[tpl]cite news |title=U.S.T.A. to Put a Roof Over Arthur Ashe Stadium |first=Naila-Jean |last=Meyers |first2=Lynn |last2=Zinser |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/15/sports/tennis/usta-to-put-a-roof-over-arthur-ashe-stadium.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=2013-08-14 |accessdate=2013-09-05[/tpl]

===Basketball on a Tennis Court===

In July 2008, the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center and Arthur Ashe Stadium hosted its first ever non-tennis event, when the New York Liberty of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) played in the "Liberty Outdoor Classic: 2008". The game itself was a historic event as it was the first ever professional basketball regular season game ever played outdoors in the USA, by either men or women. The contest featured the Indiana Fever defeating the New York Liberty.[tpl]cite news | last = Robbins | first = Liz | title = Liberty Has Its Moment in History, if Not a Victory | work = New York Times | date = 2008-07-20 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/20/sports/basketball/20liberty.html | accessdate = 2011-02-15[/tpl]
