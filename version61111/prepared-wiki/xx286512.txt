==History==

Kinetic Corporation was founded by Ray Schuhmann in 1968 as a commercial photography studio. Kinetic quickly evolved into a full-service photography and graphics business.
During the 70’s, Kinetic was nationally known for advertising photography, supported by an on-site full-service photo lab. Company founder Ray Schuhmann has been the official photographer and archivist of the Kentucky Derby for the last 50 years.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.bizjournals.com/louisville/print-edition/2012/04/13/kinetic-corps-ray-schuhmann-has.html?page=all|title=Kinetic Corp.’s Ray Schuhmann has guided his business from offering photo services to high-tech solutions| publisher= bizjournals.com |accessdate= 2013-07-30 [/tpl][tpl]cite web|url= http://www.derbyarchive.com/|  title=The Official Kentucky Derby Photo Archive| publisher= derbyarchive.com |accessdate= 2013-07-31 [/tpl]
By the 1990s, Kinetic was developing custom applications for a newly emerging platform: the Internet.
In 2000, Kinetic began its focused transition from photography based services to software and technology based services. Kinetic now derives the majority of its revenue from technology licensing, support and digital services.
In 2011, Kinetic quadrupled its staff to meet the needs of the growing demand for its software solutions.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.prweb.com/releases/translations/theTechnologyAgency/prweb9145979.htm |title=Kinetic theTechnologyAgency Quadruples Staff to Meet Global Communications Demand | publisher= prweb.com |accessdate= 2013-08-08 [/tpl]
