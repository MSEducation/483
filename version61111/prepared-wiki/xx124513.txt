==Music==

"American Girl" uses standard rock instrumentation of electric guitars (Petty and Campbell), electric bass (Blair), drums (Lynch), and keyboards (Tench). The tempo is fast and "urgent",Tom Petty and Tom Frank: Two Geniuses of Pop Culture | The New York Observer and is built on a repeated jangling guitar riff based on a "Bo Diddley beat".Rock pioneer Bo Diddley dies | Gainesville.com
As described in Rolling Stone, "The supercharged riff set the template for decades of Petty hits, but it was also a homage to the Byrds: Petty and Mike Campbell's twin guitars mirrored Roger McGuinn's 12-string, infusing the folk-rock sounds of the 1960s with New Wave energy."

===Lyrics and rumors===

Due to lyrics mentioning cars rolling by "out on 441" and a desperate girl on a balcony, the song was rumored to have been written about a girl who committed suicide by jumping from the Beaty Towers residence hall at the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where Tom Petty grew up. (U.S Route 441 runs along the university campus right beside Beaty Towers.)
Carl Van Ness, the University of Florida's official historian, says that a student may have committed suicide by jumping from one of the Beaty Towers between 1967, when the facility opened, and the early 1970s, when Tom Petty left Gainesville for California.Wilmath, Kim.

When asked directly about the story in the book Conversations With Tom Petty, Petty responded:  Urban legend.  It's become a huge urban myth down in Florida.  That's just not at all true.  The song has nothing to do with that.  But that story really gets around... They've really got the whole story. I've even seen magazine articles about that story. 'Is it true or isn't it true?' They could have just called me and found out it wasn't true.snopes.com: 'American Girl' Suicide 
In the same interview, Petty says that he wrote the song while living in California:  
 I don't remember exactly. I was living in an apartment where I was right by the freeway. And the cars would go by. In Encino, near  Leon Russell's house. And I remember thinking that that sounded like the ocean to me. That was my ocean. My Malibu. Where I heard the waves crash, but it was just the cars going by. I think that must have inspired the lyric.
The lyric "raised on promises" appears to have come from a line of dialogue in Francis Ford Coppola's 1963 film, "Dementia 13."  Referring to another woman, the character Louise states, "Especially an American Girl.  You can tell she was raised on promises."
