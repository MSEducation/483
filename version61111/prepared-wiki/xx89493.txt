Cheadle Hulme [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|iː|d|əl|_|ˈ|h|juː|m[/tpl] is a town of the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport, in Greater Manchester, England.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gmcro.co.uk/Guides/Gazeteer/gazzc.htm|title=Greater Manchester Gazetteer |publisher=Greater Manchester County Record Office |accessdate=10 February 2009|at=Places names – C|archivedate=18 July 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110718144448/http://www.gmcro.co.uk/Guides/Gazeteer/gazzc.htm[/tpl] Historically in Cheshire, it is [tpl]convert|2.3|mi|km|1[/tpl] southwest of Stockport and [tpl]convert|7.5|mi|km|1[/tpl] southeast of the city of Manchester. It lies in the Ladybrook Valley on the Cheshire Plain, and the drift consists mostly of boulder clay, sands and gravels. As of the 2001 census, it had a population of 29,000.
Evidence of Bronze Age, Roman, and Anglo-Saxon activity, including coins, jewellery and axes, has been discovered locally. The area was first mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 when it was a large estate which included neighbouring Cheadle. In the early 14th century it was split into southern and northern parts at about the future locations of Cheadle Hulme and Cheadle, respectively. The area was acquired by the Moseley family in the 17th century and became known as Cheadle Moseley. Unlike many English villages it did not grow around a church; instead it formed from several hamlets, many of which retain their names as neighbourhoods within Cheadle Hulme. In the late 19th century Cheadle Hulme was united with Cheadle, Gatley and other neighbouring places to form the urban district of Cheadle and Gatley. This district was abolished in 1974 and Cheadle Hulme became a distinct place in its own right, as part of the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport.
Cheadle Hulme remains an affluent part of the Metropolitan Borough, with its own schools, open parkland, historical landmarks such as Bramall Hall, shopping areas, and local businesses. These are sustained by its railway station, and its close proximity to Manchester Airport and major roads such as the A34.

==History==

===Early history===

The Domesday Book provides the earliest mention of the area, where it is recorded as "Cedde", Celtic for "wood". Local archaeological finds include Bronze Age axes discovered in Cheadle. Evidence of Roman occupation includes coins and jewellery, which were discovered in 1972.Clarke, p.1 The modern-day Cheadle Road was originally known as Street Lane, and may be of Roman origin. A stone cross dedicated to the Anglo-Saxon St Chad, discovered in 1873, indicates Anglo-Saxon activity. The cross was found in an area called "Chad Hill", on the banks of the Micker Brook near its confluence with the River Mersey; this area became "Chedle".Clarke, p.3 Suggestions for the origin of the name include the words cedde, and leigh or leah, in Old English meaning "clearing", forming the modern day "Cheadle".[tpl]cite web |last=Mills |first=A.

According to the Domesday Book in 1086, the modern-day Cheadle and Cheadle Hulme were a single large estate. Valued at £20,Lee, p.3 it was described as "large and important" and "a wood three leagues 9 miles long and half as broad". One of the earliest owners of the property was the Earl of Chester. It was held by a Gamel, a free Saxon, under Hugh d'Avranches, 1st Earl of Chester, and later became the property of the de Chedle family, who took their name from the land they owned.Bowden, p.5 By June 1294 Geoffrey de Chedle was Lord of the Manor. Geoffrey's descendant Robert (or Roger) died in the early 1320s, leaving the estate to his wife Matilda who held it until her death in 1326.Squire, p.1 As there were no male heirs the manor, which was now worth £30 per annum,Squire, p.2 was divided between her daughters, Clemence and Agnes.Arrowsmith, p.36 Clemence inherited the southern half (which would later become the modern-day Cheadle Hulme), and Agnes inherited the northern half, (latterly Cheadle). The two areas became known as "Chedle Holme" and "Chedle Bulkeley" respectively.Clarke, p.4 Shortly afterwards the Chedle Holme estate was divided and the part where Hulme Hall is now situated became known as "Holme", and held by the Vernons. The estates were reunified on the death of the last of the Vernons in 1476.
The only daughter of Clemence and William de Bagulegh, Isabel de Bagulegh, succeeded her parents as owner of the manor, and married Sir Thomas Danyers. Danyers was rewarded for his efforts in the crusades through an annual payment from the King of 40 marks, as well as the gift of Lyme Hall. His daughter Margaret continued to receive payments after his death.
The first John Savage succeeded Margaret, and nine more followed him.Clarke, p.5 The tenth died young, so the estate passed to his brother, Thomas Savage. In 1626 Charles I created the title of Viscount Savage for him.Clarke, p.7 On his death the estate passed to his daughter Joan, who later married John Paulet, 5th Marquess of Winchester. Joan died during childbirth at the age of 23, and the estate passed to the Marquess. The Marquess practised Catholicism, and in 1643 the estate was confiscated due to persecution of Catholics in the English Civil War.
Following this, the estate was acquired by the Moseley family of Manchester and became known as Cheadle Moseley. Anne Moseley was the last of this family to hold the manor, as her husband could not afford to keep it following her death. It was purchased by John Davenport, who bequeathed it to the Bamford family when he died childless in 1760. After the last Bamford died without male issue in 1806, the estate passed to Robert Hesketh who took the name Bamford-Hesketh; it is from this family that the Hesketh Tavern public house in Cheadle Hulme got its name. The last person to hold the manor was Winifred, Countess of Dundonald, one of Bamford-Hesketh's descendants.

===Modern history===

In 1801 the population was 971 and had risen to 2,319 by 1851.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ukbmd.org.uk/genuki/chs/cheadlemoseley.html |title=Cheshire Parishes: Cheadle Moseley |publisher=GENUKI |accessdate=5 February 2009[/tpl] In 1868 the area became a parish,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ukbmd.org.uk/genuki/chs/cheadle.html |title=Cheshire Parishes: Cheadle |publisher=GENUKI |accessdate=5 February 2009[/tpl] but it was merged with Cheadle Bulkeley in 1879 and became part of the Cheadle and Gatley district in 1894.Clarke, p.19 The name "Cheadle Moseley" continued to be used for the area, and appeared on tithes and deeds until the 20th century. In 1974, the Cheadle and Gatley district was abolished and Cheadle Hulme became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport.
During the Second World War, Cheadle Hulme was a refuge for evacuees from places such as Manchester and the Channel Islands. The area had its own Home Guard, as well as several air-raid shelters. Cheadle Hulme was also home to large parts of RAF Handforth. This was a maintenance unit, classed as a 'Universal stores' depot and had the official Royal Air Force name, "RAF Handforth No 61 M.U. (Maintenance unit)". The depot opened in 1939 and closed in 1958–59 and covered large areas of land in both Cheadle Hulme and neighbouring Handforth.
The depot stored and dispatched every conceivable item that the RAF would use in wartime. Everything from knives and forks to aircraft engines were stored and dispatched from RAF Handforth. The site was served by a large, internal railway system which left the Manchester to Crewe mainline prior to Handforth railway station. The site of the  exchange sidings and junction is at the rear of the 'Pets at home' offices on Epsom Avenue. The depot had its own shunting locomotives, which were stored in an engine shed that stood at the Wilmslow bound exit slip road for the Handforth Dean shopping centre.
The only surviving buildings of RAF Handforth are the government pay offices adjacent to the 'Total Fitness' gym on Dairyhouse Lane. These buildings were the Headquarters of the depot and have survived in military/MoD use to this day. The depot had satellite sites within Cheadle Hulme, these being Site Number 5, general storage (beneath the Eden Park road housing development which, until the housing development began still maintained the internal road layout and building foundations) and site number 6 (motor transport storage area) which is now covered by part of the Hursthead housing estate. Three large (150 ft × 250 ft) steel built, vehicle storage sheds stood at the junction of Malmesbury Road and Lyncombe Close/Tintern Road. The last of these sheds survived well into the 1980s and was latterly used by the local council as a rubbish dump. This stood between Tollard Close and Tintern Road. The houses on May Avenue were built by the RAF as married quarters and exist to this day.
As well as the above sites, several 'domestic sites' existed within Cheadle Hulme. These provided sleeping, eating and washing facilities for the Airmen and women stationed at RAF Handforth. Grove Lane park was the site of an Officer's mess, Cinema, NAAFI, Post Office, chapel and bath house among other buildings. 'The Grove' near to the junction of Grove Lane and Pingate Lane, was Nissen hut accommodation, as were the flats on Gillbent Road opposite the shops and the large field at the junction of Longsight Lane and Stanley Road. The remains of the air raid shelters can still be seen at this location to this day. The wooded area to the rear of numbers 48–64 Hall Moss Lane also housed an officers' mess, NAAFI, post office, chapel and bath house.
RAF Handforth was a large and important storage facility, that contributed directly to the war effort. The site stretched from the centre of Handforth village, through Cheadle Hulme and onwards to Woodford. The industrial estate, 'Adlington Park' (which is actually in Woodford/Poynton), was a dispersed site of RAF Handforth. Cheadle Hulme itself escaped being badly damaged, but its villagers knew the extent of the war, mainly due to the large and visible presence of the RAF and could hear the sounds of air-raids on Manchester.
Cheadle Hulme did not grow around a church like many English villages, but instead grew from several hamlets that existed in the area. Many of the names of these hamlets still appear in the names of areas, including Smithy Green, Lane End, Gill Bent, and Grove Lane. Some of the many farms such as Orish Mere Farm and Hursthead Farm which covered the area also retain their names in schools that were built in their place.Squire, p. 4–5

==Governance==

Lying within the historic county boundaries of Cheshire, Cheadle Hulme was historically a township known as "Cheadle Moseley" in the  ecclesiastical parish of Cheadle and Hundred of Stockport. Following the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, part of Cheadle Moseley was amalgamated into the Municipal Borough of Stockport. In 1879, the remaining part was merged with neighbouring Cheadle Bulkeley to form the township of Cheadle.
Established in 1886, Cheadle Hulme's first local authority was the Cheadle and Gatley local board of health, a regulatory body responsible for standards of hygiene and sanitation for the area of Stockport Etchells township and the part of Cheadle township outside the Municipal Borough of Stockport. The board of health was also part of Stockport poor law union. In 1888 the board was divided into four wards: Adswood, Cheadle, Cheadle Hulme and Gatley.Bowden, p.25 Under the Local Government Act 1894 the area of the local board became Cheadle and Gatley Urban District. There were exchanges of land with the neighbouring urban districts of Wilmslow and Handforth in 1901, and the wards were restructured again, splitting Cheadle Hulme into north and south, and merging in Adswood. Due to the fast-paced growth of the district, the wards were again restructured in 1930, with the addition of Heald Green. In 1940 the current wards of Adswood, Cheadle East, Cheadle West, Cheadle Hulme North, Cheadle Hulme South, Gatley and Heald Green were established.Bowden, p.27 Under the Local Government Act 1972 the Cheadle and Gatley Urban District was abolished, and Cheadle Hulme has, since 1 April 1974, formed an unparished area of the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport within the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester.
Since 1950 Cheadle Hulme has been part of the Cheadle parliamentary constituency,Craig, p.53 and has been represented by Liberal Democrat member Mark Hunter since 2005.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4681533.stm |title=Lib Dems win Cheadle by-election |date=15 July 2005 |work=BBC News |accessdate=18 March 2009[/tpl] Six councillors, three representing Cheadle Hulme South ward and three representing Cheadle Hulme North, serve on the borough council.[tpl]cite web |url=http://democracy.stockport.gov.uk/mgMemberIndex.aspx?FN=WARD&VW=LIST&PIC=0 |title=Your Councillors by Ward |publisher=Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council |accessdate=22 April 2013[/tpl]

==Geography==

At [tpl]coord|53.376|-2.188[/tpl], Cheadle Hulme is in the south of Greater Manchester. Stockport Metropolitan Borough straddles the Cheshire Plain and the Pennines, and Cheadle Hulme is in the west of the borough on the Cheshire Plain. The area lies in the Ladybrook Valley next to the Micker Brook, a tributary of the River Mersey which flows north–west from Poynton through Bramhall and Cheadle Hulme, joining the Mersey in Stockport.Arrowsmith, p.5 Cheadle Hulme is situated [tpl]convert|2.3|mi|km|1[/tpl] southwest of Stockport town centre, and [tpl]convert|7.5|mi|km|1[/tpl] southeast of Manchester city centre.
The majority of buildings in the area are houses from the 20th century, but there are a few buildings, landmarks, and objects that date from the 16th century, in addition to Bramall Hall which dates from the 14th century. In particular, there are many Victorian buildings in several places across the area. The local drift geology is mostly glacial boulder clay, as well as glacial sands and gravel. For many years the clay has been used for making bricks and tiles.Arrowsmith, p.7
Cheadle Hulme's climate is generally temperate, like the rest of Greater Manchester. The mean highest and lowest temperatures of [tpl]convert|13.2|°C|°F[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|6.4|°C|°F[/tpl] are slightly above the average for England, while the annual rainfall of [tpl]convert|806.6|mm|in[/tpl] and average hours (1,394.5 hours) of sunshine are respectively above and below the national averages.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/sites/manchester_airport.html |title=Manchester Airport 1971–2000 weather averages |publisher=Met Office |year=2001 |accessdate=6 June 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/areal/england.html |author=Met Office |title=Annual England weather averages |publisher=Met Office |year=2007 |accessdate=6 June 2009[/tpl]

==Economy==

For many years Cheadle Hulme was rural countryside,Lee, p.6 made up of woods, open land, and farms. The local population was made up of farmers and peasants, living in small cottages and working the land under the tenancy of the Lord of the Manor.Squire, p.3 Most families kept animals for food, grew their own crops, and probably bought and sold produce at Stockport market. Water was obtained from local wells and ponds, and sometimes the Micker Brook.
Local silk weaving became a large part of everyday life. The work took place in domestic cottages in a room known as a "loomshop", and the woven silk was transported to firms in Macclesfield [tpl]convert|8|mi|km|0[/tpl] away.Squire, p.5 Silk-weaving remained commonplace in the area until the early 20th century, when the process became industrialised. Other industries in the area included a corn mill, which collapsed some time during the First World War, located next to the Micker Brook; cotton weaving; and brickworks, one located where the fire station is and one near the railway station.Squire, p.6 A coal wharf was situated opposite the railway station  and supplied the area with coal.Squire, p.16
The building of the railways in the early 1840s introduced new employment opportunities for people in places such as Stockport and Manchester, as well as an influx of people coming to live in the area.Lee, p.7 In the mid-19th century, one of the earliest shops was opened in the Smithy Green area, selling groceries, sweets and other provisions. As people settled in the area, more shops were opened and new houses were built, many of which still stand. During the early 20th century Cheadle Hulme experienced a rapid growth in population, mostly due to an influx of people from Manchester and other large towns and cities coming to live in the area, and it gradually became more suburban.Squire, p.13 In the 1930s more houses were built around the Grove Lane and Pingate Lane, Gill Bent Road, Hulme Hall Road and Cheadle Road areas, and new roads replaced old farms.Squire, p.21 In the 1960s the Hursthead estate was built on land that was once Hursthead Farm.Squire, p.9 As of 2009 the only farm remaining is Leather's Farm on Ladybridge Road.
Cheadle Hulme is served by a fire station on Turves Road which opened in October 1960. Before this the area made use of a service in Cheadle.Squire, p.20 An ambulance station is near the fire station, and the closest public hospital is Stepping Hill Hospital in Hazel Grove. Until the early 2000s the area had a police station which served as the headquarters for the west Stockport area.[tpl]cite news |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/stockportexpress/news/s/322470_new_police_hq_is_safe_bet.html |title=New police HQ is safe bet |date=9 February 2005 |work=Stockport Express |publisher=M.E.N.

Cheadle Hulme has a large variety of businesses serving the area. Station Road is home to the shopping precinct (built in 1962)Garratt, p.61 and contains among other businesses a, an Oxfam shop, an Asda supermarket, a hairdresser's shop, an optician, a pharmacy, and several restaurants. There are more restaurants and cafés along Station Road as well as solicitors and building societies, and long-running family businesses such as Pimlott's butchers are also prominent.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.stockport.gov.uk/services/business/regendevelopment/regeneration/districtcentres/cheadlehulme/retailandent |title=Retail and Entertainment in Cheadle Hulme |publisher=Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council |accessdate=22 April 2013[/tpl] In 2002 a Blockbuster and Tesco Express opened on the site of an old petrol station, and in July 2007 Cheadle Hulme became the home of Waitrose's first purpose-built retail outlet in northern England.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.igd.com/analysis/channel/storevisit_hub.asp?channelid=1&channelitemid=26 |title=IGD Retail Analysis – Waitrose Store Visit reports & in-store photos |publisher=IGD Retail Analysis |accessdate=6 June 2009[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl]
According to the 2001 census, the biggest industry of employment for Cheadle Hulme residents is that of wholesale and retail trade and repairs with approximately 16% of people employed in that industry. This is followed closely by real estate, renting and business activities with 15% of people employed in this area. Other big areas of employment include manufacturing (13%), health and social work (11%), and education (10%).[tpl]cite web |url=http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=7&b=6096287&d=14&e=16&g=354473&i=1001x1003x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1243092685234&enc=1&dsFamilyId=119 |title=Cheadle Hulme North (Ward) Industry of Employment (UV34) |publisher=Office for National Statistics |accessdate=23 May 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=7&b=6096288&d=14&e=16&g=354532&i=1001x1003x1004&m=0&r=0&s=1243092514156&enc=1&dsFamilyId=119 |title=Cheadle Hulme South (Ward) Industry of Employment (UV34) |publisher=Office for National Statistics |accessdate=23 May 2009[/tpl] Approximately 30% of people were classed as "economically inactive" in the 2001 census.

Around 300 men from Cheadle Hulme served in the First World War,Squire, p.14 and it was decided that those who died should be commemorated. Various ideas, including a library and clock tower, were suggested and in the end a cenotaph was built on the corner of Ravenoak Road and Manor Road in 1921. Additions for later wars have been made, and due to the busy traffic around that particular place there have been suggestions for moving it to a quieter area.Wyke, p.340

==Transport==

Although most of the roads in the area date from the 20th century, there are many older roads formed from ancient routes, some as old as Roman. Cheadle Road possibly originated in Roman times and Ack Lane (formerly Hack Lane) is named after Hacon, a local Saxon landowner.Lee, p.5 Hulme Hall Road is named for the landmark it runs through and has existed since at least the 18th century. Until the 20th century, the roads were little more than country lanes, and most traffic consisted of horsedrawn carriages, carts, and milk floats. The roads were about half as wide as they are currently, and have all since been widened to accommodate the increasing amount of traffic. The first cars appeared in Cheadle Hulme in the early 1900s, but horse-drawn vehicles were the main form of transport until the 1920s. A bus, known as the "Rattler" was introduced around this time, and ran a service through the area. It was, however, very slow and noisy, as its name suggests.Squire, p.17
The Crewe to Manchester railway was completed in May 1842, and a railway station known as "Cheadle" was built opposite the modern-day Hesketh Tavern. When the Stafford to Manchester railway opened in 1845 the original station closed and a new station was built to accommodate the junction between the two railways. The road was renamed to Station Road in the same year,Lee, p.4 and the station was renamed to Cheadle Hulme in 1866.Butt, p.58 The station has four platforms that serve the Crewe to Manchester and Stafford to Manchester Lines;[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations/CHU/details.html |title=Station Facilities for Cheadle Hulme |publisher=National Rail |accessdate=10 February 2009[/tpl] there are three trains per hour to Manchester, and one train per hour to Stoke and Crewe.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.northernrail.org/travel/livedepartures/CHU |title=Live Departures from Cheadle Hulme |publisher=Northern Rail |accessdate=22 April 2013[/tpl] During the financial year 2007–2008 the station was used by passengers 424,000 times, an increase of 47,000 from the previous year.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rail-reg.gov.uk/upload/xls/station_usage_0708.xls |title=2007/08 station usage |publisher=Office of Rail Regulation |date=20 April 2009 |accessdate=24 May 2009[/tpl]
