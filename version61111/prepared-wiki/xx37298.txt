The Sikorsky SH-3 Sea King (company designation S-61) is an American twin-engined anti-submarine warfare (ASW) helicopter designed and built by Sikorsky Aircraft. It was a landmark design, being one of the first ASW helicopter to take advantage of turboshaft engines, as well as being the first amphibious helicopter in the world.Leoni 2007, p. 251.
Introduced in 1961, it served as the United States Navy as a key ASW and utility asset for several decades before being replaced by the non-amphibious Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk in the 1990s. The type also proved popular in civil service and with foreign military customers, as of 2014 many remain in service in number of nations around the world. The Sea King has been built under license by Agusta in Italy, Mitsubishi in Japan, and by Westland in the United Kingdom (See Westland Sea King). The major civil versions are the S-61L and S-61N.

==Development==

===Origins===

During the Cold War between the US and the Soviet Union, the Soviet Navy had proceeded to construct a large submarine fleet, at one point numbering over 200 operational submarines of various types. The US Navy chose to counter this threat by investing in newer and increasingly-capable ASW capabilities to detect and potentially attack these submarines, the development of the Sea King was one part in this strategy.Fieldhouse and Taoka 1989, pp. 70-71, 74.
In 1957, Sikorsky was awarded a contract to produce an all-weather amphibious helicopter for the U.S. Navy. The new helicopter was to excel at anti-submarine warfare (ASW) and would combine the roles of hunter and killer; these duties had previously been carried out by two separate helicopters.Chant 1988, p. 464. Key features of the emerging ASW helicopter would include its amphibious hull for landing on water, and its twin-turboshaft engines that enabled a larger, heavier and better-equipped aircraft than prior helicopters.
The first prototype took flight for the first time in March 1959. Carrier suitability trials were conducted on board [tpl]USS|Lake Champlain|CV-39|2[/tpl]; the trials were completed successfully in mid-1961."HSS-2 Completes Carrier Trials." Naval Aviation News, July 1961, pp. 22–23. The US Navy began receiving delivery of the first HSS-2 aircraft, which would be subsequently re-designated as the SH-3A, in September 1961.Frawley 2003, p. 194.
Sikorsky also developed a variant of the Sea King for the civil market, designated Sikorsky S-61L. The first operator of the S-61L was Los Angeles Airways, who introduced them to service on 11 March 1962.Apostolo, G. "Sikorsky S-61".The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Helicopters. Bonanza Books, 1984. ISBN 0-517-43935-2."The Self-Supporting Helicopter" Time Magazine. 26 December 1960. Another variant with a conventional hull, the Sikorsky S-61R, was also concurrently developed for transport and search and rescue (SAR) duties, this type being extensively operated by the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Coast Guard.Apostolo, Giorgio. "Sikorsky S-61R". The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Helicopters. New York: Bonanza Books. 1984. ISBN 978-0-517-43935-7.
In late 1961 and early 1962, a modified U.S. Navy HSS-2 Sea King was used to break the FAI 3 km, 100 km, 500 km and 1000 km helicopter speed records. This series of flights culminated on 5 February 1962 with the HSS-2 setting an absolute helicopter speed record of 210.6 mph.Taylor, John W.R. Jane's All The World's Aircraft 1963-1964, Jane's All The World's Aircraft Publishing Co. Ltd.[tpl]Page needed|date=April 2012[/tpl] This record was broken by a modified Sud Super Frelon helicopter on 23 July 1963 with a speed of 217.7 mph.Taylor, John W.R.

===Further developments===

In US Navy service, the initial SH-3A model of the Sea King would be progressively converted into the improved SH-3D and SH-3H variants; these featured more powerful engines and improved sensors that gave the type greater operational capabilities as an ASW platform. It was also common for Sea Kings to be converted for non-ASW activities, these roles included minesweeping, combat search and rescue, and as a cargo/passenger utility transport. The aircrew on ASW-tasked Sea Kings were routinely trained to carry out these secondary roles as aircraft could often be quickly adapted to perform different missions in the face of operational needs.Williamson 2000, pp. 149, 167.
The Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) became a major operator of the type (see Sikorsky CH-124 Sea King), the Sea King continues to operate as Canada's dominant maritime helicopter 50 years following its introduction to service in 1963.Gordon, Lisa, The King at sea" Vertical Magazine, 9 December 2013. Accessed: 11 December 2013. One notably innovation in Canadian operations, which was subsequently adopted by several other nations, was the use of a winch 'hauldown' landing method, referred to as a 'Beartrap'. This device considerably increased the ability of Sea Kings to land in difficult conditions, such as on small flight decks or during poor weather conditions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hazegray.org/navhist/canada/current/seaking/|title=Haze Gray & Underway - The Canadian Navy of Yesterday & Today - Sea King[/tpl]
In addition to aircraft manufactured by Sikorsky, several license agreements were issued to other firms to produce the type, such as Mitsubishi in Japan and Agusta in Italy. Another licensee in the United Kingdom, Westland Helicopters, would substantially modify the Sea King, producing the Westland Sea King.Uttley 2001, p. 206.McGowen 2005, p. 119.Thorn and Frawley 1998, p. 164. Unlike US Navy Sea Kings, the Westland Sea King was intended for greater autonomous operation.Lake 1996, pp. 114–115. In total, Westland produced 330 Sea Kings; beyond British operators, export customers of Westland's Sea King included the Indian Naval Air Arm, the German Navy, the Royal Australian Navy, and the Royal Norwegian Air Force.McGowen 2005, pp. 120, 126.
In the early 21st century, following their drawdown in US service, there have been a number of initiatives to refurbish ex-military Sea Kings for continued operations; in addition to civil operators, nations such as Egypt and India acquired refurbished former US Sea Kings to supplement their own ageing fleets."India Buys Six U.S. Navy Sea Kings." Sea Power, 1 February 2007."Last U.S. Navy Sea King Helicopter Delivered." Navy News, 21 November 2005."Former Presidential helicopter redelivered to the Egyptian Government." NavAir News, 17 June 2009. While Sikorsky had ended production of the type during the 1970s, it was reported that nearly 600 Sea Kings were in operational service in 2009.Baruzzi, Cara. "Flight Plan: At 50, Sikorsky’s Sea King gets an upgrade." New Haven Register, 6 September 2009.

==Design==

When introduced, the Sea King was a considerable advancement over previous helicopters; its twin-turboshaft powerplant layout gave the SH-3 a payload capacity and level of reliability far in excess of previous anti-submarine helicopters. In the event of an engine failure, the Sea King can maintain flight on a single engine alone.Bishop and Chant 2004, p. 208. Sea Kings operating in an anti-submarine capacity typically had a four-man crew; a pilot and copilot in the cockpit and two aircrew in the cabin area to operate and monitor the aircraft's detection equipment and to interpret the sensor data; the two rear aircrew were retained in other mission roles such as cargo transfer and rescue operations.Williamson 2000, p. 169. The cabin can accommodate up to 22 survivors or nine stretchers in addition to two medical officers in an SAR capacity; up to 28 soldiers can be accommodated when operated as a troop transport.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]
The Sea King features many design elements to support naval-orientated operations; the main rotor blades and the tail section can be folded for storage when deployed onboard ships. An amphibious hull allows most Sea Kings to land on and remain on the ocean's surface if required; for stability and increased flotation, the aircraft's sponsons contain deployable airbags for use when the Sea King operates in direct contact with the sea.Jackson 2005, p. 207.
Depending upon their intended mission, the armament fitted upon a Sea King could vary considerably. A typical armament configuration in an anti-submarine capacity could include up to four torpedoes or four depth charges. For anti-ship duties some models were outfitted to carry one or two missiles, typically Sea Eagles or Exocets.Byers 1986, p. 232. The Sea King had also the option of being outfitted to deploy the B57 nuclear bomb.Fieldhouse and Taoka 1989, pp. 72-73.
ASW equipment used onboard Sea Kings has included the AQS-13A/B/E dipping sonar, specialized computers for processing sonar and sonobuoy data, various models of sonobuoys, ARR-75 Sonobuoy Receivers, and Magnetic Anomaly Detectors. The commonly-fitted AKT-22 data link enabled the rapid dissemination of gathered sonar information to other friendly elements in range.Biass 1985, p. 543. Some later Sea King models featured digital navigation systems and overhauled cockpit instrumentation for night vision compatibility.Chesneau 1985, pp. 2–3, 5.

==Operational history==

The Sea King became operational with the United States Navy in June 1961 as the HSS-2; the aircraft's designation subsequently changed to SH-3A when the unified aircraft designation system was introduced. It was used primarily for anti-submarine warfare, detecting and tracking Soviet submarines and, in time of war, would be used to attack enemy submarines as well.Blair 2004, p. 42. Nighttime ASW operations were possible with considerable difficulty; in the event of hostilities, Sea Kings could also operate effectively from offshore platforms in order to further their surveillance and strike range.S.R. Arends, Harrington, J.H., Karlsson, C.R., Pellerin, A. E., and Staley, M. "Military Use of Offshore Platforms." Naval War College Newport, 9 April 1979. ADA075840.
The Sea King also performed various other roles and missions such as search-and-rescue, transport, anti-shipping and airborne early warning operations. Aircraft carriers would typically deploy Sea Kings to operate in the close vicinity of the carrier in order to act as a plane guard, ready to respond to another aircraft that crashed during takeoff or landing.Bishop and Chant 2004, p. 91. Providing a safety margin for other operations, and transferring personnel and mail in between vessels were routine, if less prestigious, duties for the US Navy Sea Kings.Dorsey, Jack. "Navy bids farewell to Sea King helicopter." Pilot Online, 28 January 2006.
The Sea King, being highly suited to the maritime environment and for its anti-submarine capabilities, achieved a considerable number of overseas sales and has been operated in large numbers by multiple nations, including Brazil, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom.Chant 1988, pp. 182–183. Several operators have kept their Sea Kings in operational usage in excess of 50 years.Tutton, Michael. "Gritty Sea King helicopters still flying after 50 years of service." Globe and Mail, 31 July 2013."BBC 2 programme Sea King: Britain's flying past 28 February 2013." Fleet Air Arm Officers Association 18 February 2013.
During the Vietnam War, SH-3s were used to rescue the crews of downed aircraft both at sea and over land; the Sea Kings were regularly tasked with retrieval operations in hostile territory, being outfitted with self-sealing fuel tanks, machine guns and armor.Marolda 1996, pp. 70–80. The Sea King has been significantly useful for medical evacuations and disaster relief efforts throughout its service life.
The SH-3 became the primary helicopter for the retrieval of manned space capsules, starting with the recovery of Mercury-Atlas 7 in May 1962.Blair 2004, p. 87. In February 1971, an SH-3A, operating from the amphibious assault ship USS New Orleans, performed the recovery mission of Apollo 14."Apollo 14 crewmen step aboard U.S.S. New Orleans after splashdown." NASA Images, Retrieved: 17 April 2012. A specialist search and rescue variant of the SH-3, the HH-3, also performed in this capacity.
Several Sea Kings, operated by the United States Marine Corps's HMX-1 unit, are used as the official helicopters of the President of the United States; in this capacity, the call sign 'Marine One' is used by the helicopter currently occupied by the President. As of 2012, a replacement helicopter fleet for the Sea King is pending under the ongoing VXX program.Trimble, Stephen. "Boeing says AW101 one of its three options for VXX." FlightGlobal.com, 8 June 2010. Retrieved: 10 June 2010.Cavas, Christopher P. "Former Competitors Join Forces for Helo Program." Defense News, 19 April 2010.
In 1992, the US Justice Department sued Sikorsky over allegations of overcharged component pricing and deliberately misleading US Navy negotiators."Sikorsky sued over alleged Sea King overcharges." Defense Daily, 1 July 1992. In 1997, the Justice Department issued further accusations against Sikorsky of willful overchanging on a contract to upgrade the Navy's Sea Kings.Pazniokas, Mark. "Testimony Begins In Sikorsky Trial." Hartford Courant, 17 July 1997.
During the 1990s, the Sea King was replaced in the ASW and SAR roles by the U.S. Navy with the newer Sikorsky SH-60 Sea Hawk.Blair 2004, p. 44. However, the SH-3 continued to operate in reserve units in roles including logistical support, search and rescue, and transport. On 27 January 2006, the SH-3 was ceremonially retired at NAS Norfolk, Virginia, by Helicopter Combat Support Squadron 2 (HC-2)."U.S. Navy Retires Sea Kings." Rotor & Wing, 15 March 2006. They have been replaced by increasingly advanced variants of the SH-60 Sea Hawk.
