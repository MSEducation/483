[[Multi-service business gateway]]

CATEGORIES: Networking hardware

A multi-service business gateway (MSBG) is a device that combines multiple network voice and data communications functions into a single device. Targeted at small and medium enterprises (SMEs), the MSBG integrates critical functions such as routing, VoIP, and security (virtual private networking, firewall, intrusion detection/prevention) into a single fault-tolerant platform, with a common control & management plane oriented around services. An MSBG may also include functionality such as web/e-mail server and filtering, storage, and wireless networking.[tpl]cite web |first=Abdul |last=Kasim |title=SMB Tech: Next-Generation SMB & Branch Office Networking Infrastructures |url=http://www.wwpi.com/small-to-mid-sized-businesses/6230-the-great-equalizer-next-generation-smb-a-branch-office-networking-infrastructures- |publisher=Computer Technology Review |date=2008-10-24 |accessdate=2009-04-03[/tpl]

The more limited financial and technical resources of SMEs restrict their ability procure, implement, and manage the technologies available to large enterprises. By integrating critical network functions in a single device, the MSBG provides a solution that is more affordable and also simplifies deployment and management for SMEs.[tpl]cite web |first=Charlie |last= Kawwas |title=Networking technology for SMEs |url=http://www.smeweb.com/technology/features/networking-technology-for-smes-010906.html |publisher=SME Web |date=2009-01-06 |accessdate=2009-04-03 [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] MSBGs can be managed by service provider or other managed services company, which allows a business to implement network services without the need of its own information technology (IT) staff.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2009[/tpl]
MSBGs provide a variety of solutions that can be used to support an SME's entire network. Use of a common architecture enables SMEs and service providers to expand the scale and services offered to meet the individual needs of the business. The openness of the MSBG also permits 3rd party applications or proprietary features to be added to the system.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2009[/tpl]
