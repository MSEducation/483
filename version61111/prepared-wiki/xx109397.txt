The Longfellow House–Washington's Headquarters National Historic Site, also known as the Vassall-Craigie-Longfellow House and, until December 2010, Longfellow National Historic Site, is a historic site located at 105 Brattle Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts. For almost fifty years, it was the home of noted American poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. For a time, it had previously served as the headquarters of George Washington.
The house was built in 1759 for John Vassall, who fled the Cambridge area at the beginning of the American Revolutionary War because of his loyalty to the king of England. On July 16, 1775, George Washington occupied the abandoned house as his first official headquarters. It served as his base of operations during the Siege of Boston, until he moved out on April 4, 1776. Andrew Craigie, Washington's Apothecary General, was the next person to own the home for a significant period of time. After purchasing the house in 1791, he instigated the home's only major addition. Craigie's financial situation at the time of his death in 1819 forced his widow Elizabeth Craigie to take in boarders. It was as a boarder that Henry Wadsworth Longfellow came into the home. He became its owner in 1843, when his father-in-law Nathan Appleton purchased it as a wedding gift. He lived in the home until his death in 1882.
The last family to live in the home was the Longfellow family, who established the Longfellow Trust in 1913 for its preservation. In 1972, the home and all of its furnishings was donated to, and was made part of, the National Park Service. The home, which represents the mid-Georgian architectural style, is seasonally open to the public.

In the days after the Battles of Lexington and Concord, the home was used as a temporary hospital. Colonel John Glover and the Marblehead Regiment occupied the house as their temporary barracks in June 1775.Harris, John. Historic Walks in Cambridge. Chester, Connecticut: The Globe Pequot Press, 1986: 208. ISBN 0-87106-899-0 Initially, General George Washington, Commander-in-Chief of the newly formed Continental Army, used the Benjamin Wadsworth House at Harvard College as his headquarters,Benjamin Wadsworth House from Historic Buildings of Massachusetts. but decided he needed more space for his staff.McCullough, David. 1776. New York: Simon & Schuster, 2005: 41. ISBN 0-7432-267-2 Washington moved into the Vassall House on July 16, 1775, and used it as his headquarters and home until he departed on April 4, 1776. During the Siege of Boston, he found the view of the Charles River from the house particularly useful.Calhoun, Charles C. Longfellow: A Rediscovered Life. Boston: Beacon Press, 2004: 125. ISBN 0-8070-7026-2.  The home was shared with several aide-de-camps, including colonel Robert H. Harrison.Howard, Hugh. Houses of the Founding Fathers. New York: Artisan, 2007: 85. ISBN 978-1-57965-275-3 During his time there, Washington was visited by John Adams and Abigail Adams, Benedict Arnold, Henry Knox, and Nathaniel Greene. In his study, Washington also confronted Dr. Benjamin Church with evidence that he was a spy.Howard, Hugh. Houses of the Founding Fathers. New York: Artisan, 2007: 87. ISBN 978-1-57965-275-3 It was in this house that Washington received a poem written by Phillis Wheatley, the first published African-American poet.

Martha Washington joined her husband in December 1775 and stayed until March 1776. She brought with her Washington's nephew George Lewis as well as her son John Parke Custis and his wife  Eleanor Calvert. On Twelfth Night in January 1776, the couple celebrated their wedding anniversary in the home. Mrs. Washington reported to a friend that "some days we have heard a number of cannon and shells from Boston and Bunkers Hill". She used the front parlor as her personal reception room, still furnished with the English-made furniture left behind by the Vassalls.Howard, Hugh. Houses of the Founding Fathers. New York: Artisan, 2007: 86. ISBN 978-1-57965-275-3 The Washingtons also had several servants, including a tailor named Giles Alexander, and several slaves including "Billy" Lee.

Surviving household accounts show that the family purchased large quantities of beef, lamb, wild ducks, geese, fresh fish, plums, peaches, barrels of cider, gallons of brandy and rum,McCullough, David. 1776. New York: Simon & Schuster, 2005: 42. ISBN 0-7432-267-2 and 217 bottles of Madeira wine purchased in a two-week period.
Washington left the house in April 1776.Calhoun, Charles C. Longfellow: A Rediscovered Life. Boston: Beacon Press, 2004: 126. ISBN 0-8070-7026-2. Nathaniel Tracy, who had made a great fortune as one of the earliest and most successful privateers under Washington, owned the house from 1781 to 1786. He then went bankrupt and sold the house to Thomas Russell, a wealthy Boston merchant, who in turn occupied it until 1791.

===Craigie family and boarders===

Andrew Craigie bought the house in 1791; Craigie had been the first Apothecary General of the American army.Levine, Miriam. A Guide to Writers' Homes in New England. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Apple-wood Press, 1984: 124–125. ISBN 0-918222-51-6 In his ballroom, Craigie hosted Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn, the father of Queen Victoria.Harris, John.

ISBN 0-87106-899-0 While living in the home, he married the daughter of a Nantucket clergyman, 22-year old Elizabeth Craigie, 17 years her elder. Craigie overspent in trying to restore the home and, when he died in 1819, he left his wife Elizabeth in great debt; Mrs. Craigie took in boarders to support herself,Wagenknecht, Edward.

Houses of the Founding Fathers. New York: Artisan, 2007: 89. ISBN 978-1-57965-275-3 Short-term residents of the home included Jared Sparks, Edward Everett, and Joseph Emerson Worcester.Brooks, Van Wyck. The Flowering of New England. New York: E. P. Dutton and Company, Inc., 1952: 153 Sparks, who moved into the home in April 1833, was then preparing a biography of Washington based on original documents. He recorded in his journal: "It is a singular circumstance that, while I am engaged in preparing for the press the letters of General Washington which he wrote at Cambridge after taking command of the American army, I should occupy the same rooms that he did at that time.""The George Washington Papers: Provenance and Publication History" at the Library of Congress Another lodger was Sarah Lowell, an aunt of James Russell Lowell.Hansen, Harry. Longfellow's New England. New York: Hastings House, 1972: 48. ISBN 0-8038-4279-1
Longfellow moved to Cambridge to take a job at Harvard College as Smith Professor of Modern Languages and of Belles Lettres.Williams, Cecil B. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. New York: Twayne Publishers, Inc., 1964: 72–73 A friend, Cornelius Conway Felton, recommended that Longfellow rent a room on the third floor of the home of a Professor Stearns on Kirkland Street; Longfellow stayed there for the 1836–1837 academic year. He disliked the place, however, and sought out better accommodations. Beginning in the summer of 1837, he rented rooms on the east side of the second floor of the home on Brattle Street, now owned by Elizabeth Craigie. At first, Mrs. Craigie thought he was a student at Harvard and refused to rent to him until he convinced her that he was a professor as well as the author of the book she was reading, Outre-Mer.Wagenknecht, Edward. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow: Portrait of an American Humanist. New York: Oxford University Press, 1966: 6–7
Longfellow's new landlady had earned a reputation for being eccentric and often wore a turban. In the 1840s, Longfellow wrote about an incident when canker-worms were devastating the elm trees on the property. Mrs. Craigie "would sit by the open window and let them crawl over her white turban. She refused to have the trees protected against them & said, Why, sir, they have as good a right to live as we—they are our fellow worms". The maid at the time, a woman named Miriam, served Longfellow his meals in his room. Longfellow called her "the giantess".Thompson, Lawrance. Young Longfellow (1807–1843). New York: The Macmillan Company, 1938: 251.
Upon moving into the home in August 1837, Longfellow wrote to his father, "The new rooms are above all praise, only the do want painting."Hansen, Harry. Longfellow's New England. New York: Hastings House, 1972: 35. ISBN 0-8038-4279-1 The rooms Longfellow rented were the same ones once used personally by George Washington while it was his headquarters. He proudly wrote to his friend George Washington Greene: "I live in a great house which looks like an Italian villa: have two large rooms opening into each other. They were once Gen. Washington's chambers".
The first major works Longfellow composed in the home were Hyperion, a prose romance likely inspired by his pursuit for the affections of Frances Appleton, and Voices of the Night, a poetry collection which included "A Psalm of Life". 20th-century literary scholar Edward Wagenknecht notes that it was these early years at the Craigie House which marked "the real beginning of Longfellow's literary career".Wagenknecht, Edward. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow: Portrait of an American Humanist. New York: Oxford University Press, 1966: 8 His landlady, Elizabeth Craigie, died in 1841.Ehrlich, Eugene and Gorton Carruth.

===Longfellow family===

After Elizabeth Craigie's death, the entire property was leased by Joseph Emerson Worcester from her heirs; he in turn rented the eastern half of the house to Longfellow.Calhoun, Charles C. Longfellow: A Rediscovered Life. Boston: Beacon Press, 2004: 167. ISBN 0-8070-7026-2. In 1843, the house was purchased by Nathan Appleton, who gave the house to Longfellow as a wedding gift when Longfellow married Nathan's daughter Frances.Wilson, Susan.

Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1973: 239. especially after Longfellow's friend George Washington Greene reminded them "how noble an inheritance this is — where Washington dwelt in every room". Longfellow was proud of the connection to Washington and in 1844 purchased a bust of the home's former occupant, a copy of the sculpture by Jean-Antoine Houdon.Howard, Hugh. Houses of the Founding Fathers. New York: Artisan, 2007: 90. ISBN 978-1-57965-275-3  Worcester and his wife became tenants under Longfellow in the western half of the house until their new home a few doors down was completed that spring.Calhoun, Charles C. Longfellow: A Rediscovered Life. Boston: Beacon Press, 2004: 167–168. ISBN 0-8070-7026-2. Mrs. Longfellow wrote on May 5, 1844, "Worcester family left us in complete possession the house, with rooms nicely cleaned, and uncarpeted stairs and entries".Tharp, Louise Hall. The Appletons of Beacon Hill. Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1973: 244.

Longfellow lived in the house for the next four decades, producing many of his most famous poems including "Paul Revere's Ride" and "The Village Blacksmith",Haas, Irvin. Historic Homes of American Authors. Washington, DC: The Preservation Press, 1991: 93. ISBN 0-89133-180-8. as well as longer works such as Evangeline, The Song of Hiawatha, and The Courtship of Miles Standish. In all, while living in this house, Longfellow published eleven poetry collections, two novels, three epic poems, and several plays as well as a translation of Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy.Irmscher, Christoph. Longfellow Redux. University of Illinois, 2008: 8. ISBN 978-0-252-03063-5. Even as the poet's popularity increased, Longfellow and his wife most often referred to the home as "Craigie House" or "Craigie Castle".Tharp, Louise Hall. The Appletons of Beacon Hill. Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1973: 245.
Longfellow oversaw the creation of a formal garden and his wife oversaw decorating the interior.Levine, Miriam. A Guide to Writers' Homes in New England. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Apple-wood Press, 1984: 125. ISBN 0-918222-51-6 Mrs. Longfellow purchased several items from Tiffany's in New York as well as $350 worth of carpets.Tharp, Louise Hall.

Boston: Beacon Press, 2004: 170. ISBN 0-8070-7026-2.
Longfellow often wrote in his first-floor study, formerly Washington's office, surrounded by portraits of his friends, including charcoal portraits by Eastman Johnson of Charles Sumner, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Cornelius Conway Felton. Longfellow would write either at the center table, at the desk, or in the armchair by the fire.
Fanny Longfellow died in the home in July 1861 after her dress accidentally caught fire; her husband attempted to quell the flames, managing to keep her face from burning.Levine, Miriam. A Guide to Writers' Homes in New England. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Apple-wood Press, 1984: 127. ISBN 0-918222-51-6 Longfellow himself was burned on his own face and was scarred badly enough that he began growing a beard to hide it.Wilson, Susan. Literary Trail of Greater Boston. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2000: 110. ISBN 0-618-05013-2

==Preservation and current use==

Longfellow died in 1882 and his daughter Alice Longfellow was the last of his children to live in the home. In 1913, the surviving Longfellow children established the Longfellow House Trust to preserve the home as well as its view to the Charles River.Harris, John. Historic Walks in Cambridge. Chester, Connecticut: The Globe Pequot Press, 1986: 210. ISBN 0-87106-899-0 Their intention was to preserve the home as a memorial to Longfellow and Washington and to showcase the property as a "prime example of Georgian architecture".
In 1962, the trust successfully lobbied for the house to become a national historic landmark. In 1972, the Trust donated the property to the National Park Service and it became the Longfellow National Historic Site and open to the public as a house museum. On display are many of the original nineteenth century furnishings, artwork, over 10,000 books owned by Longfellow, and the dining table around which many important visitors gathered.Wilson, Susan. Literary Trail of Greater Boston. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2000: 111. ISBN 0-618-05013-2 Everything on display was owned by the Longfellow family. The site was renamed to Longfellow House–Washington's Headquarters National Historic Site on December 22, 2010, to ensure that the connection to Washington was not lost in the memory of the general public.[tpl]cite journal|title=Longfellow House-Washington Headquarters National Historic Site|journal=Longfellow House Bulletin|issue=Volume 15, No. 1|publisher=National Park Service|date=June 2011|url=http://www.nps.gov/long/parknews/upload/LHB-15-1-11.pdf[/tpl]
The site also possesses some 750,000 original documents relevant to the former occupants of the home.Longfellow National Historic Site Archives, accessed July 10, 2008 These archives are open to scholarly research by appointment.
Across the street from the Longfellow House–Washington's Headquarters National Historic Site is the municipal park known as Longfellow Park. In the middle sits a memorial by sculptor Daniel Chester French dedicated in 1914. In addition to a bust of the poet, a carved bas-relief by Henry Bacon depicts the famous characters Miles Standish, Sandalphon, the village blacksmith, the Spanish student, Evangeline, and Hiawatha.

==Architecture and landscape==

The structure of the original house was built in the Georgian architectural style. The pair of large pilasters that frame the facade expressed John Vassall's aristocratic background. In 1791, Andrew Craigie added the two side piazzas and the two-story back ell and also expanded the library into a twenty by thirty foot ballroom with its own entrance. During the Longfellow family's time in the home, very few structural changes were made. As Frances Longfellow wrote, "we are full of plans & projects with no desire, however, to change a feature of the old countenance which Washington has rendered sacred".
The Longfellow House–Washington's Headquarters National Historic Site is noted for its garden on the northeast end of the property. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow oversaw the creation of the original garden, shaped as a lyre, shortly after his wedding. In 1845, he began refurbishing the garden in earnest and imported trees from England with help from Asa Gray. These trees included "a number of evergreens, among them a cedar of Lebanon and pines from the Himalayas, Norway, Switzerland and Oregon".Leighton, Ann. American Gardens of the Nineteenth Century. Amherst: The University of Massachusetts Press, 1987: 223. ISBN 0-87023-533-8. The lyre shape proved impractical and a new design was made with the help of a landscape architect named Richard Dolben in 1847. The new design was a square surrounding a circle that was cut into four tear-shaped garden beds outlined by trimmed boxwood. Mrs. Longfellow referred to the shape as a "Persian rug".Leighton, Ann. American Gardens of the Nineteenth Century. Amherst: The University of Massachusetts Press, 1987: 224. ISBN 0-87023-533-8.
After her father's death in 1882, Alice Longfellow commissioned two of America's first female landscape architects, Martha Brookes Hutcheson and Ellen Biddle Shipman, to redesign the formal garden in the Colonial Revival style. The garden was recently restored by an organization called Friends of the Longfellow House, which completed the final stage of its reconstruction, the historic pergola, in 2008.

==Replicas==

For a time, Longfellow's home was one of the most photographed and most recognizable homes in the United States. In the early twentieth century Sears, Roebuck and Company sold scaled-down blueprints of the home so that anyone could build their own version of Longfellow's home.Calhoun, Charles C. Longfellow: A Rediscovered Life. Boston: Beacon Press, 2004: 245. ISBN 0-8070-7026-2.  Several replicas of Longfellow's home appear throughout the United States. One replica, simply called Longfellow House, still exists in Minneapolis. Originally built by businessman Robert "Fish" Jones, it currently serves as an information center for the Minneapolis Park System and is on the Grand Rounds Scenic Byway. One full scale replica of the house was built in Great Barrington, Massachusetts at the turn of the 20th century. This building is one of the only remaining full scale replicas of Longfellow's original home maintaining all the original historical character.
