Edmund Duncan Montgomery (March 19, 1835 – April 17, 1911) was a Scottish philosopher, scientist and physician.

==Early life==

Edmund Duncan Montgomery was born March, 1835, in Edinburgh, Scotland.  His parentage is unknown, but the Elisabet Ney Museum relates the possibility that he was the son of Isabella Davidson (or Montgomery) and a prominent Scottish jurist, Duncan McNeill, 1st Baron Colonsay.  He and his mother lived in Paris and Frankfurt, supplemented by a trust fund for him.[tpl]cite web|title=Ney Museum-Edmund Montgomery|url=http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/elisabetney/html/montgomery_biography.html|publisher=Elisabet Ney Museum|accessdate=29 October 2010[/tpl]
By the time he entered his teens, he began to be interested in the philosophical works of Arthur Schopenhauer.  While still living in Frankfurt and only 13 years old, he participated in the Revolutions of 1848 in the German states.

==Education==

In 1852, Montgomery majored in medicine at the University of Heidelberg, where he did lab work under Robert Bunsen and came under the influence of Christian Kapp, Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach and Jacob Moleschott.  He later attended lectures by Johannes Peter Müller at the University of Berlin during his 1855–1856 enrollment.  While studying in  Bonn  1856–1857, he attended influential lectures of Hermann von Helmholtz.

==Medical practice==

Montgomery received his MD degree from the University of Würzburg on February 18, 1858.
He interned at Prague and Vienna.  He served his residency at the London German Hospital and Bermondsay Dispensary.  While doing biological research, he became Curator of the St Thomas' Hospital and Demonstrator of Morbid Anatomy.[tpl]cite journal|last=Keeton|first=Morris T|title=Edmund Montgomery Pioneer of Organicism|jstor=2707145|work=Journal of the History of Ideas|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press[/tpl]  He was elected to the Royal College of Physicians of London in 1862.
After being diagnosed with tuberculosis in 1863, he left the Royal College of Physicians of London and established medical practices on the resort island of Madeira (1863–1865), in Menton (1866) on the French Riviera, and also in Rome (1867) and Munich (1868), while continuing to do his research.  A life annuity allowed him to retire from medical practice in 1869, and devote the rest of his life to philosophy, scientific research, and writing.

==Medicine==

Montgomery's work in medicine included the study of cell theory.

==Philosophy==

Mongomery's study of philosophy complemented his work as a physical scientist. He saw life as the ability of certain chemical compounds to resist damage. He commented on conceptions of knowledge and self in over sixty journal articles and five books. He was an advocate of humanitarianism and a "religion of life," focusing on the idea that man must not ignore the potential of his own yet-to-be-completed evolutionary process.
The two most significant papers written by him were his Refutation of Kant From the Standpoint of the Empirical (1870) and The Revelation of Present Experience (1910).
In the former, he convincingly refutes Immanuel Kant's a priori, the lynchpin of Kant's system, and in the latter, he insists that all knowledge (no exceptions) is based on the evidence provided by the senses.

==Personal life==

While a student at the University of Heidelberg in 1853, Montgomery began a courtship with sculptor Elisabet Ney, who was visiting friends in the city.  They were married at the British consulate in Madeira on November 7, 1863.[tpl]cite book|last=Ledbetter|first=Suzann|title=Shady Ladies: Nineteen Surprising and Rebellious American Women|year=2006|publisher=Forge Books|isbn=978-0-7653-0827-6|pages=179–192[/tpl]
He was diagnosed with tuberculosis in 1863.  By 1870, the Franco-Prussian War had begun.  In the autumn of that year, Ney became pregnant with their first child.  Montgomery received a letter from his friend Baron Carl Vicco Otto Friedrich Constantin von Stralendorff of Mecklenburg-Schwerin who had moved to Thomasville, Georgia with his new wife Margaret Elizabeth Russell of Boston, Massachusetts, declaring the location "Earth's paradise."[tpl]cite web|title=Elisabet Ney Emigration 1871–1873|url=http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/elisabetney/html/emigration.html|publisher=City of Austin Parks and Recreation Dept|accessdate=31 October 2010[/tpl]  On January 14, 1871, Ney and Montgomery, accompanied by their housekeeper Cenci, emigrated to Georgia, to a colony promoted as a resort for consumptives. Son Arthur (1871–1873) was born in Georgia, and son Lorne 1872–1913) was born in Red Wing, Minnesota during one of their travels.  Baron and Baroness von Stralendorff returned to Wismar Germany where he died on July 1, 1872.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/smu/00145/smu-00145.html|title=Edmund Montgomery and Elisabet Ney papers|publisher=SMU|accessdate=29 October 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=New England Historic Genealogical Society Staff|title=The New England Historical and Genealogical Register|year=1873|publisher=New England Historic Genealogical Society Staff|page=291[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Stephens|first=Ira Kendrick|title=The Hermit Philosopher of Liendo|year=1951|publisher=Southern Methodist University Press|page=136[/tpl]
In 1873, Ney traveled alone to Texas.  With the help of German Consul Julius Runge in Galveston, Ney was shown Liendo Plantation near Hempstead in Waller County, Texas.  On March 4, 1873, Montgomery and the rest of the family arrived, and he purchased it. While he tended to his research, Ney ran it for the next twenty years. Oldest son Arthur died of diphtheria in 1873.[tpl]cite web|title=Elisabet Ney Liendo 1873–1891|url=http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/elisabetney/html/liendo.html|publisher=City of Austin Parks and Recreation Dept|accessdate=31 October 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Meischen|first=Betty Smith|title=From Jamestown to Texas|year=2002|publisher=IUniverse|isbn=978-0-595-24223-8|pages=43–45[/tpl]
