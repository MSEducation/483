==Career==

From 2007 to 2009, Nguyen won three Canadian national men's titles — Juvenile, Pre-Novice, and Novice — each time becoming the youngest skater to do so. In 2010, he won the bronze medal on the junior level at the Canadian Championships. Nguyen performed in the exhibition gala at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia. The following year at the 2011 Canadian Championships, he became the youngest skater to win the junior men's title.
In the 2011–12 season, Nguyen became age-eligible for international junior competition. He finished 12th in his first Junior Grand Prix event in Riga, Latvia and then won the bronze medal in his second event in Brasov, Romania. He placed 7th on the senior level at the 2012 Canadian Championships and was assigned to the 2012 World Junior Championships. Nguyen landed his first triple axel in competition in the preliminary round and qualified for the short program with a first place finish. He was 18th in the short program and 11th in the free skate, finishing 13th overall at the event. Joanne McLeod coached him at the BC Centre of Excellence in Burnaby, British Columbia until the end of the 2011–12 season.
In the summer of 2012, Nguyen moved to Toronto to work with Brian Orser at the Toronto Cricket, Skating and Curling Club. He won bronze at the 2012 JGP in Turkey and finished 12th at the 2013 World Junior Championships in Milan, Italy. The next season, he placed fourth and 16th at his two JGP events. At the 2014 World Junior Championships in Sofia, Bulgaria, he placed first in both segments and won the gold medal.
