Blewett Falls Lake (sometimes spelled incorrectly as Blewitt Falls Lake) is a reservoir located in Anson County and Richmond County in North Carolina. No bridges span the lake. It is a major lake in the Uwharrie Lakes Region and the southernmost and widest body in this chain of lakes. Created by the damming of the Great Pee Dee River, the lake occupies the former Blewett Falls on that river, which were named after a local family. The lake was created for hydropower in the early 20th century.
