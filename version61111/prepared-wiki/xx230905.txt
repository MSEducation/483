==Nomenclature==

The service is called "Alphaville", in reference to "the City term 'Alpha', meaning 'absolute returns' â€¦ above and beyond the industry benchmark."  "The Long Room" is named after a dining room of a City of London bar/restaurant on Throgmorton Street that used to be frequented by stockbrokers, bankers and insurance brokers when the London Stock Exchange was located on Threadneedle Street.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kzwp.com/lyons2/throg.htm | title=The Throgmorton Restaurant| accessdate=2009-05-02[/tpl], from an ex-employee's website on the history of J.
