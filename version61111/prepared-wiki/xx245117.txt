[[List of early color feature films]]

CATEGORIES: Lists of films by technology

This is a list of early color feature length films from 1903-1935, when the Technicolor three-strip process ("Process 4") was introduced. On the list below, all movies prior to The Show of Shows (1929) are silent films. About 36 percent of the movies on this list are thought to be lost films, with no prints surviving, or with only partial prints surviving. (This does not include movies that now exist only in black-and-white prints.)
The earliest attempts to produce color films involved hand-painting the negative or tinting it with dye. Stencil-based techniques such as Pathéchrome and the Handschiegl color process were an extension of this. Several dyes were rolled over the negative, each with an appropriate stencil underneath to restrict the dye to the desired parts of the print. Since transparent dye preserved the varying brightness of the black and white image, the result could look rather naturalistic, but in fact the choice of what colors to use and where was made by a person. Kinemacolor was the first process to capture natural color on film stock.

==Technicolor==

Beginning in 1932, Technicolor introduced a new color process—"Process 4", with one negative for each primary color and a "matrix" to improve contrast. This became the standard for the major Hollywood studios.
Constance Bennett and her husband Henri de la Falaise produced two feature-length documentaries Legong: Dance of the Virgins (1935) in Bali, and Kliou the Killer Tiger (1936) in Indochina, both in the two-color Technicolor process. However, only Legong survives in color.
