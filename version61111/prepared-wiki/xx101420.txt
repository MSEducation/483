[[Hebesphenomegacorona]]

CATEGORIES: Johnson solids

In geometry, the hebesphenomegacorona is one of the
Johnson solids (J89).
It is one of the elementary Johnson solids that do not arise from "cut and paste" manipulations of the Platonic and Archimedean solids.  It has 21 faces, 18 triangles and 3 squares, 33 edges, and 14 vertices.
The icosahedron can be obtained from the hebesphenomegacorona by merging the middle of the three squares into an edge, turning the neighboring two squares into triangles.
