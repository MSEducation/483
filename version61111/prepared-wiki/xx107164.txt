[[Oxidative coupling]]

CATEGORIES: Chemical reactions

Oxidative coupling in chemistry is a coupling reaction of two molecular entities through an oxidative process, usually catalysed by a transition metal compound and involving dioxygen as the oxidant.IUPAC. Compendium of Chemical Terminology, 2nd ed. (the "Gold Book"). Compiled by A. D. McNaught and A. Wilkinson. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford (1997). [tpl]doi|10.1351/goldbook[/tpl]. A relevant aliphatic coupling reaction is the oxidative coupling of methane.

==Oxidative aromatic coupling==

In oxidative aromatic coupling the reactants are electron-rich aromatic compounds or entities and the catalyst is an oxidizing agent.Grzybowski, M., Skonieczny, K., Butenschön, H. and Gryko, D. T. (2013), Comparison of Oxidative Aromatic Coupling and the Scholl Reaction. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., 52: 9900–9930. [tpl]doi|10.1002/anie.201210238[/tpl] The first reported synthetic application dates back to 1868 with Julius Löwe and the synthesis of ellagic acid by heating gallic acid with arsenic acid or silver oxide.Löwe, Zeitschrift für Chemie, 1868, 4, 603 A notable reaction is the synthesis of racemic 1,1'-Bi-2-naphthol from 2-naphthol and iron chloride in 1873 by Alexander Dianin A. P. Dianin, Zh. Russ. Fiz.-Khim. O-va. 1874 , 183
