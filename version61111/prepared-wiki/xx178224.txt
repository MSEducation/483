Lying almost in the middle of the south/west international traffic English-side channel of the English Channel, the Varne Bank is a constant concern for both British coastguards and shipping.Cargo ship rescued by high tide BBC News - 27 April 2006MV Lowlands Maine Maritime - 26 April 2006Container Vessel "LT Cortesia" aground in Dover Strait Maritime & Coastguard Agency - January 02, 2008 Due to its heightened risk, there is still a Trinity House automatic lightvessel placed on the Varne Bank.Varne Light ship 
Ships that founder on the Varne Bank are often stated as being lost on the Goodwin Sands in error, perhaps because the Varne Bank is less well known than its close northerly neighbour. Due to the volume increase in shipping through the world's busiest channel, several proposals have been made to eliminate the Varne Bank through dredging.Commodore David Squire - The Hazards of Navigating The Dover Strait (Pas-de-Calais) Traffic Separation Scheme - Cambridge Journal, 2003 However, also due to its shallow depth, the Varne Bank is a productive location for fishing, especially for cod and scallops.Folkestone Harbour thisisfolkestone.co.uk
In 1802, mining engineer Albert Mathieu made proposals to Napoleon, for turning the Varne Bank into an island staging point for the Channel Tunnel. In the 20th century, a proposal was made for a Channel bridge, which would have used the Varne Bank as a staging post for a support structure.AR Flint - Paper: The Proposed Bridge over the English Channel Structural Engineer magazine
Several naval battles have been fought nearby, including the Battle of Goodwin Sands in 1652 and the Battle of Dover Strait in 1917.History of Folkestone Harbour and Cross Channel Links
Varne Marine, now dissolved, was a UK yacht builder named with reference to the Varne Bank. The company produced the Varne 27 and other models, for which an owners' clubVarne Yachts Owners' Club exists. The club magazine is called 'LightShip' after the Varne Lightship which marks the hazard to shipping. There is a fish and chip shop named after the bank on Romney Marsh.
