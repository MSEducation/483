==Design and development==

The Tempest is a development of the Advanced Aeromarine Sierra and was designed to be towed aloft behind an ultralight aircraft.
The aircraft's [tpl]convert|42|ft|m|1|abbr=on[/tpl] span wing is made from aluminium tubing covered in Dacron and is supported by a single lift strut on each side, plus a jury strut. The fuselage is made from fiberglass and features a canopy that is hinged on one side for cockpit access. The cockpit is [tpl]convert|22|in|cm|0|abbr=on[/tpl] wide. The landing gear is either a monowheel gear or, optionally, bicycle gear.
Although very light, with a standard empty weight of [tpl]convert|200|lb|kg|0|abbr=on[/tpl], the Tempest does not qualify under the US FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles regulations as a hang glider, neither is it foot-launchable. When it was available the aircraft was supplied as a kit, that required an estimated 200 hours to complete, or as a complete ready-to-fly aircraft. In 1998 the kit was US$10,000 and the complete aircraft was US$12,500. Twelve were reported as flying by the end of 2001.
