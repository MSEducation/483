Seton-La Salle Catholic High School was formed in 1979 by the merger of the all-boys South Hills Catholic High School, served by the Christian Brothers, and the all-girls Elizabeth Seton High School, founded by the Sisters of Charity of Seton Hill. As the largest coeducational high school in the Diocese of Pittsburgh, Seton-La Salle serves the parishes of Pittsburgh’s South Hills and surrounding suburbs. Initially, the school was staffed by Christian Brothers, Sister of Charity, and lay faculty from both original schools. The Sisters of Charity still maintain the important presence of a religious community within the school.

As we strive for truth and honor . . .
Hail the Green and Gold.
