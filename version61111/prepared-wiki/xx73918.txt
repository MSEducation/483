==History==

The  Atlanta Baptist Female Seminary was established on [tpl]Start date|1881|04|11[/tpl] in the basement of Friendship Baptist Church in Atlanta, Georgia, by two teachers from the Oread Institute of Worcester, Massachusetts: Harriet E. Giles and Sophia B. Packard.  Giles and Packard had met while Giles was a student, and Packard the preceptress, of the New Salem Academy in New Salem, Massachusetts, and fostered a lifelong friendship there.Lefever, Harry G. (2005). The Early Origins of Spelman College.  The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education, No. 47, pp. 60-63  The two of them traveled to Atlanta specifically to found a school for black freedwomen, and found support from Frank Quarles, the pastor of Friendship Baptist Church.
Giles and Packard began the school with 11 African-American women and $100 given to them by the First Baptist Church in Medford, Massachusetts., and a promise of further support from the Women's American Baptist Home Missionary Society (WABHMS), a group with which they were both affiliated in Boston.  Although their first students were mostly illiterate, they envisioned their school to be a liberal arts institution - the first circular of the college stated that they planned to offer "algebra, physiology, essays, Latin, rhetoric, geometry, political economy, mental philosophy (psychology), chemistry, botany, Constitution  of  the United  States, astronomy, zoology, geology, moral philosophy, and evidences  of Christianity".  Over time, they attracted more students; by the time the first term ended, they had enrolled 80 students in the seminary.  The WABHMS made a down payment on a nine-acre (36,000 m²) site in Atlanta relatively close to the church they began in, which originally had five buildings left from a Union Civil War encampment, to support classroom and residence hall needs.http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/437886/Sophia-B-Packard?anchor=ref669898
In 1882 the two women returned to Massachusetts to bid for more money and were introduced to wealthy Northern Baptist businessman John D. Rockefeller at a church conference in Ohio.  Rockefeller was impressed by Packard's vision.  In April 1884, Rockefeller visited the school.  By this time, the seminary had 600 students and 16 faculty members.  It was surviving on generous donations by the black community in Atlanta, the efforts of volunteer teachers, and gifts of supplies; many Atlanta black churches, philanthropists, and black community groups raised and donated money to settle the debt on the property that had been acquired. Rockefeller was so impressed that he settled the debt on the property.  Rockefeller's wife, Laura Spelman Rockefeller; her sister, Lucy Spelman; and their parents, Harvey Buel and Lucy Henry Spelman, were also supportive of the school.  The Spelmans were longtime activists in the abolitionist movement.  Thus, in 1884 the name of the school was changed to the Spelman Seminary in honor of Laura Spelman, John D. Rockefeller's wife, and her parents, who were longtime activists in the anti-slavery movement.  Rockefeller also donated the funds for what is currently the oldest building on campus, Rockefeller Hall, which was constructed in 1886.
Packard was appointed as Spelman's first president in 1888, after the charter for the seminary was granted. The first college degrees were awarded in 1901.  Packard died in 1891, and Giles assumed the presidency until her death in 1909.

===Presidents===

Since its inception Spelman has had nine presidents:
The years 1910 to 1953 saw great growth and transition for the seminary.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.spelman.edu/academics/catalog/catalog2007/collegehistory.html|title=College History|accessdate=2008-07-02[/tpl]  Upon Giles' death, Lucy Hale Tapley became president.  Although the college was a stride in and of itself, at the time, neither the founders nor the current administration had interest in challenging the status quo of young women as primarily responsible for the family and the home.  Tapley declared: "Any course of study which fails to cultivate a taste and fitness for practical and efficient work in some part of the field of the world's needs is unpopular at Spelman and finds no place in our curriculum."  The nursing curriculum was strengthened; a teachers' dormitory and a home economics building were constructed, and Tapley Hall, the science building, was completed in 1925.  The Granddaughters' Club, a club for students whose mothers and aunts had attended Spelman was also created, and this club is still in existence today.
In 1927, Spelman Seminary officially became Spelman College.  Florence Matilda Read assumed the presidency in 1927.  Shortly thereafter, Spelman entered into an "agreement of affiliation" with nearby Morehouse College and Atlanta University by chartering the Atlanta University Center in 1929.http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-1460  Atlanta University was to provide graduate education for students, whereas Morehouse and Spelman were responsible for the undergraduate education.  At a time during which black students were often denied access to graduate student at predominant white southern research universities, access to Atlanta University allowed the undergraduate students at Morehouse and Spelman immediate access to graduate training.

In 1927, one of the most important buildings on campus, Sisters Chapel, was dedicated.  The chapel was named for its primary benefactors, sisters Laura Spelman Rockefeller and Lucy Maria Spelman.  The college also began to see an improvement in extracurricular investment in the arts, with the organization of the Spelman College Glee Club, inauguration of the much-loved Atlanta tradition of the annual Spelman-Morehouse Christmas Carol Concert and smaller events such as the spring orchestra and chorus concert, the Atlanta University Summer Theater, and the University Players, a drama organization for AUC students.  The school also began to see more of a focus on collegiate education, as it discontinued its elementary and high school divisions.  In 1930 the Spelman Nursery School as created as a training center for mothers and a practice arena for students who planned careers in education and child development. Spelman celebrated its 50th anniversary in April 1931. This milestone as accompanied by the construction of a university library that was shared amongst the Atlanta University Center institutions, and the center continues to share a library to this day.
The school continued to expand, building and acquiring more property to accommodate the growing student body.  IN 1947, Spelman joined the list of "approved institutions" of the Association of American Universities.http://www.spelman.edu/about-us/about-spelman/history-in-brief  In 1953, Florence Read retired, and Albert E. Manley became the first black and first male president of college.  Under his presidency and the presidency of his successor, Donald Stewart, Spelman saw significant growth.  The college established its study abroad program, the Merrill Foreign Travel-Study Program.  Stewart's administration tripled the college's endowment and oversaw the establishment of the Comprehensive Writing Program, an across-the-curriculum writing program that requires students to submit portfolios of their written work; the Ethel Waddell Githii College Honors Program; and the Women's Research and Resource Center.  In 1958, the college received accreditation from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.
At this time, the Spelman College students became involved in the heated civil rights actions going on in Atlanta.  In 1962, the first Spelman students were arrested for participating in sit-ins in the Atlanta community.  Noted American historian Howard Zinn was a professor of history at Spelman during this era, and served as an adviser to the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee chapter at the college.  Zinn mentored many of Spelman's students fighting for civil rights at the time, including Alice Walker and Marian Wright EdelmanAlice Walker remembers Howard Zinn. January 31, 2010 in the Boston Globe.  Zinn was dismissed from the college in 1963 for supporting Spelman students in their efforts to fight segregation; at the time, Spelman was focused on turning out "refined young ladies."  Edelman herself writes that Spelman had a reputation as "a tea-pouring, very strict school designed to turn black girls into refined ladies and teachers."Edelman, Marian Wright (2000). Spelman College: A Safe Haven for a Young Black Woman. The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education, No. 27, pp. 118-123.
Stewart retired in 1986, and the following year, Johnnetta Betsch Cole became the first black female president of Spelman College.  During this time, the college became noted for its commitment to community service and its ties to the local community.  Cole also led the college's most successful capital campaign; between 1986 and 1996, the college raised $113.8 million, including a $20 million gift from Bill Cosby and his wife, Camille Hanks Cosby, whose daughter attended Spelman.  In honor of this gift, the Cosby Academic Center was constructed.
In 1997, Cole stepped down and Audrey Forbes Manley became Spelman's first alumna president.  After her retirement, in 2002, Beverly Daniel Tatum, the college's current president, took the post. The campus now comprises 26 buildings on [tpl]convert|39|acre|m2[/tpl] in Atlanta.
