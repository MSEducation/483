On the French Riviera, Cécile is a decadent young girl who lives with her rich playboy father, Raymond. Anne, a mature and cultured friend of Raymond's late wife, arrives at Raymond's villa for a visit. Cécile is afraid that Anne will disrupt the undisciplined way of life that Cécile and her father have shared.
Despite his promises of fidelity to Anne, Raymond cannot give up his playboy life. Helped by Elsa, Raymond's young and flighty mistress, Cécile does her best to break up the relationship with Anne. The combination of the daughter's disdain and the father's rakishness drives Anne to a tragic end.Bonjour Tristesse (1957) – Trailers, Reviews, Synopsis, Showtimes and Cast. Allmovie.

==Critical reception==

The film met with a lukewarm critical reception at the time. The BFI's Monthly Film Bulletin:Monthly Film Bulletin, British Film Institute, No. 292. Vol. 25. May 1958. Page 55. "The best performance is David Niven’s; he gives his part a pathetic touch that the writing never attains. Jean Seberg, who speaks rather than acts her lines, turns in the least effective performance. Bonjour Tristesse is an elegant, ice cold, charade of emotions, completely artificial and eventually torpid." Others enjoyed it rather more and it had some unexpected friends. François Truffaut described Seberg as “The best actress in Europe’. Jean-Luc Godard said "The character played by Jean Seberg Breathless was a continuation of her role in Bonjour Tristesse, I could have taken the last shot of Preminger's film and started after dissolving to a title: "Three years later". A Guardian piece [tpl]cite news | title=Bonjour Tristesse: a golden-age masterpiece ripe for rediscovery | work=The Guardian | date=2012-10-10 | accessdate=9 November 2013 | author=Tony Paley[/tpl] in 2012 described it as “an example of Hollywood's golden age, and both its star and its famously tyrannical director are ripe for rediscovery.”
