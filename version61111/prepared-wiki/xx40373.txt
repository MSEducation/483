International draughts (also called Polish draughts or international checkers) is a strategy board game for two players, one of the variants of draughts. It is played on a 10×10 board with alternatingly dark and light squares, of which only the 50 dark squares are used. The two players are at opposite sides, with 20 pieces each, light for one player and dark for the other.  In conventional diagrams the board is displayed with the light pieces at the bottom and dark at the top and in this orientation the lower-left corner square must be dark.
The World Draughts Federation maintains a ranking.http://www.fmjd.org/rat.php [tpl]As of|2014|01[/tpl] the men's list is headed by Alexander Georgiev from Russia, and the women's list is headed by Zoja Golubeva from Latvia.

==Rules==

The general rule is that all moves and captures are made diagonally. All references to squares refer to the dark squares only. The main differences from English draughts are: the size of the board (10×10), pieces can also capture backward (not only forward), the long-range moving and capturing capability of kings, and the requirement that the maximum number of men be captured whenever a player has capturing options.
