==League history==

The TAAC began in 1988 when long-time rivals Danbury, Emmanuel Christian (then known as Emmanuel Baptist), Maumee Valley, and Ottawa Hills joined together with the recently expanded Toledo Christian (formerly McAuley High School) to compete in basketball.  When Cardinal Strich joined in 1995 after going without sports for a while, the league teamed with the Buckeye Border Conference to create the 12-team Toledo Buckeye League, which involved cross-over games with both leagues' members.Brighter day soon may dawn in Stritch sports. Toledo Blade Dec 8, 1994  This setup only lasted until June 1998, but both leagues continue to have members compete against each other.As noted on a banner in Cardinal Stritch High School's gymnasium
The first season for TAAC football was in 1999 with Cardinal Stritch, Danbury, Ottawa Hills, Toledo Christian and the recently added football-only Lorain Catholic competing for the inaugural title.1999 HS Football Schedules. Toledo Blade Aug 26, 1999
In 2000, Northwood left the Suburban Lakes League for the TAAC, wanting to compete with schools closer to their size.Stritch remains top team to beat. Toledo Blade Aug 23, 2000  They initially joined in all sports but football, but fully joined the league the next year.  
The TAAC lost its only member to date when Lorain Catholic closed at the end of the 2003-04 school year.http://www.wkyc.com/news/article/19506/2/Lorain-Catholic-High-School-closes-its-doors-
Tired of competing in the South Central Athletic Association that was composed of several Michigan schools, Edon and Hilltop left to compete as football-only members in the TAAC in 2005.  Former ties created in the old TBL made for the easy transition.
Emmanuel Baptist changed its name to Emmanuel Christian in the spring of 2006.http://www.ecstoledo.org/who
In September 2009, Gibsonburg applied for membership when it became evident that the Suburban Lakes League was going to fold in the spring of 2011.  On October 7, they were admitted as the 8th full member school in the league, after being complimented for their facilities and comparable enrollment to current members.  They became a full-voting member on January 1, 2010 and joined the league for the 2011-12 school year.Gibsonburg becomes eighth member of TAAC. Toledo Blade Oct 7, 2009
Former commissioner Dick Nowak noted that although the league was set with members, their five-year plan involved adding two more members and possibly going to a two-division format.  He would not indicate which schools are interested in TAAC membership at the time.  Rick Kaifas became the new TAAC commissioner on April 6, 2011.
In July 2012, Lakota High School and Fremont St. Joseph CC both sent letters of inquiry about joining the TAAC, concerned that the Midland Athletic League would dissolve after losing many members to other new leagues.http://www.thecourier.com/Issues/2012/Jul/25/ar_sports_072512_story4.asp?d=072512_story4,2012,Jul,25&c=s
