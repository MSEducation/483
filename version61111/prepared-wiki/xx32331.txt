Coral reefs are underwater structures made from calcium carbonate secreted by corals. Coral reefs are colonies of tiny  animals found in marine waters that contain few nutrients. Most coral reefs are built from stony corals, which in turn consist of polyps that cluster in groups. The polyps belong to a group of animals known as Cnidaria, which also includes sea anemones and jellyfish. Unlike sea anemones, coral polyps secrete hard carbonate exoskeletons which support and protect their bodies. Reefs grow best in warm, shallow, clear, sunny and agitated waters.
Often called "rainforests of the sea", coral reefs form some of the most diverse ecosystems on Earth. They occupy less than 0.1% of the world's ocean surface, about half the area of France, yet they provide a home for 25% of all marine species,[tpl]cite journal| author=Spalding MD and Grenfell AM |doi=10.1007/s003380050078| title=New estimates of global and regional coral reef areas| year=1997| journal=Coral Reefs| volume=16| issue=4| page=225[/tpl]Mulhall M (Spring 2009) Saving rainforests of the sea: An analysis of international efforts to conserve coral reefs Duke Environmental Law and Policy Forum 19:321–351. including fish, mollusks, worms, crustaceans, echinoderms, sponges, tunicates and other cnidarians.[tpl]cite book |title=Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i's Sea Creatures |last=Hoover |first=John |isbn=1-56647-220-2 |publisher=Mutual |date=November 2007[/tpl] Paradoxically, coral reefs flourish even though they are surrounded by ocean waters that provide few nutrients. They are most commonly found at shallow depths in tropical waters, but deep water and cold water corals also exist on smaller scales in other areas.
Coral reefs deliver ecosystem services to tourism, fisheries and shoreline protection. The annual global economic value of coral reefs is estimated between US$ 29.8-375 billion. However, coral reefs are fragile ecosystems, partly because they are very sensitive to water temperature. They are under threat from climate change, oceanic acidification, blast fishing, cyanide fishing for aquarium fish, overuse of reef resources, and harmful land-use practices, including urban and agricultural runoff and water pollution, which can harm reefs by encouraging excess algal growth.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.uq.edu.au/news/?article=12183 | title= Corals reveal impact of land use | accessdate = September 21, 2013 | publisher=ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.hcri.ssri.hawaii.edu/files/media/pr-water_quality.pdf |title=Urban runoff and coastal water quality being researched for effects on coral reefs |first=Charissa |last=Minato |date=July 1, 2002 |accessdate=December 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://water.epa.gov/type/oceb/fact4.cfm |title=Coastal Watershed Factsheets – Coral Reefs and Your Coastal Watershed |publisher=Environmental Protection Agency Office of Water |date=July 1998 |accessdate=December 2010[/tpl]

==Formation==

Most of the coral reefs we can see today were formed after the last glacial period when melting ice caused the sea level to rise and flood the continental shelves. This means that most modern coral reefs are less than 10,000 years old. As communities established themselves on the shelves, the reefs grew upwards, pacing rising sea levels. Reefs that rose too slowly could become drowned reefs. They are covered by so much water that there was insufficient light.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Coral_reef#Types_of_Coral_Reefs |title=Coral reef |work=The Encyclopedia of Earth |date= September 21, 2010 |first=Joanie |last=Kleypas |accessdate=April 4, 2011[/tpl] Coral reefs are found in the deep sea away from continental shelves, around oceanic islands and as atolls. The vast majority of these islands are volcanic in origin. The few exceptions have tectonic origins where plate movements have lifted the deep ocean floor on the surface.
