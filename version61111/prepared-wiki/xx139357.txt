Colleen et les Boîtes à Musique is a 14-track EP by French electronica artist Colleen (real name Cécile Schott) released on October 2, 2006. It was recorded between 2004 and January 2006 for the atelier de création radiophonique of France Culture, a national radio station, to be played back in a special broadcast. Schott was pleased with the results and soon decided to also release the recordings as an EP. This EP became her second release of 2006, acting as successor to the Mort Aux Vaches live album released in January.
Thirteen of the fourteen tracks were made entirely using music boxes, accounting for the EP's name which translates into English as "Colleen and the Music Boxes". The exception was track 14, "I'll Read You a Story", which also included classical guitar and could be found on the 2005 album The Golden Morning Breaks. The enhanced CD also included a video for this track.
