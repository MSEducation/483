==Club career==

Bentos started out his career with Guaraní Antonio Franco in his native town of Corrientes. In 1999, he was  part of Puente Seco de Corrientes title winning team. Due to his success with the club, he moved on to play with Deportivo Morón. In 2001, he moved to El Salvador to play with one of the countries biggest clubs, C.D. FAS. During his time with the Santa Ana club, he would go on to play an integral part in the club winning the league title 5 times from 2002 to 2005. He became a very consistent player and was named one of El Salvador's Most Valuable Players. Due to this, he received interest to play for various clubs outside of El Salvador, and in 2005, he was loaned to Puebla F.C. of Mexico. During his time at Puebla F.C., he was part of the team that won the Primera A title. Personally though, Bentos saw little game time, and as a result, he soon returned to C.D. FAS. He continued to play there until December 2008 when he was released from the club due to poor performances and demanding to high a wage. On December 19, he signed a six-month contract with Nejapa F.C.. For the Apertura 2009, he returned to FAS.
In 2011, bentos reached 300 games playing in the primera division.http://www.elgrafico.com/destacado-portada/36-destacadas/11898-alejandro-bentos-tricentenario.html
