==History==

Carthage College was founded by Lutheran pioneers in education in 1847 in Hillsboro, Illinois as The Literary and Theological Institute of the Lutheran Church in the Far West. The name was soon shortened to Hillsboro College. With a two-person faculty and 79 students, Hillsboro promised “a course of study designed to be thorough and practical, and to embrace all the branches of learning, usually pursued in the best academies and colleges.” In 1852 the college moved to Springfield, Illinois and operated under the name Illinois State University. Enrollment dwindled during the Civil War, and in 1870 the college moved again, this time to the rural, west-central city of Carthage, Illinois, where the college acquired its current name. By 1916, the college gained accreditation from the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools and received the association's highest rating of "A" — one of only four colleges in Illinois to gain this honor. The Great Depression and World War II lowered enrollment to 131 students in 1943. Ten years later, the Board of Trustees agreed to consider relocating Carthage once again. By 1962, Carthage had established its lakeshore campus in Kenosha, Wisconsin, and the college launched an era of growth. The next decade brought a period of continuous expansion. Enrollment increased fivefold, endowment tripled, and physical assets increased 600 percent. In Fall 1995, Carthage enrolled 1,527 full-time students, setting a new record. Intensive national searches have built a teaching-oriented faculty holding Ph.D.s from major graduate programs across the country. In the past decade alone, the College has invested more than $130 million in new construction, major renovations and technological acquisition.

==Expansion==

During the 2000s, a new library (Hedberg Library) and athletic center (Tarble Athletic and Recreation Center) opened, the old library was turned into the A. W. Clausen Center for World Business, and the former Physical Education Center was rebuilt and renamed the Tarble Arena. The Oaks, the new student village overlooking Lake Michigan, contains six villas with semi-private suites and a media lounge on each floor.
In Fall 2011, a new student union opened on the site of the former W. F. Seidemann Natatorium. It has a new press box, new bleachers, a new and larger bookstore, new dining options, a campus "living room", a new dining room, a 200-seat theatre, an art gallery, and a gaming area. In April 2012 the student center was formally dedicated and named the Campbell Student Union in honor of retiring President F. Gregory Campbell and his wife, Barbara, for their 25 years of service to Carthage. President Campbell retired in August 2012.

===Controversies===

In 2005, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) ruled that Carthage, along with several other colleges, would be ineligible to host NCAA-sanctioned playoffs and tournaments because their nickname, "Redmen", was perceived as an offensive reference to Native Americans. A decision was made to rename the Carthage men's teams the "Red Men". This is in accordance with the circa 1920 origin of the name—the team's red uniform jersey—while removing any possible controversial connotations. In conjunction with the rearticulation of the name, a new logo for the team replaced the traditional feathered Carthage C. It includes a torch, a shield, and a C.

===Conference affiliation===

Carthage College was a member of the Illinois Intercollegiate Athletic Conference from 1912 to 1941. After competing as an independent for five years, the school became a founding member of the College Conference of Illinois, now known as the College Conference of Illinois and Wisconsin, in 1946, a membership it has maintained to this time.

==Presidents==

Carthage has had 22 presidents since its founding.
