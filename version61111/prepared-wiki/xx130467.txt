[[Mosaic novel]]

CATEGORIES: Novel forms, Collaborative fiction

A mosaic novel is a novel in which individual chapters or short stories share a common setting or set of characters with the aim of telling a linear story from beginning to end, with the individual chapters, however, refracting a plurality of viewpoints and styles.
Examples include the Wild Cards series begun by George R. R. Martin and the Thieves World series of Robert Lynn Asprin and others. Thieves World overtly used and may have coined the term "mosaic novel" for this practice of sharing a world and vision amongst several authors.
