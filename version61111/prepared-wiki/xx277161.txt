The Secret River is a play by Andrew Bovell, based upon the novel of the same name by Kate Grenville. Narrated by Dhirrumbin (played by Ursula Yovich), the drama is about a man who is exiled from London in the  eighteenth century, and is sent with his family to a penal colony in the Hawkesbury River, New South Wales, where he hopes to make a new start, but its inhabitants, the indigenous Dahrug people, are not willing to give up their land. Produced by the Sydney Theatre Company, the drama was first performed on 8 January 2013 at the Sydney Theatre.
