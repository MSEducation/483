==History==

Cedar Point opened in 1870 as a recreational area. The park was developed over the years going through only a few managements. The park belonged to the Cedar Point Pleasure Company. In 1974, Cedar Point Pleasure Company proposed building an amusement park in Cambridge Township, Michigan on the former Frontier City amusement park site. Those plans were abandoned in 1975.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lenconnect.com/news/x1602164858/Cedar-Point-sells-Cambridge-Township-property|title=Ceder Point sells Cambridge Township property|accessdate=30 August 2010[/tpl] Three years later, Cedar Point acquired Valleyfair. The name Cedar Fair then was derived from the names of both parks, "Cedar" coming from Cedar Point and "Fair" coming from Valleyfair.  Cedar Fair was founded in 1983 then went public on April 29, 1987.[tpl]cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/1050/81153294000011/filing-main.htm |title=Cedar Fair, Form 10-K, Annual Report, Filing Date Mar 23, 1994 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =Mar 21, 2013[/tpl]

The first acquisition of the new Cedar Fair company came in 1992 when Cedar Fair bought Dorney Park from Harris Weinstein. Cedar Fair also bought Worlds of Fun from Hunt-Midwest in 1995.[tpl]cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/2395/81153295000023/filing-main.htm |title=Cedar Fair, Form 10-Q, Quarterly Report, Filing Date Aug 9, 1995 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =Mar 21, 2013[/tpl] One of the biggest acquisitions came in 1997 when Cedar Fair bought Knott's Berry Farm from the Knott family.[tpl]cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/375/81153298000002/filing-main.htm |title=Cedar Fair, Form 8-K, Current Report, Filing Date Jan 13, 1998 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =Mar 21, 2013[/tpl] This marked the first time Cedar Fair operated a year-round amusement park. Several new water park properties named Knott's Soak City have opened around the southern California area since the acquisition which included Buena Park in 1999, Chula Vista in 2000 and Palm Springs in 2001.[tpl]cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/2199/81153201500004/filing-main.htm |title=Cedar Fair, Form 10-K, Annual Report, Filing Date Mar 30, 2001 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =Mar 21, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://pdf.secdatabase.com/1364/0000811532-02-000002.pdf |title=Cedar Fair, Form 10-K, Annual Report, Filing Date Apr 1, 2002 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =Mar 21, 2013[/tpl] Michigan's Adventure in Muskegon, Michigan and was purchased for $27.6 million in 2001.[tpl]cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/2210/81153201500015/filing-main.htm |title=Cedar Fair, Form 10-Q, Quarterly Report, Filing Date Nov 14, 2001 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =Mar 21, 2013[/tpl]
Cedar Fair opened their first indoor water park in November 2004, Castaway Bay. It replaced the former Radisson Hotel and is open year-round.[tpl]cite web|url=http://pdf.secdatabase.com/1797/0000950152-04-005364.pdf |title=Cedar Fair, Form 424B2, Filing Date Jul 15, 2004 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =Mar 21, 2013[/tpl]
The biggest acquisitions have come recently starting in 2004 with Six Flags World of Adventure. Cedar Fair bought the park for $145 million and reverted its name back to Geauga Lake, the name the park used until its conversion by Six Flags in 2000.[tpl]cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/1053/81153204000024/filing-main.htm |title=Cedar Fair, Form 8-K, Current Report, Filing Date Apr 23, 2004 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =Mar 21, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Potter|first=Derek|title=Cedar Fair Buys Six Flags World of Adventure|publisher=Theme Park Insider|date=2004-03-10|url=http://www.themeparkinsider.com/news/response.cfm?ID=1564|accessdate=2007-12-20[/tpl]  However with it being so close to Cedar Point, the park started losing attendance and various rides, leading to rumors of the park closing. On September 21, 2007, it was announced that Geauga Lake would close and only the connected water park would operate as Geauga Lake's Wildwater Kingdom.[tpl]cite web|url=http://pdf.secdatabase.com/1922/0001193125-07-207821.pdf |title=Cedar Fair, Form 8-K, Current Report, Filing Date Sep 26, 2007 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =Mar 21, 2013[/tpl] Most of the rides at Geauga Lake, were sent to other Cedar Fair parks to operate. In 2011, the water parks name was shortened to just Wildwater Kingdom, removing the Geauga Lake prefix.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wkyc.com/news/article/198311/3/Aurora-Wildwater-Kingdom-nixes-Geauga-Lake-name|title=Aurora Wildwater Kingdom nixes Geauga Lake name|publisher=wkyc news|accessdate=30 August 2012[/tpl]
On May 22, 2006, Cedar Fair announced they had outbid competitors and intended to purchase all five parks in the Paramount Parks chain, including Star Trek: The Experience at the Las Vegas Hilton and the management agreement of Bonfante Gardens. On June 30, 2006, Cedar Fair announced that it had completed its acquisition of Paramount Parks from CBS Corporation in a cash transaction valued at $1.24 billion USD.[tpl]cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/757/81153206000061/filing-main.htm |title=Cedar Fair, Form 8-K, Current Report, Filing Date Jul 7, 2006 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =Mar 21, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Cedar Fair to Acquire Paramount Parks|publisher=The Point Online|date=2006-05-22|url=http://www.thepointol.com/news/2006/76.html|accessdate=2007-12-20 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070814210552/http://www.thepointol.com/news/2006/76.html  |archivedate = 2007-08-14[/tpl] Shortly following the transfer of ownership, Cedar Fair began the process of integrating the two companies by eliminating the Paramount Parks corporate office in Charlotte, North Carolina and transferring all decision-making to Cedar Fair's offices in Sandusky, Ohio. With the purchase of the Paramount Parks, Cedar Fair changed its name to Cedar Fair Entertainment Company.[tpl]cite web|title=Cedar Fair to call self entertainment company|url=http://www.toledoblade.com/Economy/2006/10/25/Cedar-Fair-to-call-self-entertainment-company.html|publisher=Toledo Blade|accessdate=October 9, 2022|date=October 25, 2006[/tpl]
The individual parks continued to operate under their Paramount names during the 2006 season, however Cedar Fair began removing the Paramount name and logo from the parks in January 2007. The names of the parks were changed back to their original pre-Paramount names (the Paramount's prefix was removed) with the Cedar Fair corporate logo added. They also changed Bonfante Gardens to Gilroy Gardens. Cedar Fair began removing references to Paramount Pictures since they did not have the licenses to use them. All these changes were made before the beginning of the 2007 season.
