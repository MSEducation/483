==Unique burgers==

===MOS Rice Burger===

The MOS Rice Burger uses a bun made of rice mixed with barley and millet.
Rice was first used as a bun in 1987, when the restaurant served the Tsukune Rice Burger, filled with ground chicken and daikon, and seasoned with soy sauce. The Tsukune Rice Burger is no longer on the menu in Japan.
The MOS Rice Burgers currently include the 'kaisen kakiage rice burger' ('fresh seafood shrimp fritter rice burger'), the 'kinpira rice burger' ('fried burdock and carrot rice burger'), and the 'buta shōga yaki rice burger' ('grilled pork and ginger rice burger'). There used to be a 'yakiniku rice burger' ('grilled strips of beef rice burger') (available in Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and Brisbane Australia branches).
The MOS Rice Burger has been imitated by the Taiwanese division of McDonalds,Taipei Times where the rice bun was pan-seared, but it remains a MOS-exclusive item in Japan and other markets.

===Takumi Burger===

In 2003, MOS Burger introduced an ultra-premium Takumi Burger (meaning artisan taste) series, which was expanded further in 2004.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.zoominfo.com/CachedPage/?archive_id=0&page_id=470611498&page_url=//www.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/getarticle.pl5?nb20030724a4.htm&page_last_updated=2003-07-23T14:56:58 | title=Mos to woo consumers with higher prices | publisher=The Japan Times (English version, cached) | date=July 24, 2003 | accessdate=March 29, 2013 | author=Uranaka, Taiga[/tpl] The 'Nippon's Burger Takumi' hamburger was made with Tasmanian beef and ten toppings, including sliced avocado, grated wasabi, and other gourmet, seasonal ingredients. It was available for a limited time and cost 1,000 yen (9.14 euros or 11.72 USD), making it one of the most expensive burgers offered by a fast-food chain. The 'Nippon's Burger Takumi Lettuce' was added in 2004, with lettuce instead of buns to sandwich the hamburger.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.mos.co.jp/company/ir/library/business_report/pdf/BR2004-1.pdf | title=Mos Food Services - Interview with the CEO | publisher=Mos Food Services | date=May 1, 2004 | accessdate=March 29, 2013[/tpl]
