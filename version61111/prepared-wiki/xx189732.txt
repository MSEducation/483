==Early life==

Fujii was born in Kawasaki City, Japan to a father of Japanese and European American descent and a Japanese mother. Fujii has a younger brother, Arthur. As a high school student, Fujii traveled to Switzerland to study English following bullying by her Japanese classmates who would make comments such as "You're a fat one foreigner but you don't speak English". In Switzerland, she was also subject to bullying and racism, particularly from one female classmate, who would make racist comments.
When Fujii initially entered into her management company, her debut coincided with two other new models and Fujii recalls getting the least attention. In recent years, she became a renowned model in Japan, and is arguably one of the best known Japanese models both in and outside of Japan.
