==Background==

Once More is the first new recording by Spandau Ballet since 1989. Eleven of the thirteen tracks are re-recordings of previously recorded songs by the group. The first and the last track on the album, "Once More" and "Love is All" are new songs written during the band's reunion. The title track is written by Gary Kemp and Steve Norman, while "Love is All" is the first Spandau Ballet song written by Tony Hadley.[tpl]cite web |url=http://musicnews.virgin.com/Spandau-Ballet-to-Release-New-Album-Once-More-310125223737.html |title=Spandau Ballet to Release New Album Once More |publisher=musicnews.virgin.com[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=September 2011[/tpl] The album is produced by Danton Supple, who co-produced Coldplay's X&Y album.
Singer Tony Hadley said about the new recordings: "When we got back together and the tour dates went on sale, none of us could believe the fantastic reaction we got from fans and the press alike. When the opportunity came to get into a studio and play music together, we couldn't pass it up." Gary Kemp said about the title track that "the new song was a way for us to show that Spandau Ballet are back, not just to play the hits on tour but also to take on our contemporaries in the pop charts!"
The re-recordings of the eleven older songs are made in a semi-acoustic, unplugged-like style, which gives their songs a 21st-century flavour, according to sax player Steve Norman, taking them to some "very dark, different place".[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/oct/04/spandau-ballet-new-romantics |title=Spandau Ballet, the Blitz kids and the birth of the New Romantics |first=David |last=Johnson |date=4 October 2009 |newspaper=The Observer |location=London |publisher=Guardian Media Group |issn=0029-7712 |oclc=50230244 |accessdate=2011-09-18[/tpl] According to Gary Kemp the sound of the album is not only the sound of Spandau Ballet reinvented for the 21st century, but also "how we would have made these songs the first time around if we had the maturity and know-how to achieve it".
