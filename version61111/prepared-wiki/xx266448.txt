Kasma Babcock (born 1950 in Thailand) is a Thai-American cooking teacher, author, and tour guide.

==Biography==

Born Kasma Loha-unchit, she grew up helping her mother and grandmother cook for her and her three brothers and sister.  In 1968, she moved to the United States to attend college.  After completing undergraduate and masters' degrees, she worked in the corporate world for several years.  She began offering cooking classes to earn extra income, drawing on what she had learned from her mother and grandmother.  Eventually she shifted to teaching full-time, wrote two books on Thai cuisine, and started offering "food tours" to different regions of Thailand.  She is currently married to her second husband, Michael Babcock.http://thaifoodandtravel.com/bio.html

==Classes==

Babcock teaches hands on cooking classes in a private kitchen.  She offers classes at beginning, intermediate, and advanced levels, both evening and full-time week-long intensives.  Earlier classes have more demonstration and explanation, with students taking on more of the cooking duties later.  Completing earlier series is a strict prerequisite for enrolling in more advanced classes.

==Cookbooks==

Babcock writes entirely on Thai cooking.  Her first book, It Rains fishes, won the 1996 Julia Child award as Best International Cookbook for 1995.http://www.iacp.com/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&subarticlenbr=100#1996  Her second book, Dancing Shrimp, was published in 2000.

==Tours==

Each fall and winter, Babcock offers guided tours to Thailand exploring Northern, Central, and Southern Thailand "off the beaten track".  The small groups travel by van and frequently stop at small roadside stands and modest restaurants which offer the best versions of local dishes.
