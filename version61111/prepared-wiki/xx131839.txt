White Hall was the Kentucky home of Cassius Marcellus Clay. He was an anti-slavery newspaper publisher, politician, soldier and Minister to Russia through the Lincoln, Johnson and Grant administrations. He published True American for nearly 25 years. His daughter, Laura Clay, was the first woman nominated for President by the Democratic Party.
This restored 44-room Italianate mansion was built in 1798-1799 and remodeled in the 1860s. This house was restored in 1971 under the leadership of Kentucky's First Lady Beula C. Nunn, with assistance of the Kentucky Mansions Preservation Foundation.http://www.flickr.com/photos/bearsite/5501419050/ In addition to the heirloom and period furnishings, White Hall has many unique features for its day, including indoor plumbing and central heating.  http://parks.ky.gov/statehistoricsites/wh/index.htm
