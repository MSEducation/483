[[Order of precedence in England and Wales]]

CATEGORIES: Orders of precedence, England and Wales

The following is the order of precedence in England and Wales [tpl]As of|2013|06|lc=y[/tpl]. Separate orders exist for gentlemen and ladies.
Names in italics indicate that these people rank elsewhereâ€”either higher in that table of precedence or in the table for the other sex. Titles in italics indicate the same thing for their holders, or that they are vacant.
Peers and their families make up a large part of these tables. It is possible for a peer to hold more than one title of nobility, and these may belong to different ranks and peerages. A peer derives his precedence from his highest-ranking title; peeresses derive their precedence in their same way, whether they hold their highest-ranking title in their own right or by marriage. The ranks in the tables refer to peers rather than titles: if exceptions are named for a rank, these do not include peers of a higher rank (or any peers at all, in the case of baronets). No exceptions are named for most categories, due to their large size.
