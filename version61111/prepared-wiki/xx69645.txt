As of October 2007, the ward has an estimated population of 45,543 and a population density of 3,912 people per km², making it by far the least populated of the special wards. The total area is 11.64 km², of which the Imperial Palace, Hibiya Park, National Museum of Modern Art, and Yasukuni Shrine take up approximately 2.6 km², or 22% of the total area.
Chiyoda consists of the Palace and a surrounding radius of about 1 kilometer. It inherited the name, literally meaning "field of a thousand generations," from Chiyoda Castle (the other name of Edo Castle). Many government institutions, such as the Diet, Prime Minister's residence, and Supreme Court, are located in Chiyoda, as are Tokyo landmarks such as Yasukuni Shrine, Tokyo Station, and the Budokan. Fifteen embassies are located in Chiyoda.

==History==

The Chiyoda ward was created on March 15, 1947 by the unification of Kanda Ward (the northeast corner of present-day Chiyoda, west of Akihabara) and Kōjimachi Ward (comprising the rest of Chiyoda). It has been a site of a number of historical events.

==Geography==

Chiyoda is located at the very heart of former Tokyo City in eastern mainland Tokyo. The central area of the ward is furthermore occupied by the Imperial Palace. The east side of the ward, bordering Chūō, is the location of Tokyo Station. The south side, bordering Minato, encompasses Hibiya Park and the National Diet Building. It is almost exclusively occupied by administrations and agencies. The west and northwest are primarily upper class residential; the Yasukuni Shrine is also there. To the north and northeast are several residential neighborhoods and  the Akihabara commercial district.

==Politics and government==

===Local government===

Chiyoda is run by a directly elected mayor and a city assembly of 25 elected members. The current mayor is Masami Ishikawa, an independent.

===Metropolitan representation===

For the Metropolitan Assembly, Chiyoda forms a single-member electoral district. It had been represented by Liberal Democrats for 50 years until the landslide 2009 election when then 26 year old Democratic newcomer Zenkō Kurishita unseated 70 year old former Metropolitan Assembly president and six term assemblyman, Liberal Democrat Shigeru Uchida.47 News/Kyōdō Tsūshin, July 12, 2009: 自民都連幹事長が落選　要職歴任の内田茂氏 In the 2013 election, no Democrat contested the seat and Uchida won back the district against a Communist and two independents.

===National representation===

For the national House of Representatives, Chiyoda, together with Minato and Shinjuku, forms the prefecture's 1st electoral district since the electoral reform of the 1990s. The district is currently represented by Liberal Democrat Miki Yamada.
The ward is also home to the Diet of Japan, the Supreme Court of Japan and the residence of the Prime Minister of Japan and is the political nerve center of Japan.

===International representation===

==Cityscape==

On December 31, 2001, Chiyoda had 6,572 buildings which were four stories or taller.
Some of the districts in Chiyoda are actually not inhabited, either because they are parks (Hibiya Koen), because they consist only of office buildings (Otemachi or Marunouchi), and/or because they are extremely small. The area on the eastern side of Akihabara Station is the location of several districts that cover at most a few buildings. Kanda-Hanaokachō is, for example, limited to the Yodobashi Camera department store.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl] Understanding the address system in the Kanda area can be particularly troublesome for non-locals.
