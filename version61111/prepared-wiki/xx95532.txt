Frank Schlesinger (May 11, 1871 New York City – July 10, 1943 Old Lyme, Connecticut) was an American astronomer. His work concentrated on using photographic plates rather than direct visual studies for astronomical research.

==Biography==

Schlesinger attended New York City public schools,[tpl]Cite ANB|title=Schlesinger, Frank|author=Peggy Aldrich Kidwell[/tpl] and graduated from the College of the City of New York in 1890.  He then worked as a surveyor, becoming a special student in astronomy at Columbia in 1894.  In 1896, he received a fellowship which enabled him to study full-time, and he received a Ph.D. in 1898. After his graduation, he spent the summer at Yerkes Observatory as a volunteer assisting director George Ellery Hale.[tpl]Cite DAB|title=Schlesinger, Frank|author=Peter van de Kamp|volume=Supplement Three 1941-1945|year=1973[/tpl] He was an observer in charge of the International Latitude Observatory, Ukiah, California, in 1898. From 1899 to 1903, he was an astronomer at Yerkes, where he pioneered the use of photographic methods to determine stellar parallaxes. He was director of Allegheny Observatory from 1903 to 1920 and Yale University Observatory from 1920 to 1941.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.phys-astro.sonoma.edu/BruceMedalists/Schlesinger/ | title=The Bruce Medalists: Frank Schlesinger | publisher=phys-astro.sonoma.edu | date=2013-01-24 | accessdate=2013-06-13[/tpl]
At Yale he worked extensively with Ida Barney[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.aas.org/cswa/status/status_june1990.pdf | format = PDF | work = STATUS: The Committee on the Status of Women in Astronomy | publisher = American Astronomical Society | date = June 1990 | title = Ida M.

The first publication of the results of this work started in 1925 (Transactions of the Yale University Observatory, v. 4) and the work concluded in the 1980s. He made major contributions to astrometry. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society (1912), the National Academy of Sciences (1916) and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and served as president of the American Astronomical Society (1919–1922), and the International Astronomical Union (1932–1935).
Asked how to say his name, he told The Literary Digest "The name is so difficult for those who do not speak German that I am usually called sles'in-jer, to rime with messenger.  It is, of course, of German origin and means 'a native of Schlesien' or Silesia.  In that language the pronunciation is shlayzinger, to rime with singer."Charles Earle Funk, What's the Name, Please?, Funk & Wagnalls, 1936.
