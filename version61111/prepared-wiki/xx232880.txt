May Kendall (Born Emma Goldworth Kendall) (1861 â€“ ?1943) was an English poet, novelist, and satirist.  She is best known as the co-author of the novel That Very Mab and the poetry collections Dreams to Sell and Songs from Dreamland. 
Possibly her most anthologized poem, Lay of the Trilobite, is a satire of the popular English response to Darwin's evolutionary theory.
In 1895 Kendall partially gave up professional writing in order to more fully devote her life to social reform. She worked predominantly with the Rowntree Family in York.Maltz, Diana. "Sympathy, Humor, and the Abject Poor in the Word of May Kendall." English Literature in Transition, 1880-1920. 50. 3 (2007), 313-332.
