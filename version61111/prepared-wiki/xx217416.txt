===Political campaigns===

Boucher was first elected to Congress in 1982, defeating 16-year Republican incumbent Bill Wampler by 1,100 votes.   He was narrowly reelected in 1984, defeating Delegate Jefferson Stafford by four points, even as Ronald Reagan carried the 9th in a landslide.  However, he was completely unopposed for a third term in 1986, and was reelected 11 more times without serious difficulty.
Boucher remained very popular in his district even as its socially conservative tint made it friendlier to Republicans.  The GOP won most of the area's seats in the Virginia General Assembly in 2001, and has held them ever since.  From 2002 to 2006, he fended off three reasonably well-funded Republican challengers with relative ease.  In 2002, he defeated state delegate Jay Katzen with 66 percent of the vote.  In 2004, he defeated NASCAR official Kevin Triplett with 59 percent of the vote even as George W. Bush easily carried the district.  In 2006, he defeated state delegate Bill Carrico with 68 percent of the vote.  He was reelected unopposed in 2008 even as John McCain carried the district with his largest margin in the state.  It was generally thought that Boucher would be succeeded by a Republican once he retired.

====2010====

In 2010 Boucher faced his strongest opponent to date in House of Delegates Majority Leader Morgan Griffith.  Although Boucher charged that Griffith lived outside of the 9th (his home in Salem was a few miles outside the 9th), it was not enough to overcome Griffith's attacks that Boucher was an ally of Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi.  Ultimately, Griffith unseated Boucher with 51 percent of the vote to Boucher's 46 percent.[tpl]cite news |title=GOP's Griffith ousts 14-term Va. Democratic Rep.
