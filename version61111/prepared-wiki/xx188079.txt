Harry Holman (March 15, 1872 â€“ May 3, 1947) was an American character actor. He appeared in approximately 130 films between 1923 and 1947.
Born in Conway, Missouri, Holman dropped out of school in the ninth grade and began seeking work as an actor.  In films from at least 1930, he played countless hapless judges, politicians, and businessmen.  He is best known to modern audiences as the desperate Professor Richmond who tries to transform the uncouth Three Stooges into gentlemen in the film Hoi Polloi (1935).
Holman died of a heart attack in Hollywood, California in 1947.
