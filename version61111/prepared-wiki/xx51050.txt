[[Asian thrush]]

CATEGORIES: Zoothera, Bird genera

The Asian thrushes are medium-sized mostly insectivorous or omnivorous birds in the genus Zoothera of the thrush family Turdidae.
Two New World species traditionally regarded as Zoothera; (Varied Thrush and Aztec Thrush) actually belong elsewhere in the thrush family. A group containing Siberian Thrush and the African species is not closely related to the other Zoothera and are now assigned to the genus Geokichla.
