All described species, except M. furvus, are endemic to Australia. Several species in this genus were earlier classified in the genus Saitis, containing the Mediterranean Saitis barbipes, which is superficially similar to Maratus (colorful males with enlarged third pair of legs). However, the two genera are in all likelihood not closely related.
Maratus live on or near the ground in low bushes [ref].
