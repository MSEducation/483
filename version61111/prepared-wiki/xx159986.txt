==Family==

James Paynter was descended from the wealthy Paynter family of Boskenna House in St Buryan; he was from a junior branch of this family that settled at Trekenning House in St Columb Major parish. His forebears at Boskenna were also known to be Jacobite sympathisers and in 1745 villagers at St Buryan were convinced that the Paynter family were harbouring Charles Edward Stuart (the Young Pretender).Pearce, John The Wesleys in Cornwall.
