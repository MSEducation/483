Evolution is the change in the inherited characteristics of biological populations over successive generations. Evolutionary processes give rise to diversity at every level of biological organisation, including species, individual organisms and molecules such as DNA and proteins.[tpl]cite book | editor1-last=Hall | editor1-first=B.

All life on Earth is descended from a last universal ancestor that lived approximately 3.8 billion years ago. Repeated speciation and the divergence of life can be inferred from shared sets of biochemical and morphological traits, or by shared DNA sequences.[tpl]cite book|last=Panno|first=Joseph|title=The Cell: Evolution of the First Organism|year=2005|publisher=Facts on File |isbn=0-8160-4946-7[/tpl][tpl]page needed|date=December 2013[/tpl] These homologous traits and sequences are more similar among species that share a more recent common ancestor, and can be used to reconstruct evolutionary histories, using both existing species and the fossil record.

Charles Darwin was the first to formulate a scientific argument for the theory of evolution by means of natural selection. Evolution by natural selection is a process inferred from three facts about populations: 1) more offspring are produced than can possibly survive, 2) traits vary among individuals, leading to different rates of survival and reproduction, and 3) trait differences are heritable.[tpl]cite journal |last1 = Lewontin |first1 = R.

In the early 20th century, genetics was integrated with Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection through the discipline of population genetics. The importance of natural selection as a cause of evolution was accepted into other branches of biology. Moreover, previously held notions about evolution, such as orthogenesis and "progress" became obsolete.[tpl]cite book |last = Provine |first = W.

==History of evolutionary thought==

The proposal that one type of animal could descend from an animal of another type goes back to some of the first pre-Socratic Greek philosophers, such as Anaximander and Empedocles.[tpl]cite book |last1 = Kirk |first1 = Geoffrey |last2 = Raven |first2 = John |last3 = Schofield |first3 = John |title = The Presocratic Philosophers: A Critical History with a Selection of Texts |edition=3rd |publisher = The University of Chicago Press |location = Chicago |year = 1984a |isbn = 0-521-27455-9 |pages=100–142[/tpl][tpl]cite book |last1 = Kirk |first1 = Geoffrey |last2 = Raven |first2 = John |last3 = Schofield |first3 = John |title = The Presocratic Philosophers: A Critical History with a Selection of Texts |edition=3rd |publisher = The University of Chicago Press |location = Chicago |year = 1984b |isbn = 0-521-27455-9 |pages=280–321[/tpl] Such proposals survived into Roman times. The poet and philosopher Lucretius followed Empedocles in his masterwork De Rerum Natura.[tpl]Cite book|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0131%3Abook%3D5%3Acard%3D855|chapter=lines 855–877 |author=Lucretius|title= De Rerum Natura|postscript=[tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl], edited and translated by William Ellery Leonard (1916).[tpl]Cite journal|journal=Leeds International Classical Studies 2.4 |year=2003 |first= David |last=Sedley| url=http://lics.leeds.ac.uk/2003/200304.pdf| title=Lucretius and the new Empedocles|postscript=[tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl] In contrast to these materialistic views, Aristotle understood all natural things, not only living things, as being imperfect actualisations of different fixed natural possibilities, known as "forms", "ideas", or (in Latin translations) "species".[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Torrey | first1 = Harry Beal | last2 = Felin | first2 = Frances | title = Was Aristotle an evolutionist? | journal = The Quarterly Review of Biology |date=March 1937 | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–18 | jstor = 2808399 | doi = 10.1086/394520 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | last1=Hull | first1=D.

Variations of this idea became the standard understanding of the Middle Ages, and were integrated into Christian learning, but Aristotle did not demand that real types of animals always corresponded one-for-one with exact metaphysical forms, and specifically gave examples of how new types of living things could come to be.Mason, A History of the Sciences pp 43–44
In the 17th century the new method of modern science rejected Aristotle's approach, and sought explanations of natural phenomena in terms of physical laws which were the same for all visible things, and did not need to assume any fixed natural categories, nor any divine cosmic order. But this new approach was slow to take root in the biological sciences, which became the last bastion of the concept of fixed natural types. John Ray used one of the previously more general terms for fixed natural types, "species", to apply to animal and plant types, but he strictly identified each type of living thing as a species, and proposed that each species can be defined by the features that perpetuate themselves each generation.Mayr Growth of biological thought p256; original was Ray, History of Plants. 1686, trans E. Silk. These species were designed by God, but showing differences caused by local conditions. The biological classification introduced by Carolus Linnaeus in 1735 also viewed species as fixed according to a divine plan.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/linnaeus.html|title=Carl Linnaeus - berkeley.edu|accessdate=February 11, 2012[/tpl]
Other naturalists of this time speculated on evolutionary change of species over time according to natural laws. Maupertuis wrote in 1751 of natural modifications occurring during reproduction and accumulating over many generations to produce new species.Bowler, Peter J. 2003. Evolution: the history of an idea. Berkeley, CA. p73–75 Buffon suggested that species could degenerate into different organisms, and Erasmus Darwin proposed that all warm-blooded animals could have descended from a single micro-organism (or "filament").[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/Edarwin.html|title=Erasmus Darwin - berkeley.edu|accessdate=February 11, 2012[/tpl] The first full-fledged evolutionary scheme was Lamarck's "transmutation" theory of 1809Lamarck (1809) Philosophie Zoologique which envisaged spontaneous generation continually producing simple forms of life that developed greater complexity in parallel lineages with an inherent progressive tendency, and that on a local level these lineages adapted to the environment by inheriting changes caused by use or disuse in parents.[tpl]cite book | last = Gould | first = S.J. | authorlink = Stephen Jay Gould | title = The Structure of Evolutionary Theory | publisher = Belknap Press (Harvard University Press) | location = Cambridge | year = 2002 | isbn = 978-0-674-00613-3 | ref = harv [/tpl][tpl]page needed|date=December 2013[/tpl] (The latter process was later called Lamarckism.)[tpl]cite book | last1 = Margulis | first1 = Lynn | last2 = Fester | first2 = René | title = Symbiosis as a source of evolutionary innovation: Speciation and morphogenesis | publisher = The MIT Press | year = 1991 | page = 470 | isbn = 0-262-13269-9 | url = http://books.google.ca/books?id=3sKzeiHUIUQC&pg=PA162&dq=inauthor:%22Lynn+Margulis%22+lamarck#v=onepage&q=inauthor%3A%22Lynn%20Margulis%22%20lamarck&f=false [/tpl][tpl]cite book |last = Ghiselin |first = Michael T. |authorlink = Michael Ghiselin|publication-date = September–October 1994 |contribution = Nonsense in schoolbooks: 'The Imaginary Lamarck'|contribution-url =http://www.textbookleague.org/54marck.htm |title = The Textbook Letter |publisher = The Textbook League |url = http://www.textbookleague.org/ |accessdate = January 23, 2008 [/tpl][tpl]cite book |last = Magner |first = Lois N. |title = A History of the Life Sciences |edition = Third |publisher = Marcel Dekker, CRC Press |year = 2002 |isbn = 978-0-203-91100-6 |url = http://books.google.com/?id=YKJ6gVYbrGwC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q [/tpl][tpl]page needed|date=December 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last1 = Jablonka |first1 = E. |last2 = Lamb |first2 = M.

In particular Georges Cuvier insisted that species were unrelated and fixed, their similarities reflecting divine design for functional needs. In the meantime, Ray's ideas of benevolent design had been developed by William Paley into the Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity (1802) which proposed complex adaptations as evidence of divine design, and was admired by Charles Darwin.[tpl]cite book | editor1-last=Burkhardt | editor1-first=F. | editor2-last=Smith | editor2-first=S. |year = 1991 |title = The correspondence of Charles Darwin |volume = 7 |pages = 1858–1859 |publisher = Cambridge University Press |place = Cambridge [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last1 = Sulloway |first1 = F.

The critical break from the concept of fixed species in biology began with the theory of evolution by natural selection, which was formulated by Charles Darwin. Partly influenced by An Essay on the Principle of Population by Thomas Robert Malthus, Darwin noted that population growth would lead to a "struggle for existence" where favorable variations could prevail as others perished. Each generation, many offspring fail to survive to an age of reproduction because of limited resources. This could explain the diversity of animals and plants from a common ancestry through the working of natural laws working the same for all types of thing.[tpl]cite journal |last1 = Sober |first1 = E. |year = 2009 |title = Did Darwin write the origin backwards? |journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume = 106 |issue = S1 |pages = 10048–10055 |doi = 10.1073/pnas.0901109106 |bibcode = 2009PNAS..10610048S [/tpl]Mayr, Ernst (2001) What evolution is.

Thomas Henry Huxley applied Darwin's ideas to humans, using paleontology and comparative anatomy to provide strong evidence that humans and apes shared a common ancestry. Some were disturbed by this since it implied that humans did not have a special place in the universe.[tpl]cite web |url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/277746/T-H-Huxley |title = Encyclopædia Britannica Online |publisher = Britannica.com |accessdate = January 11, 2012 [/tpl]
Precise mechanisms of reproductive heritability and the origin of new traits remained a mystery. Towards this end, Darwin developed his provisional theory of pangenesis.[tpl]cite journal |last1 = Liu |first1 = Y. S. |last2 = Zhou |first2 = X. M. |last3 = Zhi |first3 = M.

Mendel's laws of inheritance eventually supplanted most of Darwin's pangenesis theory.[tpl]cite journal |author = Weiling F |title = Historical study: Johann Gregor Mendel 1822–1884 |journal = Am. J.

Hugo de Vries connected Darwin's pangenesis theory to Weismann's germ/soma cell distinction and proposed that Darwin's pangenes were concentrated in the cell nucleus and when expressed they could move into the cytoplasm to change the cells structure. De Vries was also one of the researchers who made Mendel's work well-known, believing that Mendelian traits corresponded to the transfer of heritable variations along the germline.[tpl]cite book |last1 = Wright |first1 = S. |title = Evolution and the Genetics of Populations, Volume 1: Genetic and Biometric Foundations |page = 480 |publisher = University of Chicago Press |isbn = 0-226-91038-5 |url = http://books.google.ca/books?id=4pTdTWi83ecC&printsec=frontcover&dq=sewall+wright+volume+1#v=onepage&q&f=false |date = 1984-06-15 [/tpl] To explain how new variants originate, De Vries developed a mutation theory that led to a temporary rift between those who accepted Darwinian evolution and biometricians who allied with de Vries.[tpl]cite book |author = Will Provine |title = The Origins of Theoretical Population Genetics |year = 1971 |isbn = 0-226-68464-4 |publisher = University of Chicago Press [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |pmid=10439561 |year=1999 |last1=Stamhuis |first1=IH |last2=Meijer |first2=OG |last3=Zevenhuizen |first3=EJ |title=Hugo de Vries on heredity, 1889–1903.

Haldane, Sewall Wright, and Ronald Fisher, set the foundations of evolution onto a robust statistical philosophy. The false contradiction between Darwin's theory, genetic mutations, and Mendelian inheritance was thus reconciled.Quammen, D. (2006).

In the 1920s and 1930s a modern evolutionary synthesis connected natural selection, mutation theory, and Mendelian inheritance into a unified theory that applied generally to any branch of biology. The modern synthesis was able to explain patterns observed across species in populations, through fossil transitions in palaeontology, and even complex cellular mechanisms in developmental biology.[tpl]cite book |last = Bowler |first = Peter J. |authorlink = Peter J.

==Heredity==

Evolution in organisms occurs through changes in heritable traits – particular characteristics of an organism. In humans, for example, eye colour is an inherited characteristic and an individual might inherit the "brown-eye trait" from one of their parents.[tpl]cite journal |author = Sturm RA, Frudakis TN |title = Eye colour: portals into pigmentation genes and ancestry |journal = Trends Genet. |volume = 20 |issue = 8 |pages = 327–32 |year = 2004 |pmid = 15262401 |doi = 10.1016/j.tig.2004.06.010 |ref = harv [/tpl] Inherited traits are controlled by genes and the complete set of genes within an organism's genome is called its genotype.[tpl]cite journal |author = Pearson H |title = Genetics: what is a gene? |journal = Nature |volume = 441 |issue = 7092 |pages = 398–401 |year = 2006 |pmid = 16724031 |doi = 10.1038/441398a |ref = harv |bibcode = 2006Natur.441..398P [/tpl]
The complete set of observable traits that make up the structure and behaviour of an organism is called its phenotype. These traits come from the interaction of its genotype with the environment.[tpl]cite journal |author = Visscher PM, Hill WG, Wray NR |title = Heritability in the genomics era—concepts and misconceptions |journal = Nature Reviews Genetics  |volume = 9 |issue = 4 |pages = 255–66 |year = 2008 |pmid = 18319743 |doi = 10.1038/nrg2322 |ref = harv [/tpl] As a result, many aspects of an organism's phenotype are not inherited. For example, suntanned skin comes from the interaction between a person's genotype and sunlight; thus, suntans are not passed on to people's children. However, some people tan more easily than others, due to differences in their genotype; a striking example are people with the inherited trait of albinism, who do not tan at all and are very sensitive to sunburn.[tpl]cite journal |author = Oetting WS, Brilliant MH, King RA |title = The clinical spectrum of albinism in humans |journal = Molecular medicine today |volume = 2 |issue = 8 |pages = 330–5 |year = 1996 |pmid = 8796918 |doi = 10.1016/1357-4310(96)81798-9 |ref = harv [/tpl]
Heritable traits are passed from one generation to the next via DNA, a molecule that encodes genetic information. DNA is a long polymer composed of four types of bases. The sequence of bases along a particular DNA molecule specify the genetic information, in a manner similar to a sequence of letters spelling out a sentence. Before a cell divides, the DNA is copied, so that each of the resulting two cells will inherit the DNA sequence. Portions of a DNA molecule that specify a single functional unit are called genes; different genes have different sequences of bases. Within cells, the long strands of DNA form condensed structures called chromosomes. The specific location of a DNA sequence within a chromosome is known as a locus. If the DNA sequence at a locus varies between individuals, the different forms of this sequence are called alleles. DNA sequences can change through mutations, producing new alleles. If a mutation occurs within a gene, the new allele may affect the trait that the gene controls, altering the phenotype of the organism.[tpl]cite book |last = Futuyma |first = Douglas J. |authorlink = Douglas J.

==Variation==

An individual organism's phenotype results from both its genotype and the influence from the environment it has lived in. A substantial part of the variation in phenotypes in a population is caused by the differences between their genotypes. The modern evolutionary synthesis defines evolution as the change over time in this genetic variation. The frequency of one particular allele will become more or less prevalent relative to other forms of that gene. Variation disappears when a new allele reaches the point of fixation — when it either disappears from the population or replaces the ancestral allele entirely.[tpl]cite journal |author = Harwood AJ |title = Factors affecting levels of genetic diversity in natural populations |journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B |volume = 353 |issue = 1366 |pages = 177–86 |year = 1998 |pmid = 9533122 |pmc = 1692205 |doi = 10.1098/rstb.1998.0200 |last2 = Harwood |first2 = J |ref = harv [/tpl]
Natural selection will only cause evolution if there is enough genetic variation in a population. Before the discovery of Mendelian genetics, one common hypothesis was blending inheritance. But with blending inheritance, genetic variance would be rapidly lost, making evolution by natural selection implausible. The Hardy-Weinberg principle provides the solution to how variation is maintained in a population with Mendelian inheritance. The frequencies of alleles (variations in a gene) will remain constant in the absence of selection, mutation, migration and genetic drift.[tpl]cite book |author = Ewens W.J. |year = 2004 |title = Mathematical Population Genetics (2nd Edition) |publisher = Springer-Verlag, New York |isbn = 0-387-20191-2 [/tpl]
Variation comes from mutations in genetic material, reshuffling of genes through sexual reproduction and migration between populations (gene flow). Despite the constant introduction of new variation through mutation and gene flow, most of the genome of a species is identical in all individuals of that species.[tpl]cite journal |author = Butlin RK, Tregenza T |title = Levels of genetic polymorphism: marker loci versus quantitative traits |journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B |volume = 353 |issue = 1366 |pages = 187–98 |year = 1998 |pmid = 9533123 |pmc = 1692210 |doi = 10.1098/rstb.1998.0201 |ref = harv [/tpl] However, even relatively small differences in genotype can lead to dramatic differences in phenotype: for example, chimpanzees and humans differ in only about 5% of their genomes.[tpl]cite journal |author = Wetterbom A, Sevov M, Cavelier L, Bergström TF |title = Comparative genomic analysis of human and chimpanzee indicates a key role for indels in primate evolution |journal = J.

===Mutation===

Mutations are changes in the DNA sequence of a cell's genome. When mutations occur, they can either have no effect, alter the product of a gene, or prevent the gene from functioning. Based on studies in the fly Drosophila melanogaster, it has been suggested that if a mutation changes a protein produced by a gene, this will probably be harmful, with about 70% of these mutations having damaging effects, and the remainder being either neutral or weakly beneficial.[tpl]cite journal |author = Sawyer SA, Parsch J, Zhang Z, Hartl DL |title = Prevalence of positive selection among nearly neutral amino acid replacements in Drosophila |journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume = 104 |issue = 16 |pages = 6504–10 |year = 2007 |pmid = 17409186 |doi = 10.1073/pnas.0701572104 |pmc = 1871816 |ref = harv |bibcode = 2007PNAS..104.6504S [/tpl]
Mutations can involve large sections of a chromosome becoming duplicated (usually by genetic recombination), which can introduce extra copies of a gene into a genome.[tpl]cite journal |doi = 10.1038/nrg2593 |pmid = 19597530 |volume = 10 |issue = 8 |pages = 551–564 |last = Hastings |first = P J |title = Mechanisms of change in gene copy number |journal = Nature Reviews Genetics  |year = 2009 |last2 = Lupski |first2 = JR |last3 = Rosenberg |first3 = SM |last4 = Ira |first4 = G |pmc = 2864001 |ref = harv [/tpl] Extra copies of genes are a major source of the raw material needed for new genes to evolve.[tpl]cite book |title = From DNA to Diversity: Molecular Genetics and the Evolution of Animal Design.

[/tpl] This is important because most new genes evolve within gene families from pre-existing genes that share common ancestors.[tpl]cite journal |author = Harrison P, Gerstein M |title = Studying genomes through the aeons: protein families, pseudogenes and proteome evolution |journal = J Mol Biol |volume = 318 |issue = 5 |pages = 1155–74 |year = 2002 |pmid = 12083509 |doi = 10.1016/S0022-2836(02)00109-2 |ref = harv [/tpl] For example, the human eye uses four genes to make structures that sense light: three for colour vision and one for night vision; all four are descended from a single ancestral gene.[tpl]cite journal |author = Bowmaker JK |title = Evolution of colour vision in vertebrates |journal = Eye (London, England) |volume = 12 |issue = Pt 3b |pages = 541–7 |year = 1998 |pmid = 9775215 |ref = harv |doi = 10.1038/eye.1998.143 [/tpl]
New genes can be generated from an ancestral gene when a duplicate copy mutates and acquires a new function. This process is easier once a gene has been duplicated because it increases the redundancy of the system; one gene in the pair can acquire a new function while the other copy continues to perform its original function.[tpl]cite journal |doi = 10.1101/gr.9.4.317 |author = Gregory TR, Hebert PD |title = The modulation of DNA content: proximate causes and ultimate consequences |url = http://genome.cshlp.org/content/9/4/317.full |journal = Genome Res. |volume = 9 |issue = 4 |pages = 317–24 |year = 1999 |pmid = 10207154 |ref = harv [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author = Hurles M |title = Gene duplication: the genomic trade in spare parts |journal = PLoS Biol. |volume = 2 |issue = 7 |pages = E206 |year = 2004 |pmid = 15252449 |pmc = 449868 |doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0020206 |ref = harv [/tpl] Other types of mutations can even generate entirely new genes from previously noncoding DNA.[tpl]cite journal |title = The evolution and functional diversification of animal microRNA genes |author = Liu N, Okamura K, Tyler DM |journal = Cell Res. |year = 2008 |volume = 18 |pages = 985–96 |doi = 10.1038/cr.2008.278 |url = http://www.nature.com/cr/journal/v18/n10/full/cr2008278a.html |pmid = 18711447 |issue = 10 |pmc = 2712117 |ref = harv [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author = Siepel A |title = Darwinian alchemy: Human genes from noncoding DNA |journal = Genome Res. |volume = 19 |issue = 10 |pages = 1693–5 |year = 2009 |pmid = 19797681 |doi = 10.1101/gr.098376.109 |url = http://genome.cshlp.org/content/19/10/1693.full |pmc = 2765273 |ref = harv [/tpl]

===Sex and recombination===

In asexual organisms, genes are inherited together, or linked, as they cannot mix with genes of other organisms during reproduction. In contrast, the offspring of sexual organisms contain random mixtures of their parents' chromosomes that are produced through independent assortment. In a related process called homologous recombination, sexual organisms exchange DNA between two matching chromosomes.[tpl]cite journal |author = Radding C |title = Homologous pairing and strand exchange in genetic recombination |journal = Annu.

===Gene flow===

Gene flow is the exchange of genes between populations and between species.[tpl]cite journal |author = Morjan C, Rieseberg L |title = How species evolve collectively: implications of gene flow and selection for the spread of advantageous alleles |journal = Mol. Ecol. |volume = 13 |issue = 6 |pages = 1341–56 |year = 2004 |pmid = 15140081 |doi = 10.1111/j.1365-294X.2004.02164.x |pmc = 2600545 |ref = harv [/tpl] It can therefore be a source of variation that is new to a population or to a species. Gene flow can be caused by the movement of individuals between separate populations of organisms, as might be caused by the movement of mice between inland and coastal populations, or the movement of pollen between heavy metal tolerant and heavy metal sensitive populations of grasses.
Gene transfer between species includes the formation of hybrid organisms and horizontal gene transfer. Horizontal gene transfer is the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another organism that is not its offspring; this is most common among bacteria.[tpl]cite journal |author = Boucher Y, Douady CJ, Papke RT, Walsh DA, Boudreau ME, Nesbo CL, Case RJ, Doolittle WF |title = Lateral gene transfer and the origins of prokaryotic groups |doi = 10.1146/annurev.genet.37.050503.084247 |journal = Annu Rev Genet |volume = 37 |issue = 1 |pages = 283–328 |year = 2003 |pmid = 14616063 |ref = harv [/tpl] In medicine, this contributes to the spread of antibiotic resistance, as when one bacteria acquires resistance genes it can rapidly transfer them to other species.[tpl]cite journal |author = Walsh T |title = Combinatorial genetic evolution of multiresistance |journal = Current Opinion in Microbiology |volume = 9 |issue = 5 |pages = 476–82 |year = 2006 |pmid = 16942901 |doi = 10.1016/j.mib.2006.08.009 |ref = harv [/tpl] Horizontal transfer of genes from bacteria to eukaryotes such as the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the adzuki bean beetle Callosobruchus chinensis has occurred.[tpl]cite journal |author = Kondo N, Nikoh N, Ijichi N, Shimada M, Fukatsu T |title = Genome fragment of Wolbachia endosymbiont transferred to X chromosome of host insect |journal = Proc.

Large-scale gene transfer has also occurred between the ancestors of eukaryotic cells and bacteria, during the acquisition of chloroplasts and mitochondria. It is possible that eukaryotes themselves originated from horizontal gene transfers between bacteria and archaea.[tpl]cite journal |author = River, M. C. and Lake, J.

==Mechanisms==

From a Neo-Darwinian perspective, evolution occurs when there are changes in the frequencies of alleles within a population of interbreeding organisms. For example, the allele for black colour in a population of moths becoming more common. Mechanisms that can lead to changes in allele frequencies include natural selection, genetic drift, genetic hitchhiking, mutation and gene flow.

===Natural selection===

Evolution by means of natural selection is the process by which genetic mutations that enhance reproduction become and remain more common in successive generations of a population. It has often been called a "self-evident" mechanism because it necessarily follows from three simple facts:
These conditions produce competition between organisms for survival and reproduction. Consequently, organisms with traits that give them an advantage over their competitors  are more likely to pass on their traits on to the next generation than those with traits that do not confer an advantage.[tpl]cite journal |author = Hurst LD |title = Fundamental concepts in genetics: genetics and the understanding of selection |journal = Nature Reviews Genetics  |volume = 10 |issue = 2 |pages = 83–93 |year = 2009 |pmid = 19119264 |doi = 10.1038/nrg2506 |ref = harv [/tpl]
The central concept of natural selection is the evolutionary fitness of an organism.[tpl]cite journal |author = Orr HA |title = Fitness and its role in evolutionary genetics |journal = Nature Reviews Genetics  |volume = 10 |issue = 8 |pages = 531–9 |year = 2009 |pmid = 19546856 |doi = 10.1038/nrg2603 |pmc = 2753274 |ref = harv [/tpl] Fitness is measured by an organism's ability to survive and reproduce, which determines the size of its genetic contribution to the next generation. However, fitness is not the same as the total number of offspring: instead fitness is indicated by the proportion of subsequent generations that carry an organism's genes.[tpl]cite journal |author = Haldane J |title = The theory of natural selection today |journal = Nature |volume = 183 |issue = 4663 |pages = 710–3 |year = 1959 |pmid = 13644170 |doi = 10.1038/183710a0 |ref = harv |bibcode = 1959Natur.183..710H [/tpl] For example, if an organism could survive well and reproduce rapidly, but its offspring were all too small and weak to survive, this organism would make little genetic contribution to future generations and would thus have low fitness.
If an allele increases fitness more than the other alleles of that gene, then with each generation this allele will become more common within the population. These traits are said to be "selected for". Examples of traits that can increase fitness are enhanced survival and increased fecundity. Conversely, the lower fitness caused by having a less beneficial or deleterious allele results in this allele becoming rarer — they are "selected against".[tpl]cite journal |author = Lande R, Arnold SJ |year = 1983 |title = The measurement of selection on correlated characters |journal = Evolution |volume = 37 |pages = 1210–26 |doi = 10.2307/2408842 |issue = 6 |ref = harv |jstor = 2408842 [/tpl] Importantly, the fitness of an allele is not a fixed characteristic; if the environment changes, previously neutral or harmful traits may become beneficial and previously beneficial traits become harmful. However, even if the direction of selection does reverse in this way, traits that were lost in the past may not re-evolve in an identical form (see Dollo's law).[tpl]cite journal |doi = 10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00505.x |pmid = 18764918 |volume = 62 |issue = 11 |pages = 2727–2741 |last = Goldberg |first = Emma E |title = On phylogenetic tests of irreversible evolution |journal = Evolution |year = 2008 |last2 = Igić |first2 = B |ref = harv [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |doi = 10.1016/j.tree.2008.06.013 |pmid = 18814933 |volume = 23 |issue = 11 |pages = 602–609 |last = Collin |first = Rachel |title = Reversing opinions on Dollo's Law |journal = Trends in Ecology & Evolution |year = 2008 |last2 = Miglietta |first2 = MP |ref = harv [/tpl]
