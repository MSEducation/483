Al-Ahram ([tpl]lang-ar|الأهرام[/tpl]; The Pyramids), founded on 5 August 1875, is the most widely circulating Egyptian daily newspaper, and the second oldest after al-Waqa'i`al-Masriya (The Egyptian Events, founded 1828).[tpl]cite web|title=Publication overview|url=http://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/egypt/documents/semc/20111122_en.pdf|work=Ipsos|accessdate=9 November 2013[/tpl] It is majority owned by the Egyptian government.
Given the large dialectal variety of the Arabic language, Al-Ahram is widely considered an influential source of writing style in Arabic. In 1950, the Middle East Institute described Al-Ahram as being to the Arabic-reading public within its area of distribution, "What The Times is to Englishmen and the New York Times to Americans",Middle East Institute, 1950, p. 155. however it has often been accused of heavy influence and censorship by the Egyptian government.
In addition to the main edition published in Egypt, the paper publishes two other Arabic-language editions, one geared to the Arab World and the other aimed at an international audience, as well as editions in English and French.

The Egyptian government owns a controlling share of the stocks of the paper and appoints the editors. As appointees of the state, little censorship is exercised over them; it is understood that they are loyal to the state.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pressreference.com/Co-Fa/Egypt.html|title=Egypt Press, Media|work=Pressreference|accessdate=10 September 2012[/tpl] Under President Hosni Mubarak, Al-Ahram largely ignored, and trivialised the opposition parties to Mubarak's ruling National Democratic Party, and did not publish much direct criticism of the government.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4199054.stm|work=BBC News|title=The media in Egypt|date=2 September 2005|accessdate=23 April 2010[/tpl]
The Anti-Defamation League, in a review of Arab newspapers in 2005, stated that Al-Ahram "is given substantial leeway" by the government so long as they avoid "certain 'taboos'."Arab Media Review: Index of Arab Newspapers Anti-Defamation League, 14 February 2005 Reporters Without Borders, in their 2005 report on press freedom in Egypt, reported that editorials in many newspapers, including Al-Ahram, had become increasingly critical of the National Democratic Party's control of the government, and the corruption of the Mubarak regime.Egypt – 2005 annual report, Reporters Without Borders, January 2005 In an interview with Reporters Without Borders, Abdel Halim Qandil, editor of the weekly magazine Al-Arabi, said that the government interfered with independent operation of Al-Ahram by controlling the printing presses and appointing the editors.

==Photo controversy==

Al-Ahram generated controversy in September 2010 when an Egyptian blogger, Wael Khalil, revealed that the newspaper had altered a photo of Middle East leaders walking with United States President Barack Obama so that instead of Obama leading the group, Egyptian President Mubarak was placed in the front when he was actually walking in the rearmost position.[tpl]cite news|title=Doctored Photo Flatters Egyptian President|author=Robert Mackey|newspaper=The New York Times|date=16 September 2010|url=http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/16/doctored-photo-flatters-egyptian-president/ |accessdate=30 September 2010[/tpl] Osama Saraya, Al-Ahram's editor-in-chief, defended the altered photo, stating that it was meant to underscore Egypt's leading role in the peace process: "The expressionist photo is... a brief, live and true expression of the prominent stance of President Mubarak in the Palestinian issue, his unique role in leading it before Washington or any other."[tpl]cite news|title=Al-Ahram newspaper defends doctored photo of Hosni Mubarak|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=The Guardian|date=17 September 2010 |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/sep/17/al-ahram-newspaper-doctored-photo-hosni-mubarak|accessdate=5 October 2010[/tpl]
