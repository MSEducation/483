On December 31, 2007, Mississippi governor Haley Barbour appointed Roger Wicker to the Senate seat vacated 13 days earlier by Sen. Trent Lott. At the time of his appointment, Wicker was already a U.S. Representative for Mississippi's District 1. As a result of Wicker's appointment to the Senate, his House seat became vacant, necessitating a special election to determine who would serve the remainder of Wicker's term.

Mississippi was one of the states where right wing commentators such as Rush Limbaugh suggested people cross party lines on March 11 in order to keep the competition alive between Democratic Presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. Several websites such as the Daily Kos"DailyKos:' Limbaugh's system-gaming could give us a new Democratic congressman  and politico.com Politico.com: Primary shenanigans could backfire suggested that this is why the Republican primary runoff was so close between the more moderate McCullough and Davis as many of the more Conservative Republicans were not allowed to vote in that runoff. It is also believed that this has led to the final special election race involving a conservative Democrat (Childers) who has a better than usual chance to win the general election. Republicans were particularly concerned that a race between Childers and McCullough would've increased the Democrat's chances. 
The initial special election to fill the seat was held on April 22, 2008; no one received a majority of the vote so a runoff election was held between the two top vote getters: Democrat Travis Childers (who was the top vote getter with 49.4% of the vote) and Republican Greg Davis (who received 46.3% of the initial special election vote) on May 13, 2008.
The National Republican Congressional Committee spent over $1.3 million in support of Davis' bid for the vacant seat.  Freedom's Watch, a Republican-supporting advocacy group, purchased an additional $550,000 in advertising.  The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spent $1.5 million in support of Childers.

Democrat wins House seat in special election, Emily Waggster Pettus, Associated Press, May 13, 2008.  Once sworn in, Childers will serve through the end of the 110th Congress in January 2009.
Childers victory represents the 3rd time during the 110th Congress that a Democrat has been elected to a previously Republican-held seat in a special election. Childers victory is seen as a surprise upset for the Republican party as Mississippi's 1st district has been historically right leaning.
