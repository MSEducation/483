Rockhill's first investment was Proteon Therapeutics.  Proteon's core technology was created by Dr. F. Nicholas Franano while at Johns Hopkins University.  Proteon has secured nearly $80 million from investors including Novartis, MPM Capital, TVM Lifesciences, Skyline Ventures and Intersouth Partners to develop the company's lead drug compound.  This drug, currently known as PROT-201, could prove vital in managing some of the worst problems encountered with kidney dialysis.  In March 2009, Proteon entered into an option agreement with Novartis to be acquired for up to $550 million as certain development milestone are met."Proten Therapeutics Lands $38 million, option to sell for $550 million, Kansas City Business Journal, March 5, 2009, accessed April 5, 2009.

Rockhill's second investment, LightSpeed Genomics, was based on technology created at MIT.  According to In Sequence, a publication which covers the race to decode the human genome, "LightSpeed Genomics, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., is developing a high-speed DNA sequencing platform that 'will allow human genome sequencing to be performed more quickly and less expensively than ever before,' according to the companyâ€™s website...LightSpeed founder and CEO Josh (Jekwan) Ryu told In Sequence...that the company is currently in stealth mode and not yet ready to talk about its plans.  Ryu, who holds a PhD from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is a former Affymetrix staff scientist with 3 patents (US2005/0239113, US2005/0239114, US2005/0239115).

Church and a team are currently competing in the Archon X-Prize Competition.  To win the $10 million genomics prize purse, teams must successfully sequence 100 human genomes within 10 days for less than $10,000 per genome.See http://www.xprize.org/genomics/press-release/revolutionary-geneticist-dr-george-church-to-compete-for-the-archon-x-prize-f
