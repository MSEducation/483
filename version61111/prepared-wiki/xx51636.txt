The edimmu, read incorrectly sometimes as ekimmu,The Religion Of Babylonia And Assyria By Theophilus G. Pinches were a type of utukku in Sumerian mythology, similar in nature to the preta of Vedic religion or the kiangshi of Chinese mythology.  They were envisioned as the ghosts of those who were not buried properly.  They were considered vengeful toward the living and might possess people if they did not respect certain taboos, such as the prohibition against eating ox meat.  They were thought to cause disease and inspire criminal behavior in the living, but could sometimes be appeased by funeral repasts or libations.  The edimmu were also thought to be completely or nearly incorporeal, "wind" spirits that sucked the life out of the susceptible and the sleeping (most commonly the young).
