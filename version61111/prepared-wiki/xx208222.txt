Following the coinage of the term "anthropic principle" by Brandon Carter in 1973–4,Brandon Carter (1974). Large number coincidences and the anthropic principle in cosmology. Confrontation of cosmological theories with observational data; Proceedings of the Symposium, Krakow, Poland, September 10–12, 1973. Dordrecht: D. Reidel Publishing. pp. 291-298. units of measurement that are on a human scale are occasionally referred to as "anthropic units", as for example here:Brian William Petley (1985). The fundamental physical constants and the frontier of measurement. Bristol; Boston: A. Hilger. p. 120. [tpl]quotation|"… the metre and kilogram occupy a reasonably central position as far as symmetry in positive and negative powers of ten is concerned, emphasising that the SI units are natural anthropic units …"|Brian William Petley (1985)[/tpl]

==In social studies==

In fields of study such as sociology and ethnography, anthropic units are identifiable groupings of people. For example:J. J. Thomson (1896). Address by the President to the Mathematical and Physical Section. Science. American Association for the Advancement of Science. New Series, 4(90): 392-402.
