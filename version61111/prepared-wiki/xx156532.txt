The Shelbourne Hotel is a famous hotel situated in a landmark building on the north side of St Stephen's Green, in Dublin, Ireland.  Currently operated by Marriott International, the hotel has 265 rooms in total and reopened in March 2007 after undergoing an eighteen-month refurbishment.
John McCurdy designed the hotel and the studio of M. M. Barbezet of Paris cast the four external statues, two Nubian Princesses and their shackled slave girls.

==History==

The Shelbourne Hotel was founded in 1824 by Tipperary man Martin Burke, when he acquired three adjoining townhouses overlooking Dublin's St Stephen's Green - Europe's largest garden square. Burke named his grand new hotel The Shelbourne, after William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne.
In the early 1900s, Alois Hitler, Jr, the half brother of Adolf Hitler, worked in the hotel while in Dublin.
In 1922, the Irish Constitution was drafted in room 112, now known as The Constitution Room.[tpl]cite news|first1=Tom|last1=Lyons|first2=Daniel|last2=McConnell|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/fg-insider-briefs-the-top-bankers-at-private-dinner-3017077.html|title=FG insider briefs the top bankers at private dinner: Cox marks the card of corporate elite on crisis|date=12 February 2012|accessdate=12 February 2012[/tpl]
