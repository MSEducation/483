==History==

The ground built after the Ashby Road ground ceased the host cricket matches shortly before World War II, leaving Hinckley without a venue for first-class cricket. Local businessmen subsequently joined forces to raise funds for construction of a new ground, with a Mr. Arthur Tansey donating three fields along the Coventry Road, upon which a pitch and pavilion was built.  First-class cricket returned to Hinckley in 1951, when Leicestershire played Derbyshire in the County Championship.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/527_f.html|title=First-Class Matches played on Coventry Road, Hinckley (17)|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=20 June 2012[/tpl] From 1952 to 1957, Leicestershire played two first-class matches per season at the ground. Leicestershire didn't play there in 1956, but did return the following season, where they proceeded to play one match per season there until 1961. Two first-class matches were played there in 1962, although Leicestershire didn't visit in 1963. The final two first-class matches to be held at the ground came in 1964, with Leicestershire playing Somerset and Kent. Seventeen first-class matches were played there in total, with Leicestershire winning just once, losing eleven and drawing five.
Subsequently demolished, the site was used for a leisure centre.
