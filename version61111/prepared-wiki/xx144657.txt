===Collaborations with David Thrussell===

In 1993 Pieter Bourke began a collaborative partnership with Thrussell. They shared an interest in European electronic music and the emerging audio sampling technology. Bourke joined Thrussell's techno-industrial band Snog, playing keyboards live and writing new material with Thrussell. Snog had formed in 1989 by Thrussell with fellow art school mates, Tim McGrath and Julia Bourke. Snog's first single with Pieter Bourke aboard, "Born to Be Mild", is credited to Julia Mary Bourke, Thrussell and McGrath.[tpl]cite web | url = https://www.ascap.com/Home/ace-title-search/index.aspx | title = ASCAP – ACE Title Search | publisher = American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) | accessdate = 24 September 2012 [/tpl] Note: User to click on 'Title' tab and enter song title e.g. Born to be Mild. It was followed by their Christmas single, "Hey Christian God", which was co-written by Pieter Bourke and Thrussell.[tpl]Cite web | title = 'Hey Christian God' at APRA search engine | url = http://www.apra-amcos.com.au/worksearch.axd?q=Hey%20Christian%20God | publisher = Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) | accessdate = 24 September 2012 [/tpl] In 1994 a full length album, Dear Valued Customer, was released and was supported by live performances across Australia. Bourke co-wrote three tracks for the 1996 Snog album, Buy Me...I’ll Change Your Life, including the singles "The Future" and "Hooray".[tpl]Cite web | title = 'The Future' at APRA search engine | url = http://www.apra-amcos.com.au/worksearch.axd?q=The%20Future | publisher = Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) | accessdate = 25 September 2012 [/tpl][tpl]Cite web | title = 'Hooray' at APRA search engine | url = http://www.apra-amcos.com.au/worksearch.axd?q=Hooray | publisher = Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) | accessdate = 25 September 2012 [/tpl] His last contribution to Snog was "The Grey Menace", which was co-written with Thrusell,[tpl]Cite web | title = 'The Grey Menace' at APRA search engine | url = http://www.apra-amcos.com.au/worksearch.axd?q=The%20Grey%20Menace | publisher = Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) | accessdate = 25 September 2012 [/tpl] and appeared on the 1999 release Third Mall from the Sun.
Parallel to Snog, also in 1993, Bourke and Thrussell created an ambient duo, Soma. A self-titled seven-track CD was recorded and released in 1993. It was expanded with the addition of six songs and released as Hollow Earth on 15 December 1994. Allmusic's Theo Kavadias described the release, "Bourke's organic influence wrapped around Thrussell's electro sensibilities created exotic constructions that skirted the borders of ambience, techno and soundtrack with a vocabulary both stylish and deep".[tpl]cite web | url = [tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r302881/review |pure_url=yes[/tpl] | title = Hollow Eath – Soma : Review | last = Kavadias | first = Theo | work = Allmusic | publisher = Rovi Corporation | accessdate = 25 September 2012 [/tpl]
In 1996 Soma released The Inner Cinema, which "sees the collaboration between Thrussell and Bourke evolve and deepen from the tone set by their debut" according to Kavadias.[tpl]cite web | url = [tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r532661/review |pure_url=yes[/tpl] | title = The Inner Cinema – Soma : Review | last = Kavadias | first = Theo | work = Allmusic | publisher = Rovi Corporation | accessdate = 25 September 2012 [/tpl] Stygian Vistas, an eight-track EP was released on 1 July 1997, it contains a remixes of tracks from the first two albums plus three new songs.[tpl]cite web | url = [tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r302883/review |pure_url=yes[/tpl] | title = Stygian Vistas – Soma : Review | last = Raggett | first = Ned | work = Allmusic | publisher = Rovi Corporation | accessdate = 25 September 2012 [/tpl] Bourke and Thrussell took a hiatus from Soma to work on other projects, they re-emerged in 2000 with a four-track CD EP, My Ancient Vihmaana.

===Collaborations with Lisa Gerrard===

In 1995 Pieter Bourke began working with Lisa Gerrard, co-founder of the world music group, Dead Can Dance. Bourke provided bass guitar, darabeka, drums, hand clapping, tabla and backing vocals on Gerrard’s first solo album, The Mirror Pool (August 1995).[tpl]cite web | url = [tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r223726/credits |pure_url=yes[/tpl] | title = The Mirror Pool – Lisa Gerrard : Credits | work = Allmusic | publisher = Rovi Corporation | accessdate = 25 September 2012 [/tpl] He became a touring member of her band for concerts in Europe and North America. In late 1996 Bourke played keyboards and percussion for Dead Can Dance on their Spiritchaser Tour, to promote the band's album of the same name (June 1996). His favourite instruments, at the time, were the Near Eastern tar and Egyptian darabukka.
In 1997 Gerrard invited Bourke to perform on her second solo album, Duality. As well as playing percussion and keyboards, Bourke was asked to engineer and co-produce the recordings. As work progressed, Bourke’s role expanded from session musician and recording assistant to full partner. The album was co-credited to Gerrard and Bourke and released on 14 April 1998 on the 4AD Records label.[tpl]cite web | url = [tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r347142/ |pure_url=yes[/tpl] | title = Duality – Lisa Gerrard | last = Raggett | first = Ned | work = Allmusic | publisher = Rovi Corporation | accessdate = 25 September 2012 [/tpl] All the tracks were co-written by Bourke and Gerrard, except "Tempest" which is co-credited to Bourke, Gerrard and Iranian musician, Madjid Khaladj. Raggett observed that "Bourke's own contributions ... mesh excellently with her instrumental work and, since no specific credit appears instrument for instrument, everything works as a true partnership". According to Michael Lund of Last Sigh Magazine, "Gerrard has commented that the recording process of Duality was one of rare synchronicity, and that her and Bourke experienced moments of spiritual elevation while creating the music".[tpl]cite web | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20090603012909/http://www.lastsigh.com/reviews/gerrardduality.htm | url = http://www.lastsigh.com/reviews/gerrardduality.htm | work = Last Sigh Magazine | title = Lisa Gerrard & Pieter Bourke – Duality | first = Michael C | last = Lund | archivedate = 3 June 2009 | date = 17 May 1998 | accessdate = 25 September 2012 | issn = 1529-5826 | publisher = K. A. Alexander [/tpl] "The Human Game" was released as a single from the album, accompanied by a music video. The album also contains "Sacrifice" which is used in film and television shows.
In 1998 Bourke and Gerrard were asked by Italian director Ivana Massetti to contribute music to Nadro, a French documentary on West African visual artist, poet and author, Frederic Bruly Bouabre. Two tracks from the score were included on "The Human Game" CD single: "Awakening" and "Jungabya". In 1999 Bourke and Gerrard composed the soundtrack for the film, The Insider by American director, Michael Mann. Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine stated their score was "eerie and haunting, somewhere between ambient and new age, but always evocative and cinematic. This may be a strange choice for a seemingly dry journalism tale, but it works terrifically and gives a good sense of how unusual and unpredictable The Insider is".[tpl]cite web | url = [tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r441752/ |pure_url=yes[/tpl] | title = The Insider – Lisa Gerrard | last = Erlewine | first = Stephen Thomas | authorlink = Stephen Thomas Erlewine | work = Allmusic | publisher = Rovi Corporation | accessdate = 25 September 2012 [/tpl] In January 2000 the film received three Golden Globe Award nominations, including 'Best Original Score' for Bourke and Gerrard.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.goldenglobes.org/browse/year/1999 | title = The 57th Annual Golden Globe Awards (2000) | publisher = Hollywood Foreign Press Association | accessdate = 25 September 2012 [/tpl] In 2001 Bourke and Gerrard scored Mann’s next film, a bio-pic about World Boxing Champion, Muhammad Ali. In January 2002 the film, Ali, also received a Golden Globe Award nomination for 'Best Original Score'.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.goldenglobes.org/browse/year/2001 | title=The 59th Annual Golden Globe Awards (2002) | publisher = Hollywood Foreign Press Association | accessdate = 25 September 2012 [/tpl]

===Secret Masters===

In 2001 Pieter Bourke established a dub reggae duo, Secret Masters, in collaboration with club DJ, Brian Westbrook (aka Donnie Dub). Back in 1993 Bourke had met Westbrook, who provided cello on Eden's Healingbow. In 2004 Secret Masters' debut album, The Lost Dub Tapes, was released on their self-funded label, Master Tunes.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.abc.net.au/rn/legacy/programs/deepend/stories/2004/1209644.htm | title = Secret Masters | last = Smith | first = Amanda | publisher = Radio National.
