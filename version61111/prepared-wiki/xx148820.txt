His career as a TV presenter had its ups and downs throughout the 90s.  Although he had a strong female following, his explicit right-wing position and unstable relations with co-workers led to frequent job losses.  
After his breakthrough on TV Mulher, Clodovil was fired from the female-oriented programme hosted by Marilia Gabriela and sexologist/current São Paulo Brazilian Secretary of Tourism, Marta Suplicy. In 1982, when Walter Clark[tpl]disambiguation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl], Globo's former director general, was invited to become a director on the Rede Bandeirantes network, Clodovil hosted his programme. In the 1993 TV season, Clodovil hosted a show in Rede Manchete, however the network, based in Rio de Janeiro, suffered a severe financial crisis and strike action as well as a suspension of part of its scheduled national broadcast. Adolpho Bloch regained control of the network by legal determination and Clodovil left the channel in the first days of May due to past differences with his ex-boss.
In 2006 in São Paulo, Clodovil was depicted in a musical. He defended the preservation of Mata Atlântica in the Ubatuba region and minority rights in the lower house. His future project was Casa Clô, a foundation attended by women not helped by official social assistance programmes.
Clodovil trained as an actor and as a singer. He designed the evening gowns for Miss Brasil and Miss Universe Sandra Mara Ferreira and Sandra Guimarães de Oliveira.
