Captain America is an American fictional character, a superhero who appears in comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character first appeared in Captain America Comics #1 (cover-dated March 1941) from Marvel Comics' 1940s predecessor, Timely Comics, and was created by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby. As of 2007, an estimated 210 million copies of "Captain America" comic books had been sold in 75 countries.[tpl]Cite web | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17499797/|title= Death to 'America': Comic-book hero killed off|publisher= MSNBC|date= March 7, 2007|archiveurl=http://liveweb.archive.org/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/17499797|archivedate=February 2, 2012|deadurl=no[/tpl] For nearly all of the character's publication history, Captain America has been the alter ego of Steve Rogers, a frail young man who was enhanced to the peak of human perfection by an experimental serum, in order to aid the United States government's imminent efforts in World War II. Captain America wears a costume that bears an American flag motif, and is armed with a nearly indestructible shield that can be used for defense and can also be thrown as a weapon."Bullpen Bulletins: Stan's Soapbox" in Marvel Comics cover-dated December 1999
An intentionally patriotic creation who was often depicted fighting the Axis powers of World War II, Captain America was Timely Comics' most popular character during the 1940s wartime period. After the war ended, the character's popularity waned and the comic had been discontinued by 1950 aside from an ill-fated 1953 revival. Captain America was re-introduced by Marvel Comics during the Silver Age of comics, as an M.I.A soldier retrieved from an iceberg and awakened from suspended animation by the superhero team the Avengers in The Avengers #4 (March 1964). Since then, Captain America has often led the team, as well as starring in his own series.
Steve Rogers was purportedly assassinated in Captain America vol. 5, #25 (March 2007), although he was later revealed to be alive. The comic-book series Captain America continued to be published,[tpl]Cite web | url= http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=104091|title=Marvel's Statement on Captain America #25|publisher= Newsarama| date= March 7, 2007|first= Matt|last= Brady|accessdate= March 7, 2007|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/5vZHFKjf3|archivedate=January 7, 2011|deadurl= yes[/tpl] with Rogers' former sidekick, James "Bucky" Barnes, having taken up the mantle until Rogers eventually again assumed the role.
Captain America was the first Marvel Comics character adapted into another medium, with the release of the 1944 movie serial Captain America. Since then, the character has been featured in several other films and television series, including Chris Evans' portrayal in Captain America: The First Avenger, The Avengers, and Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Captain America was ranked sixth on IGN's Top 100 Comic Book Heroes.

==Publication history==

===Golden Age===

In 1940, writer Joe Simon conceived the idea for Captain America and made a sketch of the character in costume.1974 Comic Art Convention program, cover "I wrote the name 'Super American' at the bottom of the page," Simon said in his autobiography, and then considered that, 
[tpl]quote|No, it didn't work. There were too many 'Supers' around. 'Captain America' had a good sound to it. There weren't a lot of captains in comics. It was as easy as that. The boy companion was simply named Bucky, after my friend Bucky Pierson, a star on our high school basketball team."[tpl]Cite book |last= Simon|first= Joe|coauthors= Simon, Jim|title= The Comic Book Makers|publisher= Crestwood/II|year= 1990|page= 50|isbn= 978-1-887591-35-5[/tpl] Reissued by Vanguard Productions in 2003.[/tpl]
Simon recalled in his autobiography that Timely Comics publisher Martin Goodman gave him the go-ahead and directed that a Captain America solo comic book series be published as soon as possible. Needing to fill a full comic with primarily one character's stories, Simon did not believe that his regular creative partner, artist Jack Kirby, could handle the workload alone:
Al Liederman would ink that first issue, which was lettered by Simon and Kirby's regular letterer, Howard Ferguson.Simon, p. 51.
Simon said Captain America was a consciously political creation; he and Kirby were morally repulsed by the actions of Nazi Germany in the years leading up to the United States' involvement in World War II and felt war was inevitable: "The opponents to the war were all quite well organized. We wanted to have our say too."[tpl]Cite book |last= Wright| first= Bradford W.|title=Comic Book Nation: The Transformation of Youth Culture in America | publisher= Johns Hopkins University Press|year= 2001|isbn= 978-0-8018-7450-5|page= 36[/tpl]

Simon noted, "When the first issue came out we got a lot of ... threatening letters and hate mail. Some people really opposed what Cap stood for." The threats, which included menacing groups of people loitering out on the street outside of the offices, proved so serious that police protection was posted with New York Mayor Fiorello La Guardia personally contacting Simon and Kirby to give his support.[tpl]cite book|last = Cronin|first = Brian|title = Was Superman a Spy?: And Other Comic Book Legends Revealed|publisher = Plume|year = 2009|pages = 135–136|isbn = 978-0-452-29532-2[/tpl]
Though preceded as a "patriotically themed superhero" by MLJ's The Shield, Captain America immediately became the most prominent and enduring of that wave of superheroes introduced in American comic books prior to and during World War II,Sanderson "1940s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 18: "Cap was not the first patriotically themed super hero, but he would become the most enduring. He was Timely's most popular hero with nearly a million copies of his comic sold per month." as evidenced by the unusual move at the time of premiering the character in his own title instead of an anthology title first. This popularity drew the attention and a complaint from MLJ that the character's triangular shield too closely resembled the chest symbol of their Shield character. In response, Goodman had Simon and Kirby create a distinctive round shield for issue 2, which went on to become an iconic element of the character.Cronin, p. 134 With his sidekick Bucky, Captain America faced Nazis, Japanese, and other threats to wartime America and the Allies. Stanley Lieber, now better known as Stan Lee, contributed to the character in issue #3 in the filler text story "Captain America Foils the Traitor's Revenge", which introduced the character's use of his shield as a returning throwing weapon.[tpl]Cite book |last= Thomas|first= Roy|authorlink = Roy Thomas|title= Stan Lee's Amazing Marvel Universe| publisher= Sterling Publishing|location= New York|year= 2006|page= 11|isbn= 978-1-4027-4225-5|quote= The line reads: "With the speed of thought, he sent his shield spinning through the air to the other end of the tent, where it smacked the knife out of Haines' hand!" It became a convention starting the following issue, in which the art in a Simon and Kirby comics story illustrates the following caption: "Captain America's speed of thought and action save Bucky's life — as he hurls his shield across the room.[/tpl] Captain America soon became Timely's most popular character and even had a fan-club called the "Sentinels of Liberty."
Circulation figures remained close to a million copies per month after the debut issue, which outstripped even the circulation of news magazines such as Time during the period.Daniels, p. 37 After the Simon and Kirby team moved to DC Comics in late 1941, having produced Captain America Comics through issue #10 (January 1942), Al Avison and Syd Shores became regular pencillers of the celebrated title, with one generally inking over the other. The character was featured in All Winners Comics #1-19 (Summer 1941 – Fall 1946), Marvel Mystery Comics #80-84 and #86-92, USA Comics #6-17 (Dec. 1942 – Fall 1945), and All Select Comics #1-10 (Fall 1943 – Summer 1946).
In the post-war era, with the popularity of superheroes fading, Captain America led Timely's first superhero team, the All-Winners Squad, in its two published adventures, in All Winners Comics #19 and #21 (Fall–Winter 1946; there was no issue #20). After Bucky was shot and wounded in a 1948 Captain America story, he was succeeded by Captain America's girlfriend, Betsy Ross, who became the superheroine Golden Girl. Captain America Comics ran until issue #73 (July 1949),Captain America Comics at the Grand Comics Database at which time the series was retitled Captain America's Weird Tales for two issues,Captain America's Weird Tales at the Grand Comics Database with the finale being a horror/suspense anthology issue with no superheroes.
Atlas Comics attempted to revive its superhero titles when it reintroduced Captain America, along with the original Human Torch and the Sub-Mariner, in Young Men #24 (Dec. 1953). Billed as "Captain America, Commie Smasher!" Captain America appeared during the next year in Young Men #24-28 and Men's Adventures #27-28, as well as in issues #76-78 of an eponymous title. Atlas' attempted superhero revival was a commercial failure,Wright, p. 123. and the character's title was canceled with Captain America #78 (Sept. 1954).

===Silver Age revival===

In the Human Torch story titled "Captain America" in Marvel Comics' Strange Tales #114 (Nov. 1963),DeFalco, Tom "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 95: "As the Human Torch had been instrumental in bringing back the Sub-Mariner in The Fantastic Four #4 (May 1962), it seemed only natural that he would help usher in Captain America." writer-editor Stan Lee and artist and co-plotter Jack Kirby depicted the brash young Fantastic Four member Johnny Storm, the Human Torch, in an exhibition performance with Captain America, described as a legendary World War II and 1950s superhero who has returned after many years of apparent retirement. The 18-page story ends with this Captain America revealed as an impostor: it was actually the villain the Acrobat, a former circus performer the Torch had defeated in Strange Tales #106, who broke two thieves out of jail, hoping to draw the police away while trying to rob the local bank. Afterward, Storm digs out an old comic book in which Captain America is shown to be Steve Rogers. A caption in the final panel says this story was a test to see if readers would like Captain America to return.
Captain America was then formally reintroduced in The Avengers #4 (March 1964),DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 99: "'Captain America lives again!' announced the cover of The Avengers #4. A mere four months after his imposter had appeared in Strange Tales #114, the real Cap was back." which explained that in the final days of World War II, he had fallen from an experimental drone plane into the North Atlantic Ocean and spent decades frozen in a block of ice in a state of suspended animation. The hero found a new generation of readers as leader of that superhero team. Following the success of other Marvel characters introduced during the 1960s, Captain America was recast as a hero "haunted by past memories, and trying to adapt to 1960s society."Wright, p. 215.
After then guest-starring in the feature "Iron Man" in Tales of Suspense #58 (Oct. 1964), Captain America gained his own solo feature in that "split book," beginning the following issue.DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 103 Issue #63 (March 1965), which retold Captain America's origin, through issue #71 (Nov. 1965) was a period feature set during World War II and co-starred Captain America's Golden Age sidekick, Bucky. Kirby drew all but two of the stories in Tales of Suspense, which became Captain America with #100 (April 1968);DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 128: "Hailing 1968 as the beginning of the 'Second Age of Marvel Comics,' and with more titles to play with, editor Stan Lee discarded his split books and gave more characters their own titles: Tales of Suspense #99 was followed by Captain America #100." Gil Kane and John Romita, Sr., each filled in once. Several stories were finished by penciller-inker George Tuska over Kirby layouts, with one finished by Romita Sr. and another by penciller Dick Ayers and inker John Tartaglione. Kirby's regular inkers on the series were Frank Giacoia (as "Frank Ray") and Joe Sinnott, though Don Heck and Golden Age Captain America artist Syd Shores inked one story each. The new title Captain America continued to feature artwork by Kirby, as well as a short run by Jim Steranko, and work by many of the industry's top artists and writers. It was called Captain America and the Falcon from #134 (Feb. 1971) to #222 (June 1978)[tpl]cite journal|last = Olshevsky|first = George|authorlink = George Olshevsky|title = Heroes From Tales of Suspense, Book One: Captain America|magazine = The Marvel Comics Index|issue = 8A|pages = 64 and 93|publisher = G&T Enterprises|date = December 1979[/tpl] although the Falcon's name was not on the cover for issues #193, 200, and 216. The 1972–1975 run on the title by writer Steve Englehart and artist Sal Buscema saw the series become one of Marvel's top-sellers.[tpl]cite book|last = Amash|first = Jim|title = Sal Buscema: Comics' Fast & Furious Artist|publisher = TwoMorrows Publishing|year = 2010|page = 46|isbn = 978-1-60549-021-2|quote= When Steve and I Buscema got on the book ... if I remember correctly, the book hit #5 in sales.

As part of the aftermath of Marvel Comics' company-crossover storyline "Civil War", Steve Rogers was ostensibly killed in Captain America vol. 5, #25 (March 2007). Series writer Ed Brubaker remarked, "What I found is that all the really hard-core left-wing fans want Cap to be standing out on and giving speeches on the street corner against the George W. Bush administration, and all the really right-wing fans all want him to be over in the streets of Baghdad, punching out Saddam Hussein."[tpl]Cite web | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/culture/2007/03/07/2007-03-07_captain_america_killed.html |title= Captain America killed!|first= Ethan|last= Sacks| work=Daily News | location= New York City | date= March 9, 2007|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/6GBO3VYly|archivedate= April 26, 2013|deadurl= no|accessdate= April 26, 2013[/tpl] The character's co-creator, Joe Simon, said, "It's a hell of a time for him to go.

===Legal status===

In 1966 Joe Simon sued the owners of Marvel Comics, asserting that he – not Marvel – was legally entitled to renew the copyright upon the expiration of the original 28-year term.  The two parties settled out of court, with Simon agreeing to a statement that the character had been created under terms of employment by the publisher, and therefore it was work for hire owned by them.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.philadelphiabar.org/page/TPLSummer03CaptainAmerica|work=The Philadelphia Lawyer| publisher= Philadelphia Bar Association |accessdate=6 August 2013|title=The Struggle for Captain America|last=Lovitz|first=Michael | archivedate= December 2, 2013 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131202222355/http://www.philadelphiabar.org/page/TPLSummer03CaptainAmerica | deadurl=no[/tpl]
In 1999, Simon filed to claim the copyright to Captain America under a provision of the Copyright Act of 1976 which allowed the original creators of works that had been sold to corporations to reclaim them after the original 56-year copyright term (but not the longer term enacted by the new legislation) had expired.  Marvel Entertainment challenged the claim, arguing that the settlement of Simon's 1966 suit made the character ineligible for termination of the copyright transfer.  Simon and Marvel settled out of court in 2003, in a deal that paid Simon royalties for merchandising and licensing use of the character.[tpl]cite web|title=Joe Simon, a Creator of Captain America, Fighting On |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/16/books/16gust.html?pagewanted=all|work=The New York Times|first=George Gene | last = Gustines | accessdate=6 August 2013[/tpl]

Disturbed by the rise of the Third Reich, Rogers attempts to enlist, only to be rejected due to his physically frail body.

The serum is a success, and transforms the frail Steve Rogers into a perfect specimen—a nearly perfect human being with peak strength, agility, stamina, and intelligence. The success of the program leaves Erskine wondering about replicating the experiment on other human beings. The process itself has been inconsistently detailed: while in the original material Steve Rogers is shown receiving injections of the Super-Serum, when the origin was retold in the 1960s, the Comic Code Authority had already put a veto over graphic description of drug intake and abuse, and thus the Super-Serum was retconned into an oral formula.[tpl]cite comic| writer= Lee, Stan|penciller= Kirby, Jack|inker= Giacoia, Frank|story= The Origin of Captain America!|title= Tales of Suspense|issue= 63|date= March 1965[/tpl] Later accounts hint at a combination of oral and intravenous treatments with a strenuous training regimen, culminating in the Vita-Ray exposure.
Erskine refused to write down every crucial element of the treatment, leaving behind a flawed, imperfect knowledge of the needed steps. Thus, when the Nazi spy Heinz Kruger killed him, Erskine's method of creating new Super-Soldiers died as well. Captain America, in his first act after his transformation, avenges Erskine. In the 1941 origin story and in Tales of Suspense #63, Kruger dies when running into machinery but is not killed by Rogers; in the Captain America #109 and #255 revisions, Rogers causes the spy's death by punching him into machinery.
Unable to create new Super-Soldiers, and willing to hide the Project Rebirth fiasco, the American government casts the now-powerful Rogers as a patriotic superhero, able to counter the menace of the Red Skull as a counter-intelligence agent. As such, he's supplied with a patriotic uniform designed by Rogers himself, a bulletproof shield, a personal side arm, and the codename Captain America, while posing as a clumsy infantry private at Camp Lehigh in Virginia. He forms a friendship with the camp's teenage mascot, James Buchanan "Bucky" Barnes.
Eventually Barnes learns of Rogers' dual identity and offers to keep the secret if he can become Captain America's sidekick, being trained himself to act as the perfect partner. During their adventures, Franklin D. Roosevelt presents Captain America with a new shield, forged from an alloy of steel and vibranium, fused by an unknown catalyst, so effective that it replaces his own firearm. Throughout World War II, Captain America and Bucky fight the Nazi menace both on their own and as members of the superhero team the Invaders as seen in the 1970s comic of the same name.[tpl]cite comic| writer= Thomas, Roy|penciller= Robbins, Frank|inker= Colletta, Vince|story= A Captain Called America|title= Giant-Size Invaders|issue= 1|date= June 1975[/tpl] Captain America battles a number of criminal menaces on American soil, including a wide variety of costumed villains: the Wax Man,[tpl]cite comic| writer= Simon, Joe; Kirby, Jack|penciller= Simon, Joe; Kirby, Jack|inker= Simon, Joe|story= The Wax Statue That Struck Death|title= Captain America Comics|issue= 2|date= April 1941[/tpl] the Hangman,[tpl]cite comic| writer= Simon, Joe; Kirby, Jack|penciller= Simon, Joe; Kirby, Jack|inker= Simon, Joe|story= The Strange Case of Captain America and The Hangman: Who Killed Doctor Vordoff|title= Captain America Comics|issue= 6|date= September 1941[/tpl] the Fang,[tpl]cite comic| writer= Simon, Joe; Kirby, Jack|penciller= Simon, Joe; Kirby, Jack|inker= Simon, Joe|story= Meet the Fang, Arch-Fiend of the Orient|title= Captain America Comics|issue= 6|date= September 1941[/tpl] the Black Talon,[tpl]cite comic| writer= Binder, Otto|penciller= Kirby, Jack|inker= Shores, Syd|story= The Case of the Black Talon|title= Captain America Comics|issue= 9|date= December 1941[/tpl] and the White Death,[tpl]cite comic| writer= Simon, Joe; Kirby, Jack|penciller= Kirby, Jack|inker= Simon, Joe|story= The White Death|title= Captain America Comics|issue= 9|date= December 1941[/tpl] among others.
In addition to sidekick Bucky, Captain America was occasionally assisted by the Sentinels of Liberty.[tpl]cite journal|last=Dittmer|first=Jason|title=``America is safe while its boys and girls believe in its creeds!: Captain America and American identity prior to World War 2|journal=Environment and Planning D: Society and Space|date=March 23, 2007|volume=25|pages=401–423[/tpl]  Sentinels of Liberty was the title given to members of the Captain America Comics fan club who Captain America would sometimes address as an aside, or as characters in the Captain America Comics'' stories.
In late April 1945, during the closing days of World War II, Captain America and Bucky try to stop the villainous Baron Zemo from destroying an experimental drone plane. Zemo launches the plane with an armed explosive on it with Rogers and Barnes in hot pursuit. The pair reach the plane just before take off. When Bucky tries to defuse the bomb, it explodes in mid-air. The young man is believed killed. Rogers is hurled into the freezing waters of the North Atlantic. Neither is found, and both are presumed dead. It is later revealed that neither character actually died.

===Late 1940s to 1950s===

Captain America continued to appear in comics for the next few years changing from World War II-era hero fighting against the Nazis to confronting the United States' newest enemy, Communism. The revival of the character in the mid-1950s was short-lived, and events during that time period are later retconned to show that multiple people operated using the code name to explain the changes in the character. These post World War II successors are listed as William Naslund and Jeffrey Mace.
The last of these other official Captains, William Burnside,[tpl]cite comic| writer= Brubaker, Ed|penciller= Ross, Luke|inker= Guice, Butch; Ross, Luke|story= Two Americas Part 1|title= Captain America|issue= 602|date= March 2010[/tpl] was a history graduate enamored with the Captain America mythos, going so far to have his appearance surgically altered to resemble Rogers and legally change his name to "Steve Rogers", becoming the new "1950s Captain America".[tpl]cite comic| writer= Englehart, Steve|penciller= Buscema, Sal|inker= Mooney, Jim|story= Captain America--Hero Or Hoax?|title= Captain America|issue= 153|date= September 1972[/tpl] He self-administered to himself and his pupil James "Jack" Monroe a flawed, incomplete copy of the Super-Serum, which made no mention about the necessary Vita-Ray portion of the treatment. As a result, while Burnside and Monroe became the new Captain America and Bucky, they became violently paranoid, often raving about innocent people being communist sympathizers during the height of the Red Scare of the 1950s. Their insanity forced the U.S. government to place both of them in indefinite cryogenic storage until they could be cured of their mental illness.[tpl]cite comic| writer= Englehart, Steve|penciller= Buscema, Sal|inker= McLaughlin, Frank|story= One Into Two Won't Go!|title= Captain America|issue= 156|date= December 1972[/tpl] Monroe would later be cured and assume the Nomad identity.[tpl]cite comic| writer= DeMatteis, J.

===1960s to 1970s===

Years later, the superhero team the Avengers discovers Steve Rogers' body in the North Atlantic, the Captain's uniform under his soldier's fatigues and still carrying his shield. After he revives, they piece together that Rogers had been preserved in a block of ice since 1945, surviving in such a state only because of his enhancements from Operation: Rebirth. The block had begun to melt after the Sub-Mariner, enraged that an Inuit tribe is worshipping the frozen figure, throws it into the ocean.[tpl]cite comic| writer= Lee, Stan|penciller= Kirby, Jack|inker= Roussos, George|story= Captain America Joins ... The Avengers!|title= The Avengers|issue= 4|date= March 1964[/tpl] Rogers accepts membership in the Avengers, and although long out of his time, his considerable experience both in individual combat service and his time with the Invaders makes him a valuable asset to the team. He quickly assumes leadership,[tpl]cite comic| writer= Lee, Stan|penciller= Kirby, Jack|inker= Ayers, Dick|story= The Old Order Changeth|title= The Avengers|issue= 16|date= May 1965[/tpl] and has typically returned to that position throughout the team's history.
Captain America is plagued by guilt for having been unable to prevent Bucky's death. Although he takes the young Rick Jones (who closely resembles Bucky) under his tutelage, he refuses for some time to allow Jones to take up the Bucky identity, not wishing to be responsible for another youth's death. Insisting that his hero finally move on from that loss, Jones eventually convinces Rogers to let him don the Bucky costume,[tpl]cite comic| writer= Lee, Stan|penciller= Steranko, Jim|inker= Sinnott, Joe|story= No Longer Alone!|title= Captain America|issue= 110|date= February 1969[/tpl] but this partnership lasts only a short time; a disguised Red Skull, impersonating Rogers with the help of the Cosmic Cube, drives Jones away.
Rogers reunites with his old war comrade Nick Fury, who is similarly well-preserved due to the "Infinity Formula." As a result, Rogers regularly undertakes missions for the security agency S.H.I.E.L.D. for which Fury is public director.[tpl]cite comic| writer= Lee, Stan|penciller= Kirby, Jack|inker= Giacoia, Frank|story= Them!|title= Tales of Suspense|issue= 78|date= June 1966[/tpl] Through Fury, Rogers befriends Sharon Carter, a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent,[tpl]cite comic| writer= Lee, Stan|penciller= Kirby,, Jack; Ayers, Dick|inker= Tartaglione, John|story= 30 Minutes to Live!|title= Tales of Suspense|issue= 75|date= March 1966[/tpl] with whom he eventually begins a romantic relationship.

This additionally explained how nemesis the Red Skull, who at the time inhabited a body cloned from Rogers' cells, has the formula in his body.
Because of his altered biochemistry, Rogers' body begins to deteriorate, and for a time he must wear a powered exoskeleton and is eventually placed again in suspended animation.

Following Gruenwald's departure from the series, Mark Waid took over and resurrected Sharon Carter as Cap's love interest. The title was then relaunched under Rob Liefeld as Cap became part of the Heroes Reborn universe for 13 issuesManning, Matthew K. "1990s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 280: "Steve Rogers earned a fresh start in the Heroes Reborn universe by writer Jeph Loeb and artist Rob Liefeld." before another relaunch restored Waid to the titleManning "1990s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 288: "Writer Mark Waid began what many fans atill consider to be the ultimate run on the Captain America title with this series penciled by Ron Garney." in an arc that saw Cap lose his shield for a time using an energy based shield as a temporary replacement. Following Waid's run, Dan Jurgens took over and introduced new foe Protocide, a failed recipient of the Super Soldier serum prior to the experiment that successfully created Rogers.

===2000s===

In the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks, Rogers reveals his identity to the world and establishes a residence in the Red Hook neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York, as seen in Captain America vol. 4, #1-7 (June 2002 – Feb. 2003).Manning "2000s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 312: "The darker Marvel Knights line of books accepted Steve Rogers under their umbrella as writer John Ney Rieber and artist John Cassaday restarted the series with a new first issue." Following the disbandment of the Avengers in the "Avengers Disassembled" story arc, Rogers, now employed by S.H.I.E.L.D., discovers Bucky is alive, having been saved and deployed by the Soviets as the Winter Soldier. Rogers resumes his on-again, off-again relationship with S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Sharon Carter.
In the 2006–2007 company-wide story arc "Civil War", and its anchoring, seven-issue miniseries, Civil War (July 2006 - Jan. 2007), Rogers opposes the new mandatory federal registration of super-powered beings, and leads the underground anti-registration movement. After significant rancor and danger to the public as the two sides clash, Captain America voluntarily surrenders and orders the Anti-Registration forces to stand down.
In the story arc "The Death of Captain America", Rogers is indicted on criminal charges for his anti-registration efforts, and in Captain America vol. 5, #25 (April 2007) is shot outside a federal courthouse; taken to a hospital, he is pronounced dead.Manning "2000s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 335: "Surprising an unsuspecting fan base who thought the worst was over for Steve Rogers, Captain America's death captured worldwide media attention." The assassination, orchestrated by the Red Skull, involves Crossbones as a sniper and Dr. Faustus, who poses as a S.H.I.E.L.D. psychiatrist and gives Carter a hypnotic suggestion to surreptitiously shoot Rogers at close range during the chaos surrounding the sniper shot.
The miniseries Fallen Son: The Death of Captain America #1-5 (June–Aug. 2007) follows the stunned superhero community after the apparent assassination. Captain America is purportedly laid to rest in Arlington National Cemetery, but Tony Stark (Iron Man) and others have actually returned Rogers' body to the Arctic where Rogers had been found years before, and whereupon Namor swore to guard him. In Captain America vol. 5, #30 (Sept. 2007), Stark, who previously had tried to convince close friend and colleague of both Rogers and Stark, Clint Barton to take up the role, receives a letter containing Rogers' request that Bucky become the next Captain America, which Bucky agrees to do four issues later. Adopting the original shield, he dons a new costume incorporating a pistol and a knife. The Norse god superhero Thor communicates with what appears to be Rogers' spirit on the first anniversary of Rogers' death, in Thor vol. 3, #11 (Oct. 2008).
Captain America: Reborn #1 (Aug. 2009) reveals that Rogers did not die, and that the gun Sharon Carter had been hypnotized to use had actually caused Rogers to phase in and out of space and time, appearing at events in his lifetime and fighting battles. The Skull returns Rogers to the present, where he takes control of Rogers' mind and body. Rogers eventually regains control, and with help from his allies, defeats the Skull in the fourth and final issues of this miniseries. In the subsequent one-shot comic Captain America: Who Will Wield the Shield?, Rogers formally grants Bucky his Captain America shield and asks his former sidekick to continue as Captain America. The American President grants Rogers a full pardon for his anti-registration actions.

==Powers and abilities==

Captain America has no superhuman powers, but through the Super-Soldier Serum and "Vita-Ray" treatment, he is transformed and his strength, endurance, agility, speed, reflexes, durability, and healing are at the zenith of natural human potential. Rogers' body regularly replenishes the super-soldier serum; it does not wear off.
The formula enhances all of his metabolic functions and prevents the build-up of fatigue poisons in his muscles, giving him endurance far in excess of an ordinary human being. This accounts for many of his extraordinary feats, including bench pressing 1200 pounds (545 kg) and running a mile (1.6 km) in 73 seconds (49 mph/78 kph).[tpl]cite comic| writer= Brubaker, Ed|penciller= Pulido, Javier; Martín, Marcos; Perkins, Mike|inker= Pulido, Javier; Martín, Marcos; Perkins, Mike|story= Secrets of Iron & Fire|title= Captain America 65th Anniversary Special|issue= 1|date= May 2006[/tpl] Furthermore, his enhancements are the reason why he was able to survive being frozen in suspended animation for decades. He is highly resistant to hypnosis or gases that could limit his focus.[tpl]cite comic| writer= Busiek, Kurt|penciller= Pérez, George|inker= Pérez, George|story= Book Four: The Brave and the Bold|title= Avengers/JLA|issue= 4|date= March 2005[/tpl] The secrets of creating a super-soldier were lost with the death of its creator, Dr. Abraham Erskine. In the ensuing decades there have been numerous attempts to recreate Erskine's treatment, only to have them end in failure. Even worse, the attempts have instead often created psychopathic supervillains of which Captain America's 1950s imitator and Nuke are the most notorious examples.
Rogers' battle experience and training make him an expert tactician and an excellent field commander, with his teammates frequently deferring to his orders in battle. Thor has stated that Rogers is one of the very few humans he will take orders from and follow "through the gates of Hades".[tpl]cite comic| writer= Shooter,, Jim|penciller= Zeck, Mike|inker= Beatty, John|story= The War Begins|title= Marvel Super-Heroes Secret Wars|issue= 1|date= May 1984[/tpl] Rogers' reflexes and senses are extraordinarily keen. He has blended judo, western boxing, kickboxing, and gymnastics into his own unique fighting style and is a master of multiple martial arts. Years of practice with his near-indestructible shield make him able to aim and throw it with almost unerring accuracy. His skill with his shield is such that he can attack multiple targets in succession with a single throw or even cause a boomerang-like return from a throw to attack an enemy from behind. In canon, he is regarded by other skilled fighters as one of the best hand-to-hand combatants in the Marvel Universe, limited only by his human physique.[tpl]cite comic| writer= Carlin, Mike|penciller= Neary,, Paul|inker= Janke, Dennis|story= And Other Strangers|title= Captain America|issue= 302|date= February 1985[/tpl][tpl]cite comic| writer= Gruenwald, Mark|penciller= Lim, Ron|inker= Bulandi, Danny|story= The Devil You Know|title= Captain America|issue= 375|date= Late August 1990[/tpl] Although the super-soldier serum is an important part of his strength, Rogers has shown himself still sufficiently capable against stronger opponents, even when the serum has been deactivated reverting him to his pre-Captain America physique.[tpl]cite comic| writer= Brubaker, Ed|penciller= Eaglesham, Dale|inker= Eaglesham, Dale|story= For a lot of my childhood ... |title= Steve Rogers: Super-Soldier|issue= 3|date= November 2010[/tpl]
Rogers has vast U.S. military knowledge and is often shown to be familiar with ongoing, classified Defense Department operations. He is an expert in combat strategy, survival, acrobatics, military strategy, piloting, and demolitions. Despite his high profile as one of the world's most popular and recognizable superheroes, Rogers has a broad understanding of the espionage community, largely through his ongoing relationship with S.H.I.E.L.D. He is a talented artist, and has worked on the Captain America comic book published in the Marvel universe. Other career fields include commercial arts, teaching high school history, and law enforcement.
Although he lacks superhuman strength, Captain America is one of the few mortal beings who has been deemed worthy enough to wield Thor's hammer Mjolnir.[tpl]cite comic| writer= DeFalco, Tom|penciller= Frenz, Ron|inker= Breeding, Brett|story= The Hero and the Hammer|title= Thor|issue= 390|date= April 1988[/tpl]

===Weapons and equipment===

Captain America has used multiple shields throughout his history, the most prevalent of which is a nigh-indestructible disc-shaped shield made from an experimental alloy of steel and the fictional vibranium.[tpl]cite comic| writer= Carlin, Mike|penciller= Neary, Paul|inker= Janke, Dennis|story= Double Dare|title= Captain America|issue= 303|date= March 1985[/tpl][tpl]cite comic| writer= Carlin, Mike|penciller= Neary, Paul|inker= Janke, Dennis|story= Undercover of the Night|title= Captain America|issue= 304|date= April 1985[/tpl] The shield was cast by American metallurgist Dr. Myron MacLain, who was contracted by the U.S. government, from orders of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, to create an impenetrable substance to use for tanks during World War II. This alloy was created by accident and never duplicated, although efforts to reverse-engineer it resulted in the discovery of adamantium.[tpl]cite comic| writer= Thomas, Roy|penciller= Smith,, Barry|inker= Shores, Syd|story= Betrayal|title= The Avengers|issue= 66|date= July 1969[/tpl]
Captain America often uses his shield as an offensive throwing weapon. The first instance of Captain America's trademark ricocheting shield-toss occurs in Stan Lee's first comics writing, the two-page text story "Captain America Foils the Traitor's Revenge" in Captain America Comics #3 (May 1941). The legacy of the shield among other comics characters includes the time-traveling mutant superhero Cable telling Captain America that his shield still exists in one of the possible futures; Cable carries it into battle and brandishes it as a symbol.[tpl]cite comic| writer= Nicieza, Fabian|penciller= Medina, Lan|inker= Tadeo, Ed|story= Living Legends|title= Cable & Deadpool|issue= 25|date= April 2006[/tpl]
When without his trademark shield, Captain America sometimes uses other shields made from less durable metals such as steel,[tpl]cite comic| writer= Waid, Mark|penciller= Garney, Ron|inker= Wiacek, Bob|story= Museum Piece|title= Captain America|volume= 3|issue= 3|date= March 1998[/tpl] or even a photonic energy shield designed to mimic a vibranium matrix.[tpl]cite comic| writer= Waid, Mark|penciller= Kubert, Andy|inker= Delperdang, Jesse|story= American Nightmare, Chapter One: The Bite of Madness!|title= Captain America|volume= 3|issue= 9|date= September 1998[/tpl] Rogers, having relinquished his regular shield to Barnes, carried a variant of the energy shield which can be used with either arm, and used to either block attacks or as an improvised offensive weapon able to cut through metal with relative ease.[tpl]cite comic| writer= Brubaker, Ed|penciller= Eaglesham, Dale|inker= Eaglesham, Dale|story= In 1940, the first Professor Erskine created what became ... |title= Steve Rogers: Super-Soldier|issue= 4|date= December 2010[/tpl] Much like his vibranium shield, the energy shield can be thrown, including ricocheting off multiple surfaces and returning to his hand.[tpl]cite comic| writer= McCann, Jim|penciller= Diaz, Paco; Dragotta, Nick|inker= Diaz, Paco; Dragotta, Nick|story= Off-Target!|title= Hawkeye: Blindspot|issue= 2|date= May 2011[/tpl]
Captain America's uniform is made of a fire-retardant material, and he wears a lightweight, bulletproof "duralumin" scale armor beneath his uniform for added protection. Originally, Rogers' mask was a separate piece of material, but an early engagement had it dislodged, thus almost exposing his identity. To prevent a recurrence of the situation, Rogers modified the mask with connecting material to his uniform, an added benefit of which was extending his armor to cover his previously exposed neck. As a member of the Avengers, Rogers has an Avengers priority card, which serves as a communications device.
Captain America has used a custom specialized motorcycle, modified by the S.H.I.E.L.D. weapons laboratory, as well as a custom-built battle van, constructed by the Wakanda Design Group with the ability to change its color for disguise purposes (red, white and blue), and fitted to store and conceal the custom motorcycle in its rear section with a frame that allows Rogers to launch from the vehicle riding it.

==Enemies==

Captain America has faced numerous foes in over 70 years of published adventures. Many of his recurring foes embody ideals contrary to the American values Captain America is shown to strive for and believe. Some examples of these opposing values are Nazism (Red Skull, Baron Zemo), Neo-Nazism (Crossbones, Doctor Faustus), technocratic fascism (AIM, Arnim Zola), Communism (Aleksander Lukin), anarchism (Flag Smasher), and international and domestic terrorism (HYDRA).
