Messier did his observing with 100&nbsp;mm (four inch) [[refracting telescope]] from Hôtel de Cluny (now the [[Musée national du Moyen Âge]]), in [[Paris]], [[France]]. The list he compiled contains only objects found in the sky area he could observe: from the north [[celestial pole]] to a celestial latitude of about −35.7° and are not organized scientifically by object type, or even by location.
The first version of Messier's catalogue contained 45 objects and was published in 1774 in the journal of the French Academy of Sciences in Paris. The final version of the catalogue was published in 1781, in Connoissance des Temps for 1784.[ref]Charles Messier, 1781. Catalogue des Nébuleuses & des amas d'Étoiles.
