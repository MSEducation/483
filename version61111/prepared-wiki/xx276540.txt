CATEGORIES: Max Planck Society

The Max Planck Society Archive is the collection of records and research materials of the Max Planck Society (formerly the Kaiser Wilhelm Society). Records have been allegedly hidden from access or destroyed.Gretchen E. Schafft, "From Racism to Genocide: Anthropology in the Third Reich", Univ. of Illinois Press, 2004, p. 230-231 In 2004's From Racism to Genocide: Anthropology in the Third Reich, Gretchen E. Schafft conveys reports that users of the archive have been denied the right to copy content without express approval of the director and, in 2001, told that they could only access records if they could identify them by name. At that time, records of the Institute for German Work in the East (IDO) were not made available at all. Gretchen E. Schafft, "From Racism to Genocide: Anthropology in the Third Reich", Univ. of Illinois Press, 2004, p. 232
