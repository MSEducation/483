[[Achnahaird Bay]]

CATEGORIES: Ross and Cromarty, Geography of Highland (council area), Bays of Scotland

Achnahaird Bay is located on the Coigach peninsula, Wester Ross, Scotland, and can be reached by following the road to the scattered settlement of Achiltibuie. The beautiful, wide sandy beach and stunning views of the mountains Stac Pollaidh, Canisp and Suilven mean the area is popular with tourists (and locals) on hot summer days.
Achnahaird Bay was used as a filming location for the 2011 film The Eagle, with a horse chase scene across the beach.
There is a caravan site a stone's throw from the beach.
