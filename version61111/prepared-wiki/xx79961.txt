[[Bandgap voltage reference]]

CATEGORIES: Electronic circuits, Analog circuits

A bandgap voltage reference is a temperature independent voltage reference circuit widely used in integrated circuits. It produces a fixed (constant) voltage irrespective of power supply variations, temperature changes and the loading on the device. Usually it has an output voltage around 1.25 V, close to the theoretical 1.22 eV bandgap of silicon at 0 K.  This circuit concept was first published by David Hilbiber in 1964.[ref]
