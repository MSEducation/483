Notorious MSG is a performing trio of Asian American rappers founded in 2002 in Chinatown, Manhattan, New York City. Their songs feature lyrics about gangster lifestyles and Chinese food and boasting innuendos regarding women. Their group name is a parody of Brooklyn rapper The Notorious B.I.G., with "MSG" referring to monosodium glutamate, a sodium additive commonly used in Americanized East Asian cuisines.

==History==

Notorious MSG started in stories for themselves to explain their reasons for forming the group. According to this story, they all met in the kitchen of the Chinese restaurant in which they worked, but decided middle class origin, pointing to evidence which includes a reference to Cornell University in one of their songs.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.asianweek.com/news/view_article.html?article_id=908ab01d839399e86663f3785c1b734c|date=2005-02-04|accessdate=2007-06-15|last=Liu|first=Ling|publisher=Asian Week|title=Notorious MSG in the House! |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071010050305/http://news.asianweek.com/news/view_article.html?article_id=908ab01d839399e86663f3785c1b734c  |archivedate = 2007-10-10[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/display.php?id=1482|title=Music Review: Pacific Rimshot (Reviewed: Notorious MSG's Lunch Money EP)|publisher=Washington City Paper|last=Mazmanian|first=Adam|date=2007-05-10|accessdate=2007-06-15[/tpl]

===Supporting members===

In 2006, PRI's The World reported that the trio was in negotiations with Comedy Central to develop a series.
Notorious MSG's website had a few singles for download. Their first cut, "Wok the Party", was received with mediocre fanfare. Shortly thereafter, they released three singles (such as Chinatown Hustler) that showed their potential for splicing rhymes to background beats, and garnered much popularity.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2007[/tpl]
