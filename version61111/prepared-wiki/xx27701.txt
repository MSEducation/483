According to Acts [tpl]Bibleverse-nb||Acts|11:27-28[/tpl], he was one of a group who came to Antioch from Jerusalem. Agabus had received the gift of prophecy, and predicted a severe famine that the author says came under the reign of the Roman Emperor Claudius.Maas, Anthony. "Agabus." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 1. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 14 Jan. 2014
According to Acts [tpl]Bibleverse-nb||Acts|21:10-12[/tpl] in 58 AD, he met Paul of Tarsus at Caesarea Maritima and warned him of his coming capture; he bound his own hands and feet with Paul's belt to demonstrate what would happen if he continued his journey to Jerusalem, though Paul would not be persuaded to stay away.
He went to many countries, teaching and converting many. This moved the Jews of Jerusalem to arrest him, and they tortured him by beating him severely, and putting a rope around his neck. He was dragged outside the city and stoned to death. Maas says he was martyred at Antioch.
