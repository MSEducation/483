 The results of this study found that the only significant genetic factor was the person's [[blood type]]. Having had a stroke in the past greatly increases one's risk of future strokes.
Men are 25% more likely to suffer strokes than women,
 yet 60% of deaths from stroke occur in women.
 Since women live longer, they are older on average when they have their strokes and thus more often killed (NIMH 2002).
 Some risk factors for stroke apply only to women. Primary among these are pregnancy, childbirth, menopause and the treatment thereof (HRT).

==History==

Episodes of stroke and familial stroke have been reported from the 2nd millennium BC onward in ancient Mesopotamia and Persia.[tpl]cite journal |author=Ashrafian H |title= Familial stroke 2700 years ago |journal=Stroke |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=e187 |year=2010 |pmid= 20185778 |doi= 10.1161/STROKEAHA.109.573170|url=[/tpl] Hippocrates (460 to 370 BC) was first to describe the phenomenon of sudden paralysis that is often associated with ischemia. Apoplexy, from the Greek word meaning "struck down with violence," first appeared in Hippocratic writings to describe this phenomenon.

The word stroke was used as a synonym for apoplectic seizure as early as 1599,R. Barnhart, ed. The Barnhart Concise Dictionary of Etymology (1995) and is a fairly literal translation of the Greek term.
In 1658, in his Apoplexia, Johann Jacob Wepfer (1620–1695) identified the cause of hemorrhagic stroke when he suggested that people who had died of apoplexy had bleeding in their brains.

Wepfer also identified the main arteries supplying the brain, the vertebral and carotid arteries, and identified the cause of ischemic stroke known as cerebral infarction when he suggested that apoplexy might be caused by a blockage to those vessels.
 Rudolf Virchow first described the mechanism of thromboembolism as a major factor.[tpl]cite journal |author=Schiller F |title=Concepts of stroke before and after Virchow |journal=Med Hist |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=115–31 |date=April 1970 |pmid=4914683 |pmc=1034034 |doi=10.1017/S0025727300015325[/tpl]
The term cerebrovascular accident was introduced in 1927, reflecting a "growing awareness and acceptance of vascular theories and (...) recognition of the consequences of a sudden disruption in the vascular supply of the brain".[tpl]cite book|author1=Stanley Finger|author2=François Boller|author3=Kenneth L.

The term brain attack was introduced for use to underline the acute nature of stroke according to the American Stroke Association, who since 1990 have used the term,[tpl]cite web|title=What is a Stroke/Brain Attack?|url=http://www.stroke.org/site/DocServer/NSA_complete_guide.pdf|work=National Stroke Association|accessdate=27 February 2014[/tpl] and is used colloquially to refer to both ischemic as well as hemorrhagic stroke.[tpl]cite book|title=Segen's Medical Dictionary.|year=2010|publisher=Farlex, Inc[/tpl]

Angioplasty and stenting have begun to be looked at as possible viable options in treatment of acute ischemic stroke. Intra-cranial stenting in symptomatic intracranial arterial stenosis, the rate of technical success (reduction to stenosis of 
===Neuroprotection===

Drugs that scavenge reactive oxygen species, inhibit apoptosis, or inhibit excitatory neurotransmitters have been shown experimentally to reduce tissue injury caused by ischemia. Agents that work in this way are referred to as being neuroprotective. Until recently, human clinical trials with neuroprotective agents have failed, with the probable exception of deep barbiturate coma. However, more recently NXY-059, the disulfonyl derivative of the radical-scavengin phenylbutylnitrone, is reported to be neuroprotective in stroke.[tpl]cite journal |author=Lees KR |title=NXY-059 for acute ischemic stroke |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=354 |issue=6 |pages=588–600 |date=February 2006 |pmid=16467546 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa052980 |author-separator=, |author2=Zivin JA |author3=Ashwood T|display-authors=3 |last4=Davalos |first4=Antonio |last5=Davis |first5=Stephen M. |last6=Diener |first6=Hans-Christoph|last7=Grotta |first7=James |last8=Lyden |first8=Patrick |last9=Shuaib |first9=Ashfaq |first10=Hans-Göran |first11=Warren W.[/tpl] This agent appears to work at the level of the blood vessel lining or endothelium. Unfortunately, after producing favorable results in one large-scale clinical trial, a second trial failed to show favorable results. Benefit of NXY-059 is questionable.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Koziol|first1=JA|author2=Feng, AC|title=On the analysis and interpretation of outcome measures in stroke clinical trials: lessons from the SAINT I study of NXY-059 for acute ischemic stroke|journal=Stroke; a journal of cerebral circulation|date=October 2006|volume=37|issue=10|pages=2644–7|pmid=16946150|doi=10.1161/01.STR.0000241106.81293.2b[/tpl]
