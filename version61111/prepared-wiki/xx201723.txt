==Biography==

As part of his undergraduate thesis in Civil Engineering at the University of Utah, Fuller developed a large-scale laminar-flow nozzle that has since been used extensively in WET’s water features.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.cncmagazine.com/vol_9thru12/v9i32/v9i32c-WET.asp | title=It’s Only Water: Vol. 9, Issue 32 | author=Berry, Richard | publisher=CNC Machining | accessdate=2008-05-21 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071220110050/http://www.cncmagazine.com/vol_9thru12/v9i32/v9i32c-WET.asp  |archivedate = 2007-12-20[/tpl] Before founding WET, Fuller worked as an Imagineer for The Walt Disney Company, applying the technology he developed as an undergraduate, and had refined as a graduate student at Stanford, to create Disney’s “Leapfrog” fountain feature at Epcot Center.[ref]
