==Natural environment==

Geologically, Kiama High School is located in a unique region of NSW. The school sits beneath Saddleback Mountain and is surrounded by three plutonic flows. The school itself is built on a rock layer named Kiama Tuff. The sedimentary rocks nearby contain excellent examples of sedimentary fossils.
The new Multi Purpose (M) block enjoys a 180 degree ocean view from which the Kiama lighthouse is visible. During high seas the surge from the Kiama Blowhole is sometimes visible from the M block balcony. The annual whale migrations are also visible from this spot.

==Rebuilding program==

In 2003, the Government of New South Wales provided A$3.5 million in a rebuilding program which saw several timber buildings dating back to the 1960s demolished and replaced with modern multi storey brick and corrugated iron structures with ample modern natural lighting. The school sits on an easterly sloping block bounded to the east by the South Coast Railway Line, south of Kiama Station.
The two storey L block replaced B block. This new building, completed in 2004, includes 4 modern computer labs equipped with ergonomic furnishings. Also housed are 8 general purpose class rooms and a large common study area on each level.
Adjacent to block L is the new three-storey block M. This three-storey building was built to replace the former block D, block C and an increasing number of demountable buildings on the southern oval. The block D foundations were sinking and unstable. Building commenced in 2006 and was officially completed in February 2007 ready for the 2007 school year. The building consists of three storeys which house the new combined staffroom on the upper level and Music, Art, and PDHPE below.
The new block M lift provides wheelchair access to buildings M, L and existing buildings via a new multi storey ramp which services both buildings from the A block pathway to provide level access to buildings on the otherwise steeply sloped site. Students and staff now enjoy beach, ocean and lighthouse views from the newly completed three storey high ramp.

==Student life==

===Student Representative Council===

A Student Representative Council embeds itself within the school community and is involved in numerous charity campaigns and school events.
The SRC hold elections for each grade during the second semester of the school year. A member elects to campaign for a position on the council and must also have a recommendation from a fellow peer and teacher. Generally four to six students are elected from each year, with a gender equal ratio. These students represent their grade for the third and fourth terms until the first and second term of the following year. Elections may be suspended until third term occasionally.
Year 11 students elect to vote for a male and female captain, a male and female vice captain and two more students, a male and female, to fill the positions of secretary and treasurer. These students form the executive committee which is chaired by the principal, and presided over by the deputy principals and the teacher in charge of the SRC. The school captains represent the graduating year and provide peer leadership to the entire student body. Year 7 has no representation until the mid year elections.
SRC meetings are occasionally attended by the school principal Graeme Sutherland.

====SRC Representatives====

SRC representatives are generally highly regarded by their peers due to their role in the organisation of many recreational activities and special events. Such events are generally either funded by the council or presented to the school by the council. The KHS SRC of 2005 were noted for their success in adopting a child from China and funding King Jika Moto his community through donations raised by the school community. The 2006 SRC attempted to introduce new events into the school such as a film festival. The KHS SRC also raises funds to support external worthy causes such as CanTeen (a support network for teens with cancer), Pink Ribbon Day (for breast cancer awareness), Daffodil Day and others. The SRC raises funds for these causes by organising events such as out of uniform days and the occasional sale of popular treats which are ordinarily unavailable from the school canteen.
