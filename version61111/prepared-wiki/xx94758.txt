 The grape-vine is an alternation of [[feet positions|second and
fourth positions of the feet]] ; one foot travelling sidewise
on a straight line, the other foot going from anterior to posterior fourth position, and vice versa. The step
travels to the woman's right (the man's left), without
turning.
The man's steps are the converse of the woman's, he starting with his left foot. The step is executed in
closed position of the couple, and is usually performed
several times in succession.
The arrival of the feet in fourth position  is usually punctuated with a slight dip.

The step is used, e.g., in Foxtrot, Polka, Freestyle aerobics, Electric Slide and Hustle.  
In some dances (e.g., Polka, Hustle, Electric Slide) it is an eight count figure, often split into two, mirroring each other and called "Grapevine to the right" and "Grapevine to the left".
