that the interaction picture does not exist in an interacting, relativistic quantum field theory (QFT), something now commonly known as Haag's Theorem. Haag's original proof was subsequently generalized by a number of authors, notably Hall and Wightman,[ref]

that a Haag-like theorem also applies to free neutral scalar fields of different masses, which implies that the interaction picture cannot exist even under the absence of interactions.

==Formal description of Haag's theorem==

In its modern form, the Haag theorem may be stated as follows:[ref]

==Physical (heuristic) point of view==

==Workarounds==

Among the assumptions that lead to Haag's theorem is translation invariance of the system. Consequently, systems that can be set up inside a box with periodic boundary conditions or that interact with suitable external potentials escape the conclusions of the theorem.[tpl]cite book |last=Reed |first=M. |last2=Simon |first2=B. |series=Methods of modern mathematical physics |volume=III |year=1979 |title=Scattering theory |publisher=Academic Press |location=New York [/tpl] Haag[tpl]cite journal |last=Haag |first=R. |title=Quantum field theories with composite particles and asymptotic conditions |journal=Phys.

==Conflicting reactions of the practitioners of QFT==

While some physicists and philosophers of physics have repeatedly emphasized how seriously Haag's theorem is shaking the foundations of QFT, the majority of QFT practitioners simply dismiss the issue. Most quantum field theory texts geared to practical appreciation of the Standard Model of elementary particle interactions do not even mention it, implicitly assuming that some rigorous set of definitions and procedures may be found to firm up the powerful and well-confirmed heuristic results they report on. 
They shrug off asymptotic structure (cf. QCD jets), as they have not stumbled on a specific calculation in agreement with experiment but nevertheless failing by dint of Haag's theorem.   As was pointed out by P. Teller: 
Everyone must agree that as a piece of mathematics Haag's theorem is a valid result that at least appears to call into question the mathematical foundation of interacting quantum field theory, and agree that at the same time the theory has proved astonishingly successful in application to experimental results.[tpl]cite book |last=Teller |first=Paul | year=1997| page=115 |title = An interpretive introduction to quantum field theory | publisher = Princeton University Press[/tpl] T. Lupher has suggested that the wide range of conflicting reactions to Haag's theorem may partly be caused by the fact that the same exists in different formulations, which in turn were proved within different formulations of QFT such as Wightman's axiomatic approach or the LSZ formalism.[tpl]cite journal |last=Lupher| first=T.| title=Who proved Haag's theorem? | journal= International Journal of Theoretical Physics | volume=44 | pages=1993–2003| year=2005[/tpl] According to Lupher, The few who mention it tend to regard it as something important that someone (else) should investigate thoroughly. 
SklarSklar, Lawrence (2000), Theory and Truth: Philosophical Critique within Foundational Science. Oxford University Press. further points out:There may be a presence within a theory of conceptual problems that  appear to be the result of mathematical artifacts.  These seem to the theoretician to be not fundamental problems rooted in some deep physical mistake in the theory, but, rather, the consequence of some misfortune in the way in which the theory has been expressed.  Haag’s Theorem is, perhaps, a difficulty of this kind.
