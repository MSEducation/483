"My Michelle" is a song written by Guns N' Roses and released on the band's 1987 debut album Appetite for Destruction.  In 1989, the song was re-released as a promotional single to radio stations.
For the recording of this song, guitarist Slash used a slightly different setup. For the rest of the album, he used a Gibson Les Paul copy through a modified Marshall amplifier on the same settings for each song. However, for this song, he swapped to a '60s Gibson SG because he felt it had a darker sound.

==Composition and lyrical intent==

The song is about a friend of the band, a girl named Michelle Young who is thanked in the Appetite For Destruction cover sleeve. Slash knew Young throughout junior high, as she was a friend of Slash's first girlfriend.Bozza, Anthony, & Slash (2007). Slash.

Rose's first attempt was a sweet, almost romantic song, but one that had absolutely nothing to do with the reality of Michelle's life. He was unhappy with this version and re-wrote it, this time seeking to be completely honest.An Interview With The Gunners, Hit Parader - March 1988; retrieved January 3, 2008, from http://hem.passagen.se/snoqalf/m-meaning.html Several members of the band expressed concern over this version of the song, especially Slash, fearing it would upset Young.Bozza, Anthony, & Slash (2007).

She liked the song and the attention it brought to her, and was especially pleased with its honesty, most notably regarding her drug addiction, the death of her mother and her father's work in the pornography industry, all of which are mentioned within the first verse.
According to Slash's self-titled autobiography, Young managed to clean up and move across the country to escape her lifestyle.
During the 2006 NY and European Tours, Axl Rose shared the vocal duties with former Skid Row singer Sebastian Bach.[tpl]YouTube|SNx80r9AK2o|Guns N Roses - My Michelle w/Sebastian Bach (Download 2006)[/tpl]
