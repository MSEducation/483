[[Mirror Mirror (Dardanelles album)]]

CATEGORIES: 2007 albums

Mirror Mirror is the debut album by Melbourne based Indie rock band  Dardanelles released in September 2007.

==Background==

Taking their fans by surprise, Dardanelles' debut album proved to be a departure from their guitar infused  debut EP, filled with dark haunting vocals and complex electronic soundscapes. It was recorded over a 30-day period at 001 Studio in  Collingwood with producer Woody Annison, who had previously worked with fellow Australian bands Red Riders and Children Collide. The mysterious atmosphere can be attributed in part to the band listening to Vangelis, particularly the  Blade Runner soundtrack a great deal throughout the making of the album.http://www.lifelounge.com/Dardanelles-Interview.aspx Interview at Lifelounge Some have likened the main guitar riff to the track "Mirror Mirror" to Scott Walker's "Cossacks Are".
"Rip it Up" magazine proclaimed "Mirror Mirror" as "the finest Australian album of 2007 bar none".http://www.ripitup.com.au/reviews/5149 Album review from Rip it Up Magazine The single  Footsteps was subsequently released via iTunes and received heavy rotation on Triple J and Sydney based FBi Radio making it the second most added track to alternative radio in Australia behind Yeah Yeah Yeahs.

Another Melbourne based agency "Krozm" produced a subsequent video clip for "Footsteps" featuring face-painted band members projected across various objects and highly surreal imagery reminiscent of Pink Floyd's video work.
