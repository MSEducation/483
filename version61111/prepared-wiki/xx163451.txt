==Confederation of European Paper Industries - CEPI==

The Confederation of European Paper Industries (CEPI aisbl) represents the European pulp and paper associations towards the European institutions and has its seat in Brussels, Belgium. It monitors, analyses and acts upon EU legislation and initiatives relevant to the industry, communicating on the industry’s achievements and the benefits of its products.
CEPI is member of the International Council of Forest and Paper Associations (ICFPA).

==History==

In 1992 CEPI was founded by a merger of CEPAC(Confédération Européenne de l’Industrie des pates, papiers et cartons) and EPI (European Paper Institute). At that time CEPI had 15 member organisations.
List of chairmen:
In 1997 the Czech Pulp and Paper Association SPPAC became associate member of CEPI and in 1999 the Slovakian association followed. Hungary joined in 2001 and Poland not until 2003. In 2004 all four associate members became regular members, at the same time when their countries officially joined the European Union. In 2006 the Danish and Irish associations ceased to be members of CEPI. Slovenia joined CEPI in January 2010. Switzerland ceased to be a member in 2012 which brings the number of members to 18.

==Member organisations==

Through its 18 member countries (17 European Union members plus Norway), CEPI represents 200pulp, paper and board producing companies across Europe, ranging from small and medium-sized companies to multi-nationals, and 950 pulp and paper mills. 

==Data==

The European paper industry is producing more than 92 million tonnes of paper and board and more than 38 million tonnes of pulp annually. It provides directly more than 185 thousand jobs and indirectly 3 million jobs along the forest and paper chain. Through its 18 member countries CEPI represents 520 pulp, paper and board producing companies across Europe, ranging from small and medium sized companies to multi-nationals, and 950 paper mills. Together they represent 24% of world production. 
The European pulp and paper industry is the largest industrial producer and consumer of energy from renewable sources. Its share of biomass-based energy exceeds 55% of its total primary annual energy consumption of 1.222.039 TJ.
Recovered paper and board are a major source of the paper industry’s raw material, which is why the industry pushes for new heights for the European recycling rate. The recycling rate reached 63.4% in 2006, and reached 71.7% in 2012 which is a great success as a voluntary target of 70% that was set by the industries declaration in 2011, along the paper value chain (ERPC). The total amount of paper collected and sent to recycling in paper mills in 2012 was 58 million tonnes, an increase of 18 million tonnes (or +945%) since 1998, the base year for the target. 6% was exported for recycling in third countries.

==Fields of Action==

==European Paper Week==

European Paper Week always takes generally place at the end of November. The event takes place in the heart of Europe - Brussels.
Within European Paper Week, the CEPI Annual Meeting is a half-day conference presenting high-level speakers not only from industry, but also the European Institutions and other sectors. It focuses on the big issues shaping the European industry’s future and examines the future of the pulp and paper industry in the context of EU policy and the effects of globalisation.
During Paper Week, CEPI also hosts 3 open seminars providing participants with valuable insights into the topical key issues facing the paper industry. 
A number of other key meetings and seminars are organised in the course of European Paper Week by industry sectors and organisations along the paper chain.
