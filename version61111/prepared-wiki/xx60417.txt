==Airport expansion==

Beginning in 2006, with a budget of $65.8 million, Québec/Jean Lesage International Airport underwent a modernization designed to increase the terminal's capacity and substantially enhance the level of passenger service. The modernization included a reconfiguration of the terminal on 2 levels, a restructuring of the baggage handling area and arrivals area, as well as a reconfiguration and enlargement of the waiting rooms. 54% of the financing was provided directly by Aéroport de Québec inc. Completed in June 2008, the new configuration of the airport now enables it to handle 1.4 million passengers a year.
Based on the passenger figures for 2009 and 2010, it became clear that the terminal building would reach its design capacity by 2012. Aéroport de Québec inc. is therefore planning further investments of nearly $300 million to further expand the terminal building.[tpl]cite news |title=L'aéroport de Québec trop petit d'ici deux ans (french) |author=Le Soleil |url= http://www.cyberpresse.ca/le-soleil/actualites/la-capitale/201011/07/01-4340304-laeroport-de-quebec-trop-petit-dici-deux-ans.php?utm_categorieinterne=trafficdrivers&utm_contenuinterne=cyberpresse_B4_en-manchette_2238_section_POS1 |agency=Cyberpresse.ca |date= 8 November 2010 |accessdate= 11 November 2010[/tpl] Presently the terminal has 13 gates: 8 contact gates and 5 walk-out aircraft positions.
