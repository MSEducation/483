Cedar Point National Wildlife Refuge was donated to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service in 1964 by the owners of the Cedar Point Shooting Club. Currently, the refuge consists of [tpl]convert|2445|acre|km2|sigfig=2[/tpl] of marsh, divided into three pools. The largest pool, almost [tpl]convert|2000|acre|km2|sigfig=1[/tpl], is the largest contiguous marsh in Ohio's Lake Erie marshes.
Most of the refuge is closed to the public; however, a fishing area is open from June through August. The refuge is managed by staff at Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge, in Oak Harbor.
