The road was built to shorten the traffic distance between the Lantau Link and Tsuen Wan.
The road was inaugurated by Donald Tsang on February 1, 2002 and opened to public on February 2, 2002.  The entire length of the road is an elevated structure spanning 2.2 km.  The construction of the dual two-lane road began in February 1999. Apart from the main road, it also includes four viaducts, four slip/link roads, four subways, a traffic control centre, noise semi-enclosure/barrier, and extensive geotechnical and landscaping works.
The total cost of the construction of this highway was HK$775 million.
