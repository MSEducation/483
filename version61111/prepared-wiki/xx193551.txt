==History==

===Founders Innovation and Impact===

Founded in 1740 in Maidstone Kent, Whatman paper was created by paper maker James Whatman the Elder (1702–1759). He made revolutionary advances to the craft in England and is credited as the inventor of wove paper (or Vélin), an innovation used for high quality art and printing. The techniques continued to be developed by his son, James Whatman the Younger (1741–1798).[tpl]cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=Matt T. |last2=Etherington|first2=Don|title=Bookbinding and the conservation of books;  A dictionary of descriptive terminology.|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/don/dt/dt3773.html|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|isbn=978-0-8444-0366-3 |chapter=Whatman, James (1741–1798)[/tpl] At a time when the craft was based in smaller paper mills, his innovations led to the large scale and widespread industrialisation of paper manufacturing.
Whatman had been approached by John Baskerville, who needed paper that would take a light impression of the printing plate; this was used for the edition of Virgil's poetry, embellished with Baskerville's typography and designs. The earliest examples of wove paper, bearing his watermark, appeared after 1740.[tpl]cite web|url=http://nga.gov.au/Conservation/Watermarks/listing.cfm|title=Watermark and countermark library|year=2010|work=Conservation|publisher=National Gallery of Australia|accessdate=29 November 2010[/tpl]
Their business, is credited with the invention of the wove wire mesh used to mould and align the pulp fibres. This is the principal method used in the mass production of most modern paper. The Whatmans held a part interest in the establishment at Turkey Mill, near Maidstone, after 1740,1 this was acquired through the elder Whatman's marriage to Ann Harris.
The "handmade" paper bearing the Whatman's mark is still produced for special editions and art books.
