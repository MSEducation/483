Voodoocult was an international thrash metal band formed in 1994 by Phillip Boa, vocalist of the alternative band Phillip Boa & The Voodooclub. The project was especially notable for the reputation of the participating musicians, such as Chuck Schuldiner (of Death fame), Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo, and Mille Petrozza of the German thrash metal band Kreator. The band released two albums, and disbanded in 1996 after the release of the second album and a tour.

==Musical genre and lyrical content==

It is difficult to classify Voodoocult's style - the music on both albums contains elements of thrash metal/neo-thrash, but does also show influences of doom metal (audible on the track "Jesus Killing Machine" on the first LP), and is strongly influenced by modern metal styles. The best description for the band's music would perhaps be the umbrella term alternative metal. It is notable, that although the music has been composed by prominent band members such as Waldemar Sorychta or Mille Petrozza, Voodoocult's sound mostly does not resemble that of the respective bands such as Kreator, Slayer or Death.
In contrast to the music, the lyrics have all been written by Boa himself and are frequently bizarre - a trademark of Boa that is present in his main band Voodooclub as well. Although the lyrics themselves frequently have a surreal touch, the predominant lyrical topic, i.e. the lyrical concept of the band, is one that might be considered archetypal for metal - death.
