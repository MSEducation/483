[[Tartan (Assyrian)]]

CATEGORIES: Assyria

A Tartan ([tpl]Hebrew name|תַּרְתָּן[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-el|Θαρθαν[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-la|Tharthan[/tpl]), Aramaic: ܬܵܪܬܵܢ Tartan; was the commander-in-chief of the Assyrian army. In the Bible, the Assyrian king sends a Tartan with two other officials to deliver a threatening message to Jerusalem,[tpl]bibleverse|2|Kings|18:17|[/tpl] and Sargon II, the king of Assyria, sends a Tartan who takes Ashdod.[tpl]bibleverse||Isaiah|20:1|[/tpl]
In Assyria, the Tartan ranked next to the king. The office seems to have been duplicated, and 
there was a tartanu imni or 'tartan of the right', as well as a tartanu shumeli or 'tartan of the left'. In later times the title became territorial; we read of a tartan of 'Kummuh' (Commagene). The title is also applied to the commanders of foreign armies ; thus Sargon speaks of the Tartan Musurai, or 'Egyptian Tartan'. The Tartan of 720 BC was probably called Ashur-iska-danin; in 694 BC, Abdai, and in 686 BC Bel-emurani, held the title. It does not seem to have been in use among the closely related Babylonians.
