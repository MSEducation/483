The current iteration of AT&T Inc. began its existence as Southwestern Bell Corporation, one of seven Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOC's) created in 1983 in the divestiture of parent company American Telephone and Telegraph Company (founded 1885, later AT&T Corp.) due to the United States v. AT&T antitrust lawsuit. Southwestern Bell changed its name to SBC Communications Inc. in 1995. In 2005, SBC purchased former parent AT&T Corp. and took on its branding, with the merged entity naming itself AT&T Inc. and using the iconic AT&T Corp. logo and stock-trading symbol.
The current AT&T reconstitutes much of the former Bell System and includes ten of the original 22 Bell Operating Companies, along with one it partially owned (Southern New England Telephone), and the original long distance division.[tpl]cite book |last=Kleinfield |first=Sonny |title=The biggest company on earth: a profile of AT&T |publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston |location=New York |year=1981 |isbn=978-0-03-045326-7 |oclc= [/tpl]

==History==

AT&T can indirectly trace its origin back to the original Bell Telephone Company founded by Alexander Graham Bell after his invention of the telephone. One of that company's subsidiaries was American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T), established in 1885, which acquired the Bell Company on December 31, 1899 for legal reasons, leaving AT&T as the main company. AT&T established a network of subsidiaries in the United States that held a government-authorized phone service monopoly, formalized with the Kingsbury Commitment, throughout most of the twentieth century. This monopoly was known as the Bell System, and during this period, AT&T was also known by the nickname Ma Bell. For periods of time, the former AT&T was the world's largest phone company.
In 1984, US regulators broke up the AT&T monopoly, requiring AT&T to divest its regional subsidiaries and turning them each into individual companies. These new companies were known as Regional Bell Operating Companies, or more informally, Baby Bells. AT&T continued to operate long distance services, but thanks to the breakup, faced competition from new competitors such as MCI and Sprint.
Southwestern Bell was one of the companies created by the breakup of AT&T. It wasn't long before the company started a series of acquisitions. This includes the 1987 acquisition of Metromedia mobile business, and the acquisition of several cable companies in the early 1990s. In the later half of the 1990s, the company acquired several other telecommunications companies, including some baby bells, while selling its cable business. During this time, the company changed its name to SBC Communications. By 1998, the company was in the top 15 of the Fortune 500, and by 1999 the company was part of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
In 2005, SBC purchased AT&T for $16 billion. After this purchase, SBC adopted the AT&T name and brand. The original 1885 AT&T still exists as the long-distance phone subsidiary of this company. Today, the current AT&T owns 11 of the original 24 Bell System companies.
In 2013, the Spanish Government would have dampened a friendly takeover attempt of AT&T on Telefónica, valued in 122,000 million euros. Such an impediment would be justified in the strategic nature of the company and AT&T would have taken a step backward.El Mundo 06/17/2013. "Spain braked a takeover of AT&T on Telefónica, according to information from the newspaper El Mundo", International Business Times
AT&T today is the seventh-largest company in the United States and the 14th-largest in the world. It provides landline phone service, long-distance, mobile phone service and cable television service.
In September 2013, AT&T announced it would expand into Latin America through a collaboration with Carlos Slim’s America Movil.[tpl]cite news| url= http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/18/us-att-americamovil-idUSBRE98H02Z20130918| title= AT&T to expand in Latin America with America Movil deal| author= Sinead Carew| publisher=Reuters | date=18 September 2013[/tpl]
On December 17, 2013, AT&T announced plans to sell its Connecticut wireline operations to Stamford-based Frontier Communications.  Roughly 2,700 wireline employees supporting AT&T’s operations in Connecticut will transfer with the business to Frontier, as well as 900,000 voice connections, 415,000 broadband connections, and 180,000 U-verse video subscribers.[tpl]cite news| url= http://www.att.com/gen/press-room?pid=25160&cdvn=news&newsarticleid=37344| title= AT&T Announces Plans to Sell Connecticut Wireline Operations to Frontier Communications for $2.0 Billion| author= AT&T| publisher=AT&T | date=17 December 2013[/tpl]

==Political contributions and lobbying==

According to the Center for Responsive Politics, AT&T is the second-largest donor to United States political campaigns,[tpl]Citation |year=2011 |title=Top All-Time Donors, 1989–2012 |work=OpenSecrets.org |accessdate=Dec 9, 2011 |publisher=Center for Responsive Politics |publication-place=United States |url=http://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/list.php?order=A[/tpl] and the top American corporate donor,[tpl]Citation |last=Kang |first=Cecelia |author2=Jia Lynn Yang |publication-date=Dec 9, 2011 |title=How AT&T fumbled its $39 billion bid to acquire T-Mobile |newspaper=The Washington Post |at=washingtonpost.com |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/how-atandt-lost-its-39-million-bid-to-acquire-t-mobile/2011/12/01/JB_gIQAkTQ6hO_story.html |accessdate=Dec 9, 2011[/tpl] having contributed more than [tpl]US$|47.7 million[/tpl] since 1990, 56% and 44% of which went to Republican and Democratic recipients, respectively.[tpl]Citation |year=2011 |title=AT&T Inc: Totals |work=OpenSecrets.org |publisher=Center for Responsive Politics |publication-place=United States |url=http://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/totals.php?cycle=2012&id=JB_D000000076  |accessdate=Dec 9, 2011[/tpl]  Also, during the period of 1998 to 2010, the company expended [tpl]US$|130 million[/tpl] on lobbying in the United States.

===Legislation===

AT&T supported the Federal Communications Commission Process Reform Act of 2013 (H.R. 3675; 113th Congress), a bill that would make a number of changes to procedures that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) follows in its rulemaking processes.[tpl]cite web|title=H.R. 3675 - CBO|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45057|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=10 March 2014[/tpl] The FCC would have to act in a more transparent way as a result of this bill, forced to accept public input about regulations.[tpl]cite news|last=Kasperowicz|first=Pete|title=House votes for more transparency at the FCC|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/votes/200503-house-votes-for-more-transparency-at-the-fcc|accessdate=12 March 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=11 March 2014[/tpl] Executive Vice President - Federal Relations Tim McKone said that the bill's "much needed institutional reforms will help arm the agency with the tools to keep pace with the Internet speed of today's marketplace. It will also ensure that outmoded regulatory practices for today's competitive marketplace are properly placed in the dustbin of history."[tpl]cite web|last=McKone|first=Tim|title=AT&T Statement on Bipartisan Spectrum and FCC Reform Legislation|url=http://www.attpublicpolicy.com/fcc/att-statement-on-bipartisan-spectrum-and-fcc-reform-legislation/|publisher=AT&T Public Policy Blog|accessdate=12 March 2014|date=11 December 2013[/tpl]

===Former operating companies===

The following companies have gone to defunct status under SBC/AT&T ownership:

===Future of rural landlines===

AT&T has stated that it will declare its intentions for its rural landlines on November 7, 2012.[tpl]cite web |last=Ausik |first=Paul |title=AT&T May Keep Rural Landline Business |url=http://247wallst.com/2012/09/19/att-may-keep-rural-landline-business/ |publisher=24/7 Wall St. |date=19 September 2012 |accessdate=22 July 2013[/tpl] AT&T had previously announced that it was considering a sale of its rural landlines, which are not wired for AT&T's U-verse service; however, it has also stated that it may keep the business after all.
AT&T would not be the first Baby Bell to sell off rural landlines. Ameritech sold some of its Wisconsin lines to CenturyTel in 1998; BellSouth sold some of its lines to MebTel in the 2000s; U S WEST sold many historically Bell landlines to Lynch Communications and Pacific Telecom in the 1990s; Verizon sold many of its New England lines to FairPoint in 2008 and its West Virginia operations to Frontier Communications in 2010.

==Corporate structure==

==Criticism and controversies==

===Hemisphere database===

The company maintains a database of call detail records of all telephone calls that have passed through its network since 1987. AT&T employees work at High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area offices (operated by the Office of National Drug Control Policy) in Los Angeles, Atlanta, and Houston so data can be quickly turned over to law enforcement agencies. Records are requested via administrative subpoena, without the involvement of a court or grand jury.

===Censorship===

In August 2007, the band Pearl Jam performed in Chicago at Lollapalooza which was being web-broadcast by AT&T. The band, while playing the song "Daughter", started playing a version of Pink Floyd's "Another Brick in the Wall" but with altered lyrics critical of president George W. Bush. These lyrics included "George Bush, leave this world alone!" and, "George Bush, find yourself another home!". Listeners to AT&T's web broadcast heard only the first line because the rest was censored,[tpl]cite web |last=Grossberg |first=Josh |title=AT&T's Pearl Jamming? |publisher=E Online |date=August 9, 2007 |url=http://www.eonline.com/news/article/index.jsp?uuid=4de684ae-62eb-4b23-984c-d07ce72ea5e2 |accessdate=September 29, 2007 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/JB_20070930190920/http://www.eonline.com/news/article/index.jsp?uuid=4de684ae-62eb-4b23-984c-d07ce72ea5e2| archivedate= 30 September 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] although AT&T spokesman Michael Coe said that the silencing was "a mistake."[tpl]cite news |last=Roberts |first=Michelle |title=AT&T: Pearl Jam edit a mistake |agency=Associated Press |date=August 10, 2007 |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/JB_2003829996_pearljam10.html?syndication=rss |accessdate=September 29, 2007 | work=The Seattle Times| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070929125624/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003829996_pearljam10.html?syndication=rss| archivedate= 29 September 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

===Privacy controversy===

In 2006, the Electronic Frontier Foundation lodged a class action lawsuit, Hepting v. AT&T, which alleged that AT&T had allowed agents of the National Security Agency (NSA) to monitor phone and Internet communications of AT&T customers without warrants. If true, this would violate the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 and the First and Fourth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution. AT&T has yet to confirm or deny that monitoring by the NSA is occurring. In April 2006, a retired former AT&T technician, Mark Klein, lodged an affidavit supporting this allegation.Nakashima, Ellen, "A Story of Surveillance", Washington Post, November 7, 2007[tpl]cite news |last=Singel |first= Ryan |title=Whistle-Blower Outs NSA Spy Room |publisher=Wired |date=April 7, 2006 |url=http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2006/04/70619 |accessdate=September 29, 2007[/tpl] The Department of Justice has stated they will intervene in this lawsuit by means of State Secrets Privilege.[tpl]cite press release |title=Government Moves to Intervene in AT&T Surveillance Case |publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) |date=April 28, 2006 |url=http://www.eff.org/news/archives/2006_04.php#004613 |accessdate=September 29, 2007 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/JB_20070929123042/http://www.eff.org/news/archives/2006_04.php| archivedate= 29 September 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
In July 2006, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California – in which the suit was filed – rejected a federal government motion to dismiss the case. The motion to dismiss, which invoked the State Secrets Privilege, had argued that any court review of the alleged partnership between the federal government and AT&T would harm national security. The case was immediately appealed to the Ninth Circuit. It was dismissed on June 3, 2009, citing retroactive legislation in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]

===Intellectual property filtering===

In January 2008, the company reported plans to begin filtering all Internet traffic which passes through its network for intellectual property violations.  Commentators in the media have speculated that if this plan is implemented, it would lead to a mass exodus of subscribers leaving AT&T,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22829568/ |title=AT&T's Proposed Filtering Policy Is Bad News – Netiquette – MSNBC.com |publisher=MSNBC |date=January 25, 2008 |accessdate=November 28, 2011[/tpl] although this is misleading as Internet traffic may go through the company's network anyway.  Internet freedom proponents used these developments as justification for government-mandated network neutrality.

===Discrimination against local Public-access television channels===

AT&T is accused by community media groups of discriminating against local Public, educational, and government access (PEG) cable TV channels:, by "impictions that will severely restrict the audience".(March 9, 2009) "AT&T Accused of Discriminating Against Local Public Access Channels, Deadline for Public Comment Expires Tonight", Democracy Now!, retrieved on March 13, 2009.
According to Barbara Popovic, Executive Director of the Chicago public-access service CAN-TV, the new AT&T U-verse system forces all Public-access television into a special menu system, denying normal functionality such as channel numbers, access to the standard program guide, and DVR recording.  The Ratepayer Advocates division of the California Public Utilities Commission reported: "Instead of putting the stations on individual channels, AT&T has bundled community stations into a generic channel that can only be navigated through a complex and lengthy process."
Sue Buske (president of telecommunications consulting firm the Buske Group and a former head of the National Federation of Local Cable Programmers/Alliance for Community Media) argue that this is "an overall attack ... on public access across the States, the place in the dial around cities and communities where people can make their own media in their own communities".

In June 2010, a hacker group known as Goatse Security discovered a vulnerability within the AT&T that could allow anyone to uncover email addresses belonging to customers of AT&T 3G service for the Apple iPad.[tpl]cite news |title='Brute force' script snatched iPad e-mail addresses |first=Gregg |last=Keizer |newspaper=Computerworld |date=June 10, 2010 |url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9177921/JB_Brute_force_script_snatched_iPad_e_mail_addresses |accessdate=September 18, 2010[/tpl] These email addresses could be accessed without a protective password.[tpl]cite news |title=iPad e-mail hackers defend attack as 'ethical' |page=2 |first=Gregg |last=Keizer |newspaper=Computerworld |date=June 11, 2010 |url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9177991/iPad_e_mail_hackers_defend_attack_as_ethical_?taxonomyId=17&pageNumber=2 |accessdate=September 25, 2010[/tpl] Using a script, Goatse Security collected thousands of email addresses from AT&T. Goatse Security informed AT&T about the security flaw through a third party.[tpl]cite news |title=iPad e-mail hackers defend attack as 'ethical' |page=1 |first=Gregg |last=Keizer |newspaper=Computerworld |date=June 11, 2010 |url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/JB_9177991/iPad_e_mail_hackers_defend_attack_as_ethical_ |accessdate=September 25, 2010[/tpl] Goatse Security then disclosed around 114,000 of these emails to Gawker Media, which published an article about the security flaw and disclosure in Valleywag. Praetorian Security Group criticized the web application that Goatse Security exploited as "poorly designed".

===Accusations of enabling fraud===

In March 2012, the United States federal government announced a lawsuit against AT&T. The specific accusations state that AT&T "violated the False Claims Act by facilitating and seeking federal payment for IP Relay calls by international callers who were ineligible for the service and sought to use it for fraudulent purposes. The complaint alleges that, out of fears that fraudulent call volume would drop after the registration deadline, AT&T knowingly adopted a non-compliant registration system that did not verify whether the user was located within the United States. The complaint further contends that AT&T continued to employ this system even with the knowledge that it facilitated use of IP Relay by fraudulent foreign callers, which accounted for up to 95 percent of AT&T's call volume. The government's complaint alleges that AT&T improperly billed the TRS Fund for reimbursement of these calls and received millions of dollars in federal payments as a result."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2012/March/JB_12-civ-357.html |title=Welcome to the United States Department of Justice |publisher=Justice.gov |date=2012-03-22 |accessdate=2012-05-11[/tpl]
