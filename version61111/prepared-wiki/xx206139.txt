The specialty oral and maxillofacial pathology is concerned with diagnosis and study of the causes and effects of diseases affecting the oral and maxillofacial region. It is sometimes considered to be a specialty of dentistry and pathology.[tpl]cite book|last=Neville BW, Damm DD, Allen CA, Bouquot JE.|first=|title=Oral & maxillofacial pathology|year=2002|publisher=W.B.

In this role there is some overlap between the expertise of head and neck pathologists and that of endocrine pathologists.

The clinical evaluation and diagnosis of oral mucosal diseases are in the scope of oral & maxillofacial pathology specialists and oral medicine practitioners,[tpl]cite journal|last=Zadik|first=Yehuda|coauthors=Orbach Hadas; Panzok Amy; Smith Yoav; Czerninski Rakefet|title=Evaluation of oral mucosal diseases: inter- and intra-observer analyses|journal=J Oral Pathol Med  |year=2011|pmid=21883487|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0714.2011.01070.x/abstract|accessdate=15 December 2011|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0714.2011.01070.x|volume=41|issue=1|pages=68â€“72[/tpl] both disciplines of dentistry.  
When a microscopic evaluation is needed, a biopsy is taken, and microscopically observed by a pathologist. The American Dental Association uses the term oral and maxillofacial pathology, and describes it as "the specialty of dentistry and pathology which deals with the nature, identification, and management of diseases affecting the oral and maxillofacial regions. It is a science that investigates the causes, processes and effects of these diseases."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ada.org/prof/ed/specialties/definitions.asp#definition |title=ADA.org: Dentistry Definitions |work= |accessdate=[/tpl]
In some parts of the world, oral and maxillofacial pathologists take on responsibilities in forensic odontology.

===Geographic variation===

====United Kingdom====

There are fewer than 30 oral pathologists in the UK. No medical degree is mandatory, only a dental degree. The shortest pathway to becoming an oral pathologist in the UK is completion of 2 years' general professional training and then 5 years in a diagnostic histopathology training course. After passing the required exams and gaining a Certificate of Completion of Specialist Training, the trainee is entitled to apply for registration as a specialist.[tpl]cite web|title=The British Society of Oral & Maxillofacial Pathologists|url=http://www.bsomp.org.uk/content-wide.aspx?Group=career&Page=career_advice|accessdate=25 April 2013[/tpl]

====New Zealand====

There are 5 practising Oral Pathologists in New Zealand (as of May 2013). Oral pathologists in New Zealand also take part in forensic evaluations.[tpl]cite web|title=Specialisation|url=http://www.nzda.org.nz/pub/index.php?id=266|publisher=New Zealand Dental Association|accessdate=10 September 2013[/tpl]
