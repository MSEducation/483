The Scheffauer is a [tpl]Höhe|2111[/tpl] high mountain in the Kaisergebirge range of the Northern Limestone Alps. It forms the western buttress of the Wilder Kaiser and is one of the most frequented summits in the Kaisergebirge.

==Location==

The Scheffauer belongs to the lesser summits of the Wilder Kaiser and guards the western flank of the main crest of the mountain range. To the north and south mighty rock faces, up to 600 metres high, plunge into the valleys. At the southern foot of the Scheffauer lies Lake Hinterstein; to the west it is linked to the rarely visited Zettenkaiser, whilst to the east it is connected to the ridge of the Hackenköpfe. A worthwhile but difficult hike runs along this ridge to the Sonneck.

==Routes==

There are two frequently used routes to scale the Scheffauer; both are signposted and sufficiently secured.
