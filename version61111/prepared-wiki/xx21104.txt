[[Acid dissociation constant]]

CATEGORIES: Equilibrium chemistry, Acids, Bases, Analytical chemistry, Physical chemistry

An acid dissociation constant, Ka, (also known as acidity constant, or acid-ionization constant) is a quantitative measure of the strength of an acid in solution. It is the equilibrium constant for a chemical reaction known as dissociation in the context of acid-base reactions. The larger the Ka value, the more dissociation of the molecules in solution and thus the stronger the acid.
The equilibrium of acid dissociation can be written symbolically as:
where HA is a generic acid that dissociates by splitting into A−, known as the conjugate base of the acid, and the hydrogen ion or proton, H+, which, in the case of aqueous solutions, exists as the hydronium ion—in other words, a solvated proton. In the example shown in the figure, HA represents acetic acid, and A− represents the acetate ion, the conjugate base. The chemical species HA, A− and H+ are said to be in equilibrium when their concentrations do not change with the passing of time. The dissociation constant is usually written as a quotient of the equilibrium concentrations (in mol/L), denoted by HA, A− and H+:
Due to the many orders of magnitude spanned by Ka values, a logarithmic measure of the acid dissociation constant is more commonly used in practice. The logarithmic constant, pKa, which is equal to −log10 Ka, is sometimes also (but incorrectly) referred to as an acid dissociation constant:
The larger the value of pKa, the smaller the extent of dissociation at any given pH (see Henderson–Hasselbalch equation)—that is, the weaker the acid. A weak acid has a pKa value in the approximate range −2 to 12 in water. Acids with a pKa value of less than about −2 are said to be strong acids; a strong acid is almost completely dissociated in aqueous solution, to the extent that the concentration of the undissociated acid becomes undetectable. pKa values for strong acids can, however, be estimated by theoretical means or by extrapolating from measurements in non-aqueous solvents in which the dissociation constant is smaller, such as acetonitrile and dimethylsulfoxide.

==Theoretical background==

The acid dissociation constant for an acid is a direct consequence of the underlying thermodynamics of the dissociation reaction; the pKa value is directly proportional to the standard Gibbs energy change for the reaction. The value of the pKa changes with temperature and can be understood qualitatively based on Le Chatelier's principle: when the reaction is endothermic, the pKa decreases with increasing temperature; the opposite is true for exothermic reactions. The underlying structural factors that influence the magnitude of the acid dissociation constant include Pauling's rules for acidity constants, inductive effects, mesomeric effects, and hydrogen bonding.
The quantitative behaviour of acids and bases in solution can be understood only if their pKa values are known. In particular, the pH of a solution can be predicted when the analytical concentration and pKa values of all acids and bases are known; conversely, it is possible to calculate the equilibrium concentration of the acids and bases in solution when the pH is known. These calculations find application in many different areas of chemistry, biology, medicine, and geology. For example, many compounds used for medication are weak acids or bases, and a knowledge of the pKa values, together with the water–octanol partition coefficient, can be used for estimating the extent to which the compound enters the blood stream. Acid dissociation constants are also essential in aquatic chemistry and chemical oceanography, where the acidity of water plays a fundamental role. In living organisms, acid-base homeostasis and enzyme kinetics are dependent on the pKa values of the many acids and bases present in the cell and in the body. In chemistry, a knowledge of pKa values is necessary for the preparation of buffer solutions and is also a prerequisite for a quantitative understanding of the interaction between acids or bases and metal ions to form complexes. Experimentally, pKa values can be determined by potentiometric (pH) titration, but for values of pKa less than about 2 or more than about 11, spectrophotometric or NMR measurements may be required due to practical difficulties with pH measurements.

==Definitions==

According to Arrhenius's original definition, an acid is a substance that dissociates in aqueous solution, releasing the hydrogen ion H+ (a proton):[ref]

 Chapter 6: Acid-Base and Donor-Acceptor Chemistry[/ref]
The equilibrium constant for this dissociation reaction is known as a dissociation constant. The liberated proton combines with a water molecule to give a hydronium (or oxonium) ion H3O+, and so Arrhenius later proposed that the dissociation should be written as an acid–base reaction:
Brønsted and Lowry generalised this further to a proton exchange reaction:[ref]

 Includes discussion of many organic Brønsted acids.[/ref][ref]

 Chapter 5: Acids and Bases[/ref][tpl]Housecroft3rd[/tpl] Chapter 6: Acids, Bases and Ions in Aqueous Solution
The acid loses a proton, leaving a conjugate base; the proton is transferred to the base, creating a conjugate acid. For aqueous solutions of an acid HA, the base is water; the conjugate base is A− and the conjugate acid is the hydronium ion. The Brønsted–Lowry definition applies to other solvents, such as dimethyl sulfoxide: the solvent S acts as a base, accepting a proton and forming the conjugate acid SH+.
In solution chemistry, it is common to use H+ as an abbreviation for the solvated hydrogen ion, regardless of the solvent. In aqueous solution H+ denotes a solvated hydronium ion rather than a proton.
The designation of an acid or base as "conjugate" depends on the context. The conjugate acid BH+ of a base B dissociates according to
which is the reverse of the equilibrium
The hydroxide ion OH−, a well known base, is here acting as the conjugate base of the acid water. Acids and bases are thus regarded simply as donors and acceptors of protons respectively.
A broader definition of acid dissociation includes hydrolysis, in which protons are produced by the splitting of water molecules. For example, boric acid (B(OH)3) produces H3O+ as if it were a proton donor,[tpl]cite journal  |title=Thermodynamic Quantities for the Ionization Reactions of Buffers  |last=Goldberg |first=R.  |author2=Kishore, N.|author3= Lennen, R.  |journal=J. Phys. Chem. Ref.

Similarly, metal ion hydrolysis causes ions such as Al(H2O)63+ to behave as weak acids:[tpl]cite book |title=Metal Ions in Solution |last=Burgess |first=J. |year=1978 |publisher=Ellis Horwood |isbn=0-85312-027-7[/tpl] Section 9.1 "Acidity of Solvated Cations" lists many pKa values.

==Equilibrium constant==

An acid dissociation constant is a particular example of an equilibrium constant. For the specific equilibrium between a monoprotic acid, HA and its conjugate base A−, in water,
the thermodynamic equilibrium constant, KFile:StrikeO.png can be defined by[ref]

 Chapter 2: Activity and Concentration Quotients[/ref]
where {A} is the activity of the chemical species A etc. KFile:StrikeO.png is dimensionless since activity is dimensionless. Activities of the products of dissociation are placed in the numerator, activities of the reactants are placed in the denominator. See activity coefficient for a derivation of this expression.
Since activity is the product of concentration and activity coefficient (γ) the definition could also be written as
where HA represents the concentration of HA and Γ is a quotient of activity coefficients.
To avoid the complications involved in using activities, dissociation constants are determined, where possible, in a medium of high ionic strength, that is, under conditions in which Γ can be assumed to be always constant. For example, the medium might be a solution of 0.1 M sodium nitrate or 3 M potassium perchlorate (1 M = 1 mol·dm−3, a unit of molar concentration). Furthermore, in all but the most concentrated solutions it can be assumed that the concentration of water, H2O, is constant, approximately 55 mol·dm−3. On dividing KFile:StrikeO.png by the constant terms and writing H+ for the concentration of the hydronium ion the expression
is obtained. This is the definition in common use. pKa is defined as −log10 Ka.
Note, however, that all published dissociation constant values refer to the specific ionic medium used in their determination and that different values are obtained with different conditions, as shown for acetic acid in the illustration above. When published constants refer to an ionic strength other than the one required for a particular application, they may be adjusted by means of specific ion theory (SIT) and other theories.
Although Ka appears to have the dimension of concentration it must in fact be dimensionless or it would not be possible to take its logarithm. The illusion is the result of omitting the constant term H2O from the defining expression. Nevertheless it is not unusual, particularly in texts relating to biochemical equilibria, to see a value quoted with a dimension as, for example, "Ka = 300 M".

===Monoprotic acids===

After rearranging the expression defining Ka, and putting pH = −log10H+, one obtainsHenderson Hasselbalch Equation: Derivation of pKa and pKb
This is a form of the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation, from which the following conclusions can be drawn.
In water, measurable pKa values range from about −2 for a strong acid to about 12 for a very weak acid (or strong base). All acids with a pKa value of less than −2 are more than 99% dissociated at pH 0 (1 M acid). This is known as solvent leveling since all such acids are brought to the same level of being strong acids, regardless of their pKa values. Likewise, all bases with a pKa value larger than the upper limit are more than 99% protonated at all attainable pH values and are classified as strong bases.
An example of a strong acid is hydrochloric acid, HCl, which has a pKa value, estimated from thermodynamic quantities, of −9.3 in water.[ref]

 Chapter 5[/ref] The concentration of undissociated acid in a 1 mol·dm−3 solution will be less than 0.01% of the concentrations of the products of dissociation. Hydrochloric acid is said to be "fully dissociated" in aqueous solution because the amount of undissociated acid is imperceptible. When the pKa and analytical concentration of the acid are known, the extent of dissociation and pH of a solution of a monoprotic acid can be easily calculated using an ICE table.
A buffer solution of a desired pH can be prepared as a mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base. In practice the mixture can be created by dissolving the acid in water, and adding the requisite amount of strong acid or base. The pKa of the acid must be less than two units different from the target pH.

===Polyprotic acids===

Polyprotic acids are acids that can lose more than one proton. The constant for dissociation of the first proton may be denoted as Ka1 and the constants for dissociation of successive protons as Ka2, etc. Phosphoric acid, H3PO4, is an example of a polyprotic acid as it can lose three protons.
!equilibrium!!pKa value
|-
| H3PO4 [tpl]eqm[/tpl] H2PO4− + H+
| pKa1 = 2.15
|-
| H2PO4− [tpl]eqm[/tpl] HPO42− + H+
| pKa2 = 7.20
|-
| HPO42− [tpl]eqm[/tpl] PO43− + H+
| pKa3 = 12.37
|}
When the difference between successive pK values is about four or more, as in this example, each species may be considered as an acid in its own right; In fact salts of H2PO4− may be crystallised from solution by adjustment of pH to about 5.5 and salts of HPO42− may be crystallised from solution by adjustment of pH to about 10. The species distribution diagram shows that the concentrations of the two ions are maximum at pH 5.5 and 10.
When the difference between successive pK values is less than about four there is overlap between the pH range of existence of the species in equilibrium. The smaller the difference, the more the overlap. The case of citric acid is shown at the right; solutions of citric acid are buffered over the whole range of pH 2.5 to 7.5.
In general, it is true that successive pK values increase (Pauling's first rule). For example, for a diprotic acid, H2A, the two equilibria are
it can be seen that the second proton is removed from a negatively charged species. Since the proton carries a positive charge extra work is needed to remove it; that is the cause of the trend noted above. Phosphoric acid values (above) illustrate this rule, as do the values for vanadic acid, H3VO4. When an exception to the rule is found it indicates that a major change in structure is occurring. In the case of VO2+ (aq), the vanadium is octahedral, 6-coordinate, whereas vanadic acid is tetrahedral, 4-coordinate. This is the basis for an explanation of why pKa1 > pKa2 for vanadium(V) oxoacids.

====Isoelectric point====

For substances in solution the isoelectric point (pI) is defined as the pH at which the sum, weighted by charge value, of concentrations of positively charged species is equal to the weighted sum of concentrations of negatively charged species. In the case that there is one species of each type, the isoelectric point can be obtained directly from the pK values. Take the example of glycine, defined as AH. There are two dissociation equilibria to consider.
Substitute the expression for AH into the first equation
At the isoelectric point the concentration of the positively charged species, AH2+, is equal to the concentration of the negatively charged species, A-, so 
Therefore, taking cologarithms, the pH is given by 
pI values for amino acids are listed at Proteinogenic amino acid#Chemical properties. When more than two charged species are in equilibrium with each other a full speciation calculation may be needed.

===Water self-ionization===

Water possesses both acidic and basic properties. It is amphoteric. The equilibrium constant for the equilibrium
is given by
When, as is usually the case, the concentration of water can be assumed to be constant, this expression may be replaced by
The self-ionization constant of water, Kw, is thus just a special case of an acid dissociation constant.
From these data it can be deduced that Kw = 10−14 at 24.87 °C. At that temperature both hydrogen and hydroxide ions have a concentration of 10−7 mol dm−3.

===Amphoteric substances===

An amphoteric substance is one that can act as an acid or as a base, depending on pH. Water (above) is amphoteric. Another example of an amphoteric molecule is the bicarbonate ion HCO3− that is the conjugate base of the carbonic acid molecule H2CO3 in the equilibrium
but also the conjugate acid of the carbonate ion CO32− in (the reverse of) the equilibrium
Carbonic acid equilibria are important for acid-base homeostasis in the human body. 
An amino acid is also amphoteric with the added complication that the neutral molecule is subject to an internal acid-base equilibrium in which the basic amino group attracts and binds the proton from the acidic carboxyl group, forming a zwitterion.
At pH less than about 5 both the carboxylate group and the amino group are protonated. As pH increases the acid dissociates according to
At high pH a second dissociation may take place.
Thus the zwitter ion, NH3+CHRCO2-, is amphoteric because it may either be protonated or deprotonated.

===Bases and basicity===

Historically, the equilibrium constant Kb for a base has been defined as the association constant for protonation of the base, B, to form the conjugate acid, HB+.
Using similar reasoning to that used before
Kb is related to Ka for the conjugate acid. In water, the concentration of the hydroxide ion, OH−, is related to the concentration of the hydrogen ion by Kw = H+ OH−, therefore
Substitution of the expression for OH− into the expression for Kb gives
When Ka, Kb and Kw are determined under the same conditions of temperature and ionic strength, it follows, taking cologarithms, that pKb or "basicity"= pKw − pKa. In aqueous solutions at 25 °C, pKw is 13.9965,[ref]

 Section D–152[/ref] so 
with sufficient accuracy for most practical purposes.
In effect there is no need to define pKb separately from pKa, but it is done here as often only pKb values can be found in the older literature.

===Temperature dependence===

All equilibrium constants vary with temperature according to the van 't Hoff equation[ref]

 Section 7.4: The Response of Equilibria to Temperature[/ref]
R is the gas constant and T is the absolute temperature . Thus, for exothermic reactions, (the standard enthalpy change, ΔHFile:StrikeO.png, is negative) K decreases with temperature, but for endothermic reactions (ΔHFile:StrikeO.png is positive) K increases with temperature.

==Acidity in nonaqueous solutions==

A solvent will be more likely to promote ionization of a dissolved acidic molecule in the following circumstances:[tpl]Loudon[/tpl] p. 317–318
pKa values of organic compounds are often obtained using the aprotic solvents dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and acetonitrile (ACN).[ref]

 Chapter 8: Acids and Bases</ref>
DMSO is widely used as an alternative to water because it has a lower dielectric constant than water, and is less polar and so dissolves non-polar, hydrophobic substances more easily. It has a measurable pKa range of about 1 to 30. Acetonitrile is less basic than DMSO, and, so, in general, acids are weaker and bases are stronger in this solvent. Some pKa values at 25 °C for acetonitrile (ACN) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) are shown in the following tables. Values for water are included for comparison.
Ionization of acids is less in an acidic solvent than in water. For example, hydrogen chloride is a weak acid when dissolved in acetic acid. This is because acetic acid is a much weaker base than water.
Compare this reaction with what happens when acetic acid is dissolved in the more acidic solvent pure sulfuric acid[tpl]Housecroft3rd[/tpl] Chapter 8: Non-Aqueous Media
The unlikely geminal diol species CH3C(OH)2+ is stable in these environments. For aqueous solutions the pH scale is the most convenient acidity function. Other acidity functions have been proposed for non-aqueous media, the most notable being the Hammett acidity function, H0, for superacid media and its modified version H− for superbasic media.
In aprotic solvents, oligomers, such as the well-known acetic acid dimer, may be formed by hydrogen bonding. An acid may also form hydrogen bonds to its conjugate base. This process, known as homoconjugation, has the effect of enhancing the acidity of acids, lowering their effective pKa values, by stabilizing the conjugate base. Homoconjugation enhances the proton-donating power of toluenesulfonic acid in acetonitrile solution by a factor of nearly 800. In aqueous solutions, homoconjugation does not occur, because water forms stronger hydrogen bonds to the conjugate base than does the acid.
