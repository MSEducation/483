[[Elite Baseball Series]]

CATEGORIES: Baseball competitions

The Elite Baseball Series (EBS) highlights the top freshmen and sophomore high school baseball players in America, competing in two series of games in back to back weeks. All games are hosted at UCLA’s Jackie Robinson Stadium and UC Irvine’s Anteater Ballpark. The EBS provides a first look at future prospects for college and major league scouts. Over forty players have committed to compete in the premiere event. All games are umpired by Division 1 college umpires and admission is free.
Mike Gillespie, Head Coach at UC Irvine commented, "The EBS will give the players insight into what a college baseball weekend is all about. The experience a player receives participating in the EBS is unattainable anywhere else. It is truly an event a player should be a part of."[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2009[/tpl]
