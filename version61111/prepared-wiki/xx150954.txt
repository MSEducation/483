[[Snailsbury Tales]]

CATEGORIES: BBC children's television programmes

Snailsbury Tales was a children's cartoon broadcast on the BBC between 2003 and 2004. It was produced by Maverick Entertainment.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.toonhound.com/snails.htm|title=Toonhound - Snailsbury Tales (2003-2004)|publisher=Toonhound|accessdate=23 August 2010[/tpl]
The cartoon was about a town whose inhabitants were all snails. Much of the humour derived from the fact that it would take 10 days to visit the shops, or that the fire service was proud of their ability to move at 0.1Â mph.
It was narrated and voiced by Jon Culshaw and backgrounds drawn by Matt Cooley (Art teacher at Wanstead High School).
