===Themes and styles===

Wallace's fiction is often concerned with irony. His essay "E Unibus Pluram: Television and U.S. Fiction",[tpl]Cite journal|last=Wallace|first=David Foster|title=E Unibus Pluram: Television and U.S. Fiction|journal=Review of Contemporary Fiction|volume=13|issue=2|pages=151–194[/tpl] originally published in the small-circulation Review of Contemporary Fiction in 1993, proposes that television has an ironic influence on fiction writing, and urges literary authors to eschew TV's shallow rebelliousness: "I want to convince you that irony, poker-faced silence, and fear of ridicule are distinctive of those features of contemporary U.S. culture (of which cutting-edge fiction is a part) that enjoy any significant relation to the television whose weird pretty hand has my generation by the throat. I'm going to argue that irony and ridicule are entertaining and effective, and that at the same time they are agents of a great despair and stasis in U.S. culture, and that for aspiring fictionists they pose terrifically vexing problems." Wallace used many forms of irony, but focused on individuals' continued longing for earnest, unselfconscious experience and communication in a media-saturated society.[tpl]cite web|url=http://rci.rutgers.edu/%7Ewcd/jestcomp.htm |title=A Reader's Companion to Infinite Jest |publisher=Rci.rutgers.edu |accessdate=February 26, 2011[/tpl]
Wallace's novels often combine various writing modes or voices, and incorporate jargon and vocabulary (sometimes invented) from a wide variety of fields. His writing featured self-generated abbreviations and acronyms, long multi-clause sentences, and a notable use of explanatory footnotes and endnotes—often nearly as expansive as the text proper. He used endnotes extensively in Infinite Jest and footnotes in "Octet" as well as in the great majority of his nonfiction after 1996. On the Charlie Rose show in 1997, Wallace claimed that the notes were used to disrupt the linearity of the narrative, to reflect his perception of reality without jumbling the entire structure. He suggested that he could have instead jumbled up the sentences, "but then no one would read it".[tpl]cite web|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=7171768127610835594&q=david+foster+wallace |title=Charlie Rose – Jennifer Harbury & Robert Torricelli / David Foster Wallace |publisher=Google  |accessdate=February 26, 2011[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl]

According to Wallace, "fiction's about what it is to be a fucking human being", and he expressed a desire to write "morally passionate, passionately moral fiction" that could help readers "become less alone inside".[tpl]cite web|author=by D.
