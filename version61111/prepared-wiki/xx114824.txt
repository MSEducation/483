[[Euryattus]]

CATEGORIES: Salticidae

Euryattus is a genus of the spider family Salticidae (jumping spiders).
Like Holcolaetis and Thiania bhamoensis, these spiders build a flat, densely woven egg sac that is not contiguous with the silk of the nest. Euryattus posits the egg sac in rolled up leaves, similar to T. bhamoensis, which is in the same subfamily and stitches two leaves together.Li, D., Yik, S.H. & Seah, W.K. (2002).
