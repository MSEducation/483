==Biography==

His origins are disputed.E. Wright (2008) Lost Explorers (p.91) One document records him as a Portuguese in the service of Spain (having possibly born in Lisbon or São Pedro de Solis).Arquivo Nacional da Torre do Tombo, Alguns documentos do Archivo Nacional da Torre do Tombo açerca das navegações e conquistas portuguezas (Lisbon, 1892), pp. 262 – 263. A 1517 decree from the Spanish court also lists Díaz de Solís as a Portuguese.

Others claim that his birth took place in Lebrija, in the province of Seville, Spain, but he began his naval career in nearby Portugal before serving the Spanish Crown.Medina, José Toribio: Juan Díaz de Solís.

Two years after appointment to this office, Díaz de Solís prepared an expedition to explore the southern part of the new American continent. His three ships and crew of 70 men sailed from Sanlúcar de Barrameda, in Spain, on 8 October 1515. He followed the eastern coast of South America southward as far as the mouth of the Río de la Plata. He reached and named the Río de la Plata in 1516, sailing up river to the confluence of the Uruguay River and Paraná River with two officers and seven men. The little party had not proceeded far when they were attacked by local Charrúa Indians. The Charrúa Indians practiced cannibalism, theory suggests that he was eaten by the Charrúa after disembarking his ship. Surviving crew members reported Díaz de Solís and most of the other men were killed, thus putting the expedition to an end. His brother-in-law, Francisco de Torres, took charge of the ships and returned to Spain.
