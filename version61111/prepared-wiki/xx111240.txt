[[Canadian Unity Council]]

CATEGORIES: Non-profit organizations based in Canada

The Canadian Unity Council was a privately owned non-profit organization whose mission was the promotion of Canadian Unity and the current federal institutions.
The CUC started as the "Canada Committee" in 1964, in the middle of Quebec's Quiet Revolution. The period corresponds to the rise of both the Quebec independence movement and the demands for reform by Quebec federalists.
The election of the Parti Québécois in 1976 gave the impulse for a coalition strategy, which included all federalist parties. Funded by the Government of Canada, the CUC published numerous pro-Canada studies advertising the merits of Canadian federalism.
In 1996, the Centre for Research and Information on Canada (CRIC) was created to assist in the CUC's mission to promote the federal government's view of what federal Canada is.
In 2006, the Government of Stephen Harper announced the reduction of funding for the Unity Council.http://www.cbc.ca/canada/montreal/story/2007/05/29/bloc-reaction.html
