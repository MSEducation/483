==History==

UFC 20 was the final event of what the UFC called "The Road to the Heavyweight Title", a tournament of sorts spanning four events, held to determine the Heavyweight Champion after Randy Couture vacated the title (due to contract disputes with the UFC). Referees for the event were Mario Yamasaki (first time for UFC pay-per-view) and John McCarthy.
