==Legacy==

The Peshtigo Fire Museum, just west of U.S. Route 41, has a small collection of artifacts from the fire, first-person descriptions of the event, and a graveyard dedicated to victims of the tragedy. A memorial commemorating the fire was dedicated on October 8, 2012 at the bridge over the Peshtigo River."Large Crowd Attends Fire Monument Event." 2012. Peshtigo Times (11 October).
The chapel where Sister Adele Brise and others sheltered from the fire has become the Shrine of Our Lady of Good Help. The site is a Marian shrine, where visitors can make religious pilgrimages.[tpl]cite web |url=http://shrineofourladyofgoodhelp.com/htmPages/g_hst_p5.html |publisher=Shrine of Our Lady of Good Help |title=Troubles and Miracles |first1=Vojtech |last1=Cipin |year=2011 |accessdate=March 1, 2013[/tpl]
The combination of wind, topography and ignition sources that created the firestorm, primarily representing the conditions at the boundaries of human settlement and natural areas, is known as the Peshtigo Paradigm.[ref]
