==Burkitt's lymphoma==

Burkitt 'made two major contributions to medical science related to his experience in Africa. The first was the description, distribution, and ultimately, the etiology of a pediatric cancer that bears his name Burkitt's lymphoma'.[tpl]cite book |author=McKinnell, Robert Gilmore |title=The biological basis of cancer |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-521-60633-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=[/tpl] p. 257
Burkitt in 1957 observed a child with swellings in the angles of the jaw. 'About two weeks later...I looked out the window and saw another child with a swollen face...and began to investigate these jaw tumors'.Denis P. Burkitt, "Discovering Burkitt's Lymphoma" in Paul H. Levine, Epstein-Barr Virus and Human Disease (Humana Press 1987) p. xxi 'Having an intensely enquiring mind, Burkitt took the details of these cases to the records department...which showed that jaw tumours were common, and were often associated with other tumours at unusual sites'M. Anthony Epstein, "The Origins of EBV Research" in Erle S. Robertson, Epstein-Barr Virus (2005) p. 2 in children in Uganda. He kept copious notes and 'concluded that these apparently different childhood cancers were all manifestations of a single, hitherto unrecognized tumour complex'.Epstein, "Origins" p. 2 Burkitt published A sarcoma involving the jaws of African children.[tpl]cite pmid| 13628987[/tpl] The newly identified cancer became known as 'Burkitt's lymphoma. He went on to map the geographical distribution of the tumour. Burkitt, together with Dr Dennis Wright,Biography Dennis Wright published a book titled 'Burkitt's Lymphoma' in April 1970.

==Dietary fibre==

His second major contribution came when, on his return to Britain, Burkitt compared the pattern of diseases in African hospitals with Western diseases. He concluded that many Western diseases which were rare in Africa were the result of diet and lifestyle. He wrote a book Don't Forget Fibre in your Diet,[tpl]cite book |author= |title=Don't forget fibre in your diet: to help avoid many of our commonest diseases. Denis Burkitt |publisher=Martin Dunitz Ltd |location=London |year=1979 |pages= |isbn=0-906348-07-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=[/tpl] which was an international best-seller.
Although one study showed that people who eat very low levels of fiber—less than 10 grams per day—had an 18 percent higher risk of colorectal cancer, the more general idea that colon cancer is a fiber deficiency disease is now generally considered incorrect by cancer researchers.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2005/12/14/doubts_cast_on_fibers_effect_on_cancer/?rss_id=Boston+Globe+--+National+News | work=The Boston Globe | first=Liz | last=Kowalczyk | title=Doubts cast on fiber's effect on cancer | date=14 December 2005[/tpl]  Nevertheless, research suggests that a diet high in dietary fiber is advised as a precaution against other diseases such as heart disease and diabetes.[tpl]cite doi|10.1001/jama.294.22.2849[/tpl] He had an alternative theory, published in numerous articles and books, that the use of the natural squatting position for defecation protects the natives of Africa and Asia from gastrointestinal diseases. This theory has never been tested and is now gaining more attention as a promising direction for research.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2012[/tpl]
Burkitt was president of the Christian Medical Fellowship and wrote frequently on religious/medical themes. He received the Bower Award and Prize in 1992.  He died on 23 March 1993 in Gloucester and was buried in Bisley, Gloucestershire, England.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2012[/tpl]
