The Austrian Alpine Club - or more accurately the Austrian Alpine Association - ([tpl]lang-de|Oesterreichischer Alpenverein[/tpl]) has about 450,000 members (as of 2012) in 195 sections and is the largest mountaineering organisation in Austria. It is responsible for the upkeep of over 242 alpine huts in Austria and neighbouring countries. It also maintains over 40,000 kilometres of footpaths, and produces detailed maps of key mountain areas within Austria. Much of this work is done by the Association's 22,000 volunteers. 
The Association also has sections in Belgium and the United Kingdom, and a group in Poland.
In 1871 Guido von List became the Association's secretary.
The Association has an museum in Innsbruck dedicated to the history of alpinism.
