[[Silt]]

CATEGORIES: Soil, Sedimentology, Sediments

Silt is granular material of a size somewhere between sand and clay whose mineral origin is quartz and feldspar.  Silt may occur as a soil or as suspended sediment (also known as suspended load) in a surface water body.  It may also exist as soil deposited at the bottom of a water body. Silt has a moderate specific area with a typically non-sticky, plastic feel. Silt usually has a floury feel when dry, and a slippery feel when wet. Silt can be visually observed with a hand lens.

Silt is created by a variety of physical processes capable of splitting the generally sand-sized quartz crystals of primary rocks by exploiting deficiencies in their lattice.[tpl]cite journal |last= Moss |first= A J |authorlink= |coauthors= Green, P |year= 1975|title= Sand and silt grains: Predetermination of their formation and properties by microfractures in quartz |journal= Australian Journal of Earth Sciences |volume= 22 |issue= 4 |pages= 485–495|doi= 10.1080/00167617508728913|bibcode = 1975AuJES..22..485M [/tpl] These involve chemical weathering of rock[tpl]cite journal |last= Nahon |first= D |authorlink= |coauthors= Trompette, R|year= 1982|title= Origin of siltstones:glacial grinding versus weathering |journal= Sedimentology |volume= 29 |issue= |pages= 25–35|doi= 10.1111/j.1365-3091.1982.tb01706.x|bibcode = 1982Sedim..29...25N [/tpl] and regolith, and a number of physical weathering processes such as frost shattering[tpl]cite journal |last= Lautridou |first= J P |authorlink= |coauthors= Ozouf, J C |year= 1982|title= Experimental frost shattering: 15 years of research at the Centre de Geomorphologie du CNRS |journal= Progress in Physical Geography |volume= 6 |issue= 2|pages= 215–232|doi= 10.1177/030913338200600202[/tpl] and haloclasty.[tpl]cite journal |last= Goudie |first= A S |authorlink= |coauthors= Viles, H A |year= 1995 |title= The nature and pattern of debris liberated by salt weathering: a laboratory study |journal= Earth Surface Processes and Landforms |volume= 9 |issue= |pages= 95–98|doi= 10.1002/esp.3290090112|bibcode = 1984ESPL....9...95G [/tpl] The main process is abrasion through transport, including fluvial comminution, aeolian attrition and glacial grinding.[tpl]cite journal |last= Wright |first= J S |authorlink= |coauthors= Smith, B J; Whalley W B|year= 1998|title= Mechanisms of loess-sized quartz silt production and their relative effectiveness: laboratory simulations |journal= Geomorphology |volume= 45 |issue= |pages= 15–34|doi= 10.1016/S0169-555X(97)00084-6|bibcode = 1998Geomo..23...15W [/tpl] It is in semi-arid environments[tpl]cite journal |last= Haberlah |first= D |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2007 |title= A call for Australian loess |journal= AREA |volume= 39 |issue= 2 |pages= 224–229|doi= 10.1111/j.1475-4762.2007.00730.x[/tpl] that substantial quantities of silt are produced. Silt is sometimes known as "rock flour" or "stone dust", especially when produced by glacial action. Mineralogically, silt is composed mainly of quartz and feldspar. Sedimentary rock composed mainly of silt is known as siltstone.

==Grain size criteria==

In the Udden-Wentworth scale (due to Krumbein), silt particles range between 0.0039 to 0.0625 mm, larger than clay but smaller than sand particles. ISO 14688 grades silts between 0.002 mm and 0.063 mm. In actuality, silt is chemically distinct from clay, and unlike clay, grains of silt are approximately the same size in all dimensions; furthermore, their size ranges overlap. Clays are formed from thin plate-shaped particles held together by electrostatic forces, so present a cohesion.  According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture Soil Texture Classification system, the sand-silt distinction is made at the 0.05 mm particle size.[tpl]cite web |url= http://soils.usda.gov/technical/handbook/contents/part618.html#43 |title=Particle Size (618.43) |work=National Soil Survey Handbook Part 618 (42-55) Soil Properties and Qualities |publisher=United States Department of Agriculture - Natural Resource Conservation Service| accessdate=2006-05-31[/tpl] The USDA system has been adopted by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). In the Unified Soil Classification System (USCS) and the AASHTO Soil Classification system, the sand-silt distinction is made at the 0.075 mm particle size (i.e., material passing the #200 sieve). Silts and clays are distinguished mechanically by their plasticity.

==Environmental impacts==

Silt is easily transported in water or other liquid and is fine enough to be carried long distances by air in the form of dust. Thick deposits of silty material resulting from aeolian deposition are often called loess. Silt and clay contribute to turbidity in water. Silt is transported by streams or by water currents in the ocean. When silt appears as a pollutant in water the phenomenon is known as siltation.
Silt, deposited by annual floods along the Nile River, created the rich, fertile soil that sustained the Ancient Egyptian civilization. Silt deposited by the Mississippi River throughout the 20th century has decreased due to a system of levees, contributing to the disappearance of protective wetlands and barrier islands in the delta region surrounding New Orleans.
In south east Bangladesh, in the Noakhali district, cross dams were built in the 1960s whereby silt gradually started forming new land called "chars". The district of Noakhali has gained more than [tpl]convert|28|sqmi|km2|0[/tpl] of land in the past 50 years.
With Dutch funding, the Bangladeshi government began to help develop older chars in the late 1970s, and the effort has since become a multi-agency operation building roads, culverts, embankments, cyclone shelters, toilets and ponds, as well as distributing land to settlers. By fall 2010, the program will have allotted some [tpl]convert|27,000|acre|km2|sigfig=1[/tpl] to 21,000 families.http://pulitzercenter.org/openitem.cfm?id=1973[tpl]dead link|date=July 2012[/tpl]
A main source of silt in urban rivers is disturbance of soil by construction activity.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2008[/tpl]  A main source in rural rivers is erosion from plowing of farm fields, clearcutting or slash and burn treatment of forests.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2008[/tpl]
