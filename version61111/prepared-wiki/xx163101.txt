The Girl Guides Association of Tuvalu was previously a member of the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts, however membership was withdrawn in 2005.
Guiding was introduced to the Ellice Islands around 1950 by leaders from the neighboring Gilbert Islands. The movement spread quickly and in 1968 the first training was held in Funafuti, with the assistance of a trainer from New Zealand. The Tuvalu Girl Guides was established in 1975. In 1989 the Guide association signed a Deed of Transfer making the Branch Association of Tuvalu independent. Guiding is now flourishing in eight of the nine islands of Tuvalu.

Because the islands of Tuvalu have small number of young people, Guiding in Tuvalu carries out activities in conjunction with the Tuvalu Scout Association.
