The Hawaii House of Representatives is the lower house of the Hawaii State Legislature. Pursuant to Article III, Section 3 of the Hawaii Constitution, amended during the 1978 constitutional convention, the House of Representatives consists of 51 members representing an equal amount of districts across the islands. It is led by the Speaker of the House elected from the membership of the House, with majority and minority leaders elected from their party's respective caucuses.  The current Speaker of the House is Joseph M. Souki.
Legislators are elected to two-year terms and are not subject to term limits.  As in many state legislatures in the United States, the Hawaii House of Representatives is a part-time body and legislators often have active careers outside of government.  The upper chamber of the legislature is the Hawaii State Senate.

Additionally, legislators receive $150/day for per diem for members living outside Oahu during session, and $120/day during the interim while conducting official legislative business. Members living on Oahu receive $10/day during the interim while conducting legislative business.National Conference of State Legislatures, "2011 Legislator Compensation Data"
