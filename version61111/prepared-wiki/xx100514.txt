1,8-Bis(dimethylamino)naphthalene is a chemical compound that was first prepared in 1968  by Roger Alder FRS at the University of Bristol. It is often referred by the trade name Proton Sponge, a trademark of Sigma-Aldrich.[tpl]cite journal | author = F. Gerson, E.Haselbach, G. Plattner | journal = Chem. Phys.

Proton-sponge has several very interesting properties; one is its very high basicity; another is its spectroscopic properties.

==Structure and properties==

With a pKa of 12.34  for its conjugate acid in aqueous solution, 1,8-bis(dimethylamino)naphthalene is one of the strongest amine bases known, although it only absorbs protons slowly—hence the trade name. The high basicity is attributed to the relief of strain upon protonation and/or the strong interaction between the nitrogen lone pairs.[tpl]cite journal | author = R. W. Alder | journal = Chem. Rev. | year = 1989 | volume = 89 | pages = 1215–1223 | doi = 10.1021/cr00095a015 | title = Strain effects on amine basicities | issue = 5[/tpl] However, the molecule is sterically hindered, making it a weak nucleophile.  Because of this combination of properties, it has been used in organic synthesis as a highly selective non-nucleophilic base.
The spectroscopic properties of Proton-sponge are very interesting for researchers of molecular chemistry and have been researched for a long time. Proton-sponge emits a double fluorescence in various solutions due to the mixture of two ground-state species.

==Preparation==

This compound is commercially available; it may be prepared by the methylation of 1,8-diaminonaphthalene with iodomethane or dimethyl sulfate.[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1002/ejoc.200390085 | title = A Simple and Effective Procedure for the N-Permethylation of Amino-Substituted Naphthalenes | year = 2003 | author = Sorokin, Vladimir I. | journal = European Journal of Organic Chemistry | volume = 2003 | pages = 496 | last2 = Ozeryanskii | first2 = Valery A. | last3 = Pozharskii | first3 = Alexander F. | issue = 3[/tpl]

==Reactions==

Proton-sponge is methylated by using dimethyl sulfate. The pKa of trimethylated Proton-sponge is 6.43 in aqueous solution.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl]

Second generation proton sponges are known with even higher basicity. 1,8-bis(hexamethyltriaminophosphazenyl)naphthalene or HMPN[tpl]cite journal | title = 1,8-Bis(hexamethyltriaminophosphazenyl)naphthalene, HMPN: A Superbasic Bisphosphazene "Proton Sponge" | author = Volker Raab, Ekaterina Gauchenova, Alexei Merkoulov, Klaus Harms, Jörg Sundermeyer, Borislav Kovačević, and Zvonimir B.

HMPN has a pKBH+ of 29.9 in acetonitrile which is more than 11 orders of magnitude higher than Proton Sponge.
