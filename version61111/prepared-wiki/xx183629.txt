Terqa is the name of an ancient city discovered at the site of Tell Ashara on the banks of the middle Euphrates in Deir ez-Zor Governorate, Syria, approximately 80 km from the modern border with Iraq. Its name had become Sirqu by Neo-Assyrian times.

==History==

Little is yet known of the early history of Terqa, though it was a sizable entity even in the
Early Dynastic period. 
In the 2nd millennium BC it was under the control of Shamshi-Adad, followed by Mari in the time of Zimri-Lim, and then by Babylon after Mari's defeat by Hamurabi of the First Babylonian Dynasty, Terqa became the leading city of the kingdom of Khana/Hana after the decline of Babylon. Later, it fell into the sphere of the Kassite dynasty of Babylon and eventually the Neo-Assyrian Empire. A noted stele of Assyrian king Tukulti-Ninurta II was found at Terqa.

The principal god of Terqa was Dagan.

==Archaeology==

The main site is around [tpl]convert|20|acre[/tpl] in size and has a height of [tpl]convert|60|ft[/tpl]. The remains of Terqa are partly covered by the modern town of Ashara, which limits the possibilities for excavation.
The site was briefly excavated by E. Herzfeld in 1910.

In 1923, 5 days of excavations were conducted by François Thureau-Dangin and
P. Dhorrne.

From 1974 to 1986, Terqa was excavated for 10 seasons by a team from the
International Institute for Mesopotamian Area Studies including the
Institute of Archaeology at the University of California at Los Angeles, California State University at Los Angeles, Johns Hopkins University, the University of Arizona and the University of Poitiers in France. The team was
led by Giorgio Buccellati and Marilyn Kelly-Buccellati.

took over the dig and continues to work there to the present time.
