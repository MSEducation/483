Fontainebleau Las Vegas is a US$2.9 billion, 3,889-room, 68-story unfinished hotel/condo-hotel/casino development near the north end of the Las Vegas Strip on the [tpl]convert|24.5|acre|adj=on[/tpl] site previously occupied by the El Rancho and Algiers hotels in Paradise, Nevada. It was intended to be a sister property to the well-known 1950s-era Fontainebleau Miami Beach.  The building is currently the second tallest in the Las Vegas Valley.
The project, upon completion was expected to include: a [tpl]convert|95000|sqft|abbr=on[/tpl] casino, a [tpl]convert|60000|sqft|abbr=on[/tpl] spa, 3,300-seat performing arts theater, 1,018 condo-hotel units, [tpl]convert|180000|sqft|abbr=on[/tpl] of retail space, [tpl]convert|400000|sqft|abbr=on[/tpl] of indoor and outdoor conference space, nightclubs, and 24 restaurants and lounges.[tpl]cite web | author= | title=Fontainblue | url=http://www.vegastodayandtomorrow.com/fontainebleau.htm | work=Vegas Today and Tomorrow | date=29 September 2010 | accessdate=29 August 2011[/tpl]
The building was designed by Carlos Zapata Studio with Bergman Walls Associates as the architect of record.
Groundbreaking was officially announced to have begun on April 30, 2007. Gaming revenue on the Las Vegas Strip peaked at the end of October 2007. The tower was topped out on November 2008.

==Bankruptcy==

Fontainebleau Resorts CEO Glenn Schaeffer, the former chief financial officer of Mandalay Resort Group, which generated record profits before it was sold to MGM Mirage in 2005, left Fontainebleau Resorts without comment in May 2009.[tpl]cite news | author=Liz Benston | title=Outlook for Fontainebleau slides from bad to worse | url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2009/jun/08/fontainebleaus-outlook-slides-bad-worse/ | work=The Las Vegas Sun | date=8 June 2009 | accessdate=29 August 2011[/tpl] Schaeffer was primarily responsible for securing more than US$3 billion in loans for the project.
Also, Bank of America, the resort's largest lender, refused to provide financing on its committed line of credit for the project around this time; as a result, the resort's operator, Fontainebleau Las Vegas LLC, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in June 2009.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/06/10/fontainebleaulasvegas-idUSBNG42415320090610 |title=Fontainebleau Las Vegas files for Ch. 11 bankruptcy| work=Reuters |date=10 June 2009 |accessdate=29 August 2011[/tpl] In a move seen as an attempt to force creditors to supply funding, Fontainebleau's owner sued himself in the form of the general contractor suing the hotel ownership company - both controlled by the same individual, Turnberry Associates CEO Jeffrey Soffer.[tpl]cite news | author=Arnold M.

In July 2009, the resort sought permission in bankruptcy court to cancel events that were scheduled for the first half of 2010, as well as permission to cancel a lease for office space which was to be used for Fontainebleau's employee recruitment center.[tpl]cite news | author=Steve Green |url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2009/jul/17/fontainebleau-moves-cancel-conventions-worker-cont/ |title=Fontainebleau moves to cancel conventions, worker contracts | work=The Las Vegas Sun | date=17 July 2009 | accessdate=29 August 2011[/tpl]
In October 2009, Penn National Gaming was considering purchasing the partially completed resort and the [tpl]convert|24.5|acre[/tpl] of land for US$300 million. At that rate the land was being sold for US$12.25 million per acre. Two years earlier land was going for over US$30 million per acre on the Strip. Over US$2 billion has already been invested in the topped out building on the site.[tpl]cite news  | author=Howard Stutz|url=http://www.lvrj.com/business/penn-makes-strip-pitch-63659662.html#blogcomments?submitted=y |title=Penn makes Strip pitch; Gaming company begins the bidding on Fontainebleau | work=The Las Vegas Review-Journal | date=20 August 2009 | accessdate=29 August 2011[/tpl]  Penn National has been looking for an opportunity to enter the Las Vegas gaming market.

==Carl Icahn purchase==

However, in bankruptcy court in Miami, Florida on November 23, 2009, corporate raider and financier Carl Icahn who until 2008 controlled major casino/resort operator American Casino & Entertainment Properties offered US$156 million in cash and financing, outbidding Penn National Gaming for control of the Fontainebleau.[tpl]cite news | author=Arnold M. Knightly | title=Icahn wins auction to buy Fontainebleau for $150 million | url=http://www.lvrj.com/news/breaking_news/Icahn-82795542.html | work=The Las Vegas Review-Journal | date=27 January 2010 | accessdate=29 August 2011[/tpl] Icahn's bid includes a US$51 million debtor-in-possession loan, which, until the resort is auctioned, will provide funding to stabilize the building, cover employees' salaries, cover previous costs and eliminate the need for the resort to ask the bankruptcy court each week to borrow and spend money. Penn National dropped out of the bidding after going as high as US$145 million; they had offered US$101.5 million in cash and loans.
As of November 2009, the cost to complete the resort is an estimated US$1 to 1.5 billion.[tpl]cite news | author=Steve Green | title=Carl Icahn offers $156 million for Fontainebleau, outbids Penn National | url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2009/nov/23/carl-icahn-offers-136-million-fontainebleau/ | work=The Las Vegas Sun | date=23 November 2009 | accessdate=29 August 2011[/tpl]
On February 18, 2010, Carl Icahn assumed part-ownership of the project without an auction by being the only qualified bidder, paying US$150 million.
In October 2010, Icahn auctioned off the furnishings previously intended for the building. For example, the Plaza Hotel & Casino in Downtown Las Vegas bought rugs, furniture and mattresses from the sale and used them in a refurbishment that was completed in late 2011.  Future plans for the hotel project have not yet been disclosed to the public.[tpl]cite news | author=Steve Friess | title=For many, gamble lost in once-booming Las Vegas | url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hhtnUkzqDzqdU2kllH-xVoPmnHnQ?docId=CNG.55c503ebe84a0eea27eb368cc04917d2.81 | work=Agence France Presse  | date=21 October 2010 | accessdate=29 August 2011[/tpl]
The 68-story Fontainebleau Vegas is described in court papers as essentially a tear-down: valuable for its land on the north end of the Strip, but burdened by a five-year-old (as of 13 November 2013), unfinished tower that Icahn may demolish.[tpl]cite news | author=DOUGLAS HANKS | title=Settlement appears likely in Fontainebleau Las Vegas bankruptcy case | url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/11/13/3751959/settlement-appears-likely-in-fontainebleau.html#storylink=cpy | work=Miami Herald | date= 13 November 2013 | accessdate=20 March 2014[/tpl]
