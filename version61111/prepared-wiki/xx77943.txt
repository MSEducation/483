==Name==

Braunton is derived from the Old English elements: brōm; and tūn, meaning "farmstead", "settlement". It roughly translates to "the farmstead where broom grows". The name is recorded in the year 1086, in the Domesday Book, as Brantona.http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O40-Braunton.html

==History==

St. Brannock came from South Wales as a missionary and converted the native Britons to Christianity in AD 550. Brannock was a priest in the household of Brychan, King of Brecknock. He married one of the king's daughters, but the family troubles were a great incentive for leaving his royal home. At that time the Welsh Britons often raided their Dumnonian neighbours on the opposite side of the Bristol Channel.
In all probability Brannock came to North Devon with such a raid and is said to have landed on Saunton Sands at the mouth of the River Taw. At the time of his arrival the estuary of the Taw and Torridge rivers was wooded, as was a portion of Braunton Burrows. Brannock settled among a tribe of local Britons, soon establishing a strong Christian community. A church, the first in North Devon, was built at a spot near where the Caen stream began to spread its waters on the alluvial lands around the River Taw. Brannockstood, the township that grew up around this church, later became Brauntona and at the end of the 19th century, Braunton.
Braunton was half-surrounded by an extensive fresh-saltwater (brackish) marsh restricting available agricultural land.  This was surveyed by Charles Vancouver on behalf of the Board of Agriculture in 1808, and his report recommended that the marsh should be enclosed and reclaimed. This met with local approval, and James Green was appointed as engineer for the drainage scheme. An Act was obtained on 25 May 1811.[tpl]#tag:ref|Its purpose as set out in its cover description was "the Inclosing, Draining and Embanking Lands in Braunton, in the County of Devon."|group= n[/tpl]  Once the scheme was completed, responsibility for the marsh passed to a group of Marsh Inspectors, who sanctioned further work in 1854, involving the straightening and embanking of the River Caen, or Braunton Pill, to form the Braunton Canal. The scheme was completed by the addition of a new quay at Velator in the 1870s.Clare Manning, (2007), Braunton Marsh Management Scheme, Taw Torridge Estuary Forum
The village had a railway station on the now closed Ilfracombe Branch Line two stations from Barnstaple railway station on the 'Tarka' or North Devon Line from Exeter which has regular and heritage trains.

==Demography==

The population of Braunton, according to the census of 1801, was 1,296. This number increased quite rapidly in the thirty years to 1831, to 2,047 however the rate of increase slowed during the next 10 years and coinciding with the arrival of the railway fell from 2,364 in 1851 to 2,089 in 1881.  Population growth resumed and saw almost a doubling between 1961 and 2011, to 8,128 people. Data for 1801–1961 is available at Britain Through Time.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10017968/cube/TOT_POP |title=Braunton through time : Population Statistics : Total Population | accessdate=13 July 2013 | work = A Vision of Britain through Time [/tpl]  The 2001 and 2011 Censuses give detailed information about the village.
