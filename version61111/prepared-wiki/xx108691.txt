[[Spermidine]]

CATEGORIES: Polyamines

Spermidine is a polyamine compound ([tpl]chem|C|7|H|19|N|3[/tpl]) found in ribosomes and living tissues, and having various metabolic functions within organisms. It was originally isolated from semen.

==Function==

Polyamines, such as spermidine, are polycationic aliphatic amines and are multifunctional. They serve vital roles in cell survival.
Spermidine synchronizes an array of biological processes (such as Ca2+, Na+, K+ -ATPase) thus maintaining membrane potential and controlling intracellular pH and volume. Spermidine regulates biological processes, such as Ca2+ influx by glutamatergic N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDA receptor), which has been associated with nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and cGMP/PKG pathway activation and a decrease of Na+,K+-ATPase activity in cerebral cortex synaptosomes.
Spermidine is a longevity agent due to its impact on chromatin-mediated regulation of gene expression, however the mechanism is poorly understood. Spermidine synthase (SPDS) catalyzes the formation of spermidine. Spermidine helps further polyamines, this can include polyamines and thermospermine. These contribute to a resistance of dry climate and salinity.
It is known to regulate plant growth, assisting the in vitro process of transcribing RNA, and inhibition of NOS. Also, spermidine is a precursor to polyamines, such as spermine and thermospermine, most of which contribute to tolerance against drought and salinity in plants.
Spermidine has been tested and discovered to encourage hair shaft elongation and lengthen hair growth. Spermidine  has also been found to “upregulate expression of the epithelial stem cell-associated keratins K15 and K19, and dose-dependently modulated K15 promoter activity in situ and the colony forming efficiency, proliferation and K15 expression of isolated human K15-GFP+ cells in vitro.”
Spermidine is synthesized from putrescine and is a precursor of spermine.

==Sources==

Polyamines are ubiquitous in the animal, fungi, and plant kingdoms. Therefore, they appear in a wide array of foodstuff. There is a popular myth that grapefruits contain high amounts of spermidine, which probably relies on the confusion between spermidine and putrescine. While citrus fruits show high amounts of putrescine, they contain very little spermidine. Good dietary sources of spermidine are aged cheese, mushrooms, soy products, legumes, corn, and whole grains.[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.3402/fnr.v55i0.5572 | title = Polyamines in foods: development of a food database | year = 2011 | last1 = Ali | first1 = Mohamed Atiya | last2 = Poortvliet | first2 = Eric | last3 = Strömberg | first3 = Roger | last4 = Yngve | first4 = Agneta | journal = Food Nutr Res. | volume = 55 | pages = 5572 | pmid = 21249159[/tpl] In grains, the endosperm contains most of the spermidine.
