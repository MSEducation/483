Penguin approached Suelo about writing an autobiography, but he said that he would not accept payment for telling his story and he would be interested to do so only if the book was given away for free. Penguin was not interested in this approach, but asked a friend of his, Mark Sundeen, about writing a biography. Sundeen wrote The Man Who Quit Money, which was published by Riverhead/Penguin in 2012, and Suelo did not accept any money from his book but requested that the publishers give away a number of copies to people for free, which they did at promotional book tours.[tpl]cite web|title=UG#647 - Making The Universe Your Employer|url=http://www.unwelcomeguests.net/647|accessdate=12 April 2013[/tpl] A short film about Suelo, narrated by Mark Sundeen, is on BBC News Online.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17762033 |title=The American who quit money to live in a cave |publisher=BBC |accessdate=19 April 2012[/tpl]
