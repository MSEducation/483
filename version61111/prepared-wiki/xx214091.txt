The Home of Lotta Crabtree is located in downtown Grass Valley, California at 238 Mill Street.

==History==

Lotta's father, John Crabtree, arrived to Grass Valley in the early 1850s as part of the California Gold Rush.  Lotta and her mother joined him in 1853.  The Crabtrees, British immigrants, ran their home as a boarding house for the miners, many of whom were Cornish.  Lotta, then age six, caught the attention of her neighbor, the internationally acclaimed singer and dancer Lola Montez, whose home (later, a historical landmark) was on the same street.  Lotta moved away in 1856, later becoming a wealthy and beloved American entertainer of the late 19th century.[tpl]cite web |url=http://ceres.ca.gov/geo_area/counties/Nevada/landmarks.html |title=NO. 293 HOME OF LOTTA CRABTREE |accessdate=2008-07-28 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher=ceres.ca.gov[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ncgold.com/History/LottaCrabtree/lotta.html |title=Lotta Crabtree, fairy star of the Gold Rush |accessdate=2008-07-28 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher=ncgold.com[/tpl]

 Home of Lotta Crabtree

Lotta Crabtree was born in New York in 1847. In 1852-3 the gold fever brought her family to California. Several months after arriving in San Francisco, Mrs. Crabtree and Lotta went to Grass Valley and with Mr. Crabtree started a boarding house for miners. It was here that Lotta met Lola Montez, who taught her to sing and dance. In Scales, Plumas County, Lotta made her first public appearance, which led to a successful career on stage here and abroad.

The house is also listed in a database of women's history sites created by the Women's Progress Commemorative Commission.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/wori/planyourvisit/upload/women%27s%20history%20sites%20database.pdf |title=Women's Progress Commemorative Commission |pages=5 |accessdate=2008-07-28 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher=nps.gov[/tpl]  In the database, the house is incorrectly identified as being listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.  The house does not appear in the National Park Service's NRIS system or in the NRHP.COM private site echoing NRIS data.
