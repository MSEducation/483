[[Riblah]]

CATEGORIES: Hebrew Bible places

The ancient town of Riblah (meaning "fruitful"), was located on the northern frontier of Israel, 35 miles north-east of Baalbec, and 10 or 12 south of Lake Homs, on the eastern bank of the Orontes, in a wide and fertile plain.
It was here that Nebuchadnezzar had his headquarters, in his campaign against Jerusalem, and here also that Necho fixed his camp after he had routed Josiah's army at Megiddo (2 Kings 23:29-35; 25:6, 20, 21; Jer. 39:5; 52:10), and that Zedekiah's sons were killed before him (Jeremiah 52:10).
The town was on the great caravan road from Israel to Carchemish, on the Euphrates. It is described (Num. 34:11) as "on the eastern side of Ain." A place still called el Ain, i.e., "the fountain", can still be found about 10 miles away.
