In 1990, Crestwood had 360 students (Junior Kindergarten to Grade 6) and moved to its current location at Bayview and Lawrence.

In the spring of 2001, Vince Pagano became Director of the newly upper school, Crestwood Preparatory College (Grades 7 to 12) and oversaw the physical expansion of the new building near York Mills and the Don Valley Parkway. In September 2001, Crestwood Preparatory College began at the present site of the former Brookbanks Public School (which was closed in 2000 due to under-utilization of school space caused by low enrolment) and now has 550 students.
