[[Cardinality]]

CATEGORIES: Cardinal numbers, Basic concepts in infinite set theory

In mathematics, the cardinality of a set is a measure of the "number of elements of the set". For example, the set A = {2, 4, 6} contains 3 elements, and therefore A has a cardinality of 3. There are two approaches to cardinality – one which compares sets directly using bijections and injections, and another which uses cardinal numbers.[tpl]MathWorld |title=Cardinal Number |id=CardinalNumber [/tpl]
The cardinality of a set is also called its size, when no confusion with other notions of sizeSuch as length and area in geometry. – A line of finite length is a set of points that has infinite cardinality. is possible.
The cardinality of a set A is usually denoted | A |, with a vertical bar on each side; this is the same notation as absolute value and the meaning depends on context. Alternatively, the cardinality of a set A may be denoted by n(A), A, card(A), or # A.

===Definition 1: | A | = | B |===

===Definition 2: | A | ≥ | B |===

===Definition 3: | A | > | B |===

If | A | ≥ | B | and | B | ≥ | A | then | A | = | B | (Cantor–Bernstein–Schroeder theorem). The axiom of choice is equivalent to the statement that | A | ≥ | B | or | B | ≥ | A | for every A,B.[tpl]cite | author=Friedrich M.

==Cardinal numbers==

Above, "cardinality" was defined functionally. That is, the "cardinality" of a set was not defined as a specific object itself. However, such an object can be defined as follows.
The relation of having the same cardinality is called equinumerosity, and this is an equivalence relation on the class of all sets. The equivalence class of a set A under this relation then consists of all those sets which have the same cardinality as A. There are two ways to define the "cardinality of a set":
Assuming AC, the cardinalities of the infinite sets are denoted
The continuum hypothesis is independent of ZFC, a standard axiomatization of set theory; that is, it is impossible to prove the continuum hypothesis or its negation from ZFC (provided ZFC is consistent). See below for more details on the cardinality of the continuum.[ref]
