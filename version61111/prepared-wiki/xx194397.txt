==Holdings==

OSA curates, preserves and makes accessible multilingual collections in over 40 languages spanning the period from World War II until the present, with a global geographical coverage but special focus on East-Central Europe and the former Soviet Union.
OSA’s acquisition policy aims to collect and preserve the documentary heritage of civil society, human rights movements, transnational and intra-governmental organizations, social and protest movements, and the personal papers of known oppositional figures and social activists. From its inception, OSA has assisted in rescuing endangered collections, and plays a bridging role in making scattered documentary legacies of communities and supranational organizations researchable. By introducing open access principles in the region since 2002, OSA continues to support and initiate projects about freedom of information, freedom of speech, access to information and open standards.
