[[Rapid radiative transfer model]]

CATEGORIES: Atmospheric radiative transfer codes

The rapid radiative transfer model (RRTM) is a validated, correlated k-distribution band model for the calculation of longwave and shortwave atmospheric radiative fluxes and heating rates.  The Rapid Radiative Transfer Model for GCMs  is an accelerated version of RRTM that provides improved efficiency with minimal loss of accuracy for application to general circulation models.
