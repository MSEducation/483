[tpl]IAST|Nyāya[/tpl] (Sanskrit ny-āyá, literally "recursion", used in the sense of "syllogism, inference") is the name given to one of the six orthodox or astika schools of Hindu philosophy—specifically the school of logic. The Nyaya school of philosophical speculation is based on texts known as the Nyaya Sutras, which were written by Aksapada Gautama in the 2nd century CE.B. K. Matilal "Perception. An Essay on Classical Indian Theories of Knowledge" (Oxford University Press, 1986), p. xiv.

==Overview==

The most important contribution made by the Nyaya school to modern Hindu thought is its methodology to prove existence of God, based on the Vedas. This methodology is based on a system of logic that, subsequently, has been adopted by the majority of the other Indian schools, orthodox or not. This is comparable to how Western science and philosophy can be said to be largely based on Aristotelian logic.
However, Nyaya differs from Aristotelian logic in that it is more than logic in its own right. Its followers believed that obtaining valid knowledge was the only way to obtain release from suffering. They therefore took great pains to identify valid sources of knowledge and to distinguish these from mere false opinions. Nyaya is thus a form of epistemology in addition to logic.
According to the Nyaya school, there are exactly four sources of knowledge (pramāṇas): perception, inference, comparison, and testimony. Knowledge obtained through each of these can, of course, still be either valid or invalid. As a result, Nyaya scholars again went to great pains to identify, in each case, what it took to make knowledge valid, in the process creating a number of explanatory schemes. In this sense, Nyaya is probably the closest Indian equivalent to contemporary analytic philosophy.

==Sixteen ''Padārthas or Categories==

The Nyaya metaphysics recognizes sixteen padarthas or categories and includes all six (or seven) categories of the Vaisheshika in the second one of them, called prameya.Sharma, C. (1997). A Critical Survey of Indian Philosophy, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, ISBN 81-208-0365-5, p.192 These sixteen categories are pramāṇa (valid means of knowledge), prameya (objects of valid knowledge), saṁśaya (doubt), prayojana (aim), dṛṣṭānta (example), siddhānta (conclusion), avayava (members of syllogism), tarka (hypothetical reasoning), nirṇaya (settlement), vāda (discussion), jalpa (wrangling), vitaṇḍā (cavilling), hetvābhāsa (fallacy), chala (quibbling), jāti (sophisticated refutation) and nigrahasthāna (point of defeat).Hiriyanna, M. (1993, reprint 2000). Outlines of Indian Philosophy, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, ISBN 81-208-1099-6, pp.245,245nChattopadhyaya, D. (1986), Indian Philosophy: A Popular Introduction, People's Publishing House, New Delhi, ISBN 81-7007-023-6, p.163

==Epistemology==

The Nyaya epistemology considers knowledge (jñāna) or cognition (buddhi) as apprehension (upalabdhi) or consciousness (anubhava). Knowledge may be valid or invalid. The Naiyayikas (the Nyaya scholars) accepted four valid means (pramaṇa) of obtaining valid knowledge (prama) - perception (pratyakṣa), inference (anumāna), comparison (upamāna) and verbal testimony (śabda). Invalid knowledge includes memory (smṛti), doubt (saṁśaya), error (viparyaya) and hypothetical reasoning (tarka).Sharma, C. (1997). A Critical Survey of Indian Philosophy, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, ISBN 81-208-0365-5, pp.192-6

===Perception===

Pratyakṣa (perception) occupies the foremost position in the Nyaya epistemology. Perception is defined by Akṣapāda Gautama in his Nyaya Sutra (I,i.4) as a 'non-erroneous cognition which is produced by the intercourse of sense-organs with the objects, which is not associated with a name and well-defined'. Perception can be of two types, laukika (ordinary) and alaukika (extraordinary).

====Ordinary perception====

Ordinary (Laukika or Sadharana) perception is of six types - visual-by eyes, olfactory-by nose, auditory-by ears, tactile-by skin, gustatory-by tongue and mental-by mind.

====Extra-ordinary perception====

Extraordinary (Alaukika or Asadharana) perception is of three types, viz., Samanyalakshana (perceiving generality from a particular object), Jñanalakshana (when one sense organ can also perceive qualities not attributable to it, as when seeing a chili, one knows that it would be bitter or hot), and Yogaja (when certain human beings, from the power of Yoga, can perceive past, present and future and have supernatural abilities, either complete or some).

====Determinate and indeterminate perception====

The Naiyayika maintains two modes or stages in perception. The first is called nirvikalpa (indeterminate), when one just perceives an object without being able to know its features, and the second savikalpa (determinate), when one is able to clearly know an object. All laukika and alaukika pratyakshas are savikalpa, but it is necessarily preceded by an earlier stage when it is indeterminate. Vātsāyana says that if an object is perceived with its name we have determinate perception but if it is perceived without a name, we have indeterminate perception. Jayanta Bhatta says that indeterminate perception apprehends substance, qualities and actions and universals as separate and indistinct something and also it does not have any association with name, while determinate perception aprrehends all these together with a name. There is yet another stage called Pratyabhijñā, when one is able to re-recognise something on the basis of memory.

===Inference===

Anumāna (inference) is one of the most important contributions of the Nyaya. It can be of two types: inference for oneself (Svarthanumana, where one does not need any formal procedure, and at the most the last three of their 5 steps), and inference for others (Parathanumana, which requires a systematic methodology of 5 steps). Inference can also be classified into 3 types: Purvavat (inferring an unperceived effect from a perceived cause), Sheshavat (inferring an unperceived cause from a perceived effect) and Samanyatodrishta (when inference is not based on causation but on uniformity of co-existence). A detailed anaysis of error is also given, explaining when anumana could be false.

===Comparison===

Upamāna, which can be roughly translated as comparison is the knowledge of the relationship between a word and the object denoted by the word. It is produced by the knowledge of resemblance or similarity, given some pre-description of the new object beforehand.

===Verbal testimony===

Śabda or verbal testimony is defined as the statement of a trustworthy person (āptavākya), and consists in understanding its meaning. It can be of two types, Vaidika (Vedic), which are the words of the four sacred Vedas, and are described as the Word of God, having been composed by God, and Laukika, or words and writings of trustworthy human beings. Vaidika testimony is preferred as the infallible word of God, and Laukika testimony must by its nature be questioned and overruled by more trustworthy knowledge if such becomes available.

==Theory of inference==

The methodology of inference involves a combination of induction and deduction by moving from particular to particular via generality. It has five steps, as in the example shown:
In Nyāya terminology for this example, the hill would be called as paksha (minor term), the fire is called as sādhya (major term), the smoke is called as hetu, and the relationship between the smoke and the fire is called as vyapti (middle term). Hetu further has five characteristics: (1) It must be present in the Paksha, (2) It must be present in all positive instances, (3) It must be absent in all negative instances, (4) It must not incompatible with the minor term or Paksha and (5) All other contradictions by other means of knowledge should be absent. The fallacies in Anumana (hetvābhasa) may occur due to the following:

==The Nyaya theory of causation==

A cause is defined as an unconditional and invariable antecedent of an effect and an effect as an unconditional and invariable consequent of a cause. The same cause produces the same effect; and the same effect is produced by the same cause. The cause is not present in any hidden form whatsoever in its effect.
The following conditions should be met:
Nyaya recognizes five kinds of accidental antecedents Anyathasiddha
Nyaya recognizes three kinds of cause:

==Anyathakyativada of Nyaya==

The Nyaya theory of error is similar to that of Kumarila's Viparita-khyati (see Mimamsa). The Naiyayikas also believe like Kumarila that error is due to a wrong synthesis of the presented and the represented objects. The represented object is confused with the presented one. The word 'anyatha' means 'elsewise' and 'elsewhere' and both these meanings are brought out in error. The presented object is perceived elsewise and the represented object exists elsewhere. They further maintain that knowledge is not intrinsically valid but becomes so on account of extraneous conditions (paratah pramana during both validity and invalidity).

==Nyaya on God and salvation==

Early Naiyayikas wrote very little about Ishvara (literally, the Supreme Soul). However, later Buddhists in India had become from agnostic to strictly atheistic. As a reaction, the later Naiyayikas entered into disputes with the Buddhists and tried to prove the existence of God on the basis of inference. They made this question a challenge to their own existence. Udayana's Nyayakusumanjali gave the following nine arguments to prove the existence of creative God:Sharma, C. (1997). A Critical Survey of Indian Philosophy, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, ISBN 81-208-0365-5, pp.209-10

===On monotheism===

Not only have the Naiyayikas provided arguments to prove the existence of God, but they have also given an argument that such a God can only be one. In the Nyayakusumanjali, this is discussed against the proposition of the Mimamsa school—that let us assume there were many gods (Devas) and sages (rishis) in the beginning, who wrote the Vedas and created the world. Udayana says that: they assume such omniscient beings, those endowed with the various superhuman faculties of assuming infinitesimal size, and so on, and capable of creating everything, then we reply that the law of parsimony bids us assume only one such, namely Him, the adorable Lord. There can be no confidence in a non-eternal and non omniscient being, and hence it follows that according to the system which rejects God, the tradition of the Veda is simultaneously overthrown; there is no other way open.  In other words, Udayana says that the polytheist would have to give elaborate proofs for the existence and origin of his several celestial spirits, none of which would be logical. So it is much more logical to assume only one, eternal and omniscient God.

===On salvation===

The Naiyayikas believe that the bondage of the world is due to false knowledge, which can be removed by constantly thinking of its opposite (pratipakshabhavana), namely, the true knowledge.Dasgupta, Surendranath (1975). A History of Indian Philosophy, Vol. I, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, ISBN 81-208-0412-8[tpl]Please check ISBN|reason=Check digit (8) does not correspond to calculated figure.[/tpl], p.365 So the opening aphorism of the [tpl]IAST |Nyāya Sūtra[/tpl] states that only the true knowledge lead to niḥśreyasa (salvation). But the Nyaya school also maintains that the God's grace is essential for obtaining true knowledge.Sharma, C. (1997). A Critical Survey of Indian Philosophy, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, ISBN 81-208-0365-5, p.208 Jayanta, in his Nyayamanjari describes salvation as a passive stage of self in its natural purity, unassociated with pleasure, pain, knowledge and willingness.Dasgupta, Surendranath (1975).

==Literature of Nyaya==

The earliest text of the Nyāya School is the [tpl]IAST |Nyāya Sūtra[/tpl] of [tpl]IAST |Akṣapāda Gautama[/tpl]. The text is divided into five books, each having two sections. [tpl]IAST |Vātsāyana[/tpl]'s [tpl]IAST |Nyāya Bhāṣya[/tpl] is a classic commentary on the [tpl]IAST |Nyāya Sūtra[/tpl]. Udyotakara's [tpl]IAST |Nyāya Vārttika[/tpl] (6th century CE) is written to defend [tpl]IAST |Vātsāyana[/tpl] against the attacks made by  [tpl]IAST |Dignāga[/tpl]. [tpl]IAST |Vācaspati Miśra[/tpl]'s  [tpl]IAST |Nyāyavārttikatātparyaṭīkā[/tpl] (9th century CE) is the next major exposition of this school. Two other texts, [tpl]IAST |Nyāyaṣūcinibandha[/tpl] and [tpl]IAST |Nyāyasūtraddhāra[/tpl] are also attributed to him. Udayana's (984 CE) [tpl]IAST |Nyāyatātparyapariśuddhi[/tpl] is an important commentary on [tpl]IAST |Vācaspati[/tpl]'s treatise. His [tpl]IAST |Nyāyakusumāñjali[/tpl] is the first systematic account of theistic [tpl]IAST |Nyāya[/tpl]. His other works include [tpl]IAST |Ātmatattvaviveka[/tpl], [tpl]IAST |Kiraṇāvali[/tpl] and [tpl]IAST |Nyāyapariśiṣṭa[/tpl]. Jayanta Bhatta's [tpl]IAST |Nyāyamañjari[/tpl] (10th century CE) is basically an independent work. [tpl]IAST |Bhāsavarajña[/tpl]'s  [tpl]IAST |Nyāyasāra[/tpl] (10th century CE) is a survey of [tpl]IAST |Nyāya[/tpl] philosophy.Radhakrishnan, S. Indian Philosophy, Vol. II, Oxford University Press, New Delhi, 2006, ISBN 0-19-563820-4, pp.36-40
The later works on [tpl]IAST |Nyāya[/tpl] accepted the [tpl]IAST |Vaiśeṣika[/tpl] categories and [tpl]IAST |Varadarāja[/tpl]'s [tpl]IAST |Tārkikarakṣā[/tpl] (12th century CE) is a notable treatise of this syncretist school. [tpl]IAST |Keśava Miśra[/tpl]'s [tpl]IAST |Tārkabhaṣā[/tpl] (13th century CE) is another important work of this school.Radhakrishnan, S. Indian Philosophy, Vol. II, Oxford University Press, New Delhi, 2006, ISBN 0-19-563820-4, p.40
[tpl]IAST |Gangeśa Upādhyāya[/tpl]'s [tpl]IAST |Tattvacintāmaṇi[/tpl] (12th century CE) is the first major treatise of the new school of [tpl]IAST |Navya Nyāya[/tpl]. His son, [tpl]IAST |Vardhamāna Upādhyāya[/tpl]'s [tpl]IAST |Nyāyanibandhaprakāśa[/tpl]  (1225 CE), though a commentary on Udayana's [tpl]IAST |Nyāyatātparyapariśuddhi[/tpl], incorporated his father's views. Jayadeva wrote a commentary on [tpl]IAST |Tattvacintāmaṇi[/tpl] known as [tpl]IAST |Āloka[/tpl] (13th century CE). [tpl]IAST |Vāsudeva Sārvabhauma[/tpl]'s  [tpl]IAST |Tattvacintāmaṇivyākhyā[/tpl] (16th century CE) is first great work of Navadvipa school of  [tpl]IAST |Navya Nyāya[/tpl]. [tpl]IAST |Raghunātha Śiromaṇi[/tpl]'s [tpl]IAST |Tattvacintāmaṇidīdhiti[/tpl] and [tpl]IAST |Padārthakhaṇḍana[/tpl] are the next important works of this school. [tpl]IAST |Viśvanatha[/tpl]'s  [tpl]IAST |Nyāyasūtravṛtti[/tpl] (17th century CE) is also a notable work.Radhakrishnan, S. Indian Philosophy, Vol. II, Oxford University Press, New Delhi, 2006, ISBN 0-19-563820-4, p.41 The Commentaries on [tpl]IAST |Tattvacintāmaṇidīdhiti[/tpl] by Jagadish Tarkalankar (17th century CE) and Gadadhar Bhattacharya (17th century CE) are the last two notable works of this school.
[tpl]IAST |Annaṁbhatta[/tpl] (17th century CE) tried to develop a consistent system by combining the ancient and the new schools, [tpl]IAST |Prācina nyāya[/tpl] and [tpl]IAST |Navya nyāya[/tpl] and [tpl]IAST |Vaiśeṣika[/tpl] to develop the [tpl]IAST |nyāya-vaiśeṣika[/tpl] school. His [tpl]IAST |Tarkasaṁgraha[/tpl] and [tpl]IAST |Dīpikā[/tpl] are the popular manuals of this school.
