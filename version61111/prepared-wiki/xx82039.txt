==History==

For many centuries, Biberach was an Imperial Free City ([tpl]lang-de|Freie Reichsstadt[/tpl]) in the Holy Roman Empire.  In that role it participated in the 1792 Reichstag.
During the Protestant Reformation, Biberach was notable for being — eventually along only with Ravensburg, Augsburg and Dinkelsbühl — a "Mixed Imperial City" ([tpl]lang-de|Paritätische Reichsstadt[/tpl]) where the Peace of Westphalia caused the establishment of a joint Catholic–Protestant government and administrative system, with equality offices ([tpl]lang-de|Gleichberechtigung[/tpl]) and a precise and equal distribution between Catholic and Protestant civic officials.
This status ended in 1803, when Biberach was annexed by the Margraviate of Baden, soon to become a grand-duchy. In 1806, it was traded to the Kingdom of Württemberg in exchange for the town of Villingen; becoming part of the German Empire on its creation in 1871.
