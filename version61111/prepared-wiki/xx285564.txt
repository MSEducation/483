==History==

The foundation of Roydon County Primary School originates from a charity school built in 1752. By 1827, a church Sunday school had been established in the village and by 1835 the school had 27 pupils. At this time a day school had opened where 27 children were taught at their parents' expense. By 1839, in addition to the charity school, a British school at the Independent church, Harlow Road, a dame school with 11 children, and a free school supervised by the vicar, where 27 were taught on two days a week. By 1846, the dame school with 41 children survived, but the vicar's school had closed. A school board was elected in 1874, and the British school, which by then had moved to the Dower House barn, was closed. The board took over the charity school and replaced the building with a new one for 172 children in 1876. The 1876 building, which has become a village landmark saw the start of the modern school we know today.http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=63857#s7
