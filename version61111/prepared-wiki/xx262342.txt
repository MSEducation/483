CATEGORIES: Lists of United States Senators by seniority, 112th United States Congress

This is a classification of United States Senators by seniority from January 3, 2011 to January 3, 2013. It is a historical listing and will contain people who have not served the entire two-year Congress should anyone resign, die, or be expelled.
Order of service is based on the commencement of the senator's first term. Behind this is former service as a senator (only giving the senator seniority within his or her new incoming class), service as Vice President, a House member, a Cabinet secretary, or a governor of a state. The final factor is the population of the senator's state.A Chronological List of United States Senators 1789-Present, via www.senate.gov  1971 U.S Census Report Contains 1970 Census results. 1981 U.S Census Report Contains 1980 Census results. 1991 U.S Census Report Contains 1990 Census results.2000 Census State Population Rankings
