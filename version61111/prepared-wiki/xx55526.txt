Andrew Aitken "Andy" Rooney (January 14, 1919 – November 4, 2011) was an American radio and television writer.

==Early life and education==

Rooney was born Andrew Aitken Rooney in Albany, the son of Walter Scott Rooney (1888–1959) and Ellinor (Reynolds) Rooney (1886–1980). He attended The Albany Academy,[tpl]cite web|url=http://readme.readmedia.com/Andy-Rooney-To-Kick-Off-The-Albany-Academies-Alumni-ae-Speaker-Series-On-September-19/287079 |title=Andy Rooney To Kick Off The Albany Academies' Alumni/ae Speaker Series On September 19 |publisher=Readme.readmedia.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-14[/tpl] and later attended Colgate University in Hamilton in Central New York,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.colgate.edu/news/blog/archives/archivedisplay?nwID=2053 |title=Colgate alumni play important roles in variety of fields |publisher=Colgate.edu |date=2005-06-02 |accessdate=2011-11-14[/tpl] where he was initiated into the Sigma Chi fraternity, before he was drafted into the United States Army in August 1941.

==World War II==

Rooney began his career in newspapers while in the Army when, in 1942, he began writing for Stars and Stripes in London during World War II.Rooney, Andy. How it Feels to Bomb Germany ..., PBS.org
In February 1943, flying with the Eighth Air Force, he was one of six correspondents who flew on the second American bombing raid over Germany. Later, he was one of the first American journalists to visit the Nazi concentration camps near the end of World War II, and one of the first to write about them. During a segment on Tom Brokaw's The Greatest Generation, Rooney stated that he had been opposed to World War II because he was a pacifist. He recounted that what he saw in those concentration camps made him ashamed that he had opposed the war and permanently changed his opinions about whether "just wars" exist.
For his service as a war correspondent in combat zones during the war Rooney was decorated with the Bronze Star Medal and Air Medal.[tpl]cite news|title=Medals of Honor|author=Andy Rooney|date=September 1, 1987|publisher=The Hour|location=Norwalk, CN|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1916&dat=19870901&id=u_ggAAAAIBAJ&sjid=T3QFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1135,25679[/tpl]
Rooney's 1995 memoir, My War, chronicles his war reporting. In addition to recounting firsthand several notable historical events and people (including the entry into Paris and the Nazi concentration camps), Rooney describes how it shaped his experience both as a writer and reporter.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2010-01-14-rooney14_CV_N.htm | work=USA Today | title='A few minutes' with Andy Rooney becomes 91 years | first=Bob | last=Minzesheimer | date=January 19, 2010[/tpl]

==Career==

Rooney joined CBS in 1949, as a writer for Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts, when Godfrey was at his peak on CBS radio and TV. It opened the show up to a variety of viewers. The program was a hit, reaching number one in 1952, during Rooney's tenure with the program. It was the beginning of a close lifelong friendship between Rooney and Godfrey. He wrote for Godfrey's daytime radio and TV show Arthur Godfrey Time. He later moved on to The Garry Moore Show, which became a hit program. During the same period, he wrote for CBS News public affairs programs such as The Twentieth Century.
According to CBS News's biography of him, "Rooney wrote his first television essay, a longer-length precursor of the type he does on 60 Minutes, in 1964, "An Essay on Doors."[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1998/07/08/60minutes/bios/main13495.shtml | publisher=CBS News | title=Andy Rooney | date=July 8, 1998 | deadurl=yes[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=February 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl] From 1962 to 1968 he collaborated with another close friend, the late CBS News correspondent Harry Reasoner — Rooney writing and producing, Reasoner narrating — on such notable CBS News specials as "An Essay on Bridges" (1965), "An Essay on Hotels" (1966), "An Essay on Women" (1967), and "The Strange Case of the English Language" (1968).  In 1968, he wrote two CBS News specials in the series "Of Black America," and his script for "Black History: Lost, Stolen, or Strayed" won him his first Emmy."[tpl]cite news | title = Andy Rooney | publisher = CBS News| date = September 21, 2005 | url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1998/07/08/60minutes/main13495.shtml | accessdate = October 28, 2008 | deadurl=yes| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081018174703/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1998/07/08/60minutes/main13495.shtml| archivedate= 18 October 2008 [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=February 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl]
When CBS declined to broadcast his World War II memoir, titled "An Essay on War", in 1970, Rooney quit CBS and read the opinion himself on PBS — his first appearance on television.Bauden, David: "'60 Minutes' commentator Andy Rooney dies" Today, November 5, 2011 That show in 1971 won Rooney his third Writers Guild Award. Rooney re-joined CBS in 1973, to write and produce special programs. He also wrote the script for the 1975 documentary FDR: The Man Who Changed America.
After his return to the network, Rooney wrote and appeared in several prime-time specials for CBS, including In Praise of New York City (1974),[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/12/Andy-Rooney.html |title=Andy Rooney Biography |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-14[/tpl] the Peabody Award-winning Mr. Rooney Goes to Washington (1975), Mr. Rooney Goes to Dinner (1978), and Mr. Rooney Goes to Work (1977). Transcripts of these specials, as well as of some of the earlier collaborations with Reasoner, are contained in the book A Few Minutes with Andy Rooney. Another special, Andy Rooney Takes Off, followed in 1984.

==A Few Minutes with Andy Rooney==

Rooney's "end-of-show" segment on 60 Minutes, "A Few Minutes with Andy Rooney" (originally "Three Minutes or So With Andy Rooney"), began in 1978, as a summer replacement for the debate segment "Point/Counterpoint" featuring Shana Alexander and James Kilpatrick. The segment proved popular enough with viewers that beginning in the fall of 1978, it was seen in alternate weeks with the debate segment. At the end of the 1978–1979 season, "Point/Counterpoint" was dropped altogether.
In the segment, Rooney typically offered satire on a trivial everyday issue, such as the cost of groceries, annoying relatives, or faulty Christmas presents. Rooney's appearances on "A Few Minutes with Andy Rooney" often included whimsical lists, e.g., types of milk,[tpl]cite news| last = Rooney | first = Andy | title = What Have They Done to Milk? | work=60 Minutes| publisher = CBS News | date = November 6, 2005| url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/11/03/60minutes/rooney/main1007432.shtml | accessdate =October 27, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081008073033/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/11/03/60minutes/rooney/main1007432.shtml| archivedate= 8 October 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] bottled water brands,[tpl]cite news | last = Rooney | first = Andy | title = Andy Bottles Eau De Rooney |work=60 Minutes| publisher = CBS News | date = October 16, 2005| url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/10/13/60minutes/rooney/main939291.shtml| accessdate = October 27, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081009012505/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/10/13/60minutes/rooney/main939291.shtml| archivedate= 9 October 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] car brands,[tpl]cite news | last = Rooney | first = Andy | title = Andy Checks Out The New Rides At The Auto Show |work=60 Minutes| publisher =CBS News | date = April 15, 2007| url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/04/12/60minutes/rooney/main2677598.shtml | accessdate = October 27, 2008[/tpl] sports mascots,[tpl]cite news | last = Rooney | first = Andy | title = What's In A Team Name? |work=60 Minutes| publisher = CBS News| date = January 14, 2007| url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/01/12/60minutes/rooney/main2355874.shtml | accessdate =October 27, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081005203343/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/01/12/60minutes/rooney/main2355874.shtml| archivedate= 5 October 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] etc.  In later years, his segments became more political as well. Despite being best known for his television presence on 60 Minutes, Rooney always considered himself a writer who incidentally appeared on television behind his famous walnut table, which he made himself.

==Controversies==

Rooney made a number of comments which elicited strong reactions from fans and producers alike.

===Comments on minorities===

Rooney wrote a column in 1992 that posited that it was "silly" for Native Americans to complain about team names like the Redskins, in which he wrote in part, "The real problem is, we took the country away from the Indians, they want it back and we're not going to give it to them. We feel guilty and we'll do what we can for them within reason, but they can't have their country back. Next question."[tpl]cite news | last = Aspan | first = Maria | authorlink = Maria Aspan | title = Andy Rooney Regrets a Racist Comment in a Recent Column | work = The New York Times| date = August 27, 2007| url = http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/27/business/media/27rooney.html | accessdate = October 28, 2008[/tpl] After receiving many letters from Native Americans he wrote "when so many people complain about one thing, you have to assume you may have been wrong".[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1916&dat=19920416&id=vQghAAAAIBAJ&sjid=dnYFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1489,2362788|title=An Apology to Indians...

In a 2007 column for Tribune media services, he wrote, "I know all about Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig, but today's baseball stars are all guys named Rodriguez to me." Rooney later commented, "Yeah, I probably shouldn't have said it, but it's a name that seems common in baseball now. I certainly didn't think of it in any derogatory sense."
In 1990, Rooney was suspended without pay for three months by then-CBS News President David Burke, because of the negative publicity around his saying that "too much alcohol, too much food, drugs, homosexual unions, cigarettes are all known to lead to premature death."[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18560_162-57319150/andy-rooney-dead-at-92/ | publisher=CBS News | title=Andy Rooney Dead at 92 | date=November 5, 2011[/tpl] He wrote an explanatory letter to a gay organization after being ordered not to do so. After only four weeks without Rooney, 60 Minutes lost 20 percent of its audience. CBS management then decided that it was in the best interest of the network to have Rooney return immediately.[tpl]cite news | last = Zoglin | first = Richard | authorlink = Richard Zoglin | author2 = Leslie Whitaker| title = The Return of a Curmudgeon | work = Time | date = 12 March 1990 | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,969591,00.html | accessdate = October 29, 2008[/tpl]
After Rooney's reinstatement, he made his remorse public:[tpl]cite book |last=Rooney |first=Andy|title=Years of Minutes|year=2003|page=  151–152[/tpl]
Rooney always denied that he was a racist.

He said that makes him proud, and that it proves that the country has "come a long way — a good way."[tpl]cite news| last = Rooney| first = Andy | title = Andy Rooney On The Election| work = 60 Minutes| publisher=CBS News| date = November 9, 2008| url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/11/07/60minutes/rooney/main4581854.shtml| accessdate = November 11, 2008[/tpl]

===Remarks on Kurt Cobain's suicide===

In a 1994 segment, Rooney attracted controversy with his remarks on Kurt Cobain's suicide. He expressed his dismay that the death of Richard Nixon was overshadowed by Cobain's suicide, stating that he had never heard of Cobain or his band, Nirvana. He went on to say that Cobain's suicide made him angry. "A lot of people would like to have the years left that he threw away," Rooney said. "What's all this nonsense about how terrible life is?" he asked, adding rhetorically to a young woman who had wept at the suicide, "I'd love to relieve the pain you're going through by switching my age for yours." In addition, he asked "What would all these young people be doing if they had real problems like a Depression, World War II or Vietnam?" and commented that "If Cobain applied the same brain to his music that he applied to his drug-infested life, it's reasonable to think that his music may not have made much sense either."[tpl]cite episode | title=April 17, 1994|network=CBS | series= 60 Minutes | airdate=17 April 1994[/tpl]
On the following Sunday's show, he apologized on the air, saying he should have taken Cobain's depression into account. He also read only critical feedback from listeners without interjecting any commentary of his own.[tpl]cite episode | title=April 24, 1994|network=CBS | series= 60 Minutes | airdate=24 April 1994[/tpl][tpl]cite book |last=Rooney |first=Andy |title=Years of Minutes |year=2003 |pages= 266–268[/tpl]

In 1993, CBS released a two-volume VHS tape set of the best of Rooney's commentaries and field reports, called "The Andy Rooney Television Collection — His Best Minutes." In 2006, CBS released three DVDs of his more recent commentaries, "Andy Rooney On Almost Everything," "Things That Bother Andy Rooney," and "Andy Rooney's Solutions."[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl]

Though Rooney has been called Irish-American, he once said "I'm proud of my Irish heritage, but I'm not Irish. I'm not even Irish-American. I am American, period."
In 2005, when four people were fired at CBS News perhaps because of the Killian documents controversy, Rooney said, "The people on the front lines got fired while the people most instrumental in getting the broadcast on escaped." Others at CBS had "kept mum" about the controversy.[tpl]cite news| last = Johnson| first = Peter| author2 = Mark Memmott| title = CBS firings should go higher up, critics say| work = USA Today| date = January 10, 2005 | url = http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2005-01-10-cbs-reaction_x.htm| accessdate = November 12, 2008[/tpl]

Rooney was married to Marguerite "Margie" Rooney (née Howard) for 62 years, until she died of heart failure in 2004.
