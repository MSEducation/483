Vinca period is preserved in Plocnik locality ([tpl]convert|22|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. from Prokuplje), on the left side of Prokuplje –Kursumlija road. The earliest known metalworking in Europe was found in Pločnik in 2007 dating to 5500 BC making the Copper Age several centuries older than previously thought.http://remotecentral.blogspot.com/2007/10/archaeologists-in-serbia-discover.html Those agricultural settlements were replaced by the emerging Thracians and then the invading Celtic Scordisci in 279 BC. Pieces of ceramics found by the Latin church are traces of those tribes movement on their way to Greece.
Between 73-75 B.C., after the Romans subjugated the tribes of the region, this part of Serbia became a part of the Roman province of Moesia. It was part of the Roman „via militaris“ (connecting the central Balkans with the Adriatic) from Niš, the town was known as Hammeum, or Hameo; the first known name of the settlement. At the end of 4th century A.D., when the Roman empire was divided, all settlements in Toplica region belonged to (Byzantine Empire). The name of the place was Komplos or Komblos (village-town). Some historians believed that Komplos was rebuilt by Emperor Justinian.
When South Slavic tribes first settled in this area in the 6th century, Komplos was rendered as the Slavic Prokuplje.
The first written document about today’s town name is from 1395 A.D. when the Duchess Milica gave away as a present two houses and some belongings from the town of St. Prokopius to St. Panteleimon monastery on holy Mount Athos in modern-day Greece. Today’s name of the town of Prokuplje was first seen in use after the replacement of St. Prokopius' relics from Nis in the year 1396 A.D.
In early middle age, during the rule of Stefan Nemanja, Prokuplje is not mentioned in any written documents. The settlement gain its importance in Tsar Lazar's period, before the Turkish invasion, when the fortress on Hisar Hill was rebuilt. Prokuplje was besieged in 1454 and during 423 years of Turkish rule the name of the place was Urcub or Okrub. It was part of the Sanjak of Niš.[tpl]cite book|title=Godišnjak grada Beograda|year=1977|publisher=Museum of the Belgrade|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=OE_jAAAAMAAJ&q=%22%D0%9D%D0%B8%D1%88%D0%BA%D0%B8+%D1%81%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%9F%D0%B0%D0%BA%22&dq=%22%D0%9D%D0%B8%D1%88%D0%BA%D0%B8+%D1%81%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%9F%D0%B0%D0%BA%22&hl=en&ei=6MgaTq6QF8_2sgbnv_S4Dw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCcQ6AEwADgK|accessdate=11 July 2011|page=116[/tpl] Between the 16th and 17th centuries, the town gets important status and becomes very important like other Serbian towns: Kruševac, Stalac and Leskovac.
