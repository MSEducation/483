The Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Center for Public Affairs is the presidential library and final resting place of Ronald Wilson Reagan, the 40th President of the United States. Designed by Hugh Stubbins and Associates, the library is located in Simi Valley, California, about [tpl]convert|40|mi|km[/tpl] northwest of Downtown Los Angeles and [tpl]convert|15|mi|km[/tpl] west of Chatsworth. The library may be accessed by driving to the Olsen Road exit of State Route 23, which connects to the nearby Ronald Reagan Freeway, State Route 118.
The Reagan Library is the largest of the thirteen federally operated presidential libraries.[tpl]cite journal|last=Hufbauer|first=Benjamin|title=The Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum.

==Dedication==

It was initially planned to build the Reagan Library at Stanford University, and an agreement was reached with the university in 1984.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-G4aAAAAIBAJ&sjid=_ykEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7052,3666746&dq=stanford+library&hl=en|title=Reagan library at Stanford OK'd|date=February 15, 1984|work=Milwaukee Journal|accessdate=28 November 2012[/tpl] Those plans were canceled in 1987,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/24/us/plan-for-reagan-library-at-stanford-is-dropped.html|title=Plan for Reagan library at Stanford is dropped|last=Lindsey|first=Robert|date=April 24, 1987|work=New York Times|accessdate=24 August 2012[/tpl] and the freestanding site in Simi Valley was chosen the same year. Construction of the library began in 1988, and the center was dedicated on November 4, 1991.[tpl]cite web |title=Museum| url=http://www.reaganfoundation.org/museum/| accessdate= 2007-11-19| publisher= Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071118113221/http://www.reaganfoundation.org/museum/ |archivedate = November 18, 2007[/tpl]  The dedication ceremonies were the first time in United States history that five United States Presidents gathered together in the same place: Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan himself, and George H.

==Facilities==

When the Reagan Library opened it was the largest of the presidential libraries, with approximately [tpl]convert|153000|sqft|m2|abbr=on[/tpl]. It held that title until the dedication of the William J. Clinton Presidential Center and Park in Little Rock, Arkansas on November 18, 2004. With the opening of the [tpl]convert|90000|sqft|m2|sing=on[/tpl] Air Force One Pavilion in October 2005, the Reagan Library reclaimed the title in terms of physical size;[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.venturacountystar.com/news/2007/nov/03/winds-tear-air-force-one-pavilion-roof-at-reagan/|title=Winds tear Air Force One Pavilion roof at Reagan Library|accessdate= 2007-11-20|publisher= The Ventura County Star|date= November 3, 2007 [/tpl] however, the Clinton Library remains the largest presidential library in terms of materials (documents, artifacts, photographs, etc.).[tpl]cite web| title=Clinton Library: Library Museum and Information |url=http://www.clintonlibrary.gov/museum.html| accessdate= 2007-11-20|publisher= Clinton Presidential Library and Museum[/tpl] Like all presidential libraries since that of Franklin D. Roosevelt, the Reagan Library was built entirely with private donations, at a cost of US$60 million. Major donors included Walter Annenberg, Lew Wasserman, Lodwrick Cook, Joe Albritton, Rupert Murdoch, Richard Sills, and John P. McGovern. For fiscal year 2007, the Reagan Library had 305,331 visitors, making it the second-most visited presidential library, following the Lyndon B. Johnson Library; that was down from its fiscal year 2006 number of 440,301 visitors, when it was the most visited library.[tpl]cite video| date=30 November 2007| title=Presidential Libraries on C-SPAN: Exclusive Series Interviews and Additional Footage| url=http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/JCl| medium= Documentary| publisher=C-SPAN| accessdate=2011-10-14| time=1:32:03, 1:32:55[/tpl]
As a Presidential library administered by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), the Reagan Library, under the authority of the Presidential Records Act, is the repository of presidential records for Reagan’s administration. Holdings include 50 million pages of presidential documents, over 1.6 million photographs, a half million feet of motion picture film and tens of thousands of audio and video tapes.[tpl]cite web| title=Archives: The Ronald Reagan Presidential Library| url=http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/| accessdate=2007-11-20|publisher=National Archives and Records Administration[/tpl] The Library also houses personal papers collections including documents from Reagan’s eight years as Governor of California.

==Exhibits and scenery==

The museum features continually changing temporary exhibits and a permanent exhibit covering President Reagan’s life. This exhibit begins during Reagan's childhood in Dixon, Illinois and follows his life through his film career and military service, marriage to Nancy Davis Reagan, and political career.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/museum/gallery/early.html| title= Early Years Gallery |accessdate=2011-10-14 |publisher= Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070208172514/http://www.reaganfoundation.org/museum/dtc_home.asp?gid=1&sgid=39 |archivedate = February 8, 2007[/tpl] The "Citizen Governor" gallery shows footage of Reagan's 1964 "A Time for Choosing" speech and contains displays on his eight years as governor. The gallery includes a 1965 Ford Mustang used by Reagan during his first gubernatorial campaign, as well as the desk he used as governor.[tpl]cite web| title=Citizen Governor Gallery| url=http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/museum/gallery/govreagan.html| accessdate=2011-10-14|publisher= Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070208172245/http://www.reaganfoundation.org/museum/dtc_home.asp?gid=1&sgid=40| archivedate=February 8, 2007[/tpl] His 1980 and 1984 presidential campaigns are also highlighted, as well as his inauguration suit and a table from the White House Situation Room is on display. News footage of the 1981 assassination attempt on his life is shown, and information about the proposed Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI — dubbed "Star Wars") is included.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/museum/gallery/newbegin.html| title=New Beginnings Gallery| accessdate=2011-10-14| publisher= Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070208172454/http://www.reaganfoundation.org/museum/dtc_home.asp?gid=1&sgid=41 |archivedate = February 8, 2007[/tpl]
A full-scale replica of the Oval Office — a feature of most presidential libraries — is a prominent feature of this museum as well.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/museum/gallery/ovaloffice.html| title=The Oval Office| accessdate=2011-10-14|publisher= Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070208172255/http://www.reaganfoundation.org/museum/dtc_home.asp?gid=1&sgid=42 |archivedate = February 8, 2007[/tpl] Among the items Reagan kept on his desk was a 16" copy of a bronze statue of "Old Bill Williams", by B.

The hilltop grounds provide expansive views of the area, a re-creation of a portion of the White House Lawn, and, like many presidential libraries, a piece of the Berlin Wall. An F-14 Tomcat (BuNo 162592) is also located on the grounds.

===Artifacts controversy===

On November 8, 2007, Reagan Library National Archives officials reported that due to poor record-keeping, they are unable to say whether approximately 80,000 artifacts have been stolen or are lost inside the massive museum complex.[tpl]cite news| first= Steve| last=Chawkins| coauthors= Catherine Salliant| title= The Talk of the Reagan Library| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/nov/09/local/me-reagan9| work=The Los Angeles Times| publisher=LATimes.com| date= 2007-11-09| accessdate=2011-10-14[/tpl] A "near-universal" security breakdown was also blamed, leaving the artifacts vulnerable to theft. Many of the nation's presidential libraries claim to be understaffed and underfunded.[tpl]cite news |first=Ricardo|last=Alonso-Zaldivar|coauthors= Catherine Salliant|title=Reagan Library Has Lost Thousands Of Artifacts|url=http://www2.tbo.com/content/2007/nov/10/na-reagan-library-has-lost-thousands-of-artifacts/|publisher= Tampa Bay Online|date= 2007-11-10|accessdate=2007-11-21[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=July 2013[/tpl] The National Archives labeled the Reagan library as having the most serious problems with its inventory. In an audit, U.S. Archivist Allen Weinstein blamed the library's poor inventory software for the mishap. Frederick J. Ryan Jr., president of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation's board of directors, said the allegations of poor management practices at the library reflect badly on the National Archives. The library has undertaken a massive inventory project that will take years to complete.

==Air Force One Pavilion==

A [tpl]convert|90000|sqft|m2|sing=on[/tpl] exhibit hangar serves as the setting for the permanent display of the Boeing 707 aircraft utilized as Air Force One during Reagan's administration.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.reaganfoundation.org/airforceone/|title=Air Force One Pavilion|accessdate=2007-11-23|publisher=Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071120103330/http://www.reaganfoundation.org/airforceone/ |archivedate = November 20, 2007[/tpl] The aircraft, SAM 27000, was also used by six other presidents in its active service life from 1973–2001, including Richard Nixon during his second term, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.reaganfoundation.org/airforceone/facts_stats.asp|title=Facts and Stats|accessdate=2007-11-23|publisher=Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071107110720/http://www.reaganfoundation.org/airforceone/facts_stats.asp |archivedate = November 7, 2007[/tpl] In 1990, it became a backup aircraft after the Boeing 747s entered into service and was retired in 2001. The aircraft was flown to San Bernardino International Airport in September 2001, where it was presented to the Reagan Foundation. In what was known as Operation Homeward Bound, Boeing, the plane's manufacturer, disassembled the plane and transported it to the library in pieces.[tpl]cite press release | title=Reagan Air Force One Moves to Presidential Library| publisher=Boeing| date=20 June 2003| url=http://www.boeing.com/news/feature/reagan707/news_release1.html| accessdate = 2007-12-03[/tpl] After the construction of the foundation of the pavilion itself, the plane was reassembled and restored to museum quality, as well as raised onto pedestals [tpl]convert|25|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] above ground.[tpl]cite web| title=The Journey of Air Force One| publisher =Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation| url=http://www.reaganlibrary.com/airforceone/dtc_home.asp?pageid=4&gid=10| accessdate = 2007-12-03|page=3 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070822181751/http://www.reaganlibrary.com/airforceone/dtc_home.asp?pageid=4&gid=10 |archivedate = August 22, 2007[/tpl] The pavilion was dedicated on October 24, 2005, by Nancy Reagan, President George W.

Also featured are exhibits on the Cold War and Reagan's extensive travels aboard Air Force One.
On June 9, 2008, Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings joined Nancy Reagan to dedicate the Reagan Library Discovery Center, located in the Air Force One Pavilion.  The center is an interactive youth exhibit in which fifth through eighth grade students participate in role-playing exercises based on events of the Reagan administration.[tpl]cite news| work=The Ventura County Star| accessdate=2008-06-15| date=June 9, 2008| url=http://www.venturacountystar.com/news/2008/jun/09/unmatched-creativity-at-reagan-library-students/|title='Unmatched creativity' at Reagan Library's Discovery Center| author=Carlson, Cheri| publisher=VCStar.com[/tpl]
The pavilion has been used on several occasions as the venue for televised Republican Party primary-related debates (see below).

==Center for Public Affairs==

The Reagan Library has hosted many events, including the funeral of Ronald Reagan in June 2004, and the first Republican presidential candidates' debate of the 2008 primaries. On May 23, 2007, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer held a brief private talk and a press conference.[tpl]cite news |first=Jill| last=Serjeant| title=Rice, Australian minister evoke Reagan in Iraq talk| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/politicsNews/idUSN2344413120070523|publisher=Reuters| date=2007-05-23| accessdate=2007-11-23[/tpl] On July 17, 2007, Polish President Lech Kaczyński presented Poland's highest distinction, the Order of the White Eagle, to Mrs. Reagan on behalf of her husband.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.simivalleyacorn.com/news/2007-07-27/community/012.html| title=Rare visit from Polish president draws far-off visitors to Simi| author=Robin Nasby| accessdate=2011-10-14| date=27 July 2007| work=Simi Valley Acorn| publisher=simivalleyacorn.com[/tpl]

===Ronald Reagan's funeral===

Following his death, Reagan's casket was driven by hearse to the Reagan Library on June 7, 2004 from Point Mugu through a 25 mph procession down Las Posas Road to U.S. 101.  Many people lined the streets and freeway overpasses to pay final respects. A memorial service was held in the library lobby with Nancy Reagan, Reagan's children, close relatives, and friends. The Reverend Dr. Michael Wenning officiated at the service.
From June 7 to 9, Reagan's casket lay in repose in the library lobby, where approximately 105,000 people viewed the casket to pay their respects.[tpl]cite web| title=Transcripts-American Morning| url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0406/10/ltm.04.html| date=10 June 2004| publisher=CNN.com| accessdate=2011-10-14[/tpl] After flying the body to Washington, D.C., lying in state in the Capitol rotunda, and a national funeral service in the Washington National Cathedral, Reagan's casket was brought back to the library in California for a last memorial service and interment.
Construction plans for the library included a tomb for the eventual use of Reagan and his wife. Following a sunset service on the library grounds the previous evening, early on the morning of June 12, 2004 Reagan was laid to rest in the underground vault.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.suhor.com/si_news/reagan.htm| title=Burial of a President - A Behind the Scenes Diary| author=Dennis Welzenbach| date=7 June 2004| publisher=Suhor Industries| accessdate=2011-10-14[/tpl]

===Republican primary debates===

On May 3, 2007, the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Nancy Reagan hosted the first 2008 Republican primary debate in the Library's Air Force One Pavilion.
