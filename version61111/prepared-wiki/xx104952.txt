[[Stella (yacht)]]

CATEGORIES: Sailing yachts

The Stella is a 'one-design' Bermuda rig sloop yacht, designed for cruising and racing by the noted yacht designer CR (Kim) Holman in 1959.  The design was to the requirements of a customer who had seen the Nordic Folkboat and decided that the English east coast needed a similar vessel but modified for North Sea as opposed to Baltic conditions and a competitive racer on handicap.  The prototype: Stella No. 1 La Vie en Rose was built to win the 1959 Burnham (on Crouch) week, which she promptly did.  Clinker built of mahogany or larch on oak frames.  
The restoration of Amulet, a Stella class yacht originally built in Fort William in 1964, is described by Bob Orrell in the book Amulet: A Charm Restored and Sailed to the Western Isles.ISBN-13 9780953818075
Fleets exist in the UK (estimated 100 built) and Australia (approximately 20 built).
