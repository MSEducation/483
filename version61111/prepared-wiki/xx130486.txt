At the age of twelve, he became the 3rd Baron Ashtown and inherited a vast estate and reputedly over a million pounds.

He was a hard-line Unionist; in 1906-10 he edited a monthly publication, Grievences from Ireland, which denounced all political expressions of Irish nationalism as treasonable.
He was elected a representative peer in 1908. He died in 1946.
