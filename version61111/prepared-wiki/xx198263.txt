Renato Mizoguchi (born September 27, 1975) is a Brazillian luger who competed from 2001 to 2005. He is best known for his severe injuries suffered during the homologation process of Cesana Pariol, the bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton track for the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, in January 2005. Mizoguchi's injuries would lead to a donation set up by the International Luge Federation (FIL) in Germany to pay for his expenses and would lead the track to undergo safety modificaions after discussion both by the FIL and the FIBT during 2005 with approval finally reached in October of that year.
At the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, he finished 46th in the men's singles event. Mizoguchi finished 40th in the same event at the 2004 FIL World Luge Championships in Nagano. His best Luge World Cup finish was 50th in men's singles in 2004-5.

Following his crash, Mizoguchi was placed in a coma from January 2005, awaking from his coma three weeks later. He was discharged in March 2005. In October 2007, he married his longtime girlfriend from Japan in Tokyo.
