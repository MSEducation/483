==Career==

Geronimo began his career in radio at the age of 13 when he went to work at Rockville, Maryland AM station WINX (now WLXE, a Spanish-language music station).
He continued working at a variety of local stations, being fired at each for lacking the required FCC broadcaster's license, before forging a license.  Geronimo landed what was then his dream job at WLS-FM in Chicago, Illinois in the early 1980s.  He then moved to WBBM-FM (B96) to do the evening show.  Eventually, he replaced Dick Biondi doing morning drive at the same station.
Geronimo returned to the Washington, D.C. area in 1985, doing afternoons at WAVA. He moved to mornings in 1986, replacing Charlie & Harrigan. His partnership with Mike O'Meara, co-host of the Don and Mike Show, was forged at WAVA. Their show moved to WJFK-FM in 1991.
Washington Post radio reporter Marc Fisher features Geronimo in his book Something in the Air, on the rise and fall of radio in the United States.  Fisher also conducted an interview with Geronimo prior to his first of three retirements, the first from The Don & Mike Show in 2008, during which Don spoke out about his frustration with the direction[tpl]Clarify|date=July 2010[/tpl] radio has taken following high profile decency events such as the Janet Jackson Super Bowl incident.[tpl]cite news | first=Marc | last=Fisher | coauthors= | title=After Good Times and Bad, Geronimo Says It's Beach Time | date=2008-02-24 | publisher= | url =http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/22/AR2008022200661.html | work =Washington Post | pages = | accessdate = 2008-02-27 | language = [/tpl]

Geronimo first appeared on air part-time on  WINX in Rockville, Maryland in 1971.  In November, December 2009, Geronimo filled shifts on WCBS-FM in New York City.[tpl]cite web|title=Don Geronimo on WCBS-FM 101.1 NYC Weekends|url=http://www.nysbroadcasters.org/news/broadcast-news/don-geronimo-on-wcbs-fm-1011-nyc-weekends/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117100254/http://www.nysbroadcasters.org/news/broadcast-news/don-geronimo-on-wcbs-fm-1011-nyc-weekends|publisher=New York State Broadcasters Association|date=2009-11-24|archivedate=2010-01-17|accessdate=2013-10-25[/tpl]

===Acting===

Don has appeared in The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr., Babylon 5 and The King of Queens. He is a member of the Screen Actors Guild.[tpl]Clarify|date=July 2010[/tpl]  He has stated on several occasions on the Don and Mike Show that he and his partner at that time, Mike O'Meara, spoke without authorization during their Babylon 5 taping, which was supposed to have been a non-speaking role for each.  Rather than re-shoot the scene, the show's producers arranged for their union memberships.  This paved the way for a speaking role on King of Queens, where he spoke one line, "Lookin' good, Heffernan!" He has also co-hosted with Marty Bass post-game coverage of the Baltimore Ravens games for WJZ-TV (Channel 13).

===Controversy===

In 1994, Geronimo and his then radio partner Mike O'Meara were sued for $35 million by an anonymous University of Maryland student who claimed the pair had violated her privacy and inflicted emotional distress.[tpl]cite news|last=Yorke|first=Jeffrey|title=Geronimo and O'Meara Sued|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/72295069.html?dids=72295069:72295069&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Nov+08%2C+1994&author=Jeffrey+Yorke&pub=The+Washington+Post+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&desc=Geronimo+and+O%27Meara+Sued&pqatl=google|accessdate=11 August 2011|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=8 November 1994[/tpl] In her suit, the woman claimed to have met Geronimo at an event at the Virginia radio station and agreed to meet him later at another location, where she and the married Geronimo kissed and he fondled her. However, when she refused Geronimo's further sexual advances, he became angry and she was made to wait in his car while he sexually satisfied himself by masturbating. Also named in the suit were station manager Ken Stevens, the show's traffic reporter and producer.[tpl]cite journal|title=Vox Jox|journal=Billboard|date=November 19, 1994[/tpl]
In June 1995, Sorce was arrested by undercover officers of the Fairfax County Police Department for attempting to buy 1.7 grams of cocaine.[tpl]cite news|last1=Gerhart|first1=Ann|last2=Groer|first2=Annie|title=The Reliable Source: Probation for Geronimo|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/307918246?accountid=34227|work=The Washington Post|date=1996-03-22|accessdate=2013-09-18[/tpl] Sorce entered a guilty plea but was allowed deferred adjudication and was sentenced to one year's probation by Fairfax Circuit Court judge David T. Stitt on March 20, 1996 while he sought treatment for his addiction.
On August 5, 1998, Sorce was stopped by police for a moving violation in Great Falls, Virginia when he was observed driving his 1997 Toyota Supra at 75 miles per hour on a road where the speed limit was 35 miles per hour.[tpl]cite news|last=Jackman|first=Tom|title=Geronimo Guilty Of Drug Charge; Radio Host to Be Sentenced Today for Marijuana Possession|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-701320.html|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=1998-12-03|accessdate=2013-10-24[/tpl] The arresting officer smelled marijuana in Sorce's car, and a search by a drug sniffing dog revealed an eyeglass case containing an aspirin bottle with 4.6 grams of marijuana inside, at which time he was arrested and charged with possession of marijuana and driving under the influence of a narcotic, spending the night in the Fairfax County Adult Detention Center.[tpl]cite news|last=Fisher|first=Marc|last2=Masters|first2=Brooke A.|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/redskins/longterm/1998/camp98/articles/geronimo7.htm |title=Geronimo arrested on drug charges after stop |accessdate=2007-07-20| work=The Washington Post|date=1998-08-12[/tpl] Sorce pleaded guilty to a charge of reckless driving and was found guilty of marijuana possession by Judge Lorraine Nordlund in Fairfax General District Court on December 2, 1998.

===Retirement and Return===

On February 4, 2008, Don announced his retirement from his radio show to pursue his personal life for a while.  His last appearance on the Don and Mike Show was Friday, April 11, 2008 with Mike O'Meara to continue the show after that (as the Mike O'Meara Show).  Don was widely expected to return to radio in some form in the future.
After only 2 months in retirement, Geronimo announced that he would return to the air on WOCM, a small, independently owned radio station in Ocean City, Maryland. Don Geronimo's Rockin' Soul Show aired weekdays from 1 pm - 3pm featuring popular music from the 1970s and 1980s. After 4 weeks, Geronimo left the station.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.fmqb.com/Article.asp?id=825260|date=August 5, 2008|title=In Brief|publisher=FMQB|accessdate=2008-08-06[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.radioandrecords.com/RRWebSite/SearchStoryPage.aspx?ContentID=B2vdpLScVDg%3d&Version=1&Search=Geronimo|title=Geronimo Exits WOCM|last=Schoenberger|first=John |date=August 4, 2008|publisher=Radio and Records[/tpl]
In May 2010, Geronimo announced that beginning June 21, he would be returning to KHTK, a station which formerly syndicated the Don and Mike Show, to host a mid-day show.
As of Friday October 4, 2013, The Don Geronimo Show has been replaced by the Jason Ross show on CBS Sports Radio 1140 KHTK. Don would return to the airwaves several days later to explain that KHTK decided to go with all sports programming, but that he would return to a CBS Radio station soon.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/123376/don-geronimo-says-goodbye-to-khtk-listeners|title=Don Geronimo Says Goodbye To KHTK Listeners|last=Simon|first=Perry Michael |date=Oct 16, 2013|publisher=All Access[/tpl]
Don Geronimo returned to WJFK on October 24, 2013.  His sports-oriented show aired weekdays from 7-10pm and on Saturdays from 9:00am to noon. Initially, he broadcast the show from a studio at CBS Radio's main building in Sacramento at Commerce Circle, then from a studio at his home in Sacramento when CBS internal politics prevented the show from being done at the company's building.  Co-hosts for the show were located at WJFK's studios in Lanham, Maryland.  While it was intended that Geronimo would move to the Washington area to do the show live at WJFK's studios, this never materialized after frequent preemptions and schedule changes.  Geronimo announced on his Twitter feed on March 1, 2014 that he will no longer be heard on WJFK.  His last show was February 26, 2014.
On April 1, 2014, Geronimo began broadcasting a new show, entitled "The Don Geronimo Show," via podcast on the RELM Network.  The show airs live weekdays from 3:00pm until 5:00pm ET.  The show is a commercial-free, subscription-based podcast that listeners can stream live or download for offline listening after the show airs.  The show was announced on Twitter as "the show I always wanted to do."
