The All-American Conference is an OHSAA-sanctioned league created in 2008 from the merger of the Trumbull Athletic Conference and the Metro Athletic Conference (formerly the Mahoning Valley Conference).[tpl]cite web|last=Gulas|first=Greg|title=The Newly-Formed All-American Conference Begins in Eight Months|url=http://www.vindy.com/news/2008/jan/08/the-newly-formed-all-american-conference-begins/|work=Youngstown Vindicator|accessdate=11 August 2013[/tpl]  The only schools that declined to participate in the merger was the MAC's East Liverpool and the TAC's Brookfield, with Beaver Local joining. The conference will undergo a major change in 2014, as five schools join, and a sixth, Pymatuning Valley, had applied and was accepted, but the move was voted down by their school board.[tpl]cite web|last=Peluso|first=Vince|title=Edgewood to AAC|url=http://starbeacon.com/localsports/x1333761772/Edgewood-to-AAC|work=Ashtabula Star-Beacon|accessdate=11 August 2013[/tpl]
