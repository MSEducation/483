==History==

In 1826 John Richardson saw the southwest coast and called it "Wollaston Land". In 1839 Peter Warren Dease and Thomas Simpson followed its southeast coast and called it "Victoria Land". A map published by John Barrow in 1846 shows a complete blank from these two lands north to "Banks Land" which is the north coast of Banks Island.Derek Hayes,"Historical Atlas of the Arctic", map 136 In 1851 John Rae charted its entire south coast and connected the two "lands". In 1850 and 1851 Robert McClure circumnavigated most of Banks Island, thereby separating it from the rest of Victoria Land. His men also charted the northwest and west coasts of Victoria Island.[tpl]cite book |title=The Discovery of the North-West Passage |last=McClure |first=Robert|editor1-first=Sherard |editor1-last=Osborn |editor1-link=Sherard Osborn |year=1856 |publisher=Longman, Brown, Green, Longmans, & Roberts |location=London |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=SGUZAAAAMAAJ&vq=the+discovery+of+the+north-west+passage [/tpl]
One of Roald Amundsen's men, Godfred Hansen, charted its east coast as far as Cape Nansen in 1905,[tpl]cite book|last=Amundsen|first=Roald and Godfred Hansen|title=Roald Amundsen’s "The North West Passage"; being the record of a voyage of exploration of the ship "Gjøa" 1903-1907|publisher=A Constable and Co.|year=1908|location=London|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nwUZAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA27&dq=Roald+Amundsen's+North+West+Passage+1903+1907+Vol.+1&cad=3#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl] and in 1916 and 1917 Storker T. Storkerson, of Vilhjalmur Stefansson's Canadian Arctic Expedition, charted its northeast coast, discovering the Storkerson Peninsula.

==Location and description==

Viscount Melville Sound[tpl]ref|map1|map1[/tpl] lies to the north, and the M'Clintock Channel[tpl]ref|map2|map2[/tpl] and Victoria Strait[tpl]ref|map3|map3[/tpl] lie eastward. On the west are Amundsen Gulf[tpl]ref|map4|map4[/tpl] and Banks Island,[tpl]ref|map5|map5[/tpl] which is separated from Victoria by a long sound called the Prince of Wales Strait.[tpl]ref|map6|map6[/tpl] To the south (from west to east) lies the Dolphin and Union Strait,[tpl]ref|map7|map7[/tpl] Austin Bay,[tpl]ref|map8|map8[/tpl] Coronation Gulf[tpl]ref|map9|map9[/tpl] and the Dease Strait.[tpl]ref|map10|map10[/tpl]
The southern waterways, and sometimes the Prince of Wales Strait, form part of the disputed Northwest Passage which the Government of Canada claims are Canadian Internal Waters, while other nations state they are either territorial waters or international waters.
Victoria Island is an island of peninsulas, having a heavily indented coastline with many inlets. In the east, pointing northwards, is the Storkerson Peninsula,[tpl]ref|map11|map11[/tpl] which ends with the Goldsmith Channel,[tpl]ref|map12|map12[/tpl] the body of water separating Victoria from Stefansson Island.[tpl]ref|map13|map13[/tpl] The Storkerson Peninsula is separated from the island's north-central areas by Hadley Bay,[tpl]ref|map14|map14[/tpl] a major inlet. Another, broad peninsula is found in the north, Prince Albert Peninsula.[tpl]ref|map15|map15[/tpl] This ends at the Prince of Wales Strait. In the south, and pointing westwards, is the Wollaston Peninsula,[tpl]ref|map16|map16[/tpl] separated from the island's central areas by Prince Albert Sound. The island as a whole coincidentally resembles a stylized maple leaf, the main Canadian symbol.
The highest point of Victoria Island is [tpl]convert|655|m|abbr=on[/tpl] in the Shaler Mountains[tpl]ref|map17|map17[/tpl] in the north-central region. Located in the southeast, just north of Cambridge Bay is Ferguson Lake[tpl]ref|map18|map18[/tpl] with an area of [tpl]convert|562|km2|abbr=on[/tpl] is the largest lake on the island.Ferguson Lake at the Atlas of Canada
In the Canada 2006 Census the population of the island was 1,875; 1,477 in Nunavut and 398 in the Northwest Territories. Of the two settlements on the island the largest is Cambridge Bay,[tpl]ref|map19|map19[/tpl] which lies on the south-east coast and is in Nunavut. Ulukhaktok[tpl]ref|map20|map20[/tpl] is on the west coast and is in the Northwest Territories. Trading posts, such as Fort Collinson[tpl]ref|map21|map21[/tpl] on the northwest coast, have long since been abandoned.
The island is named after Queen Victoria, the Canadian sovereign from 1867 to 1901. The features bearing the name "Prince Albert" are named after her consort.
There is also a smaller Victoria Island in Nunavut, located in Amadjuak Lake on Baffin Island.Victoria Island, Amadjuak Lake at the Atlas of Canada
