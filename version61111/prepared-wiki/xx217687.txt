[[Southeastern Spanish ibex]]

CATEGORIES: Capra

The Southeastern Spanish ibex or Beceite ibex (Capra pyrenaica hispanica) is a goat that is endemic to Spain.
The Southeastern Spanish ibex inhabits the Sierra Nevada, Sierra de Cazorla, Sierra de Grazalema, Montes de Malaga, in Andalucia. It also occurs in the Sierra Morena. Outside Andalucia it can be found in the Montes de Toledo and the mountains all the way up the Spanish Mediterranean with populations as far north as southern Catalonia, which gives hope that one day it might recolonise the Pyrenees.
