Stephen Goosson (24 March 1889 - 25 March 1973) was an Academy Award-winning American film set designer and art director.
Born in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Goosson was an architect in Detroit before starting his film career as art director for producer Lewis J. Selznick, and films for Fox Film Corporation such as New Movietone Follies of 1930. He eventually was hired by Columbia Pictures, where he served as supervising art director for 25 years.
Goosson won the Academy Award for Best Art Direction for Lost Horizon.

Goosson died of a stroke in Woodland Hills, California.
