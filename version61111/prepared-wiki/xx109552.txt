==Formula One sponsorship==

Japan Tobacco was, through Mild Seven, the title sponsor of the Benetton Formula One team beginning with the 1994 Formula One season. This association continued after Benetton was acquired by Renault. It was to remain with Renault F1 until the end of the 2009 Formula One season, but due to European Tobacco Regulations, the company had to end their association with Renault at the end of the 2006 Formula One season.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.gpupdate.net/en/f1-news/75810/renault-and-tobacco/ |title=Renault and tobacco |publisher=GPUpdate.net |date=2005-02-05 |accessdate=2011-01-30[/tpl]
Next to Benetton and Renault, Mild Seven sponsored both Tyrrell Racing, from 1994 to 1996, and Minardi in 1997 as a result of a sponsorship deal with Japanese driver Ukyo Katayama.
