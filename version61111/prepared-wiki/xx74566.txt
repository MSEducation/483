[tpl]Nihongo|Naoto Kan|菅 直人|Kan Naoto|born 10 October 1946[/tpl] is a Japanese politician, and former Prime Minister of Japan. In June 2010, then-Finance Minister Kan was elected as the leader of the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) and designated Prime Minister by the Diet to succeed Yukio Hatoyama. Kan was the first Prime Minister of Japan since the resignation of Junichiro Koizumi in 2006 to serve for more than 1 year, with predecessors Yukio Hatoyama, Tarō Asō, Yasuo Fukuda, and Shinzō Abe either resigning prematurely or losing an election. On 26 August 2011, Kan announced his resignation. Yoshihiko Noda was formally appointed as Prime Minister on 2 September 2011.[tpl]cite news|url=http://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2011/08/29/noda-the-dpj-and-the-giant-snowball-problem/|title=Noda, the DPJ and the Giant Snowball Problem|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=29 August 2011|accessdate=29 August 2011|author=Yoree Koh[/tpl]Article 6 of the Constitution of Japan On 1 August 2012,  United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon announced Kan would be one of the members of the UN high-level panel on the post-2015 development agenda.Ban names high-level panel to map out 'bold' vision for future global development efforts UN News Centre. 31 July 2012.

==Early life and education==

Kan was born in Ube City, Yamaguchi Prefecture, as the son of Hisao Kan, an executive for a glass manufacturer. He graduated in 1970 from the Tokyo Institute of Technology and became a licensed benrishi (patent agent/attorney) in 1971.

==Career==

After graduating from college, Kan worked at a patent office for four years.[tpl]cite web|date=September 2002|author=Japan Producer|url=http://www.dot-jp.or.jp/mm/interview/jpi/12/|title=Japan Producer インタビュー|language=Japanese|publisher=Japan Producer|accessdate=8 June 2010[/tpl] He actively engaged in civic grassroots movements for years and also served on election campaign staff for Fusae Ichikawa, a women's rights activist.[tpl]cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20100605a4.html|title=All things have finally come to veteran who waited|author=Reiji Yoshida|work=The Japan Times|date=5 June 2010|accessdate=11 September 2010[/tpl]
After having lost in 1976 and 1979 general elections and 1977 Upper House election, Kan finally achieved a seat in the lower house in 1980 as a member of the Socialist Democratic Federation. He gained national popularity in 1996, when serving as the Minister of Health and Welfare, admitting the government's responsibility for the spread of HIV-tainted blood in the 1980s and directly apologized to victims. At that time, he was a member of a small party forming the ruling coalition with the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). His frank action was completely unprecedented and was applauded by the media and the public. [tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2010[/tpl]
In 1998, his image was affected by allegations of an affair, vigorously denied by both parties, with a television newscaster and media consultant, Yūko Tonomoto.[tpl]cite web|last=Landers|first=Peter|date=4 February 1999|url=http://tomcoyner.com/dream_deferred.htm |title=Dream Deffered|work=Far Eastern Economic Review|accessdate=4 June 2010[/tpl] After Yukio Hatoyama resigned as the leader of the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), Kan again took over the position. In July 2003, the DPJ and the Liberal Party led by Ichirō Ozawa agreed to form a united opposition party to prepare for the general election that was anticipated to take place in the fall.
During the campaign of the election of 2003, the DPJ called the election as the choice of the government between the ruling LDP-bloc and the DPJ, with Kan being presented as the alternative candidate to then Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. His face was used as the trademark of the campaign against the LDP.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2010[/tpl]
However, in 2004 Kan was accused of unpaid annuities and forced to again resign the position of leader. On 10 May 2004, he officially announced his resignation and made the Shikoku Pilgrimage. Later, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare spokesman apologized, saying the unpaid record was due to an administrative error.
In mid-October 2005, Kan, who turned 60 in 2006, proposed the creation of a new political party to be called the "Dankai (baby boomer) Party." The initial intent of the party was to offer places of activity for the Japanese baby boomers – [tpl]Nowrap|2.7 million[/tpl] of whom began to retire en masse in 2007.
He believes the Japan Self-Defense Forces should play a more prominent role on the international stage.[tpl]cite web|url=http://apac2020.the-diplomat.com/power-players/naoto-kan/|title=Power Players: Naoto Kan|work=The Diplomat|accessdate=4 June 2010[/tpl]

===Finance Minister===

On 6 January 2010, he was picked by Yukio Hatoyama to be the new finance minister, assuming the post in addition to deputy prime minister.[tpl]cite news|last=McCallum|first=Kenneth|title=Kan to Take Over as Japanese Finance Chief |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB126277442618617661.html?mod=WSJ_hps_LEFTWhatsNews|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=6 January 2010|accessdate=6 January 2010[/tpl] He replaced Hirohisa Fujii as finance minister.[tpl]cite news|title=Japan Replaces Ailing Finance Minister|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/07/world/asia/07japan.html?_r=0|accessdate=20 December 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=7 January 2010|author=Hiroko Tabuchi|location=Tokyo[/tpl]
In his first news conference, Kan announced his priority was stimulating growth and took the unusual step of naming a specific dollar-yen level as optimal to help exporters and stimulate the economy: "There are a lot of voices in the business world saying that (the dollar) around ¥95 is appropriate in terms of trade".[tpl]cite news|author=Takashi Nakamichi |title=Kan Calls for Weaker Yen|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB126285391946519405.html?mod=WSJ_hps_LEFTWhatsNews|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=7 January 2010|accessdate=7 January 2010[/tpl] Hatoyama appeared to rebuke Kan. "When it comes to foreign exchange, stability is desirable and rapid moves are undesirable. The government basically shouldn't comment on foreign exchange," he told reporters.[tpl]cite news|last= Nakamichi|first=Takashi|title=New Japan Minister Starts Talking Yen Down |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB126285391946519405.html#mod=todays_us_page_one|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=8 January 2010|accessdate=8 January 2010[/tpl]

===Prime Minister===

On 2 June 2010 Yukio Hatoyama announced his intention to resign as the leader of the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) and as Prime Minister, also saying that he had urged his backer in the party, Ichirō Ozawa, to resign as Secretary General.Finance Chief Chosen as Next Japanese Leader, by Martin Fackler, The New York Times, 3 June 2010. Retrieved 3 June 2010.Ozawa's resignation at strong urging of PM will lessen his influence on DPJ, Mainichi Daily News, 2 June 2010. Retrieved 6 June 2010. The Cabinet resigned en masse on 4 June. Foreign Minister Katsuya Okada and Land and Transport Minister Seiji Maehara, though once considered to be possible successors to Hatoyama, announced their support for Naoto Kan.[tpl]cite news|url=http://e.nikkei.com/e/fr/tnks/Nni20100603D03EE230.htm|title=Okada, Maehara, Noda Support Kan For DPJ Presidency |date=3 June 2010|work=Nikkei|accessdate=8 June 2010[/tpl] Kan, at his age of 63, won the leadership of the DPJ with 291 votes to 129, defeating a relatively unknown Ozawa-backed legislator Shinji Tarutoko, 50,[tpl]cite web|url=http://headlines.yahoo.co.jp/hl?a=20100604-00000013-maiall-pol|title=民主党の新代表・総理大臣に菅直人氏選出　（毎日新聞） – Yahoo!JAPAN ニュース|work=Mainichi Shimbun|publisher=Yahoo|accessdate=[tpl]date|7 June 2010[/tpl]|language=Japanese[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] who was leading the environmental policy committee in the lower house of the Diet.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTOE65205020100603|title=FACTBOX-Japan lawmaker Tarutoko to run for ruling party head|date=3 June 2010|work=Reuters|accessdate=8 June 2010|first=Yoko|last=Nishikawa[/tpl]
Subsequently, on 4 June, Kan was designated Prime Minister by the Diet.[tpl]cite news|title=Kan elected prime minister|url=http://www.asahi.com/english/TKY201006040248.html|newspaper=Asahi Shimbun|date=4 June 2010|accessdate=4 September 2010[/tpl] On 8 June, Emperor Akihito formally appointed Kan as the country's 94th Prime Minister, and the 29th postwar Prime Minister.
Kan's approval ratings fell in the month of June after he proposed an increase in the sales tax rate from 5% to 10%.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-07-10/japan-votes-to-decide-whether-kan-s-dpj-maintains-control-of-upper-house.html|title=Kan Election Loss May Impede Effort to Cut Japan Debt|publisher=Bloomberg|date=[tpl]date|11 July 2010[/tpl]|accessdate=23 July 2010|first1=Sachiko|last1=Sakamaki|first2=Takashi|last2=Hirokawa[/tpl] His sales tax increase proposal was opposed by Ichirō Ozawa, amongst others in the DPJ, and the proposal was quickly scaled back by Kan.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10594674|title=Poll blow raises Japanese economy fears|first=Roland|last=Buerk|publisher=BBC|date=12 July 2010|accessdate=23 October 2010[/tpl] The botched sales tax increase proposal was partially blamed for the DPJ's disappointing results in the July House of Councillors election, where the DPJ lost its majority and were forced to work with smaller, unaffiliated parties (such as Your Party, the JCP, and the SDP) in order to secure passage of bills in the House of Councillors.
In August, Kan apologised to the Republic of Korea on the 100th anniversary of the Japan–Korea Annexation Treaty.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kantei.go.jp/foreign/kan/statement/201008/10danwa_e.html|title=Statement by Prime Minister Naoto Kan|publisher=Kantei|date=10 August 2010|accessdate=31 October 2010[/tpl]
Ozawa challenged Kan's leadership of the DPJ in September.

After the leadership challenge, Kan reshuffled his cabinet, which left many prominent members of the pro-Ozawa faction of the DPJ without important posts in the new cabinet.[tpl]cite news|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20100917x3.html|title=Prime minister makes bold move in shutting out Ozawa's influence|publisher=The Japan Times|date=17 September 2010|accessdate=24 October 2010[/tpl] The cabinet reshuffle also resulted in the promotion of long-time Kan ally Yoshito Sengoku to Chief Cabinet Secretary.

The Kan government intervened in mid-September to weaken the surging yen by buying U.S. dollars, a move which temporarily relieved Japan's exporters.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/From-the-news-wires/2010/0915/Naoto-Kan-government-intervenes-in-currency-market-to-weaken-yen|title=Naoto Kan government intervenes in currency market to weaken yen|publisher=The Christian Science Monitor|date=[tpl]date|2010-09-15[/tpl]|accessdate=[tpl]date|2010-10-30[/tpl][/tpl] The move proved popular with stock brokers, Japanese exporters, and the Japanese public. It was the first such move by a Japanese government since 2004. Later, in October, after the yen had offset the intervention and had reached a 15-year high, the Kan cabinet approved a stimulus package worth about 5.1 trillion yen ($62 billion) in order to weaken the yen and fight deflation.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-25/cabinet-approves-63-billion-stimulus-plan-to-fight-deflation-rising-yen.html|title=Cabinet Approves $63 Billion Stimulus Plan to Fight Deflation, Rising Yen|publisher=Bloomberg|date=[tpl]date|2010-10-25[/tpl]|accessdate=[tpl]date|2010-10-30[/tpl]|first=Toru|last=Fujioka[/tpl] Kan also announced that further interventions are likely if the yen continues to rise.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.japantoday.com/category/politics/view/kan-suggests-further-market-intervention-as-yen-touches-fresh-15-year-high|title=Kan suggests further market intervention as yen touches fresh 15-year high|agency=Kyodo News|work=Japan Today|date=[tpl]date|2010-10-15[/tpl]|accessdate=[tpl]date|2010-10-30[/tpl][/tpl]
In November, Kan spoke out forcefully in support of South Korea and in harsh criticism of North Korea in the wake of the latter's bombardment of Yeonpyeong, meanwhile ignoring China's public comments which had not yet included denunciation of the North.LaFraniere, Sharon with reporting by Martin Fackler and Su Hyun Lee, "South Korea Cancels Confrontational Island Drills", The New York Times, 29 November 2010.

On 12 March 2011, after the earthquake and tsunami in the northeast Japan, Kan flew in a helicopter to observe the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant and was heavily involved in efforts to effectively respond to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster.Yoshida, Reiji, "Kan hero, or irate meddler?", Japan Times, 17 March 2012, p. 2.[tpl]cite news|url=http://english.kyodonews.jp/news/2011/03/77046.html|title=Kan inspects quake-hit areas, pledges to protect people's lives|publisher=Kyodo News|date=12 March 2011|accessdate=12 March 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110315092601/http://english.kyodonews.jp/news/2011/03/77046.html|archivedate=15 March 2011[/tpl] Naoto Kan took an increasingly anti-nuclear stance in the months following the Fukushima disaster.[tpl]Cite news|last=Gerhardt|first=Tina|date=22 July 2012|title=Japan's People Say NO to Nuclear Energy|url=http://www.alternet.org/story/15643/after_fukushima,_nuclear_power_on_collision_course_with_japanese_public|work=Alternet[/tpl] In May, he ordered the aging Hamaoka Nuclear Power Plant be closed over earthquake and tsunami fears, and he said he would freeze plans to build new reactors.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/14/world/asia/14japan.html?_r=1&hp|title=Japan Premier Wants Shift Away From Nuclear Power|author=Hiroko Tabuchi|date=13 July 2011|work=New York Times[/tpl]
Despite falling popularity, Kan rejected calls to step down while the country continued to suffer from the earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear crises of spring 2011. One year into his premiership on 2 June 2011, Kan proposed his resignation, hours before the Diet put forward a vote of no-confidence. The motion was defeated by 293 to 152, bolstering the Prime Minister's position.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/japans-prime-minister-kan-survives-no-confidence-vote-offers-to-step-down-after-crisis-ends/2011/06/02/AGNeszGH_story.html|title=Prime Minister Kan survives no-confidence vote|publisher=The Washington Post|date=2 June 2011|accessdate=2 June 2011|first=Joel|last=Greenberg[/tpl]
In July 2011, Kan said that Japan must reduce its dependence on nuclear energy, breaking with a decades-old Japanese government drive to build more nuclear power plants in the country. "We must scrap the plan to have nuclear power contribute 53 percent (of electricity supply) by 2030 and reduce the degree of reliance on nuclear power," Kan told a government panel.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/07/12/japan-nuclear-kan-idUSL3E7IC0EN20110712|title=UPDATE 2-Japan PM says must reduce dependence on nuclear power|publisher=Reuters|date=2011-07-12|accessdate=2011-07-12|first=Linda|last=Sieg[/tpl] Kan said Japan should abandon plans to build 14 new reactors by 2030.

At the same time, Seiji Maehara, who had supported Kan in 2010, was reported to have announced his intention to run to succeed Kan. Maehara is seen as the potential DPJ candidate most popular with the voters at the time.Kumar, V. Phani, "Japan to get a new PM on 30 August: report", MarketWatch, 23 August 2011, Retrieved 23 August 2011. Several other cabinet members joined the race, and the election of the DPJ successor was scheduled for 29 August. At that time, Yoshihiko Noda, most recently finance minister, was elected as the new DPJ leader and, as leader of the largest party in the Diet, becomes prime minister as well.
In 2012, Kan was interviewed about the Fukushima nuclear disaster, and has said that at one point Japan faced a situation where there was a chance that people might not be able to live in the capital zone including Tokyo and would have to evacuate. He says he is haunted by the specter of an even bigger nuclear crisis forcing tens of millions of people to flee Tokyo and threatening the nation's existence. "If things had reached that level, not only would the public have had to face hardships but Japan's very existence would have been in peril". That convinced Kan to "declare the need for Japan to end its reliance on atomic power and promote renewable sources of energy such solar that have long taken a back seat in the resource-poor country's energy mix".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/17/us-japan-kan-idUSTRE81G08P20120217|title=Nuclear crisis turns Japan ex-PM Kan into energy apostle|author=Linda Sieg and Yoko Kubota|date=17 February 2012|work=Reuters[/tpl]
