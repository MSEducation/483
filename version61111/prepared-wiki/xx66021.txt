[[Spoke-hub distribution paradigm]]

CATEGORIES: Commercial item transport and distribution

The spoke-hub distribution paradigm (or model or network) is a system of connections arranged like a chariot wheel, in which all traffic moves along spokes connected to the hub at the center. The model is commonly used in industry, in particular in transport, telecommunications and freight, as well as in distributed computing.

==Analysis of the model==

The hub-and-spoke model is most frequently compared to the point-to-point transit model.

==Commercial aviation==

In 1955 Delta Air Lines pioneered the hub and spoke system at its hub in Atlanta, Georgia,Delta Air Lines Newsroom - Press Kit. Delta.com. Retrieved on 2013-08-16. in an effort to compete with Eastern Air Lines. In the mid-1970s FedEx adopted the hub and spoke model for overnight package delivery, and after the airline industry was deregulated in 1978, Delta's hub and spoke paradigm was adopted by several other airlines.
Airlines have extended the hub-and-spoke model in various ways. One method is to create additional hubs on a regional basis, and to create major routes between the hubs. This reduces the need to travel long distances between nodes that are close together. Another method is to use focus cities to implement point-to-point service for high traffic routes, bypassing the hub entirely.

==Transportation==

The spoke-hub model is applicable to other forms of transportation:
For passenger road transport, the spoke-hub model does not apply because drivers generally take the shortest or fastest route between two points.

==Industrial distribution==

The hub-and-spoke model has also been used in economic geography theory to classify a particular type of industrial district. Ann Markusen, an economic geographer, theorised about industrial districts, where a number of key industrial firms and facilities act as a hub, with associated businesses and suppliers benefiting from their presence and arranged around them like the spokes of a wheel. The chief characteristic of such hub-and-spoke industrial districts is the importance of one or more large companies, usually in one industrial sector, surrounded by smaller, associated businesses. Examples of cities with such districts include Seattle (where Boeing was founded), Silicon Valley (a high tech hub), and Toyota City, with Toyota.

==East Asian relations==

In the sphere of East Asian relations, according to Victor Cha, hub-and-spokes refers to the network of bilateral alliances between United States and other individual East Asian countries. This system constructs a dominant bilateral security architecture in East Asia, differing from the multilateral security architecture in Europe. United States acts as a "hub" and Asian countries such as Republic of Korea(ROK), Republic of China(ROC) and Japan fall under the category "spokes." Whereas there is a strong alliance between the hub and the spoke, there are no firmly established connections between the spokes themselves.[tpl]cite doi|10.1162/isec.2010.34.3.158[/tpl]
This system was famously inspired by John Foster Dulles, who served as US Secretary of State under the Eisenhower administration from 1953 to 1959. He addressed this term twice in Tokyo and once at the San Francisco Peace Treaty of September 1951. This led to talks for bilateral peace treaty between US and Japan. The US-Japan Security Treaty of 1951, US-Republic of Korea Defense Treaty of 1953 or US-Republic of China Security Treaty of 1954 are some of the examples that manifests these bilateral relations.[tpl]cite doi|10.1162/002081802760199890[/tpl]
In 2014 all ten ASEAN defense chiefs were summoned to Hawaii for the first time for a historic meeting with Chuck Hagel. This was part of an American attempt to get the countries to strengthen military ties between themselves.[tpl]cite web |url=http://thediplomat.com/2014/04/us-swears-asia-pivot-isnt-dead/ |title=US Swears Asia Pivot Isn't Dead |last1=Keck |first1=Zachary |date=2 April 2014 |website=thediplomat.com |publisher=The Diplomat |accessdate=3 April 2014[/tpl]
