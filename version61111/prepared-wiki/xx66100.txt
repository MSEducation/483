[[Truncated cuboctahedron]]

CATEGORIES: Uniform polyhedra, Archimedean solids, Zonohedra

In geometry, the truncated cuboctahedron is an Archimedean solid. It has 12 square faces, 8 regular hexagonal faces, 6 regular octagonal faces, 48 vertices and 72 edges. Since each of its faces has point symmetry (equivalently, 180° rotational symmetry), the truncated cuboctahedron is a zonohedron.

==Cartesian coordinates==

The Cartesian coordinates for the vertices of a truncated cuboctahedron having edge length 2 and centered at the origin are all permutations of:

==Area and volume==

The area A and the volume V of the truncated cuboctahedron of edge length a are:

==Vertices==

To derive the number of vertices, we note that each vertex is the meeting point of a square, hexagon, and octagon.  
Therefore, there may seem to exist [tpl]nowrap|48 + 48 + 48 [tpl]=[/tpl] 144[/tpl] vertices. However, we have over-counted the vertices thrice since a square, hexagon, and octagon meet at each vertex. Consequently, we divide 144 by 3 to correct for our over-counting: [tpl]nowrap|144 / 3 [tpl]=[/tpl] 48.[/tpl]

==Dual==

==Uniform colorings==

There is only one uniform coloring of the faces of this polyhedron, one color for each face type.
A 2-uniform coloring also exists with alternately colored hexagons.

==Other names==

Alternate interchangeable names are:
The name truncated cuboctahedron, given originally by Johannes Kepler, is a little misleading. If you truncate a cuboctahedron by cutting the corners off, you do not get this uniform figure: some of the faces will be rectangles. However, the resulting figure is topologically equivalent to a truncated cuboctahedron and can always be deformed until the faces are regular. 
The alternative name great rhombicuboctahedron refers to the fact that the 12 square faces lie in the same planes as the 12 faces of the rhombic dodecahedron which is dual to the cuboctahedron. Compare to small rhombicuboctahedron.
One unfortunate point of confusion: There is a nonconvex uniform polyhedron by the same name. See nonconvex great rhombicuboctahedron.

==Orthogonal projections==

The truncated cuboctahedron has two special orthogonal projections in the A2 and B2 Coxeter planes with 6 and 8 projective symmetry, and numerous 2 symmtries can be constructed from various projected planes relative to the polyhedron elements.

==Related polyhedra==

The truncated cuboctahedron is one of a family of uniform polyhedra related to the cube and regular octahedron.
This polyhedron can be considered a member of a sequence of uniform patterns with vertex figure (4.6.2p) and Coxeter-Dynkin diagram [tpl]CDD|node_1|p|node_1|3|node_1[/tpl].  For p < 6, the members of the sequence are omnitruncated polyhedra (zonohedrons), shown below as spherical tilings. For p > 6, they are tilings of the hyperbolic plane, starting with the truncated triheptagonal tiling.
