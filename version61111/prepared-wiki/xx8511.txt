The demographics of New Zealand encompass the gender, ethnic, religious, geographic, and economic backgrounds of the 4.4 million people living in New Zealand. New Zealanders, informally known as "Kiwis", predominantly live in urban areas on the North Island. The five largest cities are Auckland (with one-third of the country's population), Christchurch, Wellington, Hamilton and Tauranga. Few New Zealanders live on New Zealand's smaller islands. Waiheke Island (near Auckland) is easily the most populated smaller island with [tpl]NZ population data|Waiheke Island|y[/tpl] residents, while Great Barrier Island, the Chatham and Pitt Islands and Stewart Island each have populations below 1,000. New Zealand is part of a realm and most people born in the realm's external territories of Tokelau, the Ross Dependency, the Cook Islands and Niue are considered New Zealanders. In 2006, more people who identified themselves with these islands lived in New Zealand than on the Islands themselves.
The majority of New Zealand's population is of European descent (69 percent identify as "New Zealand European"), with the indigenous Māori being the largest minority (14.6 percent), followed by Asians (9.2 percent) and non-Māori Pacific Islanders (6.9 percent). This is reflected in immigration, with most new migrants coming from Britain and Ireland, although the numbers from Asia are increasing. In 2001 an estimated 460,000 New Zealanders live abroad, mostly in Australia, representing nearly one-quarter of NZ's highly skilled workforce.  The largest Māori iwi is Ngapuhi with 122,211 people or 24 percent of the Māori population. Auckland is the most ethnically diverse region in New Zealand with 56.5 percent identifying as Europeans, 18.9 percent as Asian, 11.1 percent as Māori and 14.4 percent as other Pacific Islanders. The ethnicity of the population aged under 18 years is more diverse (72 percent European, 24 percent Māori, 12 percent Pacific and 10 percent Asian) than the population aged 65 years or older (91 percent European, 5 percent Māori, 4 percent Asian and 2 percent Pacific). Recent increases in interracial marriages has resulted in the more people identifying with more than one ethnic group.
During the 2013 census in New Zealand, it was estimated that 14.90% of the population of New Zealand were Maori, 11.80% of the population were Asians (deriving from various nations in Asia), 7.40% were of Pacific Islander origin (including from the Cook Islands, Niue, and Tokelau, all of which are dependent states of New Zealand in the Pacific), and 1.20% were individuals of Middle-Eastern, Latin American, and African descent. Approximately, a third of the population of New Zealand during the census were non-Pakeha (non-pure white European), while two-thirds of the population were pure-white/European or pure-Pakeha.http://www.stats.govt.nz/Census/2013-census/profile-and-summary-reports/quickstats-about-national-highlights/cultural-diversity.aspx
English, Māori and New Zealand Sign Language are the official languages, with English predominant. New Zealand English is mostly non-rhotic and sounds similar to Australian English, with a common exception being the centralisation of the short i. Maori has undergone a process of revitalisation and is spoken by 4.1 percent of the population. New Zealand has an adult literacy rate of 99 percent and over half of the population aged 15 to 29 hold a tertiary qualification. In the adult population 14.2 percent have a bachelor's degree or higher, 30.4 percent have some form of secondary qualification as their highest qualification and 22.4 percent have no formal qualification. Just over half the population identify as Christians, with Hinduism, Buddhism and Islam being the most significant minority religions. New Zealand has no state religion and just over a third of the population do not have a religion. Farming is a major occupation in New Zealand, although more people are employed as sales assistants. Most New Zealanders are on wage or salary income, with a median personal income in 2006 of $24,400. Unemployment was at 6.8 percent during the June 2010 quarter and most New Zealanders do some form of voluntary work.

==New Zealanders==

While the demonym for a New Zealand citizen is New Zealander, the informal "Kiwi" is commonly used both internationally[tpl]cite doi|10.1016/0962-6298(93)90012-V[/tpl] and by locals.[tpl]cite journal|journal=New Zealand Population Review|volume=30|issue=1&2|pages=5–22|year=2004|title=Seeking an Ethnic Identity: Is "New Zealander" a Valid Ethnic Category?|first=Paul|last=Callister|url=http://panz.rsnz.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/nzpr-vol-30-1and-2_callister.pdf[/tpl] The name derives from the kiwi, a native flightless bird, which is the national symbol of New Zealand.

==Geographic locations==

Over three-quarters of New Zealands population live in the North Island (76 percent) with one-third of the total population living in the Auckland region. This region is also the fastest growing, accounting for 46 percent of New Zealands total population growth. Most Māori live in the North Island (87 percent), although less than a quarter (24 percent) live in Auckland. New Zealand is a predominantly urban country, with 86 percent of the population living in an urban area. About 72 percent of the population live in the 16 main urban areas (population of 30,000 or more) and 53 percent live in the four largest cities of Auckland, Christchurch, Wellington, and Hamilton.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.stats.govt.nz/methods_and_services/access-data/tables/subnational-pop-estimates.aspx|title=Subnational population estimates at 30 June 2009 |accessdate=30 April 2010 |publisher=Statistics New Zealand |date=30 June 2007[/tpl]
Approximately 14 percent of the population live in four different categories of rural areas as defined by Statistics New Zealand. About 18 percent of the rural population live in areas that have a high urban influence (roughly 12.9 people per square kilometre), many working in the main urban area. Rural areas with moderate urban influence and a population density of about 6.5 people per square kilometre account for 26 percent of the rural population. Areas with low urban influence where the majority of the residents work in the rural area house approximately 42 percent of the rural population. Remote rural areas with a density of less than 1 person per square kilometre account for about 14 percent of the rural population.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.med.govt.nz/templates/MultipageDocumentPage35807.aspx|title=Appendix 2: Rural Area Population Statistics|publisher=Ministry of Economic Development|accessdate=12 April 2011[/tpl]

==Migration==

East Polynesians were the first people to reach New Zealand about 1280, followed by the early European explorers, notably James Cook in 1769 who explored New Zealand three times and mapped the coastline. Following the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840 when the country became a British colony, immigrants were predominantly from Britain, Ireland and Australia. Due to restrictive policies similar to the white Australian policies limitations were placed on non-European immigrants.[tpl]cite book|title=Trends in international migration: continuous reporting system on migration|publisher=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|year=2000|pages= 276–278|author=Socidad Peruana de Medicina Intensiva (SOPEMI)[/tpl] During the gold rush period (1858-1880s) large number of young men came from California and Victoria to New Zealand goldfields. Apart from British, there were Irish, North Germans, Scandinavians, Italian and many Chinese. The Chinese were sent special invitations by the Otago Chamber of Commerce in 1866. By 1873 they made up 40 percent of the diggers in Otago and 25 percent of the diggers in Westland. Diggers , Hatters and Whores.p 197-198. Eldred-Grigg. Random House. 2011.

From 1880 Māori MPs in parliament were keen that Māori should be taught in English rather than Māori.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] At that time missionary schools still taught Māori. This trend was further enforced by the Young Maori Party of the early 20th century which consisted of highly qualified Western educated Māori graduates such as Pomare and Ngata who believed that learning English would help Māori integrate into the modern world. After WW2 Māori,who had previously lived mainly in isolated rural areas migrated into urban areas where there were few Māori speakers.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] Māori were discouraged from speaking their own language (te reo Māori) in schools and work places and it existed as a community language only in a few remote areas.[tpl]cite web|first=Jock |last=Phillips|title=The New Zealanders – Bicultural New Zealand|publisher=Te Ara – the Encyclopedia of New Zealand|date=March 2009|url=http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/en/the-new-zealanders/12|accessdate=21 January 2011[/tpl] It has recently undergone a process of revitalisation,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/culture/maori-language-week|title=Māori Language Week – Te Wiki o Te Reo Maori|publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage|accessdate=February 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=British influence ebbs as New Zealand takes to talking Māori |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/australiaandthepacific/newzealand/1490814/British-influence-ebbs-as-New-Zealand-takes-to-talking-Maori.html|first=Nick|last=Squires|date=May 2005|newspaper=The Telegraph|location=Great Britain[/tpl] being declared an official language in 1987,[tpl]cite web|title=Waitangi Tribunal claim – Māori Language Week|url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/culture/maori-language-week/waitangi-tribunal-claim|publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage|date=July 2010|accessdate=19 January 2011[/tpl] and is spoken by 4.1 percent of the population.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.stats.govt.nz/Census/2006CensusHomePage/QuickStats/quickstats-about-a-subject/culture-and-identity/languages-spoken.aspx|title=QuickStats About Culture and Identity: Languages spoken|date=March 2006 |publisher=Statistics New Zealand |accessdate=20 February 2008[/tpl] There are now Māori language immersion schools and two Māori Television channels, the only nationwide television channels to have the majority of their prime-time content delivered in Māori.[tpl]cite web|url= http://media.maoritelevision.com/default.aspx?tabid=211&pid=367|title=Māori Television Launches 100 percent Māori Language Channel |publisher=Māori Television|accessdate=30 April 2010[/tpl] Many places have officially been given dual Māori and English names in recent years.
