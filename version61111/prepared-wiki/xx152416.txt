==History==

The Sprint 15 was designed in 1979 by Rodney March, who was also responsible for the design of the Olympic Tornado class catamaran. Originally built by Panthercraft Ltd of Penryn in Cornwall as the "Spark", the boat was then sold through The Laser Centre in Banbury, UK and was renamed the Dart 15.  Production was transferred in 2005 to Collins Fibreglass of South Africa, who also manufacture the Dart 18 catamaran.  In 2005 the name of the boat was changed from Dart 15 to Sprint 15.  At present just over 2,000 Sprint 15 boats have been sold, and there is an active class association and racing schedule.  The Sprint 15 is in the top 2 most popular racing catamaran fleets each year in the UK (by national championship entries).
