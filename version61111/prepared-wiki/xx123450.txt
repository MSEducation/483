Beethoven is an animated sitcom, loosely based on the 1992 motion picture of the same name.  The series was produced by Northern Lights Entertainment, Universal Animation Studios, and Universal Television, and aired for one season (1994â€“1995) on CBS, with 26 fifteen-minute episodes produced.

==Premise==

Beethoven is a dog, who was first discovered by Emily Newton in her bedroom one morning. All the family are soon introduced to the St. Bernard; however Newton family father George has his moments with Beethoven, who ends up into different mishaps time after time. When not with the Newton family, Beethoven interacts with his puppies, or with animals outside of the house.
Unlike the movie, Beethoven talked, at least among the other animals; incidentally he would also talk in the 2011 direct-to-video film, Beethoven's Christmas Adventure. The same plot was used in another animated series Free Willy, where the main character also talked.

==Availability==

Universal and Goodtimes released episodes of the show on VHS. As of May 2, 2010, Universal has not announced any plans to release the show on DVD and/or Blu-ray until 2014, although the episodes are currently available to view on YouTube.
