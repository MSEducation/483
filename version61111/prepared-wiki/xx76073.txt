==Early political career==

===Warren Commission===

At the recommendation of Representative Gerald Ford, he worked for the Warren Commission, investigating the assassination of John F. Kennedy. As an assistant counsel for the commission, he co-authoredBugliosi, p. 301–306. "Warren Commission staff lawyer Norman Redlich was asked by author Vincent Bugliosi in 2005 whether Specter was the sole author of the single bullet theory and he said, 'No, we all came to this conclusion simultaneously.' When asked who he meant by 'we', he said, 'Arlen, myself, Howard Willens, David Belin, and Mel Eisenberg.' Specter did not respond to Bugliosi's request for a clarification on the issue." the "single bullet theory", which suggested the non-fatal wounds to Kennedy and wounds to Texas Governor John Connally were caused by the same bullet. This was a crucial assertion for the Warren Commission, since if the two had been wounded by separate bullets within such a short time frame, that would have demonstrated the presence of a second assassin and therefore a conspiracy.Bugliosi, p.456.

===Seeks political office===

In 1965, Specter ran for Philadelphia district attorney against his former boss, incumbent James C. Crumlish, Jr. The city's Democratic leaders did not want Specter as their candidate, so he switched parties and ran as a Republican, prompting Crumlish to call him "Benedict Arlen".[tpl]cite news|last=Mitchell|first=Andrea|title=Andrea Mitchell remembers Specter|url=http://nbcpolitics.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/10/14/14433097-andrea-mitchell-remembers-specter?lite|newspaper=NBC News|date=October 14, 2012[/tpl] Specter defeated Crumlish by 36,000 votes.

In 1967, he was the Republican Party standard bearer, together with City Controller candidate, Tom Gola, in the Philadelphia mayoral campaign against the Democratic incumbent James Tate. One of their slogans was, "We need THESE guys to watch THOSE guys" and "They're younger, they're tougher, and nobody owns them!"[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/23/AR2005052301337_pf.html|title=Watch Those Guys|last=Dionne|first=E.J.|authorlink=E.

The amendment strengthened the ability of the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity to enforce the Fair Housing Act and expanded the protected classes to include disabled persons and families with children. In 1998 and 1999, Specter criticized the Republican Party for the impeachment of President Bill Clinton.

Soon after the 2004 election, Specter stepped into the public spotlight as a result of controversial statements about his views of the future of the Supreme Court. At a press conference, he stated:
Activist groups interpreted his comments as warnings to President George W. Bush about the implications of nominating Supreme Court justices who are opposed to the Roe v. Wade decision. Specter maintained his comments were a prediction, not a warning. He met with many conservative Republican senators, and based on assurances he gave them, he was recommended for the Judiciary Committee's chairmanship in late 2004.[tpl]cite news|last=Adams|first=Helen Colwell|title=Toomey gets behind Specter|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-9225652.html|accessdate=18 March 2013|newspaper=The Sunday News|date=11 July 2004|publisher=via HighBeam Research [tpl]subscription required[/tpl]|location=Lancaster, Pennsylvania[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Hurt|first=Charles|title=Hatch backs Specter for Judiciary post|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-124773318.html|accessdate=18 March 2013|newspaper=The Washington Times|date=17 November 2004|publisher=via HighBeam Research [tpl]subscription required[/tpl][/tpl] He officially assumed that position when the 109th Congress convened on January 4, 2005.[tpl]cite web|last=Toobin|first=Jeffrey|title=Arlen Specter and the Supreme Court|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2012/10/arlen-specter-and-the-supreme-court.html|work=The New Yorker|publisher=Conde Nast|accessdate=18 March 2013|date=15 October 2012[/tpl]
On March 9, 2006, the USA PATRIOT Act was signed into law. It amended the process for interim appointments of U.S. Attorneys, a clause Specter wrote during his chairmanship of the Senate Judiciary Committee.[tpl]cite news|last=Lithwick|first=Dahlia|title=Specter Detector|work=Slate|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2161260|date=March 5, 2007|accessdate=January 7, 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080112055028/http://www.slate.com/id/2161260/|archivedate=January 12, 2008|deadurl=no[/tpl] The change allowed the Bush Administration to appoint interim U.S. attorneys without term limits, and without confirmation by the Senate. The Bush administration used the law to place at least eight interim attorneys into office in 2006. Specter claimed that the changes were added by staff member Brett Tolman.[tpl]cite web|last=Kiel|first=Paul|title=Specter: 'I Do Not Slip Things In'|url=http://www.tpmmuckraker.com/archives/002487.php|work=TPMmuckraker|publisher=TPM Media LLC|date=February 6, 2007|accessdate=April 30, 2009|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090504095846/http://www.tpmmuckraker.com/archives/002487.php|archivedate=May 4, 2009|deadurl=no[/tpl] For more information, see dismissal of U.S. Attorneys controversy.
Specter was very critical of Bush's wiretapping of U.S. citizens without warrants. When the story first broke, he called the effort "inappropriate" and "clearly and categorically wrong". He said, he intended to hold hearings into the matter early in 2006, and had Alberto Gonzales appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee to answer for the program (although Specter declined to force Gonzales to testify under oath). On January 15, 2006, Specter mentioned impeachment and criminal prosecution as potential remedies if Bush broke the law, though he downplayed the likelihood of such an outcome.
On April 9, 2006, speaking on Fox News about the Bush administration's leaking of classified intelligence, Specter stated: "The president of the United States owes a specific explanation to the American people".[tpl]cite news|last=Jackson|first=David|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2006-04-09-specter-cia_x.htm|work=USA Today|title=Specter urges Bush, Cheney to explain CIA leak|date=April 10, 2006|accessdate=July 16, 2007[/tpl] However, he voted for the 2008 amendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which placed federal electronic searches almost entirely within the executive branch.[tpl]cite web|title=U.S. Senate Roll Call Votes: Bill H.R. 6304|url=http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=110&session=2&vote=00168|work=United States Senate website|date=July 9, 2008|accessdate=April 30, 2009|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090502180734/http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=110&session=2&vote=00168|archivedate=May 2, 2009|deadurl=no[/tpl]
During the 2007–2008 National Football League season, Specter wrote to NFL commissioner Roger Goodell concerning the destruction of New England Patriots Spygate tapes, wondering if there was a link between the tapes and their Super Bowl victory over the Philadelphia Eagles. On February 1, 2008, Goodell stated that the tapes were destroyed because "they confirmed what I already knew about the issue". Specter released a follow up statement: [tpl]cquote|My strong preference is for the NFL to activate a Mitchell-type investigation, I have been careful not to call for a Congressional hearing because I believe the NFL should step forward and embrace an independent inquiry and Congress is extraordinarily busy on other matters.

Those rights would be substantially enhanced by televising the oral arguments of the Court so that the public can see and hear the issues presented.""Specter Introduces Resolution to Televise Supreme Court Proceedings" press release (November 5, 2009)
Specter's career in the United States Senate ended on January 3, 2011, after his primary defeat to Joe Sestak. He was succeeded by Pat Toomey, who won the general election against Sestak.

===Committee assignments===

Specter was chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence from 1995, when the Republicans gained control of the Senate, until 1997, when he became chairman of the Committee on Veterans Affairs. He chaired that committee until 2001 and again from 2003 to 2005, during the times the Republicans controlled the Senate. He also chaired the Judiciary Committee from 2005 to 2007.

==Campaigns==

In 1980, Specter became the Republican nominee for Senate when Republican incumbent Richard Schweiker announced his retirement. He faced the former Mayor of Pittsburgh, Pete Flaherty. Specter won the election by a 2.5% margin. He was later reelected in 1986, 1992, 1998, and 2004, despite 1992 and 1998 being bad years for Republicans. Specter ran for reelection in 2010, for the first time as a Democrat, but was defeated in the Primary.[tpl]cite news|last=Sherman|first=Jerome L.|title=Specter says he'll run in 2010 at age 80|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07079/770871-178.stm|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=March 20, 2007|accessdate=April 30, 2009[/tpl]

===1996 presidential bid===

On March 31, 1995, Specter announced his candidacy for President of the United States, to challenge the incumbent Bill Clinton. He entered the race claiming his party needed a candidate who did not conform to the stereotypical religious conservative image. He was critical of Pat Buchanan, Pat Robertson, and Ralph Reed, saying all three were far too conservative.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.4president.org/speeches/1996/arlenspecter1996announcement.htm|title=Arlen Specter 1996 Presidential Announcement Speech|publisher=4president.org|date=March 30, 1995|accessdate=August 29, 2010[/tpl]
His campaign focused on balancing the federal budget, strict crime laws, and establishing relations with North Korea.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/31/us/joining-race-specter-attacks-the-right.html?pagewanted=1|work=The New York Times|title=Joining Race, Specter Attacks the Right|first=Richard L.|last=Berke|date=March 31, 1995[/tpl] His candidacy was not expected to succeed in winning the Republican nomination due to the overwhelmingly large number of social conservatives in the Republican Party. He was, however, able to gain support. Although fellow Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum was never overly enthusiastic, he was supportive.[tpl]cite news|last=Jaffe|first=Alexandra|title=Santorum: Backing Specter 'wasn't one of my prouder moments'|publisher=via HighBeam Research [tpl]subscription required[/tpl]|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-2613853041.html|accessdate=18 March 2013|newspaper=National Journal|date=19 March 2012|location=Washington D.C.[/tpl] Other supportive Republicans were hopeful Specter could trim the party's "far-right fringe". Although his campaign was ultimately unsuccessful at wooing conservatives, it was widely believed he could have had a strong showing among independents. On November 23, 1995, before the start of the primaries, Specter suspended his campaign to endorse Kansas Senator Bob Dole.

===2004 campaign===

In 2004, Specter faced a challenge in the Republican primary election from conservative Congressman Pat Toomey, whose campaign theme was that Specter was not fiscally conservative enough. The match-up was closely watched nationally, being seen as a symbolic clash between the conservative and moderate wings of the Republican Party. However, most of the state and national Republican establishment, including the state's other senator at the time, Rick Santorum closed ranks behind Specter. Specter was supported by President George W. Bush. Specter narrowly avoided a major upset with 51% of the primary vote. Once Specter defeated the challenge from the right, he was able to enjoy great support from independents and some Democrats in his race against Hoeffel.[tpl]cite web|last=Sabato|first=Larry J.|title=Republican Specter defends his seat against Joe Hoeffel|url=http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/article.php?id=SPA2004102201|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080213062620/http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/article.php?id=SPA2004102201|archivedate=February 13, 2008|work=Crystal Ball|publisher=University of Virginia|authorlink=Larry J.

===2010 campaign===

Specter was up for re-election to the Senate in 2010, and expressed his plans to run again. On March 18, 2009, Specter said that he was not considering running as an independent. He said, "To eliminate any doubt, I am a Republican, and I am running for reelection in 2010 as a Republican on the Republican ticket."[tpl]cite news|last=Fitzgerald|first=Thomas|title=Specter staying on Republican ticket|url=http://www.philly.com/inquirer/local/20090319_Specter_staying_on_Republican_ticket.html|date=March 19, 2009|work=The Philadelphia Inquirer|accessdate=April 28, 2009|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090501111708/http://www.philly.com/inquirer/local/20090319_Specter_staying_on_Republican_ticket.html|archivedate=May 1, 2009|deadurl=no[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2010[/tpl] Subsequently Specter's 2004 conservative GOP primary challenger, Pat Toomey, announced he would again run for the Republican nomination in the Republican senatorial primary.[tpl]cite news|last=Turner|first=Trish|title=Specter faces conservative challenge from familiar foe|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/04/15/specter-faces-conservative-challenge-familiar-foe|work=Fox News|date=April 15, 2009|accessdate=April 28, 2009|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090421033140/http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/04/15/specter-faces-conservative-challenge-familiar-foe|archivedate=April 21, 2009|deadurl=no[/tpl]

What we do not expect is to be under visual surveillance in our homes, in our bedrooms, and, most especially, we do not expect it for our children in our homes.[tpl]cite web|last=Martin|first=John P.|url=http://www.philly.com/inquirer/front_page/20100416_1_000s_of_Web_cam_images__suit_says.html|title=1,000s of Web cam images, suit says|publisher=The Philadelphia Inquirer|date=April 16, 2010|accessdate=August 13, 2010|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100418043454/http://www.philly.com/philly/news/20100416_1_000s_of_Web_cam_images__suit_says.html|archivedate=April 18, 2010[/tpl]

==Arlen Specter Center for Public Policy at Philadelphia University==

On December 21, 2011, former Senator Arlen Specter donated to Philadelphia University nearly 2,700 boxes of historical papers and memorabilia dating from his career as a Philadelphia district attorney to his service as a United States senator, including materials associated with his role as assistant counsel on the Warren Commission. The collection will be jointly managed by the University of Pittsburgh, which will house, organize, and manage the collection. The universities will collaborate on related education programing that will consequently provide access to the archives on both ends of the state.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/campus_inq/Arlen-Specter-collection-heading-west.html|title=Arlen Specter collection heading west|first=Susan|last=Snyder|newspaper=Philadelphia Inquirer|date=March 4, 2013|accessdate=March 4, 2013[/tpl]  The Specter Collection will also support The Arlen Specter Center for Public Policy at Philadelphia University.
The Center will be a nonpartisan initiative dedicated to promoting greater understanding of public policy issues both foreign and domestic. The Center will strive to accomplish these goals through support for research, educational programming, and exhibitions inspired, in part, by the senator's career and the permanent collection of his historic papers. The Center will be managed by the Paul J. Gutman Library at Philadelphia University will be located in Roxboro House, which is located nearby on campus.
Parts of Roxboro House date back to 1799. The Georgian period house constructed of frame and clapboard was expanded in 1810. At one point in its history, Roxboro House was owned by Dr. Caspar Wistar who published the first American textbook of anatomy in 1811. Wistar was president of the American Philosophical Society and his friend, Thomas Nuttall, a famous botanist, named the Wisteria vine after him. In 1965 the Philadelphia Historical Commission added this house to its list of registered buildings (No. 141). Prior to the University's purchase of the property in 1998, the house was being used as a bed and breakfast establishment.

==Illness and death==

On February 16, 2005, Specter announced that he had been diagnosed with an advanced form of Hodgkin's lymphoma, a type of cancer. Despite this, Specter continued working during chemotherapy. He ended treatment on July 22. Senator John Sununu (R-NH) shaved his head to show solidarity with Specter, who was temporarily bald while undergoing chemotherapy. On April 15, 2008, Specter announced his cancer had returned, at a stage "significantly less advanced than his Hodgkin's disease when it was originally diagnosed in 2005".[tpl]cite news|title=Specter Announces Cancer Recurrence|date=April 16, 2008|work=The New York Times|agency=Associated Press|url=http://www.alhazan.com/images/phil-spector.jpg|accessdate=April 28, 2009 [/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Arlen Specter's Hodgkin's disease returns|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/04/15/arlen.specter/index.html|work=CNN|date=April 15, 2008|accessdate=April 29, 2009|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090425073201/http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/04/15/arlen.specter/index.html|archivedate=April 25, 2009|deadurl=no[/tpl] He underwent a second round of chemotherapy, which ended on July 14, 2008.[tpl]cite news|title=Specter finishes chemotherapy|agency=The Associated Press|url=http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2008/07/specter_finishes_chemotherapy.html|date=July 14, 2008|work=Pennlive.com|accessdate=April 29, 2009|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6AGDadyjo|archivedate=August 28, 2012|deadurl=no[/tpl]

Senator Specter, while he had been accused of alienating both parties due to certain positions he took and due to the two times he switched parties, among other issues, was nonetheless respected by many as a principled statesman who did much for his state and country, including by those in politics and the legislature, both in Pennsylvania and his home state, Kansas, as well as across the U.S. and beyond. He was the longest-serving of Pennsylvania's U.S. Senators, and it was said that he had done more for the state than anyone else, with the possible exception of Benjamin Franklin himself. As a sign of this respect and out of mourning, President Obama ordered U.S. flags to be lowered to half-staff at public institutions and military bases in Washington, D.C. and the rest of the country on his day of interment.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/10/15/presidential-proclamation-death-arlen-specter |title=Presidential Proclamation – Death of Arlen Specter | The White House |publisher=Whitehouse.gov |date= |accessdate=October 16, 2012[/tpl]
