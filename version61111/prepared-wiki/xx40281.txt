After another federal repayable funding commitment of one billion francs, each of the 26 long-haul aircraft (MD-11s and A330s) and 26 medium-haul aircraft (A321s, A320s and A319s) were able to be transferred to Crossair / Swiss at the end of the winter schedule of 2001/02. On Easter Monday, 1 April 2002, the last flight of Swissair, flight SR145 from São Paulo, landed in Zurich. A 71-year-long chapter of Swiss aviation history thus came to an end. Between 1931 and 2002, Swissair had transported more than 260 million passengers. The SwissairGroup (the name change from SAirGroup to SwissairGroup was announced in 2001 but never officially implemented) still existed as 'SAirGroup in Nachlassstundung' (German: Swissair in Administration) for several years until all assets were liquidated, including a large auction where many of the remaining Swissair assets, such as historic items, were auctioned. Today, Gategourmet continues as a subsidiary under the parent firm Gate Group.

===Factors behind collapse===

Like other airlines that flew to the United States, Swissair's operations and profitability were disrupted in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks.[tpl]cite news | author=Staff writers | title=Thousands stranded in airline crisis | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1577609.stm | work=BBC News | date=3 October 200 | accessdate=2009-03-19[/tpl]  As Swissair's directors included several politicians, commentators have pointed to potential conflicts of interest as fundamental to the demise of Swissair. Media have also suggested that the directorial board failed to oversee the actions of Philippe Bruggisser (Chief Operating Officer since 1996) and Eric Honegger (board member since 1993 and later board president), and that they left behind a convoluted corporate structure and financial commitments – among others a further purchase of 35.5 percent of Sabena's stocks – which would only come to light when Mario Corti was trying to save the airline.[tpl]cite news|last=Olson|first=Elizabeth|title=Brussels sues Swissair in move to aid Sabena|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/04/business/brussels-sues-swissair-in-move-to-aid-sabena.html|accessdate=27 September 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=4 July 2001[/tpl]
The judiciary is continuing to examine why Swissair acquired counselling that supported the Hunter Strategy, and why Swissair continued to make certain payments despite nearing insolvency. Questions have also been raised about federal aid given to Swissair and the politicians involved. The highly competitive nature of the market during the business's final years also precipitated its demise: like rival company Sabena, Swissair fell victim to the competition of budget airlines such as Ryanair and EasyJet.[tpl]cite book |title=Business Studies | edition=Third edition |first=Dave | last=Hall | coauthors=Jones, Rob; Raffo, Carlo | year=2004 | publisher=Causeway Press |location=Ormskirk | isbn=1-902796-83-7 | page=196 [/tpl]
A BBC correspondent said regarding the collapse "Something did die in Switzerland that day: not just an airline but an image the Swiss had of themselves and, more importantly, of their business leaders" and "The Swiss financial community's reputation for good business sense was already seriously damaged by the Swissair disaster.""Swiss shame over airline disgrace lingers."

Due to continued civil proceedings are part of the causes of the collapse of SAirGroup subject of legal proceedings and are therefore legally unclear. The following causes are widely recognized as crucial factors:

===Management trial===

The criminal trial began 16 January 2007 in Bülach.  The entire Swissair management board stood facing criminal charges of mismanagement, false statements, and forgery of documents.  Top defendants in the trial were Mario Corti, Philippe Bruggisser, George Schorderet, Jacqualyn Fouse, Eric Honegger and Vrena Spoerry. Corti, Honegger and Spoerry entered statements proclaiming their innocence.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/01/16/business/EU-FIN-Switzerland-Swissair-Trial.php | title=Swissair executives assert innocence at first day of Switzerland's biggest corporate trial | work=International Herald Tribune | author=Harry Rosenbaum | date=15 January 2007 | accessdate=2007-02-22[/tpl]

The building is located here
KSG, Architects G.Müller + G.Berger designed the final head office complex for the airline. It was in proximity to the main airport facilities and to area freeways. The first phase of the building included offices for 1,600 workers, computer rooms, printing rooms, and 500-seat restaurant facilities. The second phase included open plan office room, another computer laboratory, and expansions of the restaurant facilities.

==Swissair legacy==

In 2002 the successor airline Swiss International Air Lines was born.  First called Swiss Air Lines, this Company was based on the former Crossair, and was basically a merger of Crossair and former Swissair employees, routes and aircraft. The Company Swissair continued to exist (in liquidation), but had no further assets. Due to legal problems with Swissair, the name had to be changed to Swiss International Air Lines
Swiss took over 26 longhaul and 26 medium haul Aircraft from the Swissair fleet and refurbished the liveries to turn it into the new Swiss fleet, together with the former Crossair Fleet consisting of Embraer 145, Saab 2000, MD-80 Series and Avro RJ.
After problems with the former Crossair pilot unions, who refused to accept different conditions than the former Swissair pilots within the same airline, a subsidiary called Swiss European Air Lines was founded which belongs 100% to Swiss International Air Lines.
In 2004, it appeared that Swiss was going to become a member of the Oneworld alliance.  It had codeshares with Oneworld carriers British Airways,  American Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Qantas, Aer Lingus and Finnair, and held a strategic partnership and joint operation for all service to North America and AA-operated flights beyond U.S. gateways using American Airlines.  Swiss started to terminate these codeshare agreements, but did not terminate the AA alliance.  A theory emerged that Swiss was planning to use its partnerships, the AA alliance, and its partnership with British Airways, a strong supportive member of Oneworld, to join Oneworld itself.
However, in March 2005 Swiss was taken over by the German Lufthansa Group and Deutsche Lufthansa AG, the flag carrier of Germany. With the merger with Lufthansa, Swiss joined the Star Alliance, which Swissair planned to join before it failed. With this move, Swiss's frequent flyer club, Swiss TravelClub became part of Miles & More, which was originally the Lufthansa frequent flyer club. It acts as both airlines' frequent flyer programme, along with many other airlines.

===Continued use of the "Swissair" brand===

Swiss retains the rights to the "Swissair" name, whose value was estimated at more than 10 million Swiss francs in 2010. In order to prevent the trademark from becoming void through disuse, Swiss licensed it to Hopscotch Air, which operates a fleet of Cirrus SR22 plane in the U.S., for use from 2010 to 2013. In Switzerland, the trademark is protected through its use by an aviation sports club, Sportfluggruppe Swissair.[tpl]cite news|title=Business lead |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2010/10/19/348506/business-lead.html|accessdate=1 November 2010|newspaper=Flightglobal|date=19 October 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Keller|first=Senta|title=Swissair hebt wieder ab|url=http://www.bernerzeitung.ch/wirtschaft/unternehmen-und-konjunktur/Swissair-hebt-wieder-ab/story/22277954|accessdate=1 November 2010|newspaper=Berner Zeitung|date=1 November 2010[/tpl]
