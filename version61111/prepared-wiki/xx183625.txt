==History==

Visitors to the area in the first decades of the 20th century frequently described the area a volcanic no-man's land between the Afar, Karayu Oromo and Amhara settlers."Local History in Ethiopia" (pdf) The Nordic Africa Institute website (accessed 3 January 2008) On the eve of the Italian invasion, a German named Neitzel had been granted a concession to cultivate cotton and coffee.Richard Pankhurst, Economic History of Ethiopia (Addis Ababa: Haile Selassie I University, 1968), p. 209 Despite that, few people lived in the area until the arrival of the Dutch corporation Handelsvereeningung Amsterdam (HVA), which established a factory to process sugar at Metehara, after it had been expelled from Indonesia in 1954.[tpl]Ref Ethiopia|BahruZewde-2001|pages= p. 198[/tpl]
In 1970, the Karayu staged an armed demonstration in Metehara which destroyed fences and buildings at the HVA plantation. The Derg announced 3 February 1975 that the sugar plantation, including the Dutch investments, would be fully nationalized.
During the 2002 drought, a Karayu leader was killed in Metehara, which increased tensions between the Karayu and Afar peoples. As a result the Afar, who traded at the Tuesday market, did not go to the market during that drought."Afar: insecurity and delayed rains threaten livestock and people" UN-Emergencies Unit for Ethiopia, July 2002, p. 4
