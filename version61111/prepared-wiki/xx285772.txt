His compositions express sounds of music made of popular Sicilian, Spanish flamenco and Latin rhythms and also echoes ethnic Greek, Arabian and Indian sounds. His style resembles the nuevo flamenco and world music. His passion for music began at the age of 6, when he was given his first acoustic guitar. Since then, he has been continuously perfecting his technique of Flamenco from various lands. At the age of 8, he started making his first short instrumental compositions. In his musical career, he has also composed soundtracks for several documentaries and television. Some of his songs have been used as accompanying music for programs broadcast on satellite TV in the USA over the years. Some choice tracks have been placed in satellite TV programs for the BBC, RAI, Discovery Channel, MTV and The Oprah Winfrey Show.

In 2006, his first EP titled Fanusa was released, which contains the songs "Fanusa", a flamenco-derived South American track, "Serenade", inspired from Celtic music, and "Danza de la Luna Nueva", which mixes tango, flamenco and Greek music. Two of his songs, "Eve" and "Bongo Beach", produced together with the English duo Coyote were selected for the Laissez Faire Lounge 2 compilation, produced by ZYX Music as well as many other compilation albums. His latest album is Viento De Siroco, which is full of Mediterranean melodies. Many of his songs are named after places in Italy as a tribute to his homeland. His song "Libertad" features the Middle Eastern drum darabukka accompanying the guitar.[tpl]cite web|author=ergo |url=http://musicadiversa.blogspot.in/2007/08/saro-tribartone-compositore-e.html |title=Musicadiversa: Saro Tribastone, compositore e chitarrista siciliano |publisher=Musicadiversa.blogspot.in |date= |accessdate=2013-08-13[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gather.com/viewArticle.action?articleId=281474977086310 |title=Saro Tribastone-Fanusa |publisher=Gather |date= |accessdate=2013-08-13[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.reviewyou.com/saro-tribastone-viento-de-siroco/ |title=Saro Tribastone "Viento De Siroco" | Review You CD Reviews |publisher=Reviewyou.com |date=2009-09-22 |accessdate=2013-08-13[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gettyimages.in/music/artists/44017-saro-tribastone |title=Saro Tribastone Music - World - Spanish,World - Eastern European | Getty Images |publisher=Gettyimages.in |date= |accessdate=2013-08-20[/tpl]
