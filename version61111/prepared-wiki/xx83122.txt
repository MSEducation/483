The Most Dangerous Game, also published as The Hounds of Zaroff, is a short story by Richard Connell first published in Collier's magazine on January 19, 1924. The Most Dangerous Game features a big-game hunter from New York who falls off a yacht and swims to an isolated island in the Caribbean where he is hunted by a Cossack aristocrat. The story is an adaptation of the big-game hunting safaris in Africa and South America that were fashionable among wealthy Americans in the 1920s. It is considered by many to be the paragon example for the man vs. man plot archetype.eMoviePoster.com
The story has been adapted numerous times, most notably for the 1932 RKO Pictures film The Most Dangerous Game, starring Joel McCrea and Leslie Banks, and for a 1943 episode of the CBS Radio series Suspense starring Orson Welles.

==Synopsis==

Sanger Rainsford and his friend, Whitney, travel to Rio de Janeiro to hunt the region’s big cat: the jaguar. After a discussion about how they are “the hunters” instead of “the hunted” Whitney goes to bed and Rainsford remains on deck. While Whitney returns to his quarters Rainsford hears gun shots, climbs onto the yachts' rail to get a better view of Ship-Trap Island, and falls overboard. After he realizes he cannot swim back to the boat, he swims to the nearby Ship-Trap Island, which is notorious for shipwrecks. He finds a palatial chateau inhabited by two Cossacks: the owner, General Zaroff, and his gigantic deaf-mute servant, Ivan. The General, another big-game hunter, knew of Rainsford from his book about hunting snow leopards in Tibet. After inviting him to dinner, General Zaroff tells Rainsford he is bored of hunting because it no longer challenges him; therefore he decided to live on an island where he could capture shipwrecked sailors. He sends them into the jungle supplied with food, a knife, and hunting clothes to be his quarry. After a three-hour head start, he hunts and kills them. If the captives elude him, Ivan, and a pack of hunting dogs for three days, General Zaroff lets them go. No one has eluded him that long. Zaroff invites Rainsford to join him in his hunt, but Rainsford is appalled by Zaroff’s motives and refuses. Zaroff then tells Rainsford that he can choose whether he will be the next to be hunted or whipped to death by Ivan; Rainsford chooses to be hunted.
Rainsford, upon the commencement of his three-hour head start, begins to lay an intricate trail in the forest and then climbs a tree. Zaroff finds him easily, but decides to play with him like a cat would a mouse. After the failed attempt of eluding the General, Rainsford builds a Malay-man-catcher; a weighted log attached to a trigger. This contraption injures Zaroff's shoulder, causing him to return home for the night. The next day Rainsford creates a Burmese-tiger-pit which kills one of Zaroff's hounds. He sets a native Ugandan knife trap, which impales and kills Ivan, but costs him his knife. To escape the General and his approaching hounds, Rainsford dives off a cliff into the sea; Zaroff returns home.
Zaroff locks himself in his bedroom and turns on the lights revealing Rainsford who, after swimming around the island, has hidden by the bed curtains. Zaroff congratulates him on winning the "game". Rainsford decides to fight him calling himself a beast-at-bay. The General accepts the challenge and says the loser will be fed to the dogs and the winner will sleep in his bed. Though the ensuing fight is not described, the story ends with Rainsford observing that "he had never slept in a better bed," implying that he defeated and killed Zaroff.
