Miguel Cano Pacheco was a Spanish baroque architect and sculptor born in Almod√≥var del Campo, father and first master of Alonso Cano, renowned joiner of altarpieces. The reputation of his work and the accumulation of orders motivated that he was moving from the mancheguian city to Granada, with all his family, two months before his son Alonso was born.
