"Universal Nation" is the first and the most successful release by DJ/producer Mike "M.I.K.E." Dierickx under his alias Push. What began as small trance studio project in late 1997, became an international commercial success over the years. The song was first released in 1998 on the legendary Belgian trance label Bonzai Records. After receiving positive reviews, the song was signed in France, Spain and Germany. One year later, other European countries followed (UK, Italy, Norway, Sweden, The Netherlands). Due to the several individual releases, the song has three different titles: Universal Nation, Universal Nation â€™99 and Universal Nation (The Real Anthem).[tpl]cite web|title=PUSH - UNIVERSAL NATION (THE REAL ANTHEM) (NUMMER)|url=http://www.ultratop.be/nl/showitem.asp?interpret=Push&titel=Universal+Nation+(The+Real+Anthem)&cat=s|publisher=Ultratop|accessdate=2008-10-10[/tpl]
Mike Dierickx is generally praised for his high quality productions. Universal Nation is often quoted as an "all time favorite trance record". In 1999 Universal Nation won "Best club single Move-X Dance Awards".
Universal Nation was followed by "Cosmonautica",  "Legacy", "Please Save Me" (feat. Sunscreem) and "Strange World". All of them were extremely well received in the European clubscene. 
Today Universal Nation is regarded as an ultimate trance classic.[tpl]fact|date=February 2014[/tpl] The phrase "proceed with visual attack formation" is sampled from the 1984 film The Last Starfighter.[tpl]fact|date=February 2014[/tpl]
