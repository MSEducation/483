==History==

The company was incorporated in Tucson, Arizona in 1956 by founders Page Burr (Princeton 1944R. Page Burr '44 Obit) and  Thomas R. Brown, Jr. (BS MIT 1949, MBA Harvard 1952) to commercialize semiconductor transistors; in 1959, the company posted its first profit. Brown eventually bought out Burr's share of the company.
In 1983, the company reincorporated in Delaware, and went public with stock trading on NASDAQ under the symbol BBRC.
The company employed over 1,300 people worldwide with manufacturing and technical facilities located in Tucson, Arizona; Atsugi, Japan; and Livingston, Scotland. Company headquarters was located in Tucson.
Burr-Brown was one of the principal suppliers of precision analog and data acquisition products to the electronic industry. The company pioneered many analog semiconductor products and techniques, such as active laser-trimming.
To mark Burr-Brown's history, a monument was erected in the main courtyard in Tucson, Arizona with the following text:
 
 From its humble beginnings in Tom Brown’s garage, Burr-Brown Corporation grew into one of the world’s leading designers and manufacturers of high-performance analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits.  Robert Page Burr and Thomas R. Brown, Jr., co-founded the company in 1956 and gave their names to the new enterprise.
Mr. Burr left in 1958 to form another company, while Mr. Brown continued to lead Burr-Brown for 44 years.  The company developed the first commercial solid-state operational amplifier and led the world in high-precision data conversion technology.
This monument honors Burr-Brown’s founders and their pioneering spirit; its gifted and dedicated employees; and its rich history of technological achievements.  In the words of its stated Corporate Purpose, Burr-Brown truly did “provide something of value to mankind.”
On the occasion of becoming one company, this marker is hereby dedicated with deepest respect by Texas Instruments Incorporated to the people of Burr-Brown.
