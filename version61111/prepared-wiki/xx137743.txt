==Origins and history==

The original Spiegeltents were constructed in the Flemish Region of Belgium in the late 19th century as mobile dance halls. They were transported around the country and assembled for town fairs in areas that did not have a proper dance hall.

===History===

The Famous Spiegeltent,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.spiegeltent.net/content.php/category/id/16 |title=The Famous Spiegeltent History |work=Spiegeltent.net |date=2010-07-13 |accessdate=2013-07-20[/tpl] perhaps the most lavishly decorated of all, was built in 1920 in Belgium by master craftsmen Oscar Mols Dom and Louis Goor. Over the decades it has hosted some of the world's greatest performing artists, including German singer Marlene Dietrich, who famously performed "Falling in Love Again" in it during the 1930s.

===Construction===

The Famous Spiegeltent is transported from venue to venue in shipping containers, and is constructed on site at each location. It consists of about 3,000 pieces of wood, mirrors, canvas and stained glass, and is then detailed in velvet and brocade.
Construction takes about ten to twelve hours, and is supervised by two Belgian specialists. In addition, an adjacent bar is constructed, which in addition to the lighting and sound equipment takes another few days.
The Famous Spiegeltent can hold an audience of about 300–350 people.

===Current use===

The Famous Spiegeltent is owned and managed by Australian pianist and theatrical producer David Bates, who first utilised the tent as a venue at the 1996 Edinburgh Fringe Festival. After a successful visit to Melbourne in 2001, Bates bought the tent from previous owners Scottish & Newcastle and set it up as a unique travelling venue.
Although its history and décor make it ideal for cabaret-style acts, the venue hosts a wide variety of genres including rock music, classical music, comedy and circus acts. 
The Famous Spiegeltent's late night show La Clique has been highly acclaimed and reappeared as "La Clique Royale" for the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 2012 to rave reviews.
