Christopher Anderson is an internationally recognized photographer and a member of Magnum Photos.

==Biography==

Born in Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada in 1970, he grew up in the west Texas town of Abilene. He first gained recognition for his pictures in 1999 when he boarded a small wooden boat with Haitian refugees trying to sail to America. The boat, named the "Believe In God", sank in the Caribbean. In 2000 the images from that journey received the Robert Capa Gold Medal.
Anderson's early work from conflict zones such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Lebanon and Israel/ Palestine earned international acclaim and awards such as two World Press Photo Awards and Magazine Photographer of the Year. In 2004, Anderson began traveling to Venezuela to document the country under the presidency of Hugo Ch√°vez. The resulting book, Capitolio (RM 2009) was named one of the best photographic books of 2010 at the Kassels book Festival in Germany. In 2011, Anderson made Capitolio into an app for iPhone and iPad, the first ever photographic book to be made into an application for such devices. His current work crosses genres, from documentary to art to portraiture of celebrities (such as Lady Gaga) and fashion. 
Anderson was one of the early members of the agency VII that was formed by photographers James Nachtwey and Antonin Kratochvil in 2001. He resigned from the agency in 2004 and joined Magnum Photos in 2005. He has served as a contract photographer for Newsweek and National Geographic Magazines and is currently the first ever "Photographer in Residence" at New York Magazine,"New York Names Christopher Anderson Photographer-In-Residence""Christopher Anderson signs with New York Magazine" working with editors Adam Moss and Jody Quon.[tpl]cite web|title=Christopher Anderson|url=http://www.christopherandersonphoto.com/#/index|publisher=Christopher Anderson|accessdate=20 August 2012[/tpl]
