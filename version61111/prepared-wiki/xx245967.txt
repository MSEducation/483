==History==

The Winnebago State Hospital was one of several 19th-century psychiatric hospitals in the United States built on the Kirkbride Plan, a style of mental asylum design advocated by Philadelphia psychiatrist Thomas Story Kirkbride in the mid-19th century. The site of the hospital was the object of a competition between Green Bay and Oshkosh in 1870. The voters in the area approved an expenditure of $16,700 to begin construction.http://dhs.wisconsin.gov/mh_winnebago/History.htm
Construction first began for the institute in 1871. It opened in 1873 as the Northern Hospital for the Insane, with the first patient admitted on April 21, 1873. The original building (now gone) was completed on November 11, 1875, with a capacity of 500 beds.
In 2007, a newspaper reported that there had been three deaths and a rape at the hospital in a two-year period.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-168260063/winnebago-cited-3-deaths.html|title=Winnebago cited for 3 deaths, rape: Poor supervision, bad judgment put patients in jeopardy at state-run mental health institute |last=Zahn|first=Mary  |date=September 2, 2007|work= The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel |accessdate=8 January 2010|location=Milwaukee, Wisconsin[/tpl] This triggered renovations to reduce the opportunities for patients to commit suicide,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-169704448/life-safety-code-planned.html|title=Life Safety Code planned for Winnebago Mental Health Institute in Oshkosh. |last=Snyder|first= Paul  |date=October 10, 2007|work=The Daily Reporter |location=Milwaukee  |accessdate=8 January 2010[/tpl] though those renovations were later criticized as inadequate.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-35591400_ITM|title=Suicide attempts at Winnebago Mental Health Institute continue after state project errors. |last=Snyder|first=Paul|date=October 20, 2008 |work=The Daily Reporter  |accessdate=8 January 2010|location=Milwaukee[/tpl]
