The Freedom Bowl was an annual post-season college football bowl game played at Anaheim Stadium in Anaheim, California, from 1984 to 1994. Beginning with the 1995 season, the Freedom Bowl's WAC tie-ins were merged with that of the Holiday Bowl and the game was dissolved.Foldesy, Jody. "Bowls burgeon as big business", The Washington Times. December 21, 1997. Page A1. In 1997, Anaheim Stadium reverted to a baseball-only configuration, making a resumption of the game in this venue unlikely.
