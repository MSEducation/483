The Palestinian National Security Forces (NSF) ([tpl]lang-ar|اجهزة امن السلطة الفلسطينية[/tpl]) are the paramilitary forces of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA). The Presidential Guard (PG) was a separate force, originally not part of the NSF.Abbas outlaws Hamas's paramilitary Executive Force. Richard Boudreaux, The Boston Globe, 7 January 2007Plan B. US State Department, 2007
Since the signing of the Oslo Accords, these forces operate in areas controlled by the PNA.
The Palestinian National Security Forces engages in various activities which includes among others, maintaining the security and protection of the Palestinian President and Palestinian Leadership. 
The Director General of the Palestinian National Security Forces is Major General Nasser Yousef. 
The Palestinian Security Force is financed by the United States which, according to media estimates, pays an annual 3 million dollars for it.

==Background==

As part of the Oslo Accords, the PNA was authorized to recruit and train a police force with paramilitary capabilities, but was not permitted to have a military force. Several bilateral agreements between the PNA and Israel regulate the size of the force, its structure, armament, and composition. The agreements provide Israel with the right to review potential recruits and withhold approval of those with a terrorist background. They were not enforced, however, with the result that the actual size and equipment of the force in 2002 exceeded what was permitted.Palestine: The recruitment practices of the Palestinian National Forces.

Initially, Yasser Arafat set up a string of 14 overlapping and often competing security forces, each one controlled by a rival political or former guerrilla chieftain, but all of them ultimately loyal to him and his Fatah party.U.S. training Fatah in anti-terror tactics.

===Early history===

After the killing of three US officials in the Gaza strip in 2003, British forces played an increasingly active role.Palestine papers: MI6 plan proposed internment – and hotline to Israelis.

===2005 re-structuring plan===

According to The Guardian, based on the Palestine Papers, in 2003, British Prime Minister Tony Blair approved a plan of the Secret Intelligence Service MI6 for a US-led "counter-insurgency surge" against Hamas. MI6 proposed a secret plan to crush Hamas and other armed groups on the West Bank. It included internment of leaders and activists, closure of radio stations and replacement of imams in mosques. The plan recommended inter alia ''
 
 "Degrading the capabilities of the rejectionists – Hamas, PIJ Islamic Jihad and the Fatah-linked Al Aqsa Brigades – through the disruption of their leaderships' communications and command and control capabilities; the detention of key middle-ranking officers; and the confiscation of their arsenals and financial resources"''. 

Also the internment of leading Hamas and PIJ figures should have been explored. The plan aimed to implement the Roadmap for peace.UK Security Plan: British MI6 Palestinian Security Plan with Annex (2003). Al Jazeera, Palestine Papers, 2011.
