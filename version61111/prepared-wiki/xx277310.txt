Torus is the second studio album by Sub Focus. The album was released on 30 September 2013 through RAM Records, Mercury Records and Virgin EMI.

==Musical concept and songs==

Torus is the geometric name for the shape in Sub Focus' logo. It was originally used on his debut album cover and the shape has played a big part in his live shows as well as in promotion and artwork. The title track was written as an intro to Douwma's live sets, in preparation for a Brixton performance in 2012. He wanted to start his sets with a low tempo and gradually speed up.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.xfm.co.uk/radio/remix/highlights/sub-focus-torus/|title=Sub Focus on Torus|publisher=XFM|author=Eddy Temple-Morris|date=2013-10-04[/tpl] "Safe In Sound" was one of the earliest tracks to be completed, and was written with Seton Daunt and later given the Mary O'Hara sample. "Endorphins" originally had a female vocalist, and was given to several artists but in the end Alex Clare visited Nick's studio to record what would be the final version of the track. "Twilight" was written as an ambient contrast to the club-orientated songs on the album, as Douwma viewed the album as a journey and wanted constant progression. The synth hook on "Falling Down" was originally intended for the Chase & Status and Takura collaboration "Flashing Lights" but didn't fit the song so was re-used as a starting point for the new song. While the track was being finished, Skrillex coincidentally visited the studios to meet Caspa and Douwma showed him the track. Skrillex enjoyed it and decided to release it alongside remixes on OWSLA. "Turn Back Time" was one of the last songs to be finished on the album. At the time he was experimenting with 90's rave samples and the song originally used a sample but was re-recorded. "You Make It Better" was also one of the final songs to be finished on the album. At the time it was just a loop and Culture Shock had a lot of ideas to develop it. They wanted a hook for the breakdown of the song so TC recorded vocals for it. The vocals on "Tidal Wave" were originally on another Sub Focus demo but instead got used on the "Tidal Wave" instrumental. "Until the End" was inspired by the Drive soundtrack and was written as a concluding track for the album.
