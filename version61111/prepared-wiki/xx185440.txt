CATEGORIES: Ships of the line of the Royal Navy, Ships built in England, 1650s ships

HMS ''Advice'' was a 40-gun fourth-rate frigate of the Royal Navy. It was originally built for the navy of the Commonwealth of England by Peter Pett II at Woodbrige, and was launched in 1650. By 1677 her armament had been increased to 48 guns.
She underwent a rebuild in 1698 at Woolwich Dockyard, from where she was relaunched as a fourth-rate ship of the line of between 46 and 54 guns. On 27 June 1711, while lying in Yarmouth Roads, Advice was attacked by five privateers flying French colours. The French ships lay off Advice's quarter, relieving each other as necessary, and caused a great deal of damage to the sails and rigging. Despite their resistance, Captain Lord Duffus was forced to surrender after two thirds of his crew had been killed or wounded, and he having taken a total of five musket balls to various parts of his body. The privateers took Advice back to Dunkirk.Ships of the Old Navy, Advice (1650).
