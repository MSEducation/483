==Early life and education==

John Sulston was born in Cambridge[tpl]cite web|title=John Sulston Biography|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2155590/bio|publisher=IMDB.com, Inc.|accessdate=21 April 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=John Sulston|url=http://www.dnalc.org/view/16073-John-Sulston.html|work=DNA Learning Centre|publisher=Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory|accessdate=21 April 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=John E.

An English teacher at Watford Grammar School, his mother quitted her job to care for him and his sister Madeleine.[tpl]cite web|title=John Sulston Biography Nobel Prize in Medicine|url=http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/sul0bio-1|publisher=American Academy of Achievement|accessdate=21 April 2014[/tpl] His mother home-tutored them until he was five. At age five he entered the local preparatory school where he soon developed aversion to games. He instead developed an early interest in science, having fun with dissecting animals and sectioning plants to observe their structure and function.[tpl]cite web|title=John E.

He joined the department of chemistry in University of Cambridge, earning his Doctor of Philosophyin 1966[tpl]cite thesis |degree=PhD |first=John|last=Sulston |title=Aspects of oligoribonucleotide synthesis|publisher=University of Cambridge |date=1967 |url=http://www.theses.com|authorlink=John Sulston[/tpl][tpl]subscription required[/tpl] for research in nucleotide chemistry. Between 1966 and 1969 he worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in US. His supervisor Colin Reese had arranged for him to work with Leslie Orgel, who would turn his scientific career in a different pathway. Orgel introduced him to Francis Crick and Sidney Brenner, who were themselves from Cambridge. He became inclined to biological research.

==Career==

Although Orgel wanted Sulston to remain with him, Sidney Brenner persuaded Sulston returned to Cambridge to work on the neurobiology of Caenorhabditis elegans at the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology. Sulston soon produced the complete map of the worm's neurons.[tpl]cite journal|last=Sulston|first=J.E.|coauthors=Horvitz, H.R.|title=Post-embryonic cell lineages of the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans|journal=Developmental Biology|year=1977|volume=56|issue=1|pages=110–156|doi=10.1016/0012-1606(77)90158-0|pmid=838129[/tpl] He continued to work for its DNA and subseqeuntly the whole genome sequencing. In collaboration with the Genome Institute at Washington University the whole genome sequence was published in 1998,[tpl]cite journal|last=The C. elegans Sequencing Consortium|title=Genome Sequence of the Nematode C. elegans: A Platform for Investigating Biology|journal=Science|year=1998|volume=282|issue=5396|pages=2012–2018|doi=10.1126/science.282.5396.2012|pmid=9851916[/tpl] so that c. elegans became the first animal to have its complete genome sequenced.[tpl]cite web|title=Caenorhabditis genome sequencing|url=http://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/projects/caenorhabditisgenomics/|publisher=Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute|accessdate=22 April 2014[/tpl] 
Sulston played a central role in both the C. elegans and human genome[tpl]cite pmid|11237011[/tpl] sequencing projects.  He had argued successfully for the sequencing of C. elegans to show that large-scale genome sequencing projects were feasible.  As sequencing of the worm genome proceeded, the project to sequence the human genome began.  At this point he was made director of the newly established Sanger Centre (named after Fred Sanger and now the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute), located in Cambridgeshire, England.
Following completion of the 'working draft' of the human genome sequence in 2000, Sulston retired from his role as director at the Sanger Centre. In 2002 he won the Dan David Prize and the Robert Burns Humanitarian Award. Later, he shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Sydney Brenner and H. Robert Horvitz, both of whom he had collaborated with at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB), for their discoveries concerning 'genetic regulation of organ development and programmed cell death'. One of Sulston's most important contributions during his research years at the LMB was to elucidate the precise order in which cells in C. elegans divide. In fact, he and his team succeeded in tracing the nematode's entire embryonic cell lineage.  Sulston is now a leading campaigner against the patenting of human genetic information.

==Personal life==

John Sulston met Daphne Bate, a fellow research students in Cambridge. They got married in 1966 just before they left for US for postdoctoral research. Together they have three children. The first child Ingrid was born in La Jolla in 1967, Adrian and Madeleine later in England.
Although brought up in a Christian family, Sulston lost his faith during his student life at Cambridge, and remain an atheist. He is a distinguished supporter of the British Humanist Association.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.humanism.org.uk/about/people/distinguished-supporters | title=Distinguished Supporters | publisher=British Humanist Association | accessdate=4 October 2012[/tpl] In 2003 he was one of 21 Nobel Laureates who signed the Humanist Manifesto.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_III/Notable_Signers | title=Notable Signers | publisher=American Humanist Association | work=Humanism and Its Aspirations | accessdate=4 October 2012[/tpl]
Sulston is in favour of free public access of scientific information. He wants genome information freely available, and he has described as "totally immoral and disgusting" the idea of profiteering from such research. He also want to change patent law, and argues that restrictions on drugs such as anti-viral drug Tamiflu by Roche are hindrance to patients whose lives are dependent on them.

==Awards and honours==

In 2001 Sulston was invited to deliver the Royal Institution Christmas Lecture on The Secrets of Life.
He also provided bail sureties for Julian Assange, according to Mark Stephens, Julian's solicitor.[tpl]cite web|title=Wikileaks' Julian Assange tells of 'smear campaign'|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-12015140|accessdate=21 April 2014|publisher=BBC|date=17 December 2010[/tpl] Having backed Julian Assange by pledging bail in December 2010, he lost the money in June 2012 when a judge ordered it to be forfeited, as Assange had sought to escape the jurisdiction of the English courts by entering the embassy of Ecuador.[tpl]cite news|author=Allen, Emily|newspaper=Daily Mail |title= Julian Assange's celebrity backers set to lose $540,000 bail money as he remains holed up in Ecuador Embassy|date=4 September 2012|url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2198072/Julian-Assanges-high-profile-backers-set-lose-340-000-bail-money-remains-holed-Ecuador-Embassy.html|accessdate=21 April 2014[/tpl]
He was awarded the Royal Society's Rutherford Memorial Lecture for 2013, which he delivered in New Zealand on the subject of population pressure.
