Sir William Timothy Gowers, FRS ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|aʊ|ər|s[/tpl]; born 20 November 1963) is a British mathematician. He is a Royal Society Research Professor at the Department of Pure Mathematics and Mathematical Statistics at the University of Cambridge, where he also holds the Rouse Ball chair, and is a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge. In 1998 he received the Fields Medal for research connecting the fields of functional analysis and combinatorics.[tpl]MathGenealogy |id=67729[/tpl][tpl]IMO results |id=11101[/tpl][tpl]AcademicSearch|1517772[/tpl][tpl]MacTutor Biography|id=Gowers[/tpl]

==Academic positions==

After his PhD, Gowers was elected to a Junior Research Fellowship at Trinity College. From 1991 until his return to Cambridge in 1995 he was a lecturer at University College London. He was elected to the Rouse Ball Professorship at Cambridge in 1998. For the academic years 2000-1 and 2001-2 he was a visiting professor at Princeton University.

==Education==

Gowers attended King's College School, Cambridge, as a choirboy in the King's College choir, and then Eton College as a King's Scholar. He completed his PhD, with a dissertation entitled Symmetric Structures in Banach Spaces,[tpl]cite thesis |degree=PhD |first=Timothy|last=Gowers |title=Symmetric structures in Banach spaces|publisher=University of Cambridge |date=1990 |url=http://ulmss-newton.lib.cam.ac.uk/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=8880|authorlink=Timothy Gowers[/tpl] at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1990, supervised by Béla Bollobás.

==Academic Work==

Gowers began his career working on Banach Spaces. He used combinatorial tools in proving several of Stefan Banach's conjectures in the subject, in particular constructing a Banach space with almost no symmetry, serving as a counterexample to several other conjectures.1998 Fields Medalist William Timothy Gowers from the American Mathematical Society With Bernard Maurey he resolved the "unconditional basic sequence problem" in 1992, showing that not every infinite-dimensional Banach space has an infinite-dimensional subspace that admits an unconditional Schauder basis.
After this work Gowers switched his attention to combinatorics and combinatorial number theory. In 1997 he provedW.T. Gowers, A lower bound of tower type for Szemeredi's uniformity lemma, GAFA 7 (1997), 322-337 that the Szemerédi regularity lemma necessarily comes with tower-type bounds.
In 2003, Gowers established a regularity lemma for hypergraphs,W.T.Gowers, Hypergraph regularity and the multidimensional Szemeredi theorem, Annals of Mathematics, 166 (2007), 897–946 analogous to the Szemerédi regularity lemma for graphs.
In 2005, he introducedhttp://arxiv.org/abs/0710.3877 the notion of a quasirandom group.
More recently Gowers has worked on Ramsey theory in random graphs and random sets with David Conlon, and has turned his attentionhttp://gowers.wordpress.com/2013/10/24/what-i-did-in-my-summer-holidays/ to other problems such as the P versus NP problem. He has also developed an interest, in joint work with Mohan Ganesalingam,http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.4501 in automated problem solving.

==Honours==

In 1996 he received the Prize of the European Mathematical Society, and in 1998 the Fields Medal for research on functional analysis and combinatorics. In 1999 he became a Fellow of the Royal Society and in 2012 was knighted by the British monarch for services to mathematics[tpl]LondonGazette |issue=60173 |date=16 June 2012 |startpage=1 |supp=yes[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/@dg/@en/documents/digitalasset/dg_202133.pdf |title= Queens Birthday Honours list| accessdate= 16 June 2012[/tpl] He also sits on the selection committee for the Mathematics award, given under the auspices of the Shaw Prize.

==Popularization Work==

Gowers has written several works popularising mathematics, including Mathematics: A Very Short Introduction (2002),[tpl]cite book |last= Gowers |first= Timothy |title= Mathematics: A Very Short Introduction |publisher= Oxford Paperbacks |date=August 2002 |isbn= 978-0-19-285361-5 [/tpl] which describes modern mathematical research for the general reader. He was consulted about the 2005 film Proof, starring Gwyneth Paltrow and Anthony Hopkins. Recently, he has edited The Princeton Companion to Mathematics (2008), which traces the development of various branches and concepts of modern mathematics. For his work on this book, he won the 2011 Euler Book Prize of the Mathematical Association of America.January 2011 Prizes and Awards, American Mathematical Society, retrieved 1 February 2011.

==Blogging==

After asking on his blog whether "massively collaborative mathematics" was possible,[tpl]cite doi|10.1038/461879a[/tpl] he solicited comments on his blog from people who wanted to try to solve mathematical problems collaboratively.[tpl]Cite book|url=http://gowers.wordpress.com/2009/01/27/is-massively-collaborative-mathematics-possible/|title=Is massively collaborative mathematics possible?|last=Gowers|first=Timothy|publisher=Gowers's Weblog|date=27 January 2009|accessdate=30 March 2009[/tpl] The first problem in what is called the Polymath Project, Polymath1, was to find a new combinatorial proof to the density version of the Hales–Jewett theorem. After 7 weeks, Gowers wrote on his blog that the problem was "probably solved".[tpl]Cite web|url=http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/?p=584|title=The Polymath project: scope of participation|last=Nielsen|first=Michael|date=20 March 2009|accessdate=30 March 2009[/tpl]
In 2009, with Olof Sisask and Alex Frolkin, he invited people to post comments to his blog to contribute to a collection of methods of mathematical problem solving[tpl]cite web|url=http://gowers.wordpress.com/2009/04/16/tricki-now-fully-live/|title=Tricki now fully live|last=Gowers|first=Timothy|date=16 April 2009|accessdate=16 April 2009[/tpl] Contributors to this Wikipedia-style project, called Tricki.org, include Terence Tao and Ben Green[tpl]cite web|url=http://terrytao.wordpress.com/2009/04/16/tricki-now-live/|title=Tricki now live|last=Tao|first=Terence|publisher=What's new|date=16 April 2009|accessdate=16 April 2009[/tpl]

==Elsevier boycott==

In 2012, Gowers posted to his blog to call for a boycott of the publishing house Elsevier.[tpl]cite doi|10.1038/nature.2012.10010[/tpl][tpl]cite doi|10.1038/492335a[/tpl] A petition ensued, branded the Cost of Knowledge project, in which researchers commit to stop supporting Elsevier journals. Commenting on the petition in The Guardian, Alok Jha credited Gowers with starting an Academic Spring.[tpl]cite web |url= http://the-scientist.com/2012/02/07/occupy-elsevier/ |title=Occupy Elsevier? |first=Bob |last=Grant |work=The Scientist |date=7 February 2012 |accessdate=12 February 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/01/28/elseviers-publishing-model-might-be-about-to-go-up-in-smoke/ |title=Elsevier's Publishing Model Might be About to Go Up in Smoke |first=Tim |last=Worstall |work=forbes.com |date=28 January 2012 |accessdate=12 February 2012[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2012/apr/09/frustrated-blogpost-boycott-scientific-journals |title=Academic spring: how an angry maths blog sparked a scientific revolution|author=Alok Jha |journal=The Guardian |date=9 April 2012 [/tpl]

==Family relations and personal life==

His father is Patrick Gowers, a composer, and his great-grandfather was Sir Ernest Gowers, a British civil servant who was best known for guides to English usage and who was the son of Sir William Gowers, a neurologist. He has five children[tpl]cite web | url = http://gowers.wordpress.com/2010/11/30/status-update/ |title= Status update |publisher= Timothy Gowers |work= Gowers's Weblog |accessdate= 1 December 2010 [/tpl] and plays jazz piano.
In November 2012 he opted to undergo catheter ablation to treat a sporadic atrial fibrillation, after performing a mathematical risk-benefit analysis to decide whether to have the treatment.Mathematics meets real life, by Tim Gowers, 5 November 2012.
