Rubén Quevedo ru βen' ke βe' do (born January 5, 1979 in Valencia, Carabobo, Venezuela) is a former starting pitcher in Major League Baseball who played with the Chicago Cubs (2000) and Milwaukee Brewers (2001–03). He batted and threw right-handed.
Quevedo was signed as a non-drafted free agent by the Atlanta Braves in 1995 and was traded to the Cubs in 1999. He played with the Cubs in 2000 and was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers in 2001 for right-handed pitcher David Weathers. After three years with Milwaukee, Quevedo signed as a free agent with the Baltimore Orioles in 2004. He appeared in one game for Baltimore's AA affiliate, the Bowie Baysox.
Quevedo's most effective pitch was his changeup, which he threw with the same arm motion as his 89 MPH fastball. Meanwhile, his slider and curve were average. He allowed a significant number of fly balls, resulting in a high number of home runs allowed.
In a four-year MLB career, Quevedo posted a 14–30 record with 237 strikeouts and a 6.15 ERA in 326.1 innings. During his minor league career he was named an AAA all-star in 2001 while pitching for the Iowa Cubs.
