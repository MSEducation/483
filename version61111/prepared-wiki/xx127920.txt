The Mid Somerset League (currently sponsored by Trophies of Radstock) is a football competition based in England.

==History==

The League was originally founded in 1923 as a Senior League to provide extra fixtures and a fuller fixture list for teams in the Mid-Somerset area. It was open to all Senior sides throughout Somerset and sides as far apart as Odd Down and Minehead took part until the league ceased to run at the end of the 1946–47 season.  It reformed in 1950 as a Junior League and has continued ever since. John Hansford published a book in 2000 celebrating the first 50 years of the league's history.
