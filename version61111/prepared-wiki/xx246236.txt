==Veterans issues==

On September 17, 2009, Walsh was honored by the Salvation Army, where he cooked breakfast for the indigent every Thursday morning. Governor Freudenthal also proclaimed "Tom Walsh Day" in Wyoming. At the ceremony, Freudenthal said, "The truth is we're all grains of sand, and all of it disappears. Veterans and our deployed folks owe Tom a great debt of gratitude for all of his work on their behalf."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.trib.com/news/local/article_39535f62-42a8-5e14-9b02-dd0401431b6e.html|title=Salvation Army Bestows National Award: Community Honors Tom Walsh|publisher=trib.com|accessdate=January 7, 2010[/tpl] The governor recalled having sent Walsh, then a state legislator, on a fact-finding mission to Mississippi to determine if National Guard troops were being treated comparably to active duty military personnel: "We stirred the pot, caused a fair amount of trouble, and the end result was that we were able to ensure that our Guard folks got the same equipment, training, and degree of respect as the regular military", Freudenthal said.
Walsh made fourteen trips at his own expense to Southeast Asia to investigate reports of American servicemen being held there after the conclusion of the Vietnam War. He visited Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and Thailand. The POW/MIA flag flies on state buildings because of Walsh's legislative endeavors. Ironically, though he served in the Army and Army Reserves from 1959–1995, he was not called to active duty during the Vietnam War, a source of reportedly "great disappointment" to Walsh. Casper Fire Chief Mark Young called Walsh "a role model for all of us. We can learn compassion and that selfless attitude toward others from him." Victor Doughty of the Salvation Army's Denver office compared Walsh to the Salvation Army's founder, William Booth of England: "They lived their lives for God and country, for family and community."

Walsh's funeral service was held on January 4, 2010, at the chapel of the Oregon Trail State Veterans Cemetery in Evansville, a facility expanded through Walsh's legislative efforts.

He will indeed be missed."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.trib.com/news/opinion/editorial/article_5e90a4eb-f0a6-5c85-867c-a01cf5ec1122.html|title=Walsh: He Never Stopped Caring, January 5, 2010|publisher=trib.com|accessdate=January 7, 2010[/tpl] Casper Circuit Judge Mike Huber called Walsh "a giant who will be missed . . .  a measure of a man's worth is if he left this world a better place than he found it."
