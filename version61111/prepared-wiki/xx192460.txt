===Contributions in translational medicine===

==Significant Contributions to Large Clinical Trials, Global Health and Education==

As a result of this vocation and the clear social need to promote healthy habits, Dr. Fuster has created the SHE Foundation (Science, Health and Education) with the aim of improving total health in the population, especially young people.

===SHE Foundation===

“After a lifetime devoted to medicine and research, Valentin Fuster, MD, PhD is convinced that a change in the population’s lifestyle is the only way to avoid the spread of cardiovascular diseases, which are a real epidemic and the main cause of death in the world.
“Faced with this evidence and based on the experience gained over his career, Valentin Fuster, MD, PhD promoted the creation of SHE, a non-profit foundation that, while focused on basic and clinical research (Science), is aimed at promoting healthy habits (Health) through communication and Education of the population.
“With this goal, the SHE Foundation devotes its efforts to creating a frame of reference for what an education in health means and involves, stressing the acquirement of healthy habits from childhood in order to promote a world in which children, young people and adults have the ability to act positively towards their health.”"Mission and Vision",SHE Foundation retrieved March 13, 2013

===Sesame Workshop===

“Valentin Fuster, MD, PhD, Director of Mount Sinai Heart, is the inspiration for a Muppet doctor on  Barrio Sésamo: Monstrous Supersanos, the Spanish version of Sesame Street which debuted on Spain's Antena 3 just last month. The character named "Dr. Valentin Ruster" is helping to educate children to lead healthier lifestyles through exercise and healthy diet.  
“Dr. Fuster serves as an international advisor on Sesame Workshop's Global Health Initiative. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death around the world, and the goal of the initiative is to measure health improvements in children and build global partnerships to address their critical health issues. In fact, many studies show that childhood obesity leads to cardiovascular disease, thru an increase in cardiovascular disease risk factors including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, etc. Globally, in 2010, the number of overweight children under the age of five is estimated to be over 42 million. Sesame Workshop, which has been creating specific content on healthy habits for young children and their families for almost a decade, is now exploring opportunities with Dr. Fuster to extend its initiative in the United States.
“Dr. Fuster first joined forces with Sesame Workshop in 2006 to collaborate with Plaza Sesamo, the Latin American version of Sesame Street, to promote cardiovascular health and well-being in Colombia. The series there encourages children, parents, teachers, and caregivers in making informed nutritional and lifestyle decisions based on educational television content, community outreach, and evidence-based research.""Meet Dr. Valentin Ruster, Barrio Sesamo's Resident Muppet Doctor", Mount Sinai retrieved March 13, 2013

===FREEDOM Trial===

The FREEDOM trial, involving 150 institutions around the world is the largest funded study (NIH) in diabetes and is led by Dr. Fuster. It aimed at defining the optimal revascularization strategy for diabetic patients with multivessel coronary disease.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Fuster|first1=Valentin|last2= Dangas|first2= George|last3=Leon|first3=Martin B.|last4=Smith|first4=Craig|last5=Nesto|first5=Richard|last6=Buse|first6=John B.|last7=Cohen|first7=David J.|last8=Mahoney|first8=Elizabeth|last9=Sleeper|first9=Lynn|last10=King|first10=Spencer|last11=Domanski|first11=Michael|last12=McKinlay|first12=Sonja|last13=Fuster|first13=Valentin|year=2008|title=Design of the Future REvascularization Evaluation in patients with Diabetes mellitus: Optimal Management of Multivessel disease (FREEDOM) trial |journal=Am Heart J|volume=51 |issue=11 |pages=215–23 |doi= 10.1016/j.ahj.2007.10.012|pmid=18215589[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last1=Fuster|first1=Valentin|last2= Farkouh|first2= M.

===Polypill===

“The prevention of cardiovascular disease is hindered by several factors, including wide variability in the pattern of prescription among physicians, limited access to expensive drugs in emerging countries, and poor adherence to medication. The use of fixed dose drug combinations (polypill) has been recommended to improve accessibility and adherence to treatment. The CNIC, working in a private-public partnership with Ferrer International, has devised a fixed dose combination for secondary prevention. The CNIC-Ferrer polypill project is led by Valentín Fuster and is coordinated by the Translational Research Platform.”."Polypill/FOCUS" retrieved March 12, 2013

===Promoting Cardiovascular Health Worldwide===

This is a report recently released by the Institute of Medicine of The National Academy of Science, under the sponsorship of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. It was the result of deliberations of a 130member committee of experts chaired by Dr. Fuster and made available to all governments of the world in order to initiate and/or contribute to global health policy for chronic diseases.[tpl]cite journal |author=Fuster V |year=2011 |title=Promoting global cardiovascular health: moving forward |journal=N Circulation |volume= 123|issue=15 |pages=1671–8 |publisher= |doi= 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.009522|pmc= |pmid=21502585 |last2=Kelly |first2=B.

===Promoting Cardiovascular Health in Children===

This large scale initiative was carried out in Colombia and Spain under Dr. Fuster's leadership.  In Colombia, a randomized control was conducted to assess the impact in children three to six years of age (a time of behavioral development) of knowledge, attitude and habits regarding healthy eating and living an active lifestyle.  Children in the 40-hour intervention group showed a significantly larger increase in total score compared to that in the control group.  Three years later, children showed a further increase in total score. This finding will be published in the American Journal of Medicine.[tpl]cite journal |author=Fuster V |year=2012|title=Targeting preschool children to promote cardiovascular health: cluster randomized trial |journal=N Am J Med|volume= 126|issue=1|pages=27–35e3 |publisher= |doi= 10.1016/j.amjmed.2012.04.045|pmc= |pmid=23062403 |last2=Briceño|first2=German|last3=Farkouh|first3=Michael E.|last4=Vedanthan|first4=Rajesh|last5=Baxter|first5=Jorge|last6=Leal|first6=Martha|last7=Boffetta|first7=Paolo|last8=Woodward|first8=Mark|last9=Hunn|first9=Marilyn|last10=Dennis|first10=Rodolfo|last11=Fuster|first11=Valentin[/tpl]
The project's results have led to its expansion into about 25,000 children in Colombia and 20,000 children in Spain. In Spain's program, a new muppet character was recently created, inspired by Dr. Fuster. The character and his storyline are aimed at educating the children of "Barrio Sesame" about their hearts and bodies. The two country project will be long running in order to prove tat the interventions at such an early age have an impact on adult behavior. The participants will be evaluated each year.

===Promoting Cardiovascular Health in Adults of Middle-Income Countries===

Health in adults of middle-income countries can be reflected by a pilot project directed by Dr. Fuster on the island of Granada in the Caribbean, which has a population of 100,000 people.  He is assembling groups of 10 people, with a cardiovascular risk factor profile in an Alcoholics Anonymous format that uses peer pressure to help participants adopt healthier behaviors.[tpl]cite journal |author=Fuster V |year=2012|title=Cardiovascular Risk Surveillance to Develop a Nationwide Health Promotion Strategy: The Grenada Heart Project |journal=Global Heart|volume=7 |issue=2|pages=87–94 |publisher= |doi= |pmid=|pmc= |url=http://www.globalheart-journal.com/article/S2211-8160(12)00065-8/fulltext |accessdate=April 2, 2013[/tpl] This project is based on a successful risk factor profile pilot study carried out in nearly 3,000 Grenadians and on a recent, also successful, 10-person group study now finishing in a small town in Spain.

===Promoting Cardiovascular Health in Adults of Low-Income Countries===

Exemplified by an NIH grant awarded to Dr. Fuster as a principal investigator, the objective of this project is to address the issue of hypertension in Kenya. Hypertension is the leading global risk factor for mortality, and the global cost of sub-optimal blood pressure is estimated to be very high.  The project is demonstrating the effective impact of combining the "human factor" and "high technology." That is, a small portion of the 100,000 population of two town districts - Turbo and Mosoriot - are being trained through automatic machines, to take the blood pressure measurement of their respective neighborhood; the values are then registered and centralized by the use of "intelligent phones." Hopefully, such an approach will be transferable to other cities and countries.

===Research & Educational AHA-FORUM===

A national program developed by Dr. Fuster when he was President of the American Heart Association, having two objectives in mind: 1) To engage potential young researchers with volunteer senior investigators of the AHA, offering as such, free tutorship or mentorship; the success stories of this approach are many. 2) To reinvigorate the Junior-Senior investigator relationships through and annual meeting, the Saturday preceding the Scientific Sessions of the AHA; the yearly attendance counts in the hundreds.

===Clinical & Educational AHA "Fellows Society of the Greater New York"===

A regional program developed by Dr. Fuster when he was President of the AHA, New York Cit (2003-2004), the purpose being two-fold: 1)To educate fellows or young cardiologists in training in the greater New York area - including Connecticut, New Jersey, Long Island and the five Boroughs of NYC - about American Heart Association programs and activities. 2) To provide a forum for professional interaction, problem solving and discussion of professional issues among the cardiology fellows. Such a successful program, it is now being extended to other regions of the country including Chicago, Boston, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia.

===CNIC, or "Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares"===

The Spanish Public research institute supported by the Government and by a core group of the most important Spanish private companies (Pro-CNIC Foundation).[ref]

===High Risk Plaque (HRP) Bioimage Initiative===

With Dr. Fuster as a principal investigator, is aimed: a) to discover the role of multi-modality imaging (five technologies) in predicting subclinical disease, b) to identify the most cost-effective imaging technology for potential use in low and medium economy countries, and c) to evaluate whether subclinical isease can motivate the individual to modify his/her lifestyle. The project is successfully involving 6,000 Americans (Chicago and Florida areas) and 8,000 Europeans (Madrid and Zaragoza, Spain)[tpl]cite journal |last1=Fuster|first1=Valentin|last2= McCall|first2= Carol|last3=Sanz|first3=Javier|last4=Falk|first4=Erling|last5=Fuster|first5=Valentin|year=2010|title=The BioImage Study: Novel Approaches to Risk Assessment in the Primary Prevention of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease - Study Design and Objectives |journal=Am Heart J|volume=160|issue=1 |pages=49–57.e1 |doi= 10.1016/j.ahj.2010.02.021 |pmid=20598972[/tpl]
