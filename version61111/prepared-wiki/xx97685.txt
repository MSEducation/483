Aus-Rotten was an American anarcho-punk band active from 1991 to 2001 formed in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Part of the DIY underground, its members practiced and promoted a philosophy of anarchism and far-left sociopolitics. The band included lead vocalist Dave Trenga, vocalist/guitarist Eric Good, bassist Corey Lyons, and drummer Matt Garabedian. Spitboy singer Adrienne Droogas would often join the band in their later material. The band's name comes from the German word ausrotten, which translates to "extermination" or "eradication". 

==Music==

===Musical style===

According to their Myspace site, Aus-Rotten is influenced by Black Flag, Conflict, Crass, and Subhumans. The band has covered songs by Chumbawamba, Flux of Pink Indians, The Pist, Conflict, Crucifix and Upright Citizens.
Aus-Rotten went through roughly two stylistic periods during its existence; they originated as a bass-heavy sound hardcore punk band with low-fidelity production, before taking a hiatus and returning with a thicker sound.

===Lyrical themes===

Dave Trenga penned most of the band's lyrics. Most of their songs espoused an anarchist worldview, touching upon consumerism, LGBT rights, the Christian right, direct action, radical feminism, AIDS, immigration, and animal rights.
The band is perhaps most famous for its radical, quotable lyrics (e.g. "People are not expendable, government is", "As long as flags fly above us, no one's really free"), as well as for their strong anti-fascist stance which, according to the interview on the ABC No Rio documentary, got them threatened at least once.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2011[/tpl]

==Post-breakup==

Aus-Rotten went on a hiatus in the mid-'90s and during that time Dave formed Human Investment with Andy of Anti-Flag and Corey and Eric formed Doomsday Parade. Aus-Rotten broke up for good in early 2001 and members have gone on to form Caustic Christ[tpl]cite news | first=Scott | last=Mervis | coauthors= | title=Pittsburgh music got outta town in 2006 | date=2006-12-21 | publisher= | url =http://www.pittsburghpostgazette.com/pg/06355/747616-42.stm | work =Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | pages = | accessdate = 2007-08-29 [/tpl] and Behind Enemy Lines.[tpl]cite news |first= |last= |title= PITTSBURGH CALLING A capsule look at Pittsburgh bands making news.|work= Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|publisher= Pittsburgh Post Gazette Publishing Co. |pages= |page= WE. 17|date= 2007-02-01[/tpl]
