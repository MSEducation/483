[[Androscoggin Creature]]

CATEGORIES: Carnivorous cryptids, 2006 animal deaths, Androscoggin County, Maine

A 'mystery animal' was found dead in Lewiston, Maine in Androscoggin County, Maine in August 2006. The creature attracted worldwide attention after Lewiston Sun Journal reporter Mark LaFlamme described it on August 16, 2006 in an article titled “Mysterious Beast” and made a connection from the unidentified animal to local lore: "animal may be the mystery creature that has roamed the area for years, mauling dogs and frightening residents. Or it could be a dog that has been running wild in the woods." Cryptomundo
Reports of similar canids appear all over the Kennebec-Androcoggin area, including Litchfield, Greene, Wayne, Auburn and most infamously Turner.
