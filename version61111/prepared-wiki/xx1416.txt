The Cleveland Browns have been named the greatest football of all time by the National Football League.

The Cleveland Browns are a professional American football franchise based in Cleveland, Ohio. They are currently members of the North Division of the American Football Conference (AFC) of the National Football League (NFL).  Their current home venue is FirstEnergy Stadium (called Cleveland Browns Stadium from its opening in 1999 to 2012).[tpl]cite web|author=|url=http://www.cleveland.com/naymik/index.ssf/2013/03/browns_owner_jimmy_haslam_has.html |title=Browns owner Jimmy Haslam has spell over football fans and politicians alike: Mark Naymik |publisher=cleveland.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-02[/tpl]  Their administrative offices and training facilities are located in Berea, Ohio.  The Browns' official colors are burnt orange, seal brown, and white.  They are unique among the 32 member franchises of the National Football League in that they do not have a helmet logo.
The Cleveland Browns were founded in 1945 by businessman Arthur B. “Mickey” McBride as a charter member of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC), which began play the following year.  The Cleveland Browns went on to dominate the AAFC, compiling a 47–4–3 record in the league's four active seasons and winning its championship in each of them.Cleveland Browns-Team history  Following the 1949 season, the AAFC folded, and the Browns were one of three franchises which joined the National Football League (the others were the San Francisco 49ers and the original Baltimore Colts). The Browns won a championship in their inaugural NFL season, as well as in the 1954, 1955, and 1964 seasons.  From 1965 to 1995, they made the playoffs 14 times, but to date, have never won another championship and have never appeared in a Super Bowl.
On November 6, 1995, Art Modell, who had purchased the Browns in 1961, announced he was relocating the franchise to Baltimore, Maryland following the season.Art Modell's decision to move Cleveland Browns haunted him for rest of life | cleveland.com  But the rights to the Browns' intellectual property were kept in trust for a future expansion team which would assume them.  The Browns' operations were suspended for three seasons.
Since resuming operations in 1999, the Cleveland Browns have had very limited success: a 77–163 record through the 2013 season.  They have had two winning seasons:  a 9–7 record in 2002 and a 10–6 record in 2007, and qualified for the playoffs in the former as a wild card team.Cleveland Browns Team Encyclopedia – Pro-Football-Reference.com

==History==

===Founding and success in the AAFC (1944–49)===

The Browns origins date to 1944, when taxi-cab magnate Arthur B. "Mickey" McBride secured the rights to a Cleveland franchise in the newly formed All-America Football Conference.[tpl]cite news|title=City To Get New Pro Gridiron Club|newspaper=Cleveland Plain Dealer|date=September 3, 1944|agency=Associated Press|page=B1[/tpl] "Organization of the All-America Football Conference, a new coast-to-coast professional football league sponsored by 'men of millionaire incomes,' was announced officially today by Arch Ward, sports editor of the Chicago Tribune and prime organizer of the new loop which will begin operations next year. ... Owners of franchises, Ward disclosed, were ... Cleveland, Arthur McBride, taxi-cab magnate." The AAFC was to compete with the dominant National Football League once it began operations at the end of World War II, which had forced many professional teams to curtail activity, merge or go on hiatus as their players served in the U.S. military.[tpl]cite web|title=Football And America: World War II|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/history/general/war/worldwar2/page2.aspx|publisher=Pro Football Hall of Fame|accessdate=May 10, 2012[/tpl]
Early in 1945, McBride named 36-year-old Ohio State Buckeyes coach Paul Brown as the team's head coach and general manager and gave him a share in its profits. The move surprised and upset Buckeye fans, who had hoped he would resume his successful run at the school after the war.[tpl]cite news|last=Dietrich|first=John|title=Paul Brown Signs 5-Year Contract to Coach New Grid Team Here|newspaper=Cleveland Plain Dealer|date=February 9, 1945|page=A1|quote=In the most astonishing football story in many years, Lieut.

Also, Brown will technically become part owner, as he will share in the profits ... Though there has been a startling tendency for the leading coaches of the country to jump into the pro ranks, Brown, at the end of the war, was figured a sure thing either to return to Ohio State, where his 1942 team won a national championship, or take some lucrative college post elsewhere, possibly on the Pacific Coast.[/tpl] Brown, who had built an impressive record as coach of a Massillon, Ohio, high school team and brought the Buckeyes their first national championship, at the time was serving in the U.S. Navy and coached the football team at Great Lakes Naval Station near Chicago.[tpl]cite web|title=Paul Brown|url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=2147|publisher=Ohio History Central, the Ohio Historical Society|accessdate=May 11, 2012|quote=Washington High School in Massillon, Ohio Brown posted a record of eighty victories, eight losses, and two ties ...

The club – and the newspapers – are hoping for a short, snappy name that goes easily into headlines.[/tpl] The franchise then held a naming contest to publicize the team, promising a $1,000 war bond to the winner. In June 1945, a committee selected "Panthers" as the new team's name.[tpl]cite news|title=New Pro Grid Club Is Named Panthers|newspaper=Cleveland Plain Dealer|date=June 9, 1945|page=12|quote=Panthers will be the name of Cleveland's team in the new All-America Football Conference, and John J.

As the war began to wind down with Germany's surrender in May 1945, the team parlayed Brown's ties to college football and the military to build its roster. Negotiations with players were handled by John Brickels, the team's acting manager, as Brown was still in the Navy.[tpl]cite news|title=Brown Denies He Is Trying To Sign '42 Ohio Players|newspaper=Cleveland Plain Dealer|date=May 5, 1945|agency=United Press|location=Chicago|page=11|quote=Brown added that since he is in naval service all Cleveland contract matters are being handled by John Brickels, acting manager of the team ...

The Browns had few worthy rivals among the AAFC's eight teams, but the New York Yankees and San Francisco 49ers were their closest competition.

The story is one of defensive play – the champions' defense – as it so often is in any collision between elevens that have proven themselves so powerful offensively.[/tpl]
While the Browns excelled on defense, Cleveland's winning ways were driven by an offense that employed Brown's version of the T formation, which emphasized speed, timing and execution over set plays.[tpl]cite news|title=Brown Explains All 'Secrets' Of His T Formation|newspaper=Cleveland Plain Dealer|date=May 4, 1946|location=Cleveland, Ohio|page=16|quote=Dwelling upon his version of the T formation, which he developed in his two years as coach of the Great Lakes Bluejackets, Brown explained the workings of every position on the team.

The Cleveland area showered support on the Browns from the outset. Brown's celebrity was cresting in the late 1940s, thanks to his success with teams at the high school, college and now professional levels.  Meanwhile, the Browns unexpectedly had Cleveland to themselves; the NFL's Cleveland Rams, who had continually lost money despite winning the 1945 NFL championship, moved to Los Angeles after that season.[tpl]cite news|title=Rams, Pro Grid Champions, Will Move to Los Angeles|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wXcbAAAAIBAJ&sjid=vUwEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6119,3551810&dq=rams+move+to+los+angeles&hl=en|accessdate=May 11, 2012|newspaper=Pittsburgh Press|date=January 13, 1946|agency=United Press|location=New York|page=37|quote=The National Football League today gave the Cleveland Rams, pro champions, permission to transfer their franchise to Los Angeles ...

The Browns, however, became victims of their own success. Their dominance exposed a lack of balance among AAFC teams, which the league tried to correct by sending Browns players including quarterback Y.A. Tittle to the Baltimore Colts in 1948.[tpl]cite news|title=Browns Send 2 Backs To Colts|newspaper=Cleveland Plain Dealer|date=April 15, 1948|page=23|quote=Jake Leicht said he received a letter from Commissioner Jonas Ingram of the All-America Conference stating that he, Y.A. Tittle and Charley O'Rourke would go to Baltimore in another move to strengthen the Colts.[/tpl] Attendance at Browns games fell in later years as fans lost interest in lopsided victories.

Before the 1958 season, Cleveland was again in search of a quarterback. O'Connell had played well in the previous two seasons – he led the league in passing in 1957 – but lacked the stature and durability Paul Brown wanted in a starter. He stood at just 5 feet, 10 inches tall and was hurt numerous times, including a sprained ankle and a broken bone in his leg that kept him out of the last two games of the 1957 regular season. Due in part to these injuries, O'Connell retired early in 1958 to take a coaching job in Illinois, and Milt Plum was named the starter.[tpl]cite news|last=Heaton|first=Chuck|title=Plum Moves Up As O'Connell Quits|newspaper=Cleveland Plain Dealer|date=January 22, 1958|page=25|quote=Retirement of Tommy O'Connell from the Cleveland Browns yesterday to take the position of backfield coach at Illinois puts the quarterbacking squarely on the broad shoulders of Milt Plum ...

As the team built up a 9–3 regular-season record, Brown in 1958 ran for 1,527 yards – almost twice as much as any other back and a league record at the time.[tpl]cite web|title=1958 NFL Leaders and Leaderboards|url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/1958/leaders.htm|publisher=Pro-Football-Reference.com|accessdate=May 16, 2012[/tpl]

Cleveland's campaigns in 1959 and 1960 were noteworthy for Brown's league-leading rushing totals in both seasons.[tpl]cite news|last=Heaton|first=Chuck|title=Browns' 14 in 4th Nip Eagles, 28–21|newspaper=Cleveland Plain Dealer|date=December 14, 1959|page=35|quote=Jim Brown ... for the third straight year the National League rushing champion with 1,329 yards ...[/tpl] Plum became established as the starting quarterback, bringing a measure of stability to the squad not seen since Graham's retirement. The Penn State product led the team to a 7–5 record in 1959, and one year later, he turned in one of the greatest statistical seasons at his position in NFL history. Nonetheless, in 1960, the Browns dropped three games by a total of 10 points, finished with an 8–3–1 record and out of the playoffs for the second consecutive season.[tpl]cite web|title=1959 Cleveland Browns Statistics & Players|url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/cle/1959.htm|publisher=Pro-Football-Reference.com|accessdate=May 16, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=1960 Cleveland Browns Statistics & Players|url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/cle/1960.htm|publisher=Pro-Football-Reference.com|accessdate=May 16, 2012[/tpl]
Art Modell, a 35-year-old advertising executive from Brooklyn, purchased the team in 1961 from a group of shareholders led by National Insurance Company. The beginnings of a power struggle between Paul Brown and Art Modell took its toll. Journalist D.L. Stewart recounted in Jeff Miller's book on the AFL, Going Long, "As you well can imagine, Jimmy Brown and Paul were not thick. The buzz was that Jimmy had Modell working for him, and Paul took exception to that."[tpl]cite book |last=Miller|first=Jeff|title=Going Long|publisher=Contemporary Books, McGraw Hill| page=268|year=2003 |location=New York|isbn=0-07-141849-0[/tpl] The season otherwise was typical: a fifth consecutive league-leading season from Jim Brown and a half-decent performance in the standings, but again, at 8–5–1, they were two games out of a berth in the championship.
After a 7–6–1 record in 1962, Modell fired Paul Brown on January 9, 1963, and replaced him one week later with longtime assistant Blanton Collier. Many of the Browns' younger players, such as Jim Brown and quarterback Frank Ryan, had chafed under Brown's autocratic coaching style; in contrast, Collier ran the club with a much looser grip. He installed a much more open offense and allowed Ryan to call his own plays. In Collier's first season, the Browns won their first six games, but a damaging midseason slump ended up costing them the Eastern Division title as they finished one game back with a 10–4 mark. On an individual level, Jim Brown won Most Valuable Player accolades with a record 1,863 yards rushing.

===Continued success under Blanton Collier (1965–70)===

In 1964, the Browns went 10–3–1 and reached their first title game in seven years. They throttled the heavily favored Baltimore Colts 27–0, with receiver Gary Collins catching three touchdown passes to earn the MVP award. Currently, this is the most recent major league sports championship for the city of Cleveland.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.clevelandbrowns.com/team/history/results/1964_stats.php |title=Cleveland Browns |publisher=Clevelandbrowns.com |date= |accessdate=2008-12-13[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] The following year, the Browns again reached the title game, but came up short against the Green Bay Packers.
That 1965 title game would mark the final game in a Browns uniform for Jim Brown. During the start of the subsequent training camp, Brown was still in England filming scenes for The Dirty Dozen due to production delays. On July 14, Brown announced his retirement from football to concentrate on his fledgling acting career. The Browns were able to blunt the effect of Brown's departure with the emergence of third-year running back Leroy Kelly, who would rush for more than 1,000 yards in each of the next three seasons, leading the league during the latter two years.
After missing out on the postseason in 1966, the Browns rebounded with a 9–5 season the following year. However, they were quickly eliminated by the Dallas Cowboys, 52–14 in the first round of the playoffs. In each of the next two seasons, the Browns took revenge on the Cowboys in the playoffs, winning by scores of 30–21 and 38–14, respectively. However, both victories were in turn followed by stinging defeats, preventing them from reaching the Super Bowl.
In May 1969, the Browns, along with the Pittsburgh Steelers and Baltimore Colts, agreed to move in 1970 to the post-merger American Football Conference. Inconsistent performances throughout the 1970 campaign proved to be fatal to postseason hopes as the team finished one game behind Paul Brown's upstart Cincinnati Bengals with a 7–7 record. Late in the 1970 season, Collier officially announced his retirement due to increased hearing problems, and was replaced by the team's offensive coordinator Nick Skorich.

===The "Kardiac Kids" (1971–84)===

Skorich led the Browns to a division title in [tpl]nfly|1971[/tpl] and a wild-card berth in [tpl]nfly|1972[/tpl]. In the latter year, the Browns battled the undefeated Miami Dolphins before losing 20–14, as the Dolphins went on to capture their first Super Bowl title with a spotless 17–0 mark. In [tpl]nfly|1973[/tpl], the Browns were handicapped by a struggling offense, but remained in contention until the closing weeks of the season, finishing with a 7–5–2 record.
However, the team's era of success came to a crashing halt as it dropped to 4–10 in 1974. Neither quarterback Mike Phipps nor rookie Brian Sipe was effective behind center; they threw 24 combined interceptions to only 10 touchdowns. The Browns allowed 344 points, most in the league. It was only the second losing season in franchise history, and it cost Skorich his job.
Assistant coach Forrest Gregg took over in [tpl]nfly|1975[/tpl], but the Browns stumbled out of the gate with an 0–9 start that finally came to an end on November 23 in a 35–23 comeback victory over the Cincinnati Bengals. Three weeks later, third-year running back Greg Pruitt paced the team with 214 yards rushing in a rout over the Kansas City Chiefs, helping the team finish the season 3–11.
Cleveland showed marked improvement with a 9–5 record in [tpl]nfly|1976[/tpl] as Brian Sipe firmly took control at quarterback. Sipe had been inserted into the lineup after a Phipps injury in the season-opening win against the New York Jets on September 12. After a 1–3 start brought visions of another disastrous year, the Browns jolted the two-time defending Super Bowl champion Steelers with an 18–16 victory on October 10. Third-string quarterback Dave Mays helped lead the team to that victory, while defensive end Joe "Turkey" Jones's pile-driving sack of Pittsburgh quarterback Terry Bradshaw fueled the heated rivalry between the two teams. That win was the first of eight in the next nine weeks, helping put the Browns in contention for the AFC playoffs. The Browns rattled off wins over the Atlanta Falcons, San Diego Chargers, before a 21–6 loss to their cross-state rivals, the Paul Brown-owned Cincinnati Bengals. The Browns rebounded and picked up wins over the Houston Oilers, Philadelphia Eagles, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Miami Dolphins and a second victory over Houston, giving the Browns a series sweep for the season. A 39–14 blow out loss to the Kansas City Chiefs in the regular season finale cost them a share of the division title, but running back Pruitt continued his outstanding play by rushing for exactly 1,000 yards, his second-straight four-digit season. Brian Sipe finished the season completing 178 passes in 312 attempts, for 2,113 yards. He also had 17 touchdown passes versus 14 interceptions.
The Browns continued to roll in the first half of the 1977 season, but an injury to Sipe by Steelers linebacker Jack Lambert on November 13 proved to be disastrous. Cleveland won only one of their last five games to finish at 6–8, a collapse that led to Forrest Gregg's dismissal before the final game of the season. Dick Modzelewski served as interim coach in the team's 20–19 loss to the Seattle Seahawks.
On December 27, 1977, Sam Rutigliano was named head coach, and he aided a healthy Sipe in throwing 21 touchdowns and garnering 2,900 yards during the 1978 NFL season. Greg Pruitt and Mike Pruitt (no relation) led a rushing attack that gained almost 2,500 yards, but problems with the team's dismal pass defense resulted in the Browns finishing 8–8 on the year.
The 1979 campaign started with four consecutive wins, three of which were in the final minute or overtime. Four more games were won by less than a touchdown. This penchant for playing close games would later earn them the nickname "Kardiac Kids". Sipe threw 28 touchdown passes, tying him with Steve Grogan of New England for most in the league, but his 26 interceptions were the worst in the league. Mike Pruitt had a Pro Bowl season with his 1,294 rushing yards, while the defense was still shaky, ranking near the bottom in rushing defense. The team finished 9–7, behind division rivals Houston and Pittsburgh in a tough AFC Central.
The 1980 season is still fondly remembered by Browns fans. After going 3–3 in the first six games, the Browns won three straight games with fourth-quarter comebacks, and stopped a late comeback by the Baltimore Colts to win a fourth. The Browns won two more games in that fashion by the end of the season, and even lost a game to the Minnesota Vikings on the last play when a Hail Mary pass was tipped into the waiting hands of Ahmad Rashad. Sipe passed for 4,000 yards and 30 touchdowns with only 14 interceptions (enough for him to be named the NFL MVP), behind an offensive line that sent three members to the Pro Bowl: Doug Dieken, Tom DeLeone and Joe DeLamielleure. The "Kardiac Kids" name stuck. A fourth-quarter field goal by Don Cockroft in the final game against the Bengals helped the Browns capture the division with an 11–5 mark, with the Oakland Raiders their opponent in the team's first playoff game in eight years. However, a heartbreaking end to this dramatic season came in the closing seconds when Rutigliano called what became known as "Red Right 88" and had Sipe pass toward the end zone, only to watch Oakland's Mike Davis intercept the ball. The Raiders went on to win the Super Bowl, and "Red Right 88" has numbered among the list of Cleveland sports curses ever since.
If 1980 was a dream season, then [tpl]nfly|1981[/tpl] was a nightmare. Sipe threw only 17 touchdowns while being picked off 25 times. The Browns went 5–11, and few of their games were particularly close. Tight end Ozzie Newsome, their only Pro Bowler, had 1,004 yards receiving for six touchdowns.
In [tpl]nfly|1982[/tpl] Sipe split quarterbacking duties with Paul McDonald, and both put up similar numbers. The Browns had little success rushing or defending against it, finishing in the bottom five teams in both yardage categories. Despite going 4–5, Cleveland was able to make the playoffs due to an expanded playoff system in the strike-shortened year. They were matched up again with the Raiders in the playoffs, but were easily defeated 27–10.
Sipe and the Browns got some of their spark back in [tpl]nfly|1983[/tpl]. Sipe had 26 touchdown passes and 3,566 yards, while Mike Pruitt ran for 10 scores on 1,184 yards. Cleveland even won two games in overtime and another in the fourth quarter. A fourth-quarter loss to the Oilers in their second-to-last game dashed their playoff hopes. At 9–7 the Browns finished one game behind the Steelers, and lost out on a wild-card spot due to a tiebreaker.
1984 was a rebuilding year. Brian Sipe defected to the upstart United States Football League after the 1983 season, and Paul McDonald was named the starting quarterback. Mike Pruitt missed much of the season and later ended up with the Buffalo Bills. Coach Sam Rutigliano lost his job after a 1–7 start as Marty Schottenheimer took over. The Browns coasted to a 5–11 record.

===Bernie Kosar and the Broncos rivalry (1985–90)===

In 1985, the Browns selected University of Miami quarterback Bernie Kosar in the Supplemental Draft. As a rookie, Kosar learned through trial by fire as he took over for Gary Danielson midway through the 1985 season. Progressing a bit more each Sunday, the young quarterback helped turn the struggling season around, as the Browns won four of the ten games Kosar started. Two young rushers, Earnest Byner and Kevin Mack, played a large part in the team's success as well; each ran for 1,000+ yards. The Browns' 8–8 record gave the team the top spot in a weak AFC Central, and they looked poised to shock the heavily favored Miami Dolphins in the Divisional Playoff game with a 21–3 lead at halftime. It took Dan Marino's spirited second-half comeback to win the game for Miami 24–21. While the Browns faithful may have felt the initial sting of disappointment, there was tremendous upside in the loss: Schottenheimer's team, with Kosar at quarterback, reached the playoffs each of the next five seasons, advancing to the AFC Championship Game in three of those years.
The Browns broke into the ranks of the NFL's elite—particularly on defense—with a 12–4 showing in [tpl]nfly|1986[/tpl]. Behind Kosar's 3,854 yards passing and one of the league's stingiest defenses featuring five Pro Bowlers (Chip Banks, Hanford Dixon, Bob Golic, Clay Matthews and Frank Minnifield), the Browns dominated the AFC Central with the best record in the AFC and clinched home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. In the Divisional Playoffs, the Browns needed some serious heroics (and a bit of luck) to overcome the New York Jets. The Jets were leading 20–10 with less than four minutes to play, with the Browns in a dire 3rd and 24 situation. As fate would have it, Mark Gastineau was called for roughing the passer, which gave Cleveland a first down. The drive ended with Kevin Mack running into the end zone for a touchdown. After going three-and-out the Jets went back on defense, but allowed the rejuvenated Browns to again drive the ball deep into their end of the field. With 11 seconds remaining in regulation, Mark Moseley kicked a field goal to tie the game. In the first of two ensuing overtime periods, Moseley missed his next attempt, but later redeemed himself by ending what had become the second longest game in NFL history, a 23–20 victory for the Browns.
The 1986 AFC Championship Game saw the Denver Broncos arrive in the windswept, hostile confines of Cleveland Municipal Stadium. No one knew at the time, but the Broncos would become Cleveland's nemesis of the Kosar era, having only lost once to the Browns in a span that still continues to this day. As with the Divisional Playoffs of the previous week, the AFC title game would also prove to be an overtime heart-stopper. But this time, it was John Elway and the Broncos who came away the victors. Pinned in on the Denver two-yard line with 5:11 left to play and the wind in his face, Elway embarked on his now-famous 98-yard march downfield, which is now known by NFL historians as simply "The Drive." With 34 seconds on the clock, Elway's 5-yard touchdown pass to Mark Jackson tied the game at 20 apiece. The 79,973 Browns fans in attendance were silenced when Rich Karlis' field goal attempt just made it inside the left upright to win the game 23–20 for Denver early into overtime.
The Browns' success was replicated in [tpl]nfly|1987[/tpl], with 22 touchdown passes and 3,000 yards for Kosar and eight Pro Bowlers (Kosar, Mack, Dixon, Golic, Minnifield, linebacker Clay Matthews, wide receiver Gerald McNeil, and offensive lineman Cody Risien). Cleveland won another AFC Central crown with a 10–5 record and easily defeated the Indianapolis Colts 38–21 in the divisional playoff to set up a rematch with the Broncos in the AFC Championship Game, this time in Denver. With the score 21–3 in favor of the Broncos at halftime, Kosar led a third-quarter comeback with two touchdowns by Earnest Byner and another by Reggie Langhorne. Early in the fourth quarter, Webster Slaughter's 4-yard touchdown catch tied the game at 31–31. The Broncos regained the lead with a 20-yard Sammy Winder touchdown with less than five minutes to go, setting the stage for another Browns comeback ... or so they thought. Kosar drove the Browns to the Broncos' 8-yard line with 1:12 to go, and handed off to Byner. Just when it looked like he had an open route to the end zone, Broncos defensive back Jeremiah Castille stripped him of the ball. The Broncos recovered what became known as "The Fumble". After taking an intentional safety, the Broncos had shocked the Browns again, 38–33.
Injuries to Kosar and two of his backups sidelined them for much of the [tpl]nfly|1988[/tpl] season, but the Browns still finished 10–6. A final-week comeback victory in a snowstorm at Cleveland Municipal Stadium over the Houston Oilers clinched them a wild-card playoff spot and a home game rematch against the Oilers in the first round. After Mike Pagel, in for an injured Don Strock (the recently signed ex-Dolphins quarterback), threw a touchdown pass to Webster Slaughter late in the fourth quarter to pull the Browns within a point at 24–23, the Browns had three chances to recover an onside kick (due to penalties), but the Oilers recovered and stopped the Cleveland comeback.
Schottenheimer left the Browns by mutual agreement with Modell shortly after the loss to the Oilers. Modell was tired of losing in the playoffs, and Schottenheimer was tired of what he perceived as Modell's interference with his coaching personnel and game strategy. The Kansas City Chiefs quickly hired Schottenheimer for the [tpl]nfly|1989[/tpl] season. Bud Carson was his replacement in Cleveland, but his tenure was short—only one and a half years.
The 1989 season opened with the Browns defeating the rival Pittsburgh Steelers at Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh 51–0, which as of 2010 remains the most lopsided game in the rivalry as well as the all-time worst loss for the Steelers. The rest of the season was headlined by Slaughter's Pro Bowl-worthy 1,236 yards receiving, and was a success at 7–3 until a 10–10 tie with Schottenheimer's Chiefs in November led to a 3-game losing streak. Two comeback wins over the Minnesota Vikings and Houston Oilers in the season's final two weeks kept them in the playoff race. The tie ended up being the Browns' saving grace, with their 9–6–1 record winning them the AFC Central title and first-round bye over the Oilers and Pittsburgh Steelers at 9–7. The Browns narrowly survived a scare from the Buffalo Bills in their divisional playoff game, when Scott Norwood missed an extra point that would have pulled Buffalo within three points and, later, when Jim Kelly's desperation pass to the end zone on the final play of the game was intercepted by Clay Matthews.
Cleveland's 34–30 win set them up for another tilt with the Broncos in Denver for the AFC Championship. While their two previous matchups went down to the wire, the result of this particular game was never in doubt. The Broncos led from start to finish, and a long Elway touchdown pass to Sammy Winder put the game away in the fourth quarter. Denver easily won 37–21.
In [tpl]nfly|1990[/tpl] things began to unravel. Kosar threw more interceptions (15) than touchdowns (10) for the first time in his career; and the team finished last in the league in rushing offense, and near the bottom in rushing defense. Carson was fired after a 2–7 start, and the team finished 3–13, second-worst in the league. After the season Bill Belichick, defensive coordinator of the then-Super Bowl champion New York Giants, was named head coach.

===Bill Belichick and Modell's move (1991–95)===

The Browns saw only a slight improvement under Belichick in [tpl]nfly|1991[/tpl], finishing 6–10. Kosar was markedly better, with a ratio of 18 touchdowns to 9 interceptions, and Leroy Hoard had a breakout season. The next season, with Kosar sitting out much of the season and Mike Tomczak in under center, Cleveland was in the thick of the AFC Central race before dropping their final three games to finish 7–9.
The [tpl]nfly|1993[/tpl] season saw Belichick make the controversial decision of cutting Kosar while back-up Vinny Testaverde, who had been signed from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, was injured. The Browns were in first place at the time and the Browns faltered as Todd Philcox became the starter. Kosar was signed by the Dallas Cowboys and a few days later led the Cowboys to a win in place of an injured Troy Aikman. Kosar would win a ring that season as the Cowboys won the Super Bowl with a healthy Aikman. Cleveland won only two of its final nine games finishing 7–9 once again.
Cleveland managed to right the ship in [tpl]nfly|1994[/tpl], although the quarterback situation hadn't quite improved. A solid defense led the league for fewest yards allowed per attempt, sending four players (Rob Burnett, Pepper Johnson, Michael Dean Perry, and Eric Turner) to the Pro Bowl. The Browns finished 11–5, making the playoffs for the first time in four seasons. In the AFC Wild Card game against the New England Patriots, the Browns' defense picked off Drew Bledsoe three times, with Testaverde completing two-thirds of his passes, to win 20–13. Arch-rival Pittsburgh ended the Browns' season the following week, however, with a 29–9 blowout in the AFC Divisional game.
Modell announced on November 6, 1995, that he had signed a deal to relocate the Browns to Baltimore in [tpl]nfly|1996[/tpl]—a move which would return the NFL to Baltimore for the first time since the Colts relocated to Indianapolis after the 1983 season. The very next day, on November 7, 1995, Cleveland voters overwhelmingly approved an issue that had been placed on the ballot at Modell's request, before he made his decision to move the franchise, which provided $175 million in tax dollars to refurbish the outmoded and declining Cleveland Municipal Stadium.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/12/sports/pro-football-a-city-fights-to-save-the-browns.html?ref=art_modell&pagewanted=all|title=A City Fights To Save The Browns|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2010-08-07|date=November 12, 1995|first=Richard|last=Sandomir[/tpl] Modell's plan was later scrapped and taxpayers ultimately paid close to $300 million to demolish the old stadium and construct a new stadium for the Browns on the site of Municipal Stadium.
Browns fans reacted angrily to the news. Over 100 lawsuits were filed by fans, the city of Cleveland, and a host of others. Congress held hearings on the matter. Actor/comedian Drew Carey returned to his hometown of Cleveland on November 26, 1995, to host "Fan Jam" in protest of the proposed move. A protest was held in Pittsburgh during the Browns' game there—one of the few instances that Steelers fans and Browns fans were supporting each other, as fans in Pittsburgh felt that Modell was robbing their team of their rivalry with the Browns. Virtually all of the team's sponsors immediately pulled their support, leaving Municipal Stadium devoid of advertising during the team's final weeks.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl]
The [tpl]nfly|1995[/tpl] season was a disaster on the field as well. After starting 3–1, the Browns lost 3 straight before the news broke about the team's impending move cut the legs out from under the team. They finished 5–11, including a 1–8 record in the nine games after the announcement. Fans in the Dawg Pound became so unruly during their final home game against the Cincinnati Bengals that moving towards that end zone had to be moved to the opposite end of the field. Rows of empty seats were torn from the stadium and thrown on the field. Stalls and sinks in the restrooms were torn from the walls. Several fans set fires in the stands, especially in the "Dawg Pound" section, and assaulted security officials and police officers who tried to quell the growing fires.[tpl]cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/news/2001/12/16/jaguars_browns_ap/|title=Fans get unruly about overturned call in final minute|date=December 2001|accessdate=2011-12-01|work=CNN[/tpl] The Browns won their final home game.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/cle/1995.htm|title=1995 Cleveland Browns Statistics & Players|publisher=Pro-Football-Reference.com|accessdate=2010-12-30[/tpl] Belichick was fired by Modell via telephone in February 1996, exactly 1 week after the switch to Baltimore was made official. The new team became the Baltimore Ravens.

===Inactivity (1996–99)===

After extensive talks between the NFL, the Browns, and officials of the two cities, Cleveland accepted a legal settlement that would keep the Browns legacy in Cleveland.Morgan, Jon. Deal clears NFL path to Baltimore, The Baltimore Sun, February 9, 1996. In February 1996, the NFL announced that the Browns would be 'deactivated' for three years, and that a new stadium would be built for a new Browns team, as either an expansion team or a team moved from another city, that would begin play in 1999. Modell would in turn be granted a new franchise, the NFL's 31st, for Baltimore, the Baltimore Ravens, retaining the current contracts of players and personnel. The Browns ceased play at the end of the 1995 season when Modell relocated the organization to Baltimore. The Browns franchise was then reactivated, and its roster restocked via an expansion draft before resuming play in the 1999 season. There would be a new team, but the Browns' name, colors, history, records, awards and archives would all remain in Cleveland.  The move fueled a proliferation of 12 new stadiums throughout the NFL. Using the NFL–City of Cleveland agreement's promise to supply a team to Cleveland by 1999, several NFL franchises used the threat of relocation to coerce their respective cities to build new stadiums with public funds.[tpl]Cite journal|first=Katherine C.|last=Leone|title=No Team, No Peace: Franchise Free Agency in the National Football League|journal=Columbia Law Review|volume=97|issue=2|pages=473–523|year=1997|doi=10.2307/1123368|ref=harv [/tpl]
Cleveland NFL Football LLC (Cleveland Browns Trust) was formed by the NFL. President of the Trust was Bill Futterer, and NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue was the Trustee. The Trust represented the NFL in the stadium design and construction, managed the sale of suites and club seats, and sold Permanent Seat Licenses and season tickets. Additionally, the Trust reorganized the Browns Backers fan clubs across the United States, resumed coaches shows on television and radio throughout the state of Ohio, and conducted a dramatic one-year countdown celebration that incorporated the first live Internet broadcast in NFL history. The Trust operated its campaign under a Countdown to '99 theme, utilizing Hall of Famers such as Lou Groza and Jim Brown extensively, and sold nearly 53,000 season tickets—a team record in 1998. It remains the only time in professional American football history that a league operated a team "in absentia" in order to preserve the history of the franchise and to build value in that franchise for the future owner. The NFL sold the Browns as an expansion team in 1998 to former Browns minority owner Al Lerner. The purchase price was a then- North American record $530 million, more than double any previous selling price for a pro sports team.[tpl]cite news|last=Sandomir|first=Richard|title=Lerner Wins Browns for $530 Million|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/09/sports/pro-football-lerner-wins-browns-for-530-million.html?pagewanted=1|accessdate=May 9, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 9, 1998[/tpl] Commissioner Tagliabue announced that the Browns would be an expansion team, rather than a relocated team, at the owners meeting in March 1998.[tpl]harvnb|Henkel|2005|p=111[/tpl]
Officially, the National Football League, Pro Football Hall of Fame, Cleveland Browns and Baltimore Ravens all recognize the current Browns team as a continuation of the team founded in 1946. The Ravens 1998 Fan and Media Guide referred to longtime staffers as having worked for "The Modell organization" before the Ravens were created in 1996.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.citypaper.com/columns/story.asp?id=8519|title=Baltimore City Paper – Columns:8 Upper|publisher=Citypaper.com|date=September 23, 1998|accessdate=2009-12-02[/tpl]

===Lerner family ownership (1999–2012)===

Cleveland returned to the NFL in 1999 with high hopes and expectations, featuring deep-pocketed ownership in Al Lerner. The team's football operations appeared to be in solid hands in the form of president and CEO Carmen Policy and general manager Dwight Clark, both of whom had come from the San Francisco 49ers. Chris Palmer, former offensive coordinator of the Jacksonville Jaguars, was hired as head coach. The team was rebuilt from a special expansion draft and the regular NFL draft; the latter included the number one selection, QB Tim Couch.
It was to be expected that the resurrected Browns would struggle at first, as for all practical purposes they were an expansion team. However, the Browns' first two seasons were awful even by expansion standards. 1999 started with a home game against the rival Pittsburgh Steelers on ESPN Sunday Night Football, with Cleveland native Drew Carey participating in the opening-game coin toss. However, it would be the only highlight for the Browns that night. The Steelers got revenge on the 51–0 loss to the Browns ten years earlier (though Steelers All-Pro center Dermontti Dawson was the only player remaining from either team from the 1989 game) by beating the Browns 43–0 in their first game back. Though it is not the team's worst loss ever, it is their second worst loss since the team returned to the NFL, behind a 48–0 loss to Jacksonville on December 3, 2000.
The 1999 season saw the Browns start 0–7 en route to a 2–14 finish, the worst in franchise history. [tpl]nfly|2000[/tpl] was slightly better, with a 3–13 finish—the lone highlight being the Browns' first home win in five years, against the Steelers on September 17. Compounding the fans' frustration was the Baltimore Ravens' win over the New York Giants in Super Bowl XXXV that season. Though the Ravens were considered a "new franchise", the team still had players such as Matt Stover and Rob Burnett who had played for the Browns before the Modell move. Palmer was fired after the season and replaced by University of Miami coach Butch Davis.
Under Davis the Browns became more competitive, finishing 7–9 in [tpl]nfly|2001[/tpl], three games out of the playoffs. With the team apparently close to being a contender again, Clark was forced to resign after the season, and Davis was named general manager as well as coach. In [tpl]nfly|2002[/tpl], the Browns finished 9–7, and due to multiple tiebreakers they made the playoffs for the first time since 1994. Facing Pittsburgh in the first round, the Browns led 33–21 with five minutes to go, but ultimately lost 36–33. Their largest lead in the game was 17 points—they led 24–7 in the third quarter; after that point the Steelers outscored them 29–9.  Also during the 2002 season, owner Al Lerner died on October 2, and ownership then was taken over by his son Randy.
The Browns could not sustain the momentum from '02, finishing with double-digit losing records in [tpl]nfly|2003[/tpl], [tpl]nfly|2004[/tpl], [tpl]nfly|2005[/tpl], and [tpl]nfly|2006[/tpl]. Davis resigned November 30, 2004 with the team shouldering a 3–8 record; Policy had resigned earlier in the year. Offensive Coordinator Terry Robiskie was named interim head coach for the remainder of the 2004 season.
Before the 2005 season began, Romeo Crennel, a one-time Browns assistant coach under Chris Palmer and, at the time, defensive coordinator for the New England Patriots, was named the Browns head coach. The team also hired Phil Savage – who had been Ravens VP/GM Ozzie Newsome's top aide – as a new general manager. But despite the changes, the 2005 and 2006 seasons saw the Browns losing trend continue, with records of 6–10 and 4–12 respectively. Prior to the Browns' final game of the 2005 NFL season, ESPN reported that team president John Collins was going to fire Savage. However, the resulting uproar from fans and local media was strong, and on January 3, 2006 Collins resigned instead. The role of team "President and CEO" was vacated until 2008, with owner Randy Lerner filling in as de facto CEO until Michael Keenan was hired.
In the 2007 season, the team saw a remarkable turnaround on the field. After opening the season with a 34–7 defeat by the Pittsburgh Steelers, the Browns traded starting quarterback Charlie Frye to the Seattle Seahawks, with backup Derek Anderson assuming the starting role. In his first start, Anderson led the Browns to a 51–45 win over the Cincinnati Bengals, tying the franchise record of five touchdown passes in a single game. The Browns finished the 2007 season a surprising 10–6, but missed the playoffs due to a tie-breaker. Nevertheless, the record was the team's best since 1994. Six players earned Pro Bowl recognition, with Anderson starting for the AFC in place of New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/2008-01-28-3488501906_x.htm|title=Browns long snapper Pontbriand named to Pro Bowl - USATODAY.com|publisher=Usatoday.com|date=January 28, 2008|accessdate=2008-12-13[/tpl] Coach Crennel agreed to a two-year contract extension.[tpl]cite web|author=CBSSports.com wire reports|url=http://www.sportsline.com/nfl/story/10605249|title=After breakthrough season, Browns' Crennel to sign two-year extension – NFL – CBSSports.com Football|publisher=Sportsline.com|accessdate=2008-12-13[/tpl]
The Browns entered the 2008 season with high expectations, and many pundits predicted that the team would win the division.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2008-09-03-preseason-picks_N.htm|title=USA Today's NFL preseason picks 2008|work=USA Today|date=September 5, 2008|accessdate=2008-12-29[/tpl] The highlight of the season was an upset of the defending Super Bowl champion New York Giants on Monday Night Football. However, inconsistent play and key injuries led to a disappointing 4–12 record. The Browns ended up using four starting quarterbacks during the season: Derek Anderson, Brady Quinn and Ken Dorsey were lost to injury; the fourth, Bruce Gradkowski, was signed mid-season. Ending with six straight losses, the Browns finished with a franchise first two consecutive shutouts.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nfl.com/teams/schedule?team=CLE&season=2008&seasonType=REG|title=NFL.com 2008 Schedule|work=NFL|date=September 5, 2008|accessdate=2008-12-29[/tpl] Savage and Crennel were subsequently fired.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.myfoxcleveland.com/myfox/pages/Home/Detail?contentId=8155939&version=1&locale=EN-US&layoutCode=TSTY&pageId=1.1.1|title=Browns Fire GM Phil Savage|date=December 28, 2008|accessdate=2008-12-28[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Withers|first=Tom|url=http://www.myfoxcleveland.com/myfox/pages/Home/Detail?contentId=8158822&version=10&locale=EN-US&layoutCode=TSTY&pageId=1.1.1|title=Browns Fire Coach Romeo Crennel|agency=Associated Press|date=December 29, 2008|accessdate=2008-12-29[/tpl]
On January 5, 2009, the Browns hired former New York Jets coach Eric Mangini as head coach.Browns, Mangini reach agreement – ClevelandBrowns.com[tpl]dead link|date=June 2013[/tpl] Mangini, who started his career as a ballboy in Cleveland, worked as an assistant under former Browns coach Bill Belichick until becoming head coach of the Jets in 2006. On January 25, the team hired George Kokinis as the team's general manager. The Browns continued to struggle as they became accustomed to a completely new coaching staff. Throughout the preseason, Brady Quinn and Derek Anderson competed for the starting quarterback position. Quinn ended up winning the job, but after three games marked by team inconsistency (and an 0–3 record), he was benched in favor of Anderson. On November 1, the team announced the firing of GM Kokinis after only 8 regular season games (and a 1–7 record), with his duties essentially being assumed by Mangini. Soon afterwards, Mangini decided that a quarterback switch was to be made again, and Quinn given the starting job back. After being 1–11 at the three-quarters point in the season (12 games), the team went on a four-game winning streak and finished with a record of 5–11, highlighted by the team beating the Steelers after twelve consecutive losses against their bitter rival.
On December 21, 2009, as Mangini's first season was coming to a close, former Green Bay Packers and Seattle Seahawks head coach Mike Holmgren was hired as team President and was given authority over the team's football operations. This hire was made after Browns owner Randy Lerner announced that he wished to bring in a "serious, credible leader" to steer the team in the right direction. After much public speculation by the media that Holmgren and Mangini would not be able to co-exist,[tpl]cite web|url=http://blogs.nfl.com/2009/12/16/holmgrens-arrival-would-likely-mean-end-for-mangini/| publisher=NFL.com|last=La Canfora|first=Jason|title=Holmgren's arrival likely would mean end for Mangini|date=December 16, 2009| accessdate=2010-01-08|ref=harv|postscript=[tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl] [/tpl] Holmgren announced the retaining of Mangini and the entire coaching staff for the 2010 season.[tpl]Cite journal| title=Cleveland Browns' Eric Mangini will coach team in 2010|last=Grossi|first=Tony|publisher=The Plain Dealer|url=http://www.cleveland.com/browns/index.ssf/2010/01/post_17.html|date=January 7, 2010|accessdate=2010-01-08| ref=harv| postscript=[tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl] The following week, Holmgren hired former Philadelphia Eagles general manager Tom Heckert to become the new GM for the Browns.
After taking control as President, Holmgren decided to release Anderson and trade away Quinn (getting back eventual 1,100+ yard rusher and fan favorite RB Peyton Hillis in return). He signed veteran quarterback Jake Delhomme, who had led the Carolina Panthers to the Super Bowl in 2003, along with veteran backup Seneca Wallace from the Seattle Seahawks. During the 2010 draft, the team of Holmgren, Heckert and Mangini focused mostly on improving the team's defensive secondary, although they also managed to acquire the University of Texas's Colt McCoy in the third round; McCoy has the most recorded wins as a starting quarterback in NCAA history.
Despite heading into the 2010 season with an overall sense of optimism, the Browns started off poorly. They set an NFL record when they lost their first three games after leading in the fourth quarter. They finally won their first game against the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 4. However, both Delhomme and Wallace injured their ankles over the first five games, forcing Colt McCoy to start in Week 6 against the Steelers even though Mike Holmgren stated that he would sit and learn the entire season. Though McCoy lost his first NFL start against the Steelers, he was able to win the following week when the Browns upset the defending Super Bowl Champions, the New Orleans Saints. With this victory, the Browns defeated the defending Super Bowl Champions three years in a row, becoming the seventh NFL team to achieve this feat.[tpl]cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/statsinfo/post/_/id/10495/browns-stun-super-bowl-champs-again|title=Browns stun Super Bowl champs again|date=October 24, 2010|accessdate=2010-10-24 [/tpl] The Browns continued this positive streak by outplaying the New England Patriots for a 34–14 victory in their next game. However, they lost to the New York Jets in overtime the following week, despite a late 4th quarter game tying touchdown drive by McCoy. On January 3, 2011, after losing four games in a row to end the season, Holmgren and the Browns decided to fire head coach Eric Mangini, who posted a record of 10–22 in his two seasons as head coach.[tpl]Cite journal|title=Browns fire coach Eric Mangini|last=AP|publisher=ESPN|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=5984058|date=January 3, 2011|accessdate=2011-01-03|ref=harv|postscript=[tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl] Eleven days later, Holmgren signed St. Louis Rams offensive coordinator Pat Shurmur to become the new head coach, and former Buffalo Bills and Chicago Bears head coach Dick Jauron as their defensive coordinator.
While potentially hamstrung in attempts to install a new offensive system by the NFL lockout, the Browns played through the first half of the 2011 season at or near the bottom of the league in almost every offensive category. Starting several rookies, Shurmur's team was frequently beset by confusion in personnel and play-calling at critical junctures. Early in the year the defense surrendered a touchdown on a failure to break the defensive huddle, and the team's chances in several games were compromised by a host of special teams mistakes and meltdowns. At the midpoint of the season, in a telling series in which Shurmur called for a conservative ball-protection strategy, the Browns recovered their own fumble resulting from a mistakenly called hand off to a 3rd string tight-end lined up at fullback, only to botch a short go-ahead field goal attempt with a failed snap and uncoordinated line movement.
The Browns would go 4–12 in Shumur's first season, including losing six in a row to end the 2011 campaign.
New owner Jimmy Haslam announced on October 16, 2012 that Holmgren would stay on through the 2012 season in a lesser role (though still officially listed as president), and would then retire.  On November 25, it was reported by CBS and confirmed by the Browns that Holmgren would officially step down following the Browns 20–14 win over the Steelers.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.twitter.com/TonyGrossi |title=Tony Grossi (@TonyGrossi) op Twitter |publisher=Twitter.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-31[/tpl]

===Haslam ownership (2012–present)===

In July 2012, owner Randy Lerner announced that he planned to sell the Browns to businessman Jimmy Haslam.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d82ad9ba4/article/cleveland-browns-up-for-sale-mike-holmgren-confirms?module=HP11_breaking_news |title=Cleveland Browns up for sale, Mike Holmgren confirms |publisher=Nfl.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-02[/tpl] The sale was finalized on August 2, 2012 in excess of $1 Billion (USD).[tpl]cite web|author=Adam SchefterNFLFollowArchive |url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/8225861/randy-lerner-sells-cleveland-browns-more-1b-sources-say |title=Randy Lerner sells Cleveland Browns for more than $1B, sources say – ESPN |publisher=Espn.go.com |date=August 2, 2012 |accessdate=2012-09-03[/tpl] Haslam officially was approved as the new owner on October 16, 2012 at the NFL owners' meetings, and the very next day former Eagles president Joe Banner was named as the Browns new CEO.
The Browns began the 2012 season by losing their first five games.  Having lost their last six games to end the 2011 season, this marked an eleven-game losing streak, tied for the longest in team history with the 1974–75 teams.[tpl]dead link|date=January 2013[/tpl] On October 12, the Browns defeated the Bengals 34–24 in Cleveland, behind 2 TD passes from rookie QB Brandon Weeden (on his 29th birthday) to end the streak.
On December 31, 2012, head coach Pat Shurmur and general manager Tom Heckert were fired. Shurmur went 9–23 in his two seasons as head coach.
After interviewing numerous candidates such as Chip Kelly and Ken Whisenhunt, the Browns decided to hire former offensive coordinator and tight ends coach, Rob Chudzinski, on January 10, 2013.
On January 15, 2013, Haslam and Banner announced that the naming rights to Cleveland Browns Stadium were sold to FirstEnergy, and the stadium would be renamed FirstEnergy Stadium. The name change officially received Cleveland City Council approval on February 15, 2013.
On January 18, 2013, the Browns hired Michael Lombardi – who had a previous stint with the Browns in the player personnel department in the '80s and '90s – as Vice President of Player Personnel (two months later he was officially given the title of general manager), making him Tom Heckert's replacement.[tpl]cite web|author=By JEFF SCHUDELjschudel@MorningJournal.com@jsbrownsinsider |url=http://morningjournal.com/articles/2013/03/06/sports/doc5136b61a5c34b767388986.txt |title=Cleveland Browns name Mike Lombardi General Manager, hire Ray Farmer as Assistant GM |publisher=morningjournal.com |date=2013-03-06 |accessdate=2013-06-02[/tpl]
The Browns would finish with a 4-12 record in the first season under the new regime, finishing last in the AFC North Division, and losing seven in a row to finish the 2013 campaign.

==Logos and uniforms==

===Logos===

The Browns are the only National Football League team without a helmet logo.  The logoless helmet serves as the Browns' official logo.  The organization has used several promotional logos throughout the years; players' numbers were painted on the helmets from the 1957 to 1960; and an unused "CB" logo[tpl]cite web|url=http://content.sportslogos.net/logos/7/155/full/5225.gif |title=Image of Cleveland Browns "CB" helmet |date= |accessdate=2013-06-02[/tpl] was created in 1965,[tpl]cite web|last=Grzegorek |first=Vince |url=http://www.clevescene.com/64-and-counting/archives/2010/02/09/the-hunt-for-the-great-orange-brown-and-white-whale-unraveling-the-mystery-of-the-1965-cb-cleveland-browns-helmet-logo |title=The Hunt for the Great Orange, Brown, and White Whale: Unraveling the Mystery of the 1965 "CB" Cleveland Browns Helmet Logo | '64 and Counting: Scene's Sports Blog |publisher=Clevescene.com |date=2010-02-09 |accessdate=2013-06-02[/tpl] But for much of their history, the Browns' helmets have been an unadorned burnt orange color with a top stripe of dark brown (officially called "seal brown") divided by a white stripe.
The team has had various promotional logos throughout the years, such as the "Brownie Elf" mascot or a Brown "B" in a white football. While Art Modell did away with the Brownie Elf in the mid-1960s, believing it to be too childish, its use has been revived under the current ownership. The popularity of the Dawg Pound section at First Energy Stadium has led to a brown and orange dog being used for various Browns functions. But overall, the orange, logo-less helmet continues to remain as the primary trademark of the Cleveland Browns.

===Uniforms===

The original designs of the jerseys, pants, and socks have remained mostly the same, but the helmets have gone through many significant revisions throughout the years.
Jerseys: 1. Home Uniforms: brown (officially "seal brown") with white numerals and a white-orange-white-orange-white stripe sequence on the sleeves. 2. Away Uniforms: white with brown numerals and a brown-orange-brown-orange-brown stripe sequence on the sleeves. The three white or brown stripes are approximately twice the width of the two orange stripes. (The original 1946 jerseys featured block-shadow numerals.) 3. A third orange jersey was used for night games in the 1954 season, as well as from 2002 to 2005 when the NFL encouraged teams to create a third jersey. In 2013 the Browns wore a combination of brown pants and jerseys in honor of Jim Brown.
Pants: 1. White – white with an orange-brown-orange stripe sequence on the sides (the stripes are of equal width). 2. Brown – solid brown (no stripes). Orange pants with a wider brown-white-brown stripe sequence were worn from 1975 to 1983 and become symbolic of the "Kardiac Kids" era. The orange pants were worn again occasionally in 2003 and 2004.
Socks: Brown or white with matching stripe pattern to jerseys (1946–83; 1985–95; 1999–2002 mid-season); solid brown with brown jerseys and solid orange with white jerseys (1984); solid brown when worn with white pants (2002 mid-season–2008); white striped socks with brown pants (2009) Exceptions: White striped socks appeared occasionally with the white jerseys in 2003–2005 and again in 2007. Brown striped socks appeared with 1957-style throwback uniforms in 2006–2008.
Helmet: Solid white (1946–1949); solid white for day games and solid orange for night games (1950–51); orange with a single white stripe (1952–56); orange with a single white stripe and brown numerals on the sides (1957–59); orange with a brown-white-brown stripe sequence and brown numerals on the sides (1960); orange with a brown-white-brown stripe sequence (1961–95 and 1999–present).
Over the years, the Browns have had on-again / off-again periods of wearing white for their home games, particularly in the 1970s and 80s, as well as in the early 2000s after the team returned to the league. Until recently, when more NFL teams have started to wear white at home at least once a season, the Browns were the only non-subtropical team north of the Mason-Dixon line to wear white at home on a regular basis.
Numerals first appeared on the jersey sleeves in 1961. Over the years, there have been minor revisions to the sleeve stripes, the first occurring in 1968 (brown jerseys worn in early season) and 1969 (white and brown jerseys) when stripes began to be silk screened onto the sleeves and separated from each other to prevent color bleeding. However, the basic five-stripe sequence has remained intact (with the exception of the 1984 season). A recent revision was the addition of the initials "AL" to honor team owner Al Lerner who died in 2002; this was removed in 2013 upon Jimmy Haslam assuming ownership of the team.
Orange pants with a brown-white-brown stripe sequence were worn from 1975 to 1983 and become symbolic of the "Kardiac Kids" era. The orange pants were worn again occasionally in 2003 and 2004.
Other than the helmet, the uniform was completely redesigned for the 1984 season. New striping patterns appeared on the white jerseys, brown jerseys and pants. Solid brown socks were worn with brown jerseys and solid orange socks were worn with white jerseys. Brown numerals on the white jerseys were outlined in orange. White numerals on the brown jerseys were double outlined in brown and orange. (Orange numerals double outlined in brown and white appeared briefly on the brown jerseys in one pre-season game.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kFlAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=v1YMAAAAIBAJ&pg=1066,2673152|title=Browns' Home Jerseys Will Be Modified|newspaper=Youngstown Vindicator|date=August 8, 1984|accessdate=2010-12-30[/tpl]) However, this particular uniform set was not popular with the fans, and in 1985 the uniform was returned to a look similar to the original design. It remained that way until 1995.
In 1999, the expansion Browns adopted the traditional design with two exceptions: 1.) Jersey-sleeve numbers were moved to the shoulders, and 2.) The orange-brown-orange pants stripes were significantly widened.
Experimentation with the uniform design began in 2002. An alternate orange jersey was introduced that season as the NFL encouraged teams to adopt a third jersey, and a major design change was made when solid brown socks appeared for the first time since 1984 and were used with white, brown and orange jerseys. Other than 1984, striped socks (matching the jersey stripes) had been a signature design element in the team's traditional uniform. The white striped socks would appeared occasionally with the white jerseys in 2003–2005 and 2007.
Experimentation continued in 2003 and 2004 when the traditional orange-brown-orange stripes on the white pants were replaced by two variations of a brown-orange-brown sequence, one in which the stripes were joined (worn with white jerseys) and the other in which they were separated by white (worn with brown jerseys). The joined sequence was used exclusively with both jerseys in 2005. In 2006, the traditional orange-brown-orange sequence returned.
Additionally in 2006, the team reverted to an older uniform style, featuring gray face masks; the original stripe pattern on the brown jersey sleeves (The white jersey has had that sleeve stripe pattern on a consistent basis since the 1985 season.) and the older, darker shade of brown.http://www.cleveland.com/browns/plaindealer/index.ssf?/base/sports/1143967223212420.xml&coll=2&thispage=3[tpl]Dead link|date=December 2010[/tpl]
The Browns wore brown pants for the first time in team history on August 18, 2008, preseason game against the New York Giants. The pants contain no stripes or markings. The team had the brown pants created as an option for their away uniform when they integrated the gray facemask in 2006.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.clevelandbrowns.com/article.php?id=8699|title=Cleveland Browns | Brown out|publisher=Clevelandbrowns.com|accessdate=2008-12-13|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20080822033723/http://www.clevelandbrowns.com/article.php?id=8699 |archivedate=August 22, 2008[/tpl] They were not worn again until the Browns "family" scrimmage on August 9, 2009 with white-striped socks.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/browns/index.ssf/2009/08/scrimmage_shows_offense_still.html|title=Scrimmage shows Cleveland Browns' offense still needs work|publisher=Cleveland.com|accessdate=2009-08-09[/tpl] The Browns have continued to wear the brown pants throughout the 2009 season.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/nfl/plaindealer/index.ssf?/base/sports/1248597145139770.xml&coll=2|title=Cleveland Browns might wear brown pants for all road games during 2009 NFL season|publisher=Cleveland.com|date=|accessdate=2009-07-26[/tpl] Browns quarterback Brady Quinn supported the team's move to wearing the brown pants full-time, claiming that the striped pattern on the white pants "prohibited mobility".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/browns/index.ssf/2009/08/cleveland_browns_scrimmage_ans.html|title=Cleveland Browns' scrimmage answers some Brady Quinn concerns; WR Leggett impresses|publisher=The Plain Dealer|accessdate=2009-08-10[/tpl]
However, the fans generally did not like the brown pants, and after being used for only one season, the team returned to their white shirt-on-white pants in 2010. Coach Eric Mangini told The Plain Dealer the Browns won't use the brown pants anymore. "It wasn't very well-received," Mangini said.

==Rivalries==

The Cleveland Browns have rivalries with all three of its AFC North opponents. In addition, the team has had historical rivalries with the Baltimore Colts, Denver Broncos, and Detroit Lions.
The team's biggest rival in the AAFC was the San Francisco 49ers, though this has cooled and in some cases turned into a friendly relationship, as the Browns now play in AFC and the 49ers play in the NFC. Additionally, many 49ers personnel helped the Browns relaunch in 1999 as well as former team President Mike Holmgren having started his NFL career in San Francisco. In addition, 49ers owners John York & Denise DeBartolo York reside in the Youngstown, Ohio 60 miles southeast of Cleveland.

===Divisional rivalries===

====Pittsburgh Steelers====

Often called the "Turnpike Rivalry",[tpl]cite web|url=http://kdka.com/local/Steelers.Browns.rivalry.2.564970.html |title=Steelers To Take On Browns For First Place In The AFC North |publisher=Kdka.com |date=2010-10-14 |accessdate=2013-06-02[/tpl] the Browns' main rival has long been the Pittsburgh Steelers. Though the Browns dominated this rivalry early in the series (winning the first eight matchups), the Steelers currently have the all-time edge 64–57, making it the oldest rivalry in the AFC. Former Browns owner Art Modell scheduled home games against the Steelers on Saturday night from 1964 to 1970 to help fuel the rivalry. The rivalry has been fueled by the proximity of the two teams, number of championships both teams have won, players and personnel having played and/or coached for both sides, and personal bitterness. Though the rivalry has cooled in Pittsburgh due to the Modell move (as well as the Browns having a 5–24 record against the Steelers since returning to the league in 1999), the Steelers are still top rival for Cleveland.

====Cincinnati Bengals====

Originally conceived due to the personal animosity between Paul Brown and Art Modell, the "Battle of Ohio" between the Browns and the Cincinnati Bengals have been fueled by the sociocultural differences between Cincinnati and Cleveland, a shared history between the two teams, and even similar team colors, since Brown used the exact shade of orange for the Bengals that he used for the Browns. (Though this has changed since then, as the Bengals now use a brighter shade of orange.) Modell, in fact, moved the Browns to the AFC after the AFL–NFL merger in order to have a rivalry with the Bengals. The rivalry has also produced two of the eight highest-scoring games in NFL history. Cincinnati has the all-time edge 42–37, having won the majority of games against the Browns since they returned to the NFL in 1999.

====Baltimore Ravens====

Created as a result of the Cleveland Browns relocation controversy, the rivalry between the Browns and Ravens was more directed at Art Modell than the team itself, and is simply considered a divisional game in Baltimore. Unlike the other two rivalries, this one is more lopsided: the Ravens lead 20–7.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/rav/|title=Baltimore Ravens Team Encyclopedia|publisher=Pro-Football-Reference.com|accessdate=2010-12-30[/tpl]

===Other rivalries===

====Detroit Lions====

The Lions rivalry began in the 1950s when the Browns and Lions played in four NFL championships with the Lions winning three championships over the Browns and the Browns won one championship over the Lions. This was arguably one of the NFL's best rivalries in the 1950s. The two teams now since 2002 play an annual preseason game known as the Great Lakes Classic.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.morningjournal.com/articles/2009/11/22/sports/mj1925578.txt|title=Great Lakes Classic has lacked luster since its beginning|date=November 22, 2009|accessdate=2009-03-21|author=Schudel, Jeff|publisher=The Morning Journal[/tpl]

====Baltimore/Indianapolis Colts====

The Colts rivalry was hot in the 1960s. The Browns upset the Colts in the 1964 NFL championship (the last championship to date for the Browns) and the Colts got revenge by beating the Browns in the 1968 NFL Championship. The Browns also beat the Indianapolis Colts in a 1987 divisional playoff game.

====Denver Broncos====

The Browns had a brief rivalry with the Broncos that arose from three AFC championship matches from 1986–89. In the 1986 AFC Championship, quarterback John Elway led The Drive to secure a tie in the waning moments at Cleveland Municipal Stadium; the Broncos went on to win in 23–20 in overtime.33 One year later, the two teams met again in the 1987 AFC Championship at Mile High Stadium. Denver took a 21–3 lead, but Browns' quarterback Bernie Kosar threw four touchdown passes to tie the game at 31–31 halfway through the 4th quarter. After a long drive, John Elway threw a 20-yard touchdown pass to running back Sammy Winder to give Denver a 38–31 lead. Cleveland advanced to Denver's 8-yard line with 1:12 left, but Broncos' safety Jeremiah Castille stripped Browns' running back Earnest Byner of the football at the 2-yard line — a play that has been called The Fumble by Browns' fans. The Broncos recovered it, gave Cleveland an intentional safety, and went on to win 38–33.34 The two teams met yet again in the 1989 AFC Championship at Mile High Stadium, which the Broncos easily won by a score of 37–21.35 Interestingly, the Broncos would not win the Super Bowl after any of the championship games where they beat the Browns.

==Fan Base==

===Dawg Pound===

Perhaps the most visible Browns fans are those that can be found in the Dawg Pound. Originally the name for the bleacher section located in the open (east) end of old Cleveland Municipal Stadium, the current incarnation is likewise located in the east end of Cleveland Browns Stadium and still features hundreds of orange and brown clad fans sporting various canine-related paraphernalia. The fans adopted that name in 1984 after members of the Browns defense used it to describe the team's defense.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/browns/2006-02-16-dawg-pound_x.htm|title=Judge finds nobody beats out Cleveland for 'Dawg Pound'|work=Usatoday.com|publisher=Gannett Company|date=February 16, 2006|accessdate=2008-12-13|first=Larry|last=Newmeister[/tpl]
Retired cornerback Hanford Dixon, who played his entire career for the Browns (1981–89), is credited with naming the Cleveland Browns defense 'The Dawgs' in the mid-80's. Dixon and teammates Frank Minnifield, and Eddie Johnson would bark at each other and to the fans in the bleachers at the Cleveland Stadium to fire them up. It was from Dixon's naming that the Dawg Pound subsequently took its title.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.clevelandbrowns.com/article.php?id=6887|title=Cleveland Browns | Rookies get a history lesson|publisher=Clevelandbrowns.com|accessdate=2008-12-13[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] The fans adopted that name in the years after.

===Browns Backers===

The most prominent organization of Browns fans is the Browns Backers Worldwide (BBW). The organization has approximately 105,000 members[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.clevelandbrowns.com/fans/backers/|title=Cleveland Browns|publisher=Clevelandbrowns.com|accessdate=2011-01-17[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] and is considered the largest sports-fan organization in the USA. Browns Backers clubs can be found in every major city in the United States, and in a number of military bases throughout the world, with the largest club being in Phoenix, Arizona. In addition, the organization has a sizable foreign presence in places as far away as Egypt, Australia, Japan, Sri Lanka, and McMurdo Station in Antarctica.[tpl]cite news|first=Mike|last=Deneen|title=Lakewood Native Takes Browns Backers to South Pole|url=http://www.lakewoodobserver.com/read/2006/01/11/lakewood-native-takes-browns-backers-to|work=The Lakewood Observer|date=January 11, 2006|accessdate=2011-11-29[/tpl] According to The Official Fan Club of the Cleveland Browns, the two largest international fan clubs are in Alon Shvut, West Bank and Niagara, Canada, with Alon Shvut having 129 members and Niagara having 310.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.clevelandbrowns.com/fans/backers/results.php?id=INT|title=Cleveland Browns|publisher=Clevelandbrowns.com|accessdate=2008-12-13[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
A 2006 study conducted by Bizjournal determined that Browns fans are the most loyal fans in the NFL. The study, while not scientific, was largely based on fan loyalty during winning and losing seasons, attendance at games, and challenges confronting fans (such as inclement weather or long-term poor performance of their team).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14686579/|title=Cleveland No. 1 in NFL fan loyalty - NFL- nbcsports.msnbc.com|publisher=Msnbc.msn.com|accessdate=2008-12-13[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] The study noted that Browns fans filled 99.8% of the seats at Cleveland Browns Stadium during the last seven seasons, despite a combined record of 36 wins and 76 losses over that span.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/specials/slideshow/13.html|title=NFL Fan Support Rankings|publisher=Bizjournals.com|accessdate=2008-12-13|deadurl=yes[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
Following former Browns owner Randy Lerner's acquisition of English football club Aston Villa, official Villa outlets have started selling Cleveland Browns goods such as jerseys and NFL balls. This has raised interest in England and strengthened the link between the two sporting clubs. Aston Villa supporters have set up an organization known as the Aston (Villa) Browns Backers of Birmingham.[tpl]dead link|date=December 2010[/tpl]

===Famous Fans===

The Cleveland Browns were the favorite team of Elvis Presley.June Moore (with assistance from Kathy Westmoreland): Kathy Westmoreland: Elvis’ voice of an angel, Ju’Mel Publishing, USA, Juni 2010, S. 159 / ISBN 978-0-9827845-0-1[tpl]cite web|url=http://weeklyworldnews.com/headlines/5025/top-20-surprising-elvis-facts/|title= TOP 20 surprising Elvis Facts|publisher=Weeklyworldnews.com|accessdate=2014-02-07[/tpl] Reason for this decision by the “King of Rock’n’Roll“ was the fact that his friend Gene Hickerson, with whom he had played football in their common youth in Memphis, were contracted by the Browns in 1957 and have played there during his entire active career until 1973.[tpl]cite web|url=http://dcoughlin.wordpress.com/2011/10/24/gene-hickerson-elvis-took-his-calls/|title= Gene Hickerson: Elvis Took His Calls|publisher=Dan Coughlin|accessdate=2014-02-07[/tpl] Also defender Bobby Franklin, who had played from 1960 to 1966 for the Browns, was a friend of Elvis Presley.
