==Plot==

The Pink Panther is backpacking through Transylvania and stops to spend a night at a castle, believing it to be a lodge. It is in fact a vampire's castle also occupied by a hairy knife-throwing hand, a Yeti-like phantom in squeaky shoes, and a shark in the moat. Thinking the vampire's coffin to be that of a dead man, the Pink Panther buries it. Dusk arrives, the coffin rumbles to surface, and the vampire emerges. Whenever the vampire turns into a bat to attack, The Pink Panther repeatedly sprays him with bug repellant; this invariably causes the vampire to fly out the window, turn back into human form and fall into a moat, where he is preyed on by the shark. By the end, sunrise causes the vampire, shark, phantom, and castle to all disappear.
