Kavalactones are a class of lactone compounds found in the kava shrub. Kavalactones have a wide variety of effects including amnestic, analgesic, anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, nootropic, and sedative/hypnotic activity caused by numerous interactions with the central nervous system via a myriad of mechanisms.

==Enzyme inhibition==

Kava extract has been shown to potently inhibit a wide range of hepatic enzymes, suggesting a very high potential for interactions with many pharmaceuticals and herbal medications.[tpl]cite web|title=Inhibition of Human Cytochrome P450 Activities by Kava Extract and Kavalactones|author=James M. Mathews, Amy S. Etheridge and Sherry R. Black|url=http://dmd.aspetjournals.org/content/30/11/1153.short[/tpl] For this reason, kava should never be consumed without the permission of a primary care physician, psychiatrist, and/or any other doctor who is prescribing medication for a patient. It is also recommended that potential users discuss their kava use with a pharmacist. If undergoing anesthesia, it is recommended to note any use of kava well in advance of any surgery. Patients may be instructed to temporarily discontinue use of kava for a set period of time before and after the surgery.

==Toxicity==

Several kavalactones (e.g. Flavokavain B, Methysticin and Yangonin) have been reported to be toxic and/or carcinogenic, although further research into these mechanisms is needed and it is not yet known if kava consumption induces toxic/carcinogenic effects in vivo. Despite this, hepatoxicity has been reported in a small portion of previously healthy kava users.[tpl]cite web| author=Dr Joji Malani | year=2002| title=Evaluation of the effects of Kava on the Liver | format=PDF | work= | url=http://www.spc.int/cis/documents/Kava%20article%20DrMalani.pdf | accessdate=2008-01-05[/tpl][tpl]cite web| author=AC Brown | year=2007| title=Traditional kava beverage consumption and liver function tests in a predominantly Tongan population in Hawaii revealed no liver impairment. | work= | url=http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&collection=ENV&recid=7500835&q=kava+beverage&uid=1126092&setcookie=yes | accessdate=2009-03-17[/tpl]
Numerous kavalactones have apoptotic effects on various human tissues, which may be involved in some of the purported toxic effects of kava use.[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Tang | first1 = J | last2 = Dunlop | first2 = RA | last3 = Rowe | first3 = A | last4 = Rodgers | first4 = KJ | last5 = Ramzan | first5 = I | title = Kavalactones Yangonin and Methysticin Induce Apoptosis in Human Hepatocytes (HepG2) In Vitro. | journal = Phytotherapy research : PTR | pages = n/a | year = 2010 | pmid = 20734326 | doi = 10.1002/ptr.3283 | volume = 25 | issue = 3[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|title=Flavokawain A, a novel chalcone from kava extract, induces apoptosis in bladder cancer cells by involvement of Bax protein-dependent and mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway and suppresses tumor growth in mice.|author=Zi X, Simoneau AR|journal=Cancer Research|pmid=15833884|doi=10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-3803|volume=65|issue=8|date=April 2005|pages=3479–86[/tpl][tpl]Cite web|title=Flavokawain B, a novel, naturally occurring chalcone, exhibits robust apoptotic effects and induces G2/M arrest of a uterine leiomyosarcoma cell line|author=Ramez N.

==Compounds==

At least 18 different kavalactones have been identified to date, with methysticin being the first identified.
Multiple analogues, such as ethysticin, have also been isolated.
Some consist of a substituted α-pyrone as the lactone while others are partially saturated.
