The Czech National Council ([tpl]lang-cs|Česká národní rada, ČNR[/tpl]) was the legislative body of the Czech Republic since 1968 when the Czech Republic was created as a member state of Czech-Slovak federation. It was legally transformed into the Chamber of Deputies according to the Constitution (Act. No. 1/1993 Coll.) because of the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1992.
