The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) is the police department of the city of Los Angeles, California.  With 10,023 officers[tpl]cite web|last=Altman |first=Larry |url=http://www.insidesocal.com/crime&courts/2009/03/lapd-announces-milestone-numbe.html |title=LAPD announces milestone number of officers - Crime & Courts |publisher=Insidesocal.com |date=2009-03-02 |accessdate=2011-12-25[/tpl] and 2,879 civilian staff,  it is the third-largest local law enforcement agency in the United States, after the New York City Police Department and the Chicago Police Department.Department of Justice report Accessed June 19, 2012 The department serves an area of [tpl]convert|498|sqmi|km2[/tpl] and a population of 3,792,621 people as of the 2010 Census.
The LAPD has been fictionalized in numerous movies, novels and television shows throughout its history. The department has also been associated with a number of controversies, mainly concerned with racial animosity, police brutality and police corruption.

==History==

The first specific Los Angeles police force was founded in 1853 as the Los Angeles Rangers, a volunteer force that assisted the existing County forces.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lapdonline.org/history_of_the_lapd/content_basic_view/1107|title=The LAPD: 1850–1900|publisher=LAPD|accessdate=2008-08-04[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lasd.org/aboutlasd/history.html#dates|title=History of the LASD|publisher=LASD|accessdate=2008-08-04[/tpl] The Rangers were soon succeeded by the Los Angeles City Guards, another volunteer group.  Neither force was particularly efficient and Los Angeles became known for its violence, gambling and vice.
The first paid force was created in 1869, when six officers were hired to serve under City Marshal William C. Warren. By 1900, under John M. Glass, there were 70 officers, one for every 1,500 people. In 1903, with the start of the Civil Service, this force was increased to 200.
During World War II, under Clemence B. Horrall, the overall number of personnel was depleted by the demands of the military.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lapdonline.org/history_of_the_lapd/content_basic_view/1109|title=The LAPD: 1926–1950|publisher=LAPD|accessdate=2008-08-04[/tpl] Despite efforts to maintain numbers, the police could do little to control the 1943 Zoot Suit Riots.
Horrall was replaced by a retired United States Marine Corps General William A. Worton, who acted as interim chief until 1950, when William H. Parker succeeded him and would serve until his death in 1966. Parker advocated police professionalism and autonomy from civilian administration. However, the Bloody Christmas scandal in 1951 led to calls for civilian accountability and an end to alleged police brutality.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lapdonline.org/history_of_the_lapd/content_basic_view/1110|title=The LAPD: Chief Parker|publisher=LAPD|accessdate=2008-12-24[/tpl]
Under Parker, Inspector Daryl Gates[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.libertyreferences.com/lapd-swat.shtml |title=LAPD SWAT Team History |publisher=Liberty References |date= |accessdate=2011-12-25[/tpl] LAPD also created the first SWAT (Special Weapons and Tactics) team in United States law enforcement.  Officer John Nelson and then-inspector Daryl Gates created the program in 1965 to deal with threats from radical organizations such as the Black Panther Party operating during the Vietnam War era.

==Organization==

===Board of Police Commissioners===

The Los Angeles Board of Police Commissioners is a five-member body of appointed officials which oversees the LAPD.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.lapdonline.org/police_commission| title=Los Angeles Board of Police Commissioners |publisher=LAPD|accessdate= 2008-04-02[/tpl]  The board is responsible for setting policies for the department and overseeing the LAPD's overall management and operations.  The Chief of Police reports to the board, but the rest of the department reports to the chief.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lapdonline.org/search_results/content_basic_view/834|title=official website of the LAPD|publisher=LAPD|accessdate=2008-08-11[/tpl]
The old headquarters for the LAPD was Parker Center, named after former chief William H. Parker, which still stands at 150 N. Los Angeles St. The new headquarters is the new Police Administration Building located at 100 W. 1st St., immediately south of Los Angeles City Hall, which officially opened in October 2009.

===Office of the Chief===

The Office of the Chief of Police is the administrative office comprising the chief of staff, the Employee Relations Group, the Public Information Office, and RACR/COMPSTAT.  Also reporting to the chief of police is the special assistant for constitutional policing, whose office is divided into Fiscal Operations Division, Risk Management Division, Research and Planning Division, and Internal Audits and Inspections Division.  The Professional Standards Bureau, which includes the Internal Affairs Group, Special Operations Division and Force Investigation Division, also reports directly to the chief of police.
Real-time Analysis and Critical Response Division/COMPSTAT (Computer Statistics) maintains crime data. It holds regular weekly meetings within a purpose-built suite in the new Police Administration Building with the Chief of Police and senior officers. COMPSTAT is based on the NYPD CompStat unit that was created in 1994 by former LAPD Chief William Bratton, while he was still a NYPD Police Commissioner.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/Research/Crime/HL573.cfm|title=heritage.org|publisher=Heritage.org|accessdate= 2008-07-06[/tpl] He implemented the LAPD version on becoming Chief of Police in 2002.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lapdonline.org/inside_the_lapd/content_basic_view/6364|title=COMPSTAT|publisher=LAPD|accessdate= 2008-07-06[/tpl]
The Real-Time Analysis & Critical Response Division began operations in March 2006. It is composed of the Department Operations Section, which includes the Department Operations Center Unit, Department Operations Support Unit and the Incident Command Post Unit; Detective Support Section and the Crime Analysis Section.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lapdonline.org/home/pdf_view/39375|title=Regional Crime Center|accessdate=2009-01-01[/tpl]

===Office of Operations===

The majority of the LAPD's approximately 10,000 officers are assigned within the Office of Operations, whose primary office is located in the new Police Administration Building.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lapdonline.org/search_results/content_basic_view/6370|publisher=LAPD|title=official website of the LAPD|accessdate=2008-08-11[/tpl]  An assistant chief commands the office, and reports directly to the chief of police. The LAPD comprises 21 stations, known officially as "areas" but also commonly referred to as "divisions."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lapdonline.org/inside_the_lapd/content_basic_view/1063|title=official website of the LAPD|publisher=LAPD|accessdate=2008-08-11[/tpl]
The 21 stations are grouped geographically into four command areas, each known as a "bureau." The latest areas, "Olympic" and "Topanga," were added on January 4, 2009.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.lapdonline.org/newsroom/news_view/36684|title=Press release regarding the new LAPD stations|publisher=LAPD|accessdate=2008-04-02[/tpl]

==Rank structure and insignia==

===Supervisory terminology===

The following names are used to describe supervision levels within the LAPD:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lapdonline.org/lapd_manual/volume_3.htm#701|title=Supervision|publisher=http://www.lapdonline.org|accessdate=21 November 2012[/tpl]
‡ As detectives are considered specialists within the LAPD, they are normally considered to be separate from the uniformed line of command. The senior-most detective is therefore permitted to take charge of an incident when it is necessary for investigative purposes superseding the chain-of-command of other higher-ranking officers in attendance.[tpl]rp|125[/tpl]

==Chiefs of Police==

Since 1876, there have been 56 appointed chiefs of the Los Angeles Police Department. William H. Parker was the longest serving police chief in Los Angeles Police Department history, serving for 16 years as chief.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lapdonline.org/history_of_the_lapd/content_basic_view/1110|title=Brief biography|publisher=LAPD|accessdate=2008-08-11[/tpl]

==Staffing==

===Limitations===

The Los Angeles Police Department has suffered from chronic underfunding and under-staffing in recent years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lapdonline.org/january_2006/news_view/3729|title=LAPD Announces Crime Down Again in 2005|publisher=LAPD|accessdate=2008-07-13[/tpl] Compared to most other major cities in the United States, and though its the third largest police department in the country, Los Angeles has historically had one of the lowest ratios of police personnel to population served. Former police chief William J. Bratton made enlarging the force one of his top priorities (Bratton has been quoted as saying, "You give me 4,000 more officers and I'll give you the safest city in the world").[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lapdauthors.com/los_angeles_police_department_history.html|title=LAPD Authors|publisher=LAPD Authors|accessdate=2008-07-13[/tpl]
The Los Angeles Police Department protects its city with only one officer for every 426 residents. As a point of comparison, New York City boasts one NYPD officer for every 228 residents. For Los Angeles to have the same ratio of officers as New York City, the LAPD would need to have nearly 17,000 officers. Further points of comparison include Chicago, which has a ratio of one officer per 216 citizens and Philadelphia, whose officer per citizen ratio is 1 to 219.
In recent years, the department had been conducting a massive recruiting effort, with a goal of hiring an additional 1,500 police officers. One problem with such a drive is the lack of qualified candidates. The city has four specialized agencies, not affiliated with the LAPD directly, which serve the Port, the Airport, the City Hall, Library, and Zoo, and the Unified School District.

===Union===

The Los Angeles Police Protective League (LAPPL) is the labor union for LAPD officers up to the rank of lieutenant.[tpl]cite book|title=Willful Injustice: A Post-O.J. Look at Rodney King, American Justice, and Trial by Race|first=Robert|last=Deitz|year=1996|page=176|publisher=Regnery Publishing|isbn=978-0-89-526457-2|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=S7A679WR6boC&pg=PA176[/tpl]

===Demographics===

Up until the Gates administration, the LAPD was predominantly white (80% in 1980), and many officers had resided outside the city limits.Newton, Jim. "ACLU Says 83% of Police Live Outside L.A." Los Angeles Times 29 March 1994: B1. Simi Valley, the Ventura County suburb that later became infamous as the site of the state trial that immediately preceded the 1992 Los Angeles riots, has long been home to a particularly large concentration of LAPD officers, almost all of them white. A 1994 ACLU study of officers' home zip codes, concluded that over 80% of police officers resided outside the city limits.
Hiring quotas began to change this during the 1980s, but it was not until the Christopher Commission reforms that substantial numbers of black, Hispanic, and Asian officers began to join the force. Minority officers can be found in both rank-and-file and leadership positions in virtually all divisions, and the LAPD is starting to reflect the general population.
The LAPD hired the first female police officer in the United States in 1910, Alice Stebbins Wells.[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.lapdonline.org/history_of_the_lapd/content_basic_view/833| title= Women in LAPD|publisher=LAPD| accessdate = 2007-09-21[/tpl] Since then, women have been a small, but growing part of the force. Through the early 1970s, women were classified as "policewomen" on the LAPD.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,974878-3,00.html|title=Are Women Better Cops?|publisher=TIME Magazine|accessdate=2008-08-11 | date=1992-02-17[/tpl]  Through the 1950s, their duties generally consisted as working as matrons in the jail system, or dealing with troubled youths working in detective assignments.  Rarely did they work any type of field assignment and they were not allowed to promote above the rank of sergeant.
A lawsuit by a policewoman, Fanchon Blake, from the 1980s instituted court ordered mandates that the department begin actively hiring and promoting women police officers in its ranks.  The department eliminated the rank of "Policeman" from new hires at that time along with the rank of "Policewoman."  Anyone already in those positions was grandfathered in, but new hires were classified instead as "Police Officers," which continues to this day. In 2002, women made up 18.9% of the force.
In 1886, the department hired its first two black officers, Robert William Stewart and Roy Green.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lapdonline.org/history_of_the_lapd/content_basic_view/1107|title=The LAPD: 1850–1900|accessdate=2008-07-09[/tpl]  Despite this, the department was slow at integration. During the 1965 Watts Riot, only 5 of the 205 police assigned to South Central Los Angeles were black, despite the fact that it was the largest black community in Los Angeles.

==Work environment==

LAPD patrol officers have a three-day 12-hour and four-day 10-hour work week schedule. The department has over 250 types of job assignments, and each officer is eligible for such assignments after two years on patrol. LAPD patrol officers almost always work with a partner, unlike most suburban departments surrounding the city of Los Angeles, which deploy officers in one-officer units in order to maximize police presence and to allow a smaller number of officers to patrol a larger area.
The department's training division has three facilities throughout the city, including Elysian Park, Ahmanson Recruit Training Center (Westchester), and the Edward Davis Training Center (Granada Hills).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lapdonline.org/home/content_basic_view/6375|title=LAPD Training Division Mission Statement and Overview|publisher=LAPD|accessdate=2008-12-22[/tpl]
From spring 2007 through the spring of 2009, new recruits could earn money through sign on bonuses ranging from $5,000 to $10,000. Those bonuses ended in 2009.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.joinlapd.com/index2.html|title=Join LAPD-Official Recruitment Site|publisher=LAPD|accessdate=2008-07-13[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.joinlapd.com/bonus.html|title=Join LAPD-Signing Bonus|publisher=LAPD|accessdate=2008-07-13[/tpl]  Sign on bonuses were paid 1/2 after graduation from the academy, and 1/2 after completion of probation. Also, $2,000 could be added for out of town sign ons for housing arrangements. As of July 2009, new recruits earned starting salaries of $56,522–$61,095 depending on education level, and began earning their full salary on their first day of academy training.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.joinlapd.com/salary.html |title=Join LAPD-Official Recruitment Site |publisher=LAPD |accessdate=2009-07-13[/tpl]
As of January 2010, the starting base salary for high school graduates was lowered to $45,226. If the applicant has at least 60 college units, with an overall GPA of 2.0 or better, the applicant will start at $47,043. If the applicant has a BA or BSc (four year) degree, the applicant will start at $48,880.

==Resources==

Before the early 1970s, LAPD officers were issued the six-shot double action/single action Smith & Wesson Model 14 .38 Special revolver. From the early 1970s to 1988, officers were armed with the six-shot, double action/single action Smith & Wesson Model 15 revolver, also known as the .38 "Combat Masterpiece". This was specifically designed at the request of the Los Angeles Police Department. It was a .38 caliber Smith and Wesson Model 10 variant with non-snag, high profile adjustable sights.
LAPD Model 15s were often modified by an armorer to fire double-action only, meaning officers could not cock the hammer. This was to prevent accidental discharges caused by the short, light single-action trigger pull that some officers used. Many officers and detectives also carried the Model 36 "Chief's Special" as a backup revolver, and often off-duty.
In the patrol cars, locked to a steel bar, was an Ithaca Model 37, 12-gauge shotgun, loaded with "00" (double-aught) buckshot, nine pellets to the cartridge with one round in the chamber and four in the magazine tube. The shotgun was made specifically for the Los Angeles Police Department, and was called the "L.A.P.D. Special".  The shotgun was based on the Ithaca Model 37 "Deerslayer", which was a weapon designed to hunt large game with rifled slugs.  As a consequence of being designed for use with slugs, it had rifle sights, unlike most shotguns.
The "L.A.P.D. Special" had a dull parkerized military finish instead of the more usual high gloss blue finish. The barrel was 18 and a half inches long, as opposed to the twenty inches of the civilian version. The advantages of the Ithaca Model 37 Shotgun over the Winchester, Mossberg and Remington models were that the Ithaca weighed a pound less, and could be used with equal ease by right or left-handed shooters due to the unique bottom ejection port and loading chamber it used. The Ithaca 37 is still in use today as the main shotgun carried by LAPD officers, and has been in use since the 1940s.
In response to increasing firepower carried by criminals, including fully automatic weapons and assault rifles, LAPD patrol officers were issued the Beretta 92F.  Later, officers were able to carry the Smith & Wesson Model 5906, a semi-automatic 9mm pistol, in addition to a few other approved weapons in 9mm caliber.
In response to the North Hollywood shootout of 1997, LAPD officers had the option of carrying the Smith & Wesson Model 4506 and 4566 service pistols in .45 ACP caliber.  Also due to the North Hollywood incident, qualified officers were issued patrol rifles called UPR (Urban Police Rifle) consisting mainly of AR-15 variants chambered in .223 after being certified from LAPD Urban Police Rifle School.
Until 2002, LAPD officers' standard issue pistol was the Beretta 92F/92FS. However, when William Bratton was appointed Chief of the LAPD, he allowed his officers to carry the Glock pistol, a weapon which the two previous departments he was chief at (the New York City Police Department and the Boston Police Department) carried. New officers graduating from the LAPD academy are now issued the Glock 22 or Glock 17 but can qualify in a variety of firearms.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lapdonline.org/training_division/content_basic_view/6384 |title=Firearms Section - official website of THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT |publisher=Lapdonline.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-25[/tpl]

SWAT's primary weapons are the Heckler & Koch MP5 series submachine guns and most officers choose the fixed stock A2 model. For assistant weapons, officers carry AR-15s and CAR-15s. In the '80s and early '90s they carried Colt RO727s and RO733s.  In 2000 they imported the M4A1s. In 2010 LAPD SWAT began issuing Heckler & Koch HK416 rifles.http://www.lapdonline.org/assets/jpeg/12%20MU%20HP%20416.jpg[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/mikesphotos_us/5173674713/ |title=20101030-PacDiv-SWAT-Gear-003 | Flickr - Photo Sharing! |publisher=Flickr |date=2010-10-30 |accessdate=2014-03-03[/tpl]
The LAPD recently announced that they will be incorporating a new shotgun, the Benelli M4 Super 90 and officers will go through additional training for the use of the semi-automatic shotgun and will have to privately purchase the gun if they elect to switch from the standard pump-action Remington 870.  The LAPD also has 37mm launchers and modified "beanbag" firing Remington 870s for crowd control when less than lethal force is needed.

==LAPD awards, commendations, citations and medals==

The department presents a number of medals to its members for meritorious service.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lapdonline.org/history_of_the_lapd/content_basic_view/1127|title=History|publisher=LAPD|accessdate=2008-08-11[/tpl] The medals that the LAPD awards to its officers are as follows:

===Bravery===

The Los Angeles Police Department Medal of Valor is the highest law enforcement medal awarded to officers by the Los Angeles Police Department. The Medal of Valor is an award for bravery, usually awarded to officers for individual acts of extraordinary bravery or heroism performed in the line of duty at extreme and life-threatening personal risk.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lapdonline.org/search_results/content_basic_view/27313|title=Medal of Valor|publisher=LAPD|accessdate=2008-08-05[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.libertylib.com/lapd-swat.shtml|title=LAPD Commendations|publisher=Liberty Library|accessdate=2008-08-05[/tpl]
The Liberty Award is a bravery medal for police canines killed or seriously injured in the line of duty. The award, which was inaugurated in 1990, is named after Liberty, a Metropolitan Division K-9 shot and killed in the line of duty. Liberty's handler received the Medal of Valor for the same incident. So far it has only been awarded once in the LAPD's history.
The Police Medal is an award for bravery, usually awarded to officers for individual acts of heroism in the line of duty, though not above and beyond the call of duty, as is required for the Medal of Valor.
The Police Star is an award for bravery, usually awarded to officers for performing with exceptional judgment and/or utilizing skillful tactics in order to defuse dangerous and stressful situations.
The Police Life-Saving Medal is an award for bravery, usually awarded to officers for taking action in order to rescue or attempt the rescue of either a fellow officer or any person from imminent danger.

The widely publicized case of Christine and Walter Collins was depicted in the 2008 film Changeling.  In March 1928, Christine Collins reported her nine-year-old son, Walter, missing.  Five months later a boy named Arthur Hutchins came forth claiming to be Walter.  When Mrs. Collins tried to tell the police that the boy was not her son, she was committed to a mental institution under a Section 12 internment.  It was later determined that Walter had actually fallen victim to a child rapist/murderer in the infamous Wineville Chicken Coop Murders.  Arthur Hutchins eventually admitted that he had lied about his identity in order to get to Hollywood and meet his favorite actor, Tom Mix.
Bloody Christmas was the name given to the severe beating of seven men by officers from the Los Angeles Police Department on December 25, 1951. The attacks, which left five hispanic and two white young men with broken bones and ruptured organs, was only properly investigated after lobbying from the Mexican American community. The internal inquiry by Los Angeles Chief of Police William H. Parker resulted in eight police officers being indicted for the assaults, 54 being transferred, and 39 suspended.

The lawsuit would eventually be settled in 1993, and Morgan was awarded $800,000 by the Los Angeles City Council.
In 1986, the department purchased a 14-ton armored breaching vehicle, used to smash quickly through the walls of houses of suspects.Patricia Klein, "A Ram at Rest: Quiet Times for L.A. Police Department's 'Battering' Vehicle", Los Angeles Times, February 10, 1986. Accessed November 30, 2010. The ACLU questioned the constitutionality of the vehicle.Langford v. Gates, 610 U.S. Dist. 120 (1985). Ultimately, the California Appellate Court ruled that the vehicle was unconstitutional, violating lawful search and seizure.Langford v. Gates, 43rd Cal. 3rd Dist. 233 (1987).
Early in his tenure as Chief of Police, Daryl Gates re-instituted the use of the choke hold (placing an arm or flashlight over someone's throat) to subdue suspects. In 1982, however, this technique left one suspect, James Mincey, Jr. in a coma for two weeks prior to his eventual death.Charles P. Wallace, "Tests Show No Drugs in Victim's Body", Los Angeles Times (May 1, 1982). Accessed on November 30, 2010. An investigation into the use of the choke hold found that sixteen people had died soon after being restrained by police choke holds.City of Los Angeles v. Heller, 475 U.S. 796 (1986). After the NAACP and ACLU brought this to the attention to the public, the Department discontinued the use of the choke hold.Martha L.

However, with the election of Richard Riordan in 1992 before the verdict, the reforms recommended by Christopher were put on hold.
After seven days of jury deliberations, the jury acquitted all four officers of assault and acquitted three of the four of using excessive force. The evening after the verdict, thousands of people in the Los Angeles area rioted over the six days following the verdict. Widespread looting, assault, arson, and murder occurred, and property damages totaled one billion dollars. In all, 53 people died during the riots."The L.A. 53". By Jim Crogan. LA Weekly.

On 1 August 1988, as part of Chief Gates’ '’Operation Hammer,’’ directed against gangs, paramilitary teams raided four apartments at 39th Street and Dalton Avenue. According to an investigation by the department’s Internal Affairs, the team leader, Captain Thomas Elfmont directed his men to “hit" the apartments "hard," to "level" them, and to leave them "uninhabitable."
The police detained 37 people, making seven arrests.  They also found six ounces of marijuana and a small amount of cocaine. The seven were beaten by the police and at the police station forced to whistle the them to the '’Andy Griffith Show’’. Those who refused were beaten again. Nobody was charged with a crime. The city paid four million dollars to settle the matter.Raid Of The Day: The 39th & Dalton Edition, by Radley Balko, 5 February 2013, Huffington PostRichard A.

LAPD officers fired numerous shots into the back of a blue pickup truck, allegedly without warning and injured the two women inside.  The second incident, twenty-five minutes later, involved the Torrance Police shooting into the windshield of another pickup truck, narrowly missing the driver.  In both cases the victims were not involved with the Dorner case.[tpl] cite news | url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2013/02/torrance-shootings.html| title=Police shoot two in Torrance in search for ex-LAPD cop| work=LA Times Blog | first=Kate | last=Mather | date=8 February 2013[/tpl] The Dorner case itself involved allegations of impropriety by other LAPD officers, as Dorner alleged that he had been fired for reporting brutality by his training officer.

===Rampart scandal and consent decree===

Following the Rampart Division C.R.A.S.H. scandal of the late 1990s - early 2000s, the United States Department of Justice entered into a consent decree with the LAPD regarding numerous civil rights violations.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.lapdonline.org/search_results/content_basic_view/928 |title= Consent Decree Overview: Civil Rights Consent Decree| accessdate=2008-04-02[/tpl]  Mayor Richard J. Riordan and the Los Angeles city council agreed to the terms of the decree on November 2, 2000.  The federal judge formally entered the decree into law on June 15, 2001. The consent decree is legally binding, and lasted until July 17, 2009, when U.S. District Court Judge Gary Feess terminated it.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.lapdonline.org/search_results/content_basic_view/928|title= Consent Decree Bureau|publisher=LAPD|accessdate=2013-10-06[/tpl] Under the terms of a transitional agreement approved by Feess, the Board of Police Commissioners and the Office of Inspector General, which monitors the department on behalf of the Board of Police Commissioners, will assume responsibility for keeping tabs on the department's efforts to fully implement a few still-incomplete or recently finished reforms. If lawyers for the U.S. Department of Justice are not satisfied with the oversight by the LAPD's inspector general, the agreement allows them to object and bring the department back before Feess.
The Rampart scandal mainly surrounded the unethical and illegal actions of members of the LAPD's anti-gang unit, Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums (CRASH). In particular, Javier Ovando, an unarmed teenager, had been shot and paralyzed by then-officer Rafael Pérez. After the shooting, Pérez planted a gun on Ovando and claimed self-defense. Ovando was sent to prison, although later he was exonerated and released. By 2001, the resulting investigations would lead to more than 75 officers being investigated or charged and over 100 criminal cases being overturned due to perjury or other forms of misconduct,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/lapd/scandal/cron.html|title=PBS Rampart Scandal Timeline|publisher=PBS|accessdate=2008-08-04[/tpl]  much based on the plea-bargain testimony of Perez.[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070311233626/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5933056/the_murder_of_the_notorious_big |title=Rolling Stone : The Murder of the Notorious B.I.G |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-03[/tpl]
The DOJ-LAPD consent decree places emphasis on the following nine major areas:
The consent decree includes several recommendations from the Rampart Board of Inquiry, and several consent decree provisions mandate the department to continue existing policies. Some of the more complex or major provisions in the decree call for the following:
There are several stakeholders in the LAPD consent decree compliance process. At the federal level, stakeholders include:
As the consent decree is a binding agreement between the city and the DOJ, the following city entities are key stakeholders:
The Consent Decree Bureau was the LAPD bureau charged with overseeing this process. Until 2009, the commanding officer of the Consent Decree Bureau, a civilian appointed by the chief of police, was Police Administrator Gerald L. Chaleff.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.lapdonline.org/home/comm_bio_view/7588|title= About the Consent Decree Bureau|publisher=LAPD|accessdate=2008-07-09[/tpl]

==In popular culture==

The CBS radio show Calling All Cars hired LAPD radio dispacher Jesse Rosenquist to be the voice of the dispatcher.  Rosenquist was already famous because home radios could tune into early police radio frequencies.  As the first police radio dispatcher presented to the public ear, his was the voice that actors went to when called upon for a radio dispatcher role.
The iconic television series Dragnet, with LAPD Detective Joe Friday as the primary character, was the first major media representation of the department.[tpl]cite book|author=Michael J. Hayde|title=My Name's Friday: The Unauthorized but True Story of Dragnet and the Films of Jack Webb|publisher=Cumberland House|year=2001|isbn=1-58182-190-5 [/tpl] Real LAPD operations inspired Jack Webb to create the series and close cooperation with department officers let him make it as realistic as possible, including authentic police equipment and sound recording on-site at the police station.
Due to Dragnet's popularity, LAPD Chief Parker "became after J. Edgar Hoover, the most well known and respected law enforcement official in the nation". In the 1960s, when the LAPD under Chief Thomas Reddin expanded its community relations division and began efforts to reach out to the African-American community, Dragnet followed suit with more emphasis on internal affairs and community policing than solving crimes, the show's previous mainstay.Michael J. Hayde, My Name's Friday: The Unauthorized but True Story of Dragnet and the Films of Jack Webb, Cumberland House, 2001, ISBN 1-58182-190-5, quote at p. 192.
Several prominent representations of the LAPD and its officers in television and film include Adam-12, The Rookies, Police Story, The Blue Knight, The Choirboys, Crime Wave, The Stone Killer, 10 to Midnight, Murphy's Law, Blue Streak, Blue Thunder, Boomtown, The Closer, Colors, Crash, Columbo, Dark Blue, Die Hard,
The Rookie, End of Watch, Heat, Hollywood Homicide, Hunter, Internal Affairs, Jackie Brown, L.A. Confidential, Lakeview Terrace, Law & Order: Los Angeles, Life, Major Crimes,  Numb3rs, Reservoir Dogs, The Shield, Southland, Speed, Street Kings, NCIS: Los Angeles, SWAT, Training Day and the Lethal Weapon, Rush Hour and Terminator film series. The LAPD is also featured in the video games Midnight Club II, Midnight Club: Los Angeles, True Crime: Streets of LA, L.A. Noire, L.A. Rush and Call of Juarez: The Cartel, and parodied in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and Grand Theft Auto V (Los Santos Police Department; Los Santos is a recreation of Los Angeles).
The LAPD has also been the subject of countless novels. Elizabeth Linington used the department as her backdrop in three different series written under three different names, perhaps the most popular being those novel featuring Detective Lieutenant Luis Mendoza, who was introduced in the Edgar-nominated Case Pending.  Joseph Wambaugh, the son of a Pittsburgh policeman, spent fourteen years in the department, using his background to write novels with authentic fictional depictions of life in the LAPD. Wambaugh also created the Emmy-winning TV anthology series Police Story. Wambaugh was also a major influence on James Ellroy, who wrote several novels about the Department set during the 1940s and 1950s, the most famous of which are probably The Black Dahlia, fictionalizing the LAPD's most famous "cold case", and L.A. Confidential, which was made into a film of the same name. Both the novel and the film chronicled mass-murder and corruption inside and outside the force during the Parker era.
