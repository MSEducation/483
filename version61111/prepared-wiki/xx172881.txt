At the general election in February 1982, he was defeated again in Cork South–Central, and also in the subsequent Seanad election.

At the 1999 local elections he was elected to Cork County Council a councillor for Carrigaline, but served only one term, losing that seat at the 2004 local elections.
In 1985 Barry Cogan was one of the key founders in Carrigaline of what became South Coast Community Television, a community group established to provide British TV channels to Carrigaline and subsequently other areas of County Cork.
