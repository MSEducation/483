Queensland Pride was first published as a monthly in January 1991, one month after the state of Queensland decriminalised male homosexuality. It was originally published as a newspaper, in a black-and-white newsprint format. It was the state's first gay and lesbian publication. Its founding editor was Raymond 'Wally' Cowin, who remained in the editorial role until February 2001. He was succeeded as editor by the then news editor, Iain Clacher, who remained editor of the title until January 2009, when he died of a heart attack. Clacher was succeeded as editor by Peter Hackney. Scott McGuinness and Andrew Blythe also served in the role, before Andrew Shaw took over from acting editor Anthony Smith in June 2012.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl] Shaw was previously editor of Melbourne LGBTI weekly Melbourne Community Voice from 2000 to 2003 and from 2009 to 2012.
In March 2001, Queensland Pride began publishing fortnightly. It reverted to a monthly publication schedule in March 2004, shortly after publication of the title was taken over by a new company, Special Publications Australia. Special Publications Australia sold the title to Sydney-based Evolution Publishing in June 2007.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.brisbanemediamap.com.au/public/client/609 |title=Queensland Pride |author= |date=22 October 2010 |work=Brisbane Media Map |publisher= |accessdate=28 June 2011 [/tpl] From June 2007 the publication changed from a newsprint format to a high-quality, full-colour, full-gloss format.
