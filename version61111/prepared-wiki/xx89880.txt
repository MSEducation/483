Very Proud of Ya is the second studio album by American rock band AFI. It was released on June 18, 1996 through Nitro Records.

==Background==

The liner notes of the album state that all the tracks are copyrighted to Anthems For Insubordinates, while the mailing address states the band's name as Asking For It. It is the last album to feature bassist Geoff Kresge, who illustrated the album cover as well.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl] The album features future band member Jade Puget performing back-up vocals.
The tracks "Two of a Kind" and "YÃ¼rf Rendenmein" were re-recorded from their debut album Answer That and Stay Fashionable. The title of "Love is a Many Splendored Thing" is a reference to the song of the same name by Sammy Fain and Paul Francis Webster, although it is not a cover. A music video directed by Darren Doane and Ken Daurio was made for the track "He Who Laughs Last".

==Track Listing==

On iTunes, two songs were misspelled. "Fishbowl" was misspelled "Fishbool" and "Modern Epic" was mistakenly "Modern Epidemic" but those were later corrected.
