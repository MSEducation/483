==Ernie Boch==

Ernie Boch, Jr. inherited the automobile sales and service business started by his grandfather, Andrew Boch, who began the family business in 1945 by purchasing a Nash Motors franchise in Norwood, Massachusetts.[tpl]cite journal|last=Earls|first=Alan R.|title=Sweet Song of Success|journal=Ward's Dealer Business|date=2005-02-05|url=http://wardsdealer.com/ar/auto_sweet_song_success/index.html|accessdate=2011-01-04[/tpl]
Andrew's son,  Ernie Boch Sr., built the Norwood operation into the top ranked Rambler dealer in the country by the early 1960s. This was accomplished on the strength of his drive and often "outlandish" television commercials with the catch phrase for anyone shown a new or used car without a Boch mini-sticker in the window:  "ask for the keys it's your car, my name is Ernie Boch." Later, Boch began using the National Airlines tag "Come on down!" which the airline used to promote travel to Florida before its merger with Pan American World Airways. Ernie Boch, Jr,'s father is also largely credited with bringing the "Automile" concept to U.S. Route 1 in Norwood.[tpl]cite book |first=Patricia J. |last=Fanning |title = Norwood: A History |publisher=Arcadia Publishing |year=2002 |page=148|isbn=978-0-7385-2404-7 |url= http://books.google.com/?id=vsdw_GzYMpYC&pg=PA148[/tpl]  With this concept, a large cluster of competing automobile dealerships join together to publicize the "Automile" as an automobile shopping center. 
Shortly after the death of Ernie Boch Sr., Boch Jr. appeared in a television commercial paying tribute to his father. Boch Jr. was in a car, watching images from an old commercial featuring his father, in the rear view mirror. Boch Jr. smiled and drove away.
Ernie Jr.'s first car was a 1971 Volkswagen Beetle, British racing green. He bought it in 1974, when he was 16, from the used-car department at his family's Toyota dealership.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2006/01/29/ernie_boch_jr/ |title=Ernie Boch Jr. |publisher=boston.com |accessdate=2011-01-04 |date=2006-01-29[/tpl]
His father, Ernie Boch, Sr., received some criticism from the Boston Brahmin culture and other elements of the upper class as a member of the nouveau riche of the region.[tpl]Cite book |first=Grant David |last=McCracken |title=Transformations: identity construction in contemporary culture|publisher=Indiana University Press |year=2008 |page=210 |isbn=978-0-253-21957-2 | url=http://books.google.com/?id=0LvyVaZxRt4C&pg=PT237 |accessdate=2011-01-04 |postscript=[tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl]
