[[Direct Xa inhibitor]]

CATEGORIES: Anticoagulants

Direct factor Xa inhibitors (xabans') are a class of anticoagulant drugs which act directly upon Factor X in the coagulation cascade, without using antithrombin as a mediator.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/456874_5 |title=Medscape.com  |format= |work= |accessdate=2009-01-23[/tpl]

==Clinical uses==

Direct factor Xa inhibitors are being used clinically. Clinical trials have shown promise for these compounds as substitutes for the currently administered vitamin K antagonists or low molecular weight heparin. Those trials demonstrated efficacy and safety against warfarin for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation and against low-molecular-weight heparin for treatment and secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism or for initial treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing hip or knee replacement.[tpl]cite journal|last=Bauer|first=K.

Advantages of orally administered direct Xa inhibitors lie in the fact that they have a rapid onset and offset of action which reduces need for "bridging" with a parenteral anticoagulant, that they don't require frequent monitoring or re-dosing whilst having few strong drug interactions and no food interactions, leading to greater convenience by patients and doctors and that they have a lower risk of intra cranial bleeding in trials.
Disadvantages compared to warfarin include the currently limited prospective experience, concerns regarding patient adherence without laboratory monitoring, uncertainty about dosing in some patient populations (eg, renal dysfunction, marked extremes of body weight), their contraindication in severe renal impairment, their lack of specific antidotes and assays to measure drug levels in case of severe bleeding, their potential to overuse in low risk atrial fibrillation people, their short half live affecting efficacy and theirnhigher drug acquisition costs.

==Products==

A new series of oral, direct-acting inhibitors of Factor Xa have entered clinical development, and are competitors of dabigatran, which is  a direct thrombin (factor IIa) inhibitor. These include rivaroxaban (Xarelto) from Bayer, apixaban (Eliquis) from Bristol-Myers Squibb, betrixaban (LY517717) from Portola Pharmaceuticals, darexaban (YM150) from Astellas and edoxaban (Lixiana) (DU-176b) from Daiichi.[tpl]cite journal|last=Turpie|first=AG|title=New oral anticoagulants in atrial fibrillation.|journal=European heart journal|date=Jan 2008|volume=29|issue=2|pages=155–65|pmid=18096568[/tpl]  And more recent TAK-442 (Takeda) and eribaxaban (PD0348292) (Pfizer).
The developpement of darexaban was discontinued in september 2011: in a trial for prevention of recurrences of myocardial infarction in top of dual anti platelet therapy, the drug didn't work and the risk for bleeding was increased by 300%.[tpl]cite news|last=Grogan|first=Kevin|title=Astellas pulls the plug on darexaban|url=http://www.pharmatimes.com/Article/11-09-29/Astellas_pulls_the_plug_on_darexaban.aspx|accessdate=11 April 2014|newspaper=Pharmatimes|date=September 29, 2011[/tpl]

==History==

A naturally occurring inhibitor of factor Xa was first reported in 1987. Tuszynski et al. discovered antistasin, which was isolated from the extracts of Mexican leech, Haementeria officinalis. Soon after this, another naturally occurring inhibitor, tick anticoagulant peptide (TAP) was isolated from the extract of tick Ornithodoros moubata.[tpl]cite web|title=P15358 antistasin|url=http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P15358|publisher=Uniprot|accessdate=11 April 2014[/tpl]
