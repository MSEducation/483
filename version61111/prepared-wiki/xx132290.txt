A flexible display is a display which is flexible in nature; differentiable from the more prevalent traditional flat screen displays used in most electronics devices. In the recent years there has been a growing interest from numerous consumer electronics manufacturers to apply this display technology in e-readers, mobile phones and other consumer electronics.

==History==

===Flexible electronic paper based displays===

Flexible electronic paper (e-paper) based displays were the first flexible displays conceptualized and prototyped. Though this form of flexible displays has a long history and were attempted by many companies, it is only recently that this technology began to see commercial implementations slated for mass production to be used in consumer electronic devices.

====Xerox PARC====

The concept of developing a flexible display was first put forth by Xerox PARC (Palo Alto Research Company). In 1974, Nicholas K. Sheridon, a PARC employee, made a major breakthrough in flexible display technology and produced the first flexible e-paper display. Dubbed Gyricon, this new display technology was designed to mimic the properties of paper, but married with the capacity to display dynamic digital images. Sheridon envisioned the advent of paperless offices and sought commercial applications for Gyricon.[tpl]cite web|url=http://thefutureofthings.com/articles/1000/the-future-of-electronic-paper.html|title=The Future of Electronic Paper|author=Iddo Genuth|date=15 October 2007|publisher=The Future of Things|accessdate=12 February 2013[/tpl] In 2003 Gyricon LLC was formed as a direct subsidiary of Xerox to commercialize the electronic paper technology developed at Xerox PARC.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.parc.com/event/191/gyricon-llc-and-the-world-of-electronic-paper.html|title=Gyricon LLC and the World of Electronic Paper|author=Xerox PARC|date=9 December 2003|publisher=Xerox PARC|accessdate=12 February 2013[/tpl] Gyricon LLC's operations were short lived and in December 2005 Xerox closed the subsidiary company in a move to focus on licensing the technology instead.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/mbusinessreview/stories/index.ssf?/mbusinessreview/se/stories/20051215_scio.html|title=Xerox erases electronic paper subsidiary, Gyricon LLC, in Scio Twp|author=Brian Hamilton|date=15 December 2005|publisher=Ann Arbor Business Review|accessdate=12 February 2013[/tpl]

====HP and ASU====

In 2005, Arizona State University opened a 250,000 square foot facility dedicated to flexible display research named the ASU Flexible Display Center (FDC). ASU received $43.7 million from the Army Research Lab towards the development of this research facility. A planned prototype device was slated for public demonstration later that year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2005/02/09/arizona-state-opens-flexible-display-center/|title=Arizona State opens flexible-display center|author=Marc Perton|date=9 February 2005|publisher=Engadget|accessdate=12 February 2013[/tpl] However, the project met a series of delays. In December 2008, ASU in partnership with Hewlett Packard finally demonstrated a prototype flexible e-paper from the Flexible Display Center at the university.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2008/12/08/hp-and-asu-demo-bendable-unbreakable-electronic-displays/|title=HP and ASU demo bendable, unbreakable electronic displays|author=Brian Hamilton|date=8 December 2008|publisher=Engadget|accessdate=12 February 2013[/tpl] HP continued on with the research, and in 2010, showcased another demonstration.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2010/03/20/hp-flexible-display-unfurled-on-video/|title=HP flexible display unfurled on video|author=Donald Melanson|date=20 March 2010|publisher=Engadget|accessdate=12 February 2013[/tpl] However, due to limitations in technology, HP stated “company doesn't actually see these panels being used in truly flexible or rollable displays, but instead sees them being used to simply make displays thinner and lighter.”

====Plastic Logic====

This company develops and manufactures colour and monochrome plastic flexible displays in various sizes based on its proprietary organic thin film transistor (OTFT) technology.[tpl]cite web|title=All-Plastic Electronics Power Flexible Color Display|url=http://www.designnews.com/author.asp?section_id=1392&doc_id=245254&f_src=designnews_gnews&dfpPParams&dfpPParams=ind_183,industry_consumer,industry_medical,bid_27,aid_245254&dfpLayout=blog|date=7 June 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Plastic Logic Shows Off New 10.7 Color Display Screen|url=http://goodereader.com/blog/e-paper/plastic-logic-shows-off-new-10-7-color-display-screen/|date=4 September 2012[/tpl] The displays are manufactured in the company's purpose-built factory in Dresden, Germany, which was the first factory of its kind to be built - dedicated to the high volume manufacture of organic electronics.[tpl]cite news|title=Plastic Logic Opens World's First Commercial Plastic Electronics Manufacturing Factory|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2008/09/17/idUS125673+17-Sep-2008+BW20080917|date=17 September 2008 | work=Reuters[/tpl] These flexible displays are cited as being "unbreakable", because they are made completely of plastic and do not contain glass. They are also lighter and thinner than glass-based displays and low-power. Applications of this flexible display technology include signage,[tpl]cite web|title=Plastic Logic unveils 42-inch flexible plastic signage prototype|url=http://www.slashgear.com/plastic-logic-unveils-42-inch-flexible-plastic-signage-prototype-05272530/|date=5 March 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=SERELEC and Plastic Logic introduce ZED - a low-power outdoor digital signage solution|url=http://www.plasticlogic.com/news/?itemid=MjAxMTMxNzAxNDcwMQ==|date=28 January 2013[/tpl] wristwatches and wearable devices[tpl]cite web|title=Plastic Logic shows off colour e-paper display smart watch concept: the future of wearable tech?|url=http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/120209-plastic-logic-colour-e-paper-smart-watch-concept|date=26 March 2013[/tpl] as well as automotive and mobile devices.[tpl]cite news|title=Bend me, shape me: Flexible phones 'out by 2013'|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-20526577|date=30 November 2012 | work=BBC News[/tpl]

====Organic User Interfaces and the Human Media Lab====

In 2004, a team lead by Prof. Roel Vertegaal at Queen's University's Human Media Lab in Canada developed PaperWindows,Holman, D., Vertegaal, R. and Troje, N. (2005). PaperWindows: Interaction Techniques for Digital Paper. In Proceedings of ACM CHI 2005 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems. ACM Press, 591-599. the first prototype bendable paper computer and first Organic User Interface. Since full-colour, US Letter-sized displays were not available at the time, PaperWindows deployed a form of active projection mapping of computer windows on real paper documents that worked together as one computer through 3D tracking. At a lecture to the Gyricon and Human-Computer Interaction teams at Xerox PARC on May 4, 2007, Prof. Vertegaal publicly introduced the term Organic User Interface (OUI) as a means of describing the implications of non-flat display technologies on user interfaces of the future: paper computers, flexible form factors for computing devices, but also encompassing rigid display objects of any shape, with wrap-around, skin-like displays. The lecture was published a year later as part of a special issue on Organic User InterfacesHolman, H. and Vertegaal R. Organic user interfaces: designing computers in any way, shape, or form. Communications of the ACM 51(6), June 2008, 26-30. in the Communications of the ACM.

Since 2010 Sony Electronics, AU Optronics and LG Electronics have all expressed interest in developing flexible e-paper displays.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.auo.com/?sn=107&lang=en-US&c=10&n=299|title=AUO Unveils Flexible E-Paper Technology|author=AUO News Center|date=20 October 2009|publisher=AU Optronics|accessdate=12 February 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2010/09/15/sony-demoes-flexible-electronic-paper-display-tickles-our-fancy/|title=Sony demoes flexible electronic paper display, tickles our fancy|author=Vlad Savov|date=15 September 2010|publisher=Engadget|accessdate=12 February 2013[/tpl] However, only LG have formally announced plans for mass production of flexible e-paper displays.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theverge.com/2012/3/28/2910102/lg-mass-produce-flexible-e-ink-screen|title=LG begins mass production of flexible e-paper display|author=Sean Hollister|date=28 March 2012|publisher=The Verge|accessdate=12 February 2013[/tpl]

===Flexible OLED-based displays===

Research and development into flexible e-paper-based displays largely began in late 2000s with the main intensions of implementing this technology in mobile devices. However, this technology has recently made an appearance, to a moderate extent, in consumer television displays as well.

====Nokia Morph and Kinetic concepts====

Nokia first conceptualized the application of flexible OLED displays in mobile phone with the Nokia Morph concept mobile phone. Released to the press in February 2008, the Morph concept was project Nokia had co-developed with the University of Cambridge.[tpl]cite web|url=http://research.nokia.com/morph|title=The Morph Concept |author=Nokia Research Center|date=February 2008|publisher=Nokia|accessdate=12 February 2013[/tpl] WIth the Morph, Nokia intended to demonstrated their vision of future mobile devices to incorporate flexible and polymorphic designs; allowing the device to seamlessly change and match a variety of needs by the user within various environments.[tpl]cite web|url=http://press.nokia.com/2008/02/25/nokia-and-university-of-cambridge-launch-the-morph-a-nanotechnology-concept-device/|title=Nokia and University of Cambridge launch the Morph - a nanotechnology concept device|author=Nokia Press Center|date=25 February  2008|publisher=Nokia|accessdate=12 February 2013[/tpl] Though the focus of the Morph was to demonstrate the potential of nanotechnology, it pioneered the concept of utilizing a flexible video display in a consumer electronics device. Nokia renewed their interest in flexible mobile devices again in 2011 with the Nokia Kinetic concept.[tpl]cite web|url=http://conversations.nokia.com/2011/10/28/nokia-kinetic-bendy-phone-is-the-next-big-thing-video/|title=Nokia Kinetic bendy phone is the next big thing|author=Trevor Davies|date=28 October 2011|publisher=Conversations by Nokia|accessdate=12 February 2013[/tpl] Nokia unveiled the Kinetic flexible phone prototype at Nokia World 2011 in London, alongside Nokia’s new range of Windows Phone 7 devices.[tpl]cite web|url=http://press.nokia.com/2011/10/26/nokia-showcases-bold-portfolio-of-new-phones-services-and-accessories-at-nokia-world/|title=Nokia showcases bold portfolio of new phones, services and accessories at Nokia World|author=Nokia Press Center|date=26 October 2011|publisher=Nokia|accessdate=12 February 2013[/tpl] The Kinetic proved to be a large departure from the Morph physically, but it still incorporated Nokia's vision of polymorphism in mobile devices.

==Technical details==

===Electronic paper===

Flexible displays using electronic paper technology commonly use Electrophoretic or Electrowetting technologies. However, each type of flexible electronic paper vary in specification due to different implementation techniques by different companies.

====HP and ASU e-paper====

The flexible electronic paper display technology co-developed by Arizona State University and HP employs a manufacturing process developed by HP Labs called Self-Aligned Imprint Lithography (SAIL).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hpl.hp.com/news/2009/jan-mar/electronicpaper.html|title=HP and Arizona State University Demo Flexible, Unbreakable Displays|author=HP Press Center|date=Spring 2009|publisher=HP|accessdate=12 February 2013[/tpl] The screens are made by layering stacks of semi-conductor materials and metals between pliable plastic sheets. The stacks need to be perfectly aligned and stay that way. Alignment proves difficult during manufacturing when heat during manufacturing can deform the materials and when the resulting screen also needs to remain flexible. The SAIL process gets around this by ‘printing’ the semiconductor pattern on a fully composed substrate, so that the layers always remain in perfect alignment. The limitation of the material the screen is based on allows only a finite amount of full rolls, hence limiting its commercial application as a flexible display. Specifications provided regarding the prototype display are as follows:

====AUO e-paper====

The flexible electronic paper display announced by AUO is unique as it is the only solar powered variant. A separate rechargeable battery is also attached when solar charging is unavailable.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theverge.com/2011/10/28/2521831/auo-makes-flexible-solar-powered-epaper|title=AUO makes flexible solar powered epaper|author=Joseph Parish|date=28 October 2011|publisher=The Verge|accessdate=12 February 2013[/tpl]

==Concept devices==

===Mobile devices===

In May 2011, Human Media Lab at Queen's University in Canada introduced PaperPhone, the first flexible smartphone, in partnership with the Arizona State University Flexible Display Center. PaperPhone used 5 bend sensors to implement navigation of the user interface through bend gestures of corners and sides of the display. In January 2013, the Human Media Lab introduced the first flexible tablet PC, PaperTab, in collaboration with Plastic Logic and Intel Labs, at CES. PaperTab is a multi-display environment in which each display represents a window, app or computer document. Displays are tracked in 3D to allow multidisplay operations, such as collate to enlarge the display space, or pointing with one display onto another to pull open a document file. In April 2013 in Paris, the Human Media Lab, in collaboration with Plastic Logic, unveiled the world's first actuated flexible smartphone prototype, MorePhone. MorePhone actuates its body to notify users upon receiving a phone call or message.
Nokia introduced the Kinetic concept phone at Nokia World 2011 in London. The flexible OLED display allows users to interact with the phone by twisting, bending, squeezing and folding in different manners across both the vertical and horizontal planes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theverge.com/2011/10/31/2527890/nokia-kinetic-device-demo|title=Nokia Kinetic device demo|author=Vlad Savov|date=1 November 2011|publisher=The Verge|accessdate=12 February 2013[/tpl] The technology journalist website Engadget described interactions such as "when bend the screen towards yourself, device acts as a selection function, or zooms in on any pictures you're viewing."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2011/10/26/nokias-kinetic-future-flexible-screens-and-a-twisted-interface/|title=Nokia's kinetic future: flexible screens and a twisted interface|author=Mat Smith|date=26 October 2011|publisher=Engadget|accessdate=12 February 2013[/tpl] Nokia envisioned this type of device to be available to consumers in "as little as three years", and claimed to already process "the technology to produce it."
At CES 2013, Samsung showcased the two handsets which incorporates AMOLED flexible display technology during its keynote presentation, the Youm and an unnamed Windows Phone 8 prototype device.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ces.cnet.com/8301-34435_1-57563058/eyes-on-samsungs-youm-flexible-display-tech-at-ces-2013/|title=Eyes-on: Samsung's Youm flexible-display tech at CES 2013|author=Josh Lowensohn|date=9 January 2013|publisher=CNET|accessdate=12 February 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/ces/9792166/CES-2013-Samsung-flexible-phone-prototype-unveiled.html|title=CES 2013: Samsung flexible phone prototype unveiled|author=Matt Warman|date=10 January 2013|publisher= The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=12 February 2013|location=London[/tpl] The Youm possesses a static implementation of flexible AMOLED display technology, as its screen has a set curvature along one of its edges.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/9/3855960/samsung-flexible-oled-phone-prototype-hands-on|title=Samsung shows off flexible AMOLED phone prototype (hands-on)|author=Dante D'Orazio|date=9 January 2013|publisher=The Verge|accessdate=12 February 2013[/tpl] The benefit of the curvature allows users "to read text messages, stock tickers, and other notifications from the side of the device even if user have a case covering the screen." The screen is described to be a 16:9 aspect ratio at a 720p resolution. The unnamed Windows Phone 8 prototype device is composed of a solid base from which extends a flexible AMOLED display. The AMOLED display itself bends and was described as "virtually unbreakable even when dropped" according to Samsung representatives. Brian Berkeley, the senior vice president of Samsung Display, believes that this flexible form factor "will really begin to change how people interact with their devices, opening up new lifestyle possibilities ... and allow our partners to create a whole new ecosystem of devices."

===Curved OLED TVs===

LG Electronics and Samsung Electronics both introduced curved OLED televisions with a curved display at CES 2013 hours apart from each other.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/8/3851310/samsung-curved-oled-tv|title=Samsung introduces 'world's first' curved OLED TV|author=David Pierce|date=8 January 2013|publisher=The Verge|accessdate=12 February 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/8/3852438/battle-of-the-curved-oled-tvs-lg-matches-samsung-oled-curved-tv|title=Battle of the curved OLED TVs: LG matches Samsung with its own 'world's first'|author=David Pierce|date=8 January 2013|publisher=The Verge|accessdate=12 February 2013[/tpl] Both companies recognized their respective curved OLED prototype television as a first-of-its-kind due to its flexed OLED display.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.samsung.com/us/news/20352|title=SAMSUNG Introduces World’s First Curved OLED TV at CES 2013|author=Samsung News Center|date=8 January 2013|publisher=Samsung Electronics|accessdate=12 February 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lgnewsroom.com/newsroom/contents/62967|title=LG SHOWS ITS FIRST OLED TV WITH CURVED SCREEN|author=LG News Room|date=9 January 2013|publisher=LG Electronics|accessdate=12 February 2013[/tpl] The technology journalist website The Verge noted the subtle curve on 55" Samsung OLED TV allowed it to have a "more panoramic, more immersive viewing experience, and actually improves viewing angles from the side." The experience was also shared viewing the curved 55" LG OLED TV. It should be noted that the LG set is also 3D capable, in addition to the curvature.
