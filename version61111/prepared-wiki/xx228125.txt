The Kansas City Missouri Temple is the 137th operating temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).  It is the first to be built in the Greater Kansas City area.  Previous attempts at building an LDS temple in the area failed in Independence in 1833 and Far West in 1838, after LDS founder Joseph Smith had selected and dedicated locations for their construction. A temple was completed in Independence in 1994 by the Community of Christ church, which is not affiliated with the LDS Church and does not serve the same theological functions.

==Announcement and construction==

The announcement of the new temple was made on October 4, 2008 during the church's 178th Semiannual general conference by LDS Church president Thomas S. Monson. When the announcement was made, Monson did not specify whether the temple would be constructed in Kansas or Missouri.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700264138/Rome-LDS-temple-four-others-announced.html |newspaper= Deseret News |date= October 5, 2008  |first= James M |last= Dougherty |title= Rome LDS temple, four others announced |accessdate= 2012-10-15 [/tpl] However, a later press release confirmed that the temple would be built in the Shoal Creek development in Clay County, Missouri.[tpl]citation |url= http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/ldsnewsroom/eng/news-releases-stories/new-temple-site-locations-announced |publisher= LDS Church |date= October 7, 2008 |contribution= New Temple Site Locations Announced |title= News Story |work= Newsroom |accessdate= 2012-10-15 [/tpl] This was the second temple built in Missouri, after the St. Louis Missouri Temple.  
The Kansas City Missouri Temple was announced concurrently with the Philadelphia Pennsylvania, Calgary Alberta, CÃ³rdoba Argentina and Rome Italy temples.
On October 22, 2009, the Kansas City Council approved The Meadows at Searcy Creek First Plat, the subdivision of the Shoal Creek development where the temple is located.  The plat includes the lot for a church meetinghouse as well as the temple.[tpl]citation |url= http://cityclerk.kcmo.org/LiveWeb/Meetings/CouncilMinutes.aspx?q=ldjGkY8LZZzB%2b8t09Sj578qFenyLEQW3xSGL2U4ViJ1n1o%2b0jssbK5mqrNhAfrnxT0v7UWqwMgI%3d |contribution= Ordinance 090883 |title= Kansas City Council Record |date= October 22, 2009 |publisher= Office of the City Clerk of Kansas City |accessdate= 2012-10-15 [/tpl]  Site work in the development, including acquiring property for the future temple, commenced in late October.
