==Plot Summary==

Miss Emily Sidley teaches third grade. On one particular day while she is teaching spelling, she gets the disconcerting feeling that one of her students is staring at her. She turns around and notices that Robert, the quietest student, has his gaze fixed on her. During the following week, Miss Sidley eventually punishes Robert for her suspicions. Robert taunts her by asking her if she wants to see him change which he does (whether it really happened or was a figment of her imagination is not exactly explained) and terrifies the teacher who runs screaming and is nearly run down by a bus. 
After the incident, Miss Sidley takes a leave of absence. When she returns, Robert taunts her at recess about there being more creatures at school. The terrified teacher soon decides to take drastic measures. She takes out her deceased brother's gun from a drawer and puts it in her purse. That day at school, she takes twelve of her students to the testing room and shoots each one dead. Another teacher soon comes upon the carnage before Miss Sidley can kill another student.
Miss Sidley is sent to a mental institution after the murders. She works with little preschoolers each day for therapy. One day she feels the fear that drove her to her crime and asks to be removed from the room. That night, Miss Sidley commits suicide by slashing her throat and her former psychiatrist soon focuses intently on the children.
