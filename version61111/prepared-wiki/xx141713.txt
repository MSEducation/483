[[List of Hewitts and Nuttalls in Wales]]

CATEGORIES: Hewitts of Wales, Nuttalls, Lists of mountains and hills of Wales

This is a list of mountains in Wales over 2,000 feet.
Nuttalls are hills in England and Wales that are at least [tpl]convert|2000|ft[/tpl] high with a relative height of at least [tpl]convert|15|m|abbr=on[/tpl]. The list was compiled by John and Anne Nuttall and published in The Mountains of England & Wales.[tpl]cite book |author=John & Anne Nuttall |title=The Mountains of England & Wales - Volume 1: Wales |edition= 2nd |year=1999 |publisher=Cicerone (publisher) |location=Milnthorpe, Cumbria |isbn=978-1-85284-304-5[/tpl]
Hewitts are hills in England, Wales and Ireland that are at least 2,000 ft high with a relative height of at least [tpl]convert|30|m|abbr=on[/tpl]. This list was compiled by Alan Dawson and originally published in The Relative Hills of Britain[tpl]cite book |author=Alan Dawson |year=1992 |title=The Relative Hills of Britain |url=http://bubl.ac.uk/org/tacit/marilyns/ |publisher=Cicerone Press |location=Milnthorpe |isbn=978-1-85284-068-6[/tpl] under the name Sweats. The list was subsequently renamed Hewitts, updated, and published in The Hewitts and Marilyns of Wales.[tpl]cite book |title=The Hewitts and Marilyns of Wales |author=Alan Dawson |url=http://bubl.ac.uk/org/tacit/tables/wales/ |isbn=978-0-9522680-6-2 |publisher=TACit Press |location=Cambuskenneth, Stirling |year=1997[/tpl]
Other than the inclusion of Ireland, the only difference between Nuttalls and Hewitts is that hills with a relative height between 15 and 30 m are Nuttalls but not Hewitts. This corresponds to roughly a quarter of all Nuttalls, and the exclusion of these least prominent Nuttalls was one of the reasons why the list of Hewitts was produced.
In the tables below, rows have been coloured according to which list(s) the hills are on. Hills that are additionally Marilyns or that are on the list of hills with a 600 m drop are also distinguished. In the parent column, the prominence parent is used where possible. The prominence parent of a peak can be found by dividing the island or region in question into territories by tracing the runoff from the key col of every higher peak. The prominence parent is the higher peak in whose territory the original peak resides.[tpl]cite web |url=http://peaklist.org/theory/theory.html |title=Prominence Theory |accessdate=January 17, 2008 |author=Aaron Maizlish |year=2003[/tpl] Prominence parentage data is unavailable for Nuttalls and Hewitts, so the hills' parent Marilyns are shown. The parent Marilyn of a hill is the Marilyn whose territory a peak resides in.
There are 190 Nuttalls on the list, of which 138 are Hewitts, and 53 are Marilyns.
