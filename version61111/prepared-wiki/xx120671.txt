Carmarthenshire County Council ([tpl]lang-cy|Cyngor Sir Gaerfyrddin[/tpl]) is the local authority for the county of Carmarthenshire, Wales, providing a range of services under the control of elected county councillors that include education, planning, transport, social services and public safety. The council is one of twenty-two unitary authorities that came into existence on 1 April 1996 under the provisions of the Local Government (Wales) Act 1994. It took over local government functions previously provided by Carmarthen District, Dinefwr Borough,  Llanelli Borough councils and the Carmarthenshire area of what was Dyfed County Council.
The council is based in County Hall in Carmarthen. The County Hall was designed by Percy Thomas in 1935 but not completed until 1955. It replaced the Carmarthen Gaol built by John Nash on part of Carmarthen Castle's site.
