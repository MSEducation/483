Love is War is Vanilla Ninja's fourth studio album, released by EMI Music Germany in May 2006. This is the first album by girls as a three-piece band. The process of recording took about 6 months. Most of the songs are co-written by the band members - Lenna and Piret, what makes this album the most personal for girls. For example the song "Kingdom Burning Down" tells a story of their fight with ex producer and as girls say "every song is dedicated to someone and they have important meaning for us".Love is War album page 
The first single from this album was "Dangerzone", which was quite successful in Germany and Poland. Vanilla Ninja performed this song on Sopot International Song Festival in Poland. Later, the single "Rockstarz" was released. However, due to many release date changes caused by EMI, the single did not chart well and girls were dropped from the label.
