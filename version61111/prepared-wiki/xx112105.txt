According to an article dated November 5, 2008,InsideDefense.com article, AFRL: NO CHANGES PLANNED FOR ADVANCED TACTICAL LASER PROGRAM there is a recent Air Force Scientific Advisory Board report that states "the Advanced Tactical Laser testbed has no operational utility." That does not mean it's not necessarily a good idea, but that it may need further development. The Air Force Research Laboratory continues to run tests and develop the platform. There is some discussion of converting to solid state lasers from the existing chemical lasers. Being much smaller and lighter, solid state lasers might be deployable on smaller platforms. The existing chemical laser platform is being used to develop more advanced control software and hardware and to reduce problems such as "jitter".
On June 18, 2009 it was announced that the ATL was successfully fired in flight for the first time.  The system was fired from a 46th Test Wing NC-130H aircraft while flying over White Sands Missile Range, successfully hitting a target board on the ground.Advanced tactical laser aircraft fires high-power laser in flight
