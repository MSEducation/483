[[Heartland Collegiate Athletic Conference]]

CATEGORIES: Heartland Collegiate Athletic Conference

The Heartland Collegiate Athletic Conference (HCAC) is an intercollegiate athletic conference affiliated with the NCAA's Division III.  Member institutions are located in Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio.   Although officially instituted during the 1998-1999 season, the HCAC actually traces its history to the formation of the Indiana Collegiate Athletic Conference (ICAC) in 1987.
Original members of the HCAC included Anderson, Bluffton, Franklin, Hanover, Manchester, Mount St. Joseph, Wabash, and Wilmington. Of the ten current members, six were founding members of the former ICAC.
Former members include DePauw (1987-1998),Taylor (1988-1991), Wabash (1987-1999), and Wilmington (1998-2000). Rose–Hulman Institute of Technology (1988-1998) re-joined as of July 1, 2006.

==History==

The Indiana Collegiate Athletic Conference (ICAC) was formed in June 1987, with 1990-1991 being the first full season of competition (all eight teams competing in eight varsity sports).
Charter members in 1987 included Anderson University, DePauw University, Franklin College, Hanover College, Manchester College, and Wabash College. Rose–Hulman Institute of Technology and Taylor University later joined in 1988.
The addition of three Ohio schools (Bluffton College, the College of Mount St. Joseph, and Wilmington College) and the departure of two Indiana schools (DePauw and Rose–Hulman) during the 1998-1999 season prompted a change in name to Heartland Collegiate Athletic Conference. Wabash and Wilmington later departed in the 1998-99 and 1999-2000 seasons respectively. Transylvania University joined in 2001. Rose–Hulman would re-join the HCAC, effectively for the 2006-07 season.
The most recent expansion was when Earlham College of Richmond, Indiana was accepted as the 10th member of the conference in October of 2009 to begin competition in the fall of 2010.
