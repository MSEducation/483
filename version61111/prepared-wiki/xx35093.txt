</ref> Until the [[Delaware Memorial Bridge]] opened in 1951, a ferry connected New Jersey Route 48 to [[Delaware Route 48]] in Wilmington. U.S. Route 40 had used this ferry, but was eventually moved to a ferry that ran from [[New Castle, Delaware]] to [[Pennsville, New Jersey|Pennsville]], with U.S. Route 40 being rerouted to follow present-day [[New Jersey Route 49|Route 49]], various local roads, and County Route 551 to reach Route 48 and continue east along with that route.<ref name="Map2">[tpl]cite web|author= Nitzman, Alex |url=http://www.aaroads.com/delaware/road_maps.htm|title=1928 Delaware Road Map|publisher= AARoads | accessdate=2009-03-04[/tpl]</ref><ref name="Map3">[tpl]cite web|author= Nitzman, Alex |url=http://www.aaroads.com/delaware/road_maps.htm|title=1938 Delaware Road Map|publisher= AARoads | accessdate=2009-03-04[/tpl]</ref> Following the completion of both the Delaware Memorial Bridge and the New Jersey Turnpike in 1951, U.S. Route 40 was routed off more of Route 48 onto a new alignment, joining the route at its current eastern terminus.<ref name="Map4">[tpl]cite web|author= Nitzman, Alex |url=http://www.aaroads.com/delaware/road_maps.htm|title=1951 Delaware Road Map|publisher= AARoads | accessdate=2009-03-30[/tpl]</ref> In the [[1953 renumbering]] of New Jersey state highways, Route 48 was designated onto its current alignment from U.S. Route 130 to U.S. Route 40, with the rest of the route dropped in favor of the U.S. Route 40 designation.
