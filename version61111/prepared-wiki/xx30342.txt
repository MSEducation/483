==Plot==

The story is a shōnen comedy that takes place in the Kanagawa Prefecture, and centers on Keitaro Urashima and his attempts to fulfill a childhood promise that he made with a girl to enter Tokyo University together. However, he has forgotten the name of the girl he made the promise to and hopes to be accepted into Tokyo University in order to find her. After failing the entrance exam twice and his parents no longer willing to support him, he goes to stay at his grandmother's hotel, only to find that it has been converted to a female-only apartments.  He is about to be kicked out by the girls, when his aunt announced that his grandmother has given him the titles of the apartments, and he stays on as the manager of the family-owned girls' dorm [tpl]Nihongo|Hinata House|日向荘|Hinata Sō|also known as Hinata Apartments[/tpl].  Now he has to balance his new responsibilities with his attempts to pass the university entrance exam.
At Hinata House, Keitaro meets Naru Narusegawa, who is also studying to enter Tokyo University. Naru ranked first in the whole of Japan on the practice exams, and Keitaro convinces her to help him study. Keitaro accidentally reads a small section of Naru's diary and as the two grow closer through their studies, Keitaro becomes increasingly convinced that Naru may be the girl he made the promise with. On the second day of the Tokyo University exam, Keitaro asks Naru about the promise and is stunned when she tells him he is mistaken. Despite their studying, and Naru's mock exam results, they both fail the exams. The pair then have an argument and independently run off to Kyoto to clear their heads. While on their trip they settle their differences and meet Mutsumi Otohime, who lives in Okinawa and is also studying for the Tokyo University exams.
After returning from Kyoto, Keitaro and Naru eventually decide to retake the exams. After a while, Mutsumi moves to Tokyo, and the three begin to study together. During this period, Naru becomes convinced that Mutsumi is Keitaro's promised girl, but Mutsumi states that she made a childhood promise with Naru, not Keitaro. During the Tokyo University exams, Keitaro believes he has failed them once again and runs away before finding out his results. After learning of this, Naru chases after him without checking her exam results, and is eventually followed by the rest of the residents of Hinata House who announce that Keitaro and Naru both passed the exams along with Mutsumi. However, at the Tokyo University opening ceremony, Keitaro has an accident and is unable to attend the University for three months. After recovering from his injuries, Keitaro decides to study overseas with Noriyasu Seta. As Keitaro leaves, Naru finally confesses her true feelings to him at the airport and decides to wait for him to return.
When Keitaro returns, he and Naru finally begin to express their feelings for each other. After they deal with new obstacles, Grandma Hina returns to Hinata House and reveals Naru is the girl of Keitaro's promise. Four years later, a wedding ceremony (with a new girl, Ema Maeda presented) is held at Hinata House for Naru and Keitaro as they finally fulfill their childhood promise to each other.

==Production==

Initial sketches for the series were created between September and December 1997, after the completion of A.I. Love You.[tpl]cite book |title=[tpl]noitalic|ラブひな∞[/tpl]|publisher=Kodansha |date=July 17, 2002 |page=323 |isbn=4-06-334325-1[/tpl][tpl]cite book |title=A.I.

Around six months before the start of serialization, character designs were still going through several revisions before being settled upon. Several characters underwent complete redesigns and name changes.[tpl]cite book |last=Akamatsu |first=Ken |authorlink=Ken Akamatsu |title=Love Hina, Volume 1 |publisher=Tokyopop |date=May 7, 2002 |page=187 |isbn=1-931514-94-1 [/tpl] At one stage the character Naru was named Midori, and she was supposed to fall through a hole in the floor naked, bump her head on Keitaro and lose her memory. Naru's name was changed many times before the author settled on Naru Narusegawa, and her final design is similar to Saati Namba from A.I. Love You.[tpl]cite book |last=Akamatsu |first=Ken |authorlink=Ken Akamatsu |title=Love Hina, Volume 1 |publisher=Tokyopop |date=May 7, 2002 |page=188 |isbn=1-931514-94-1 [/tpl][tpl]cite book |last=Akamatsu |first=Ken |authorlink=Ken Akamatsu |title=A.I.

In her early design, Shinobu had a similar appearance to Forty Namba from A.I. Love You.[tpl]cite book |last=Akamatsu |first=Ken |authorlink=Ken Akamatsu |title=Love Hina, Volume 1 |publisher=Tokyopop |date=May 7, 2002 |page=193 |isbn=1-931514-94-1 [/tpl][tpl]cite book |title=[tpl]noitalic|ラブひな∞[/tpl]  |publisher=Kodansha |date=July 17, 2002 |page=362 |isbn=4-06-334325-1[/tpl]
Throughout the run of the manga, the series used digital editing processes. After a rough sketch of a page was created, the page layout and basic detail were drawn and scanned into an Apple Macintosh. The major page elements were then shaded or filled with patterns, and elements that were drawn separately were added digitally to the page.[tpl]cite book |title=[tpl]noitalic|ラブひな0[/tpl] |publisher=Kodansha |date=July 17, 2000 |pages=214–217|isbn=4-06-334314-6[/tpl]  The manga also used a series of "banked images", which were basic line drawings of locations, such as a characters room. Instead of redrawing a location from scratch every time it was used, these banked images could be used as a base, and extra detail added to them depending on the requirements for the scene.[tpl]cite book |title=[tpl]noitalic|ラブひな∞[/tpl] |publisher=Kodansha |date=July 17, 2002 |pages=297–301 |isbn=4-06-334325-1[/tpl]
Both of these techniques lead to characters having white outlines when copied digitally onto the scene.[tpl]cite book |last=Akamatsu |first=Ken |authorlink=Ken Akamatsu |title=Love Hina, Volume 14 |publisher=Tokyopop |date=September 16, 2003 |pages=151–152 |isbn=1-59182-120-7[/tpl]  Parts of Hinata Inn and other locations used were inspired by real life locations and designed from photographs collected during research.[tpl]cite book |title=[tpl]noitalic|ラブひな0[/tpl] |publisher=Kodansha |date=July 17, 2000 |pages=113–114|isbn=4-06-334314-6[/tpl]

The series was well received by critics. Tony Chen, of Anime News Network (ANN), found it to be a funny series, though finding the 16+ rating appropriate due to the number of jokes involving sexual innuendo. He praised the beautiful artwork, feeling the "sexy and cute" female designs were perfect for the series and that Keitaro's design fit his dorky personality. Chen found Naru's regularly catching Keitaro making a mistake and calling him a pervert redundant and annoying.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/love-hina-gn-1-5 |title=Love Hina GN 1-5 – Review |publisher=Anime News Network |first=Tony |last=Chen |date=September 17, 2002 |accessdate=January 14, 2008[/tpl] Eric Luce of Ex.org notes an increased character development over other love comedies, and describes the series as "nothing if not whimsical".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ex.org/5.7/35-mangaj_lovehina.html |title=Love Hina |publisher=Ex.org |last=Luce |first=Eric |accessdate=October 4, 2009[/tpl]
ANN's Bamboo Dong praised the anime adaptation for being very intriguing and mixing "drama, romance, and slapstick comedy in a pleasing combination". She found the music "incredibly cute" and felt it was used in a way which contributed to many of the dramatic effects in the anime.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/love-hina |title=Love Hina — Review |publisher=Anime News Network |first=Bamboo |last=Dong |accessdate=January 14, 2008[/tpl] In The Anime Encyclopedia: A Guide to Japanese Animation Since 1917, Jonathan Clements and Helen McCarthy felt the female characters were a "standard rack of female anime archetypes" and that the series as a whole was a "culmination of a decade of geek-centered anime". Kenneth Lee, writing for Ex.org praised the look and quality of the animation, highlighting the benefits of the digital creation of the adaption over traditional cel animation. Lee recognised elements from other series such as Maison Ikkoku and Kimagure Orange Road, and summarised the series as "Simply Wonderful".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ex.org/5.7/13-animej_lovehina.html |title=Love Hina TV Volume 1: Process 1 DVD |publisher=Ex.org |last=Lee |first=Kenetth |accessdate=October 4, 2009[/tpl]
Chris Beveridge, of AnimeOnDVD.com, noted the first anime DVD volume was "really well put together", but also felt the manga did not translate into an anime series particularly well.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mania.com/love-hina-vol-1_article_74243.html |title=Love Hina vol. #1 |publisher=Mania.com |first=Chris |last=Beveridge |date=January 28, 2002 |accessdate=December 14, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mania.com/love-hina-vol-6_article_74684.html |title=Love Hina vol. #6 |publisher=Mania.com |first=Chris |last=Beveridge |date=November 13, 2002 |accessdate=December 14, 2008[/tpl] He praised the Christmas special, noting that it was "several notches above the TV series" but found that while the Spring Special had amusing moments, it was rushed with bad plotting.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mania.com/love-hina-spring-special_article_75039.html |title=Love Hina Spring Special |publisher=Mania.com |first=Chris |last=Beveridge |date=February 19, 2003 |accessdate=December 14, 2008[/tpl]
The Love Hina Again OVA received more mixed reviews, with ANN's Zac Berthschy feeling it reversed part of the plot of the main anime series and never reached the same entertainment level as the television series. The character of Kanako, Keitaro's sister, was heavily criticized for being "one of the most annoying characters ever created even though she would have been better for Keitaro than Naru."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/love-hina-again/dvd |title=Love Hina Again DVD — Review |publisher=Anime News Network |first=Zac |last=Bertschy |date=October 30, 2003 |accessdate=January 14, 2008[/tpl] Beveridge praised the fun and comedy as well as the fan service, but also noted that one's enjoyment would depend on whether they still cared for the characters.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mania.com/love-hina-again-movie_article_75422.html |title=Love Hina Again Movie |publisher=Mania.com |first=Chris |last=Beveridge |date=August 15, 2003 |accessdate=December 14, 2008[/tpl]
