[[Geometrinae]]

CATEGORIES: Geometrinae

Geometrinae is the nominate subfamily of the geometer moth family (Geometridae). It is strongly split, containing a considerable number of tribes of which most are presently very small or monotypic however. These small moths are often a light bluish green, leading to the common name of emerald moths, though a few species called thus are also found in the tribe Campaeini of the Ennominae.
There are about 2,300 described species, mostly from the tropics.
