[[Fringe science]]

CATEGORIES: Scientific method, Fringe science, Fringe theory

There are differing definitions of fringe science. By one definition (see below) it is valid, but not mainstream, science; by another broader definition it is generally viewed in a negative way as being non-scientific.
In the philosophy of science, the question of where to properly draw a boundary between science and non-science, when the objective actually is objectivity, is called the demarcation problem. Compounding this issue is that proponents of some fringe theories use both proper scientific evidence and outlandish claims to support their arguments.

==Description==

Fringe science is used to describe unusual theories and models of discovery. Those who develop such fringe science ideas may work within the scientific method, but their results are not accepted by the mainstream community. Usually the evidence provided by supporters of a fringe science is believed only by a minority and rejected by most experts. Fringe science may be advocated by a scientist who has a degree of recognition by the larger scientific community (typically through the publication of peer reviewed studies by the scientist), but this is not always the case. While most fringe science views are ignored or rejected, through careful use of the scientific method, including falsificationism, the scientific community has come to accept some ideas from fringe sciences.Friedlander, p. 172. One example of such is plate tectonics, an idea that had its origin as a fringe science of continental drift, and was held in a negative opinion for decades.Friedlander, p. 5. It is noted that:
The phrase fringe science can be considered pejorative. For example, Lyell D. Henry, Jr. wrote, "'fringe science' is a term also suggesting kookiness."[tpl]cite journal |author=Henry Lyell D. |year=1981 |title=Unorthodox science as a popular activity |journal=J Am Culture |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=1–22 |doi=10.1111/j.1542-734X.1981.0402_1.x[/tpl] Such characterization is perhaps inspired by the eccentric behavior of many researchers on the fringe of science (colloquially and with considerable historical precedent known as mad scientists).[tpl]cite encyclopedia |last1=Runco |first1=Mark A |last2=Pritzker |first2=Steven R |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Creativity |volume=i–z |year=1999 |page=10 |contribution=[/tpl] [tpl]Verify source|date=June 2010[/tpl] The categorical boundary between fringe science and pseudoscience can be disputed. The connotations of fringe science are that the enterprise is still rational, but an unlikely avenue for future results. Fringe science may not be a part of the scientific consensus for a variety of reasons, including incomplete or contradictory evidence.Friedlander, p. 183.

==Responding to fringe science==

Michael W. Friedlander suggests some guidelines for responding to fringe science, which he argues is a more difficult problem to handle, "at least procedurally",Friedlander, p. 174. than scientific misconduct. His suggested methods include impeccable accuracy, checking cited sources, not overstating orthodox science, thorough understanding of the Wegener continental drift example, examples of orthodox science investigating radical proposals, and prepared examples of errors from fringe scientists.Friedlander, p. 178–9.
Though there are examples of mainstream scientists supporting maverick ideas within their own discipline of expertise, fringe science theories and ideas are often advanced by individuals either without a traditional academic science background, or by researchers outside the mainstream discipline,[tpl]cite book|author=Friedlander, Michael W. |title=At the Fringes of Science |oclc=42309381[/tpl]p. 58[tpl]Verify source|date=June 2010[/tpl] although the history of science shows that scientific progress is often marked by interdisciplinary and multicultural interaction.[tpl]cite book |authorlink=Isaac Asimov |author=Isaac Asimov |title=Left Hand of the Electron|publisher=Bantam Books |year=1980 |isbn=978-0-440-94717-2[/tpl] Friedlander suggests that fringe science is necessary for mainstream science "not to atrophy", as scientists must evaluate the plausibility of each new fringe claim and certain fringe discoveries "will later graduate into the ranks of accepted" while others "will never receive confirmation".Friedlander, p. 173. The general public has difficulty distinguishing between "science and its imitators", and in some cases a "yearning to believe or a generalized suspicion of experts is a very potent incentive to accepting pseudoscientific claims".Friedlander, p. 176.

===Controversies===

Towards the end of the 20th century, religiously inspired critics[tpl]who|date=October 2012[/tpl] cited fringe science theories with limited support. The goal was frequently to classify as "controversial" entire fields of scientific inquiry (notably paleo-anthropology, human sexuality, evolution, geology, and paleontology) that contradicted literal or fundamentalist interpretation of various sacred texts. Describing ongoing debate and research within these fields as evidence of fundamental weaknesses or flaws, these critics argued that "controversies" left open a window for the plausibility of divine intervention and intelligent design.[tpl]cite web | title = The dangers of creationism in education | url = http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc07/EDOC11297.htm | publisher = Council of Europe | date = 2008-03-31[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.antievolution.org/features/wedge.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Wedge |publisher=Discovery Institute |year=1999[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/edwards-v-aguillard/amicus1.html |title=Edwards v. Aguillard[/tpl]: Amicus curiae brief of 72 Nobel laureates, 17 state academies of science, and 7 other scientific organizations in support of appellees in [tpl]ussc|482|578|1987[/tpl] As Donald E. Simanek asserts, "Too often speculative and tentative hypotheses of cutting edge science are treated as if they were scientific truths, and so accepted by a public eager for answers," ignorant of the fact that "As science progresses from ignorance to understanding it must pass through a transitionary phase of confusion and uncertainty."[tpl]cite web |url=http://alcor.concordia.ca/~vpetkov/links4.htm#cutting |title=Cutting edge science |accessdate=2008-04-01 |last=Simanek |first=Donald |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080319110815/http://alcor.concordia.ca/~vpetkov/links4.htm#cutting  |archivedate = 2008-03-19[/tpl] The media also play a role in the creation and propagation of the view that certain fields of science are "controversial". In "Optimising public understanding of science: A comparative perspective" by Jan Nolin et al., the authors claim, "From a media perspective it is evident that controversial science sells, not only because of its dramatic value but also since it is often connected to high-stake societal issues."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.univie.ac.at/virusss/opus/OPUS%20Report%20Final.pdf |page=632 |author=Nolin, Jan; et al. |title=Optimising public understanding of science: A comparative perspective |format=PDF[/tpl]
