[[Sodium perchlorate]]

CATEGORIES: Perchlorates, Sodium compounds, Oxidizing agents

Sodium perchlorate is the inorganic compound with the chemical formula NaClO4. It is the most soluble of the common perchlorate salts. It is a white crystalline, hygroscopic solid that is highly soluble in water and in alcohol. It usually comes as the monohydrate, which has a rhombic crystal structure.[tpl]cite book |last=Eagleson |first=Mary |authorlink= |title=Concise Encyclopedia Chemistry |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Owuv-c9L_IMC |others=revised, illustrated |accessdate=March 7, 2013 |year=1994 |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |location= |isbn=9783110114515 |page=1000 |pages=[/tpl]

==Uses==

Sodium perchlorate is the precursor to many other perchlorate salts, often taking advantage of their low solubility relative to NaClO4 (209 g/100 ml at 25 °C).  Perchloric acid is made by treating NaClO4 with HCl.
NaClO4 finds only minimal use in pyrotechnics because it is hygroscopic; ammonium and potassium perchlorates are preferred.  These salts are prepared by double decomposition from a solution of sodium perchlorate and potassium or ammonium chlorides.

===Laboratory applications===

NaClO4 has a variety of uses in the laboratory, often as a nonreactive electrolyte.  For example, it is used in standard DNA extraction and hybridization reactions in molecular biology.

===In medicine===

Sodium perchlorate can be used to block iodine uptake before administration of iodinated contrast agents in patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism (suppressed TSH).Becker C. and treatment of side effects due to iodinated contrast media relevant to radiological practice.

==Production==

Sodium perchlorate is produced by anodic oxidation of sodium chlorate, not sodium chloride, at an inert electrode, such as platinum.Helmut Vogt, Jan Balej, John E.
