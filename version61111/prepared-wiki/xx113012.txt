"Feeling Alive" was the Cypriot entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 2003, performed in English by Stelios Konstantas.
The song was performed ninth on the night (following Croatia's Claudia Beni with Vi≈°e nisam tvoja and preceding Germany's Lou with "Let's Get Happy"). At the close of voting, it had received 15 points, placing 20th in a field of 26.  For his Eurovision appearance, Stelios appeared dressed in a white suit and shirt. His backing performers, which included two girls in sleeveless, white, floor-length gowns, were also dressed in white.
The song is an up-tempo love song, with Konstantas telling his lover that he feels alive when she is with him.
It was succeeded as Cypriot representative at the 2004 Contest by Lisa Andreas with "Stronger Every Minute".
