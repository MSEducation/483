==Early life==

David Bailey was born in Leytonstone, East London,[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rySr84jox_AC&pg=PA96#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The Houghton Mifflin Dictionary of Biography|page=96|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|date=15 July 2003|accessdate=10 April 2012[/tpl] to Herbert Bailey, a tailor's cutter, and his wife, Gladys, a machinist. From the age of three he lived in East Ham."Passed/Failed: An education in the life of David Bailey, photographer", The Independent.
[tpl]quote|"In the winter", he recalled, the family "would take bread-and-jam sandwiches and go to the cinema every night because in those days it was cheaper to go to the cinema than to put on the gas fire. I'll bet I saw seven or eight movies a week."[tpl]cite news|last=Stuart|first=Jeffries|title=Out of his skulls|accessdate=26 August 2010|newspaper=The Guardian[/tpl][/tpl]

Bailey developed a love of natural history, and this led him into photography. Suffering from undiagnosed dyslexia, he experienced problems at school. He attended a private school, Clark's College in Ilford, where he says they taught him less than the more basic council school. As well as dyslexia he also has the motor skill disorder developmental coordination disorder

In one school year, he claims he only attended 33 times. He left school on his fifteenth birthday, to become a copy boy at the Fleet Street offices of the Yorkshire Post. He raced through a series of dead end jobs, before his call up for National Service in 1956, serving with the Royal Air Force in Singapore in 1957. The appropriation of his trumpet forced him to consider other creative outlets, and he bought a Rolleiflex camera.
He was demobbed in August 1958, and determined to pursue a career in photography, he bought a Canon rangefinder camera. Unable to obtain a place at the London College of Printing because of his school record, he became a second assistant to David Ollins, in Charlotte Mews. He earned £3 10s (£3.50) a week, and acted as studio dogsbody. He was delighted to be called to an interview with photographer John French.

==Professional career==

In 1959, Bailey became a photographic assistant at the John French studio, and in May 1960, he was a photographer for John Cole's Studio Five before being contracted as a fashion photographer for British Vogue magazine later that year.[tpl]Page needed|date=August 2010[/tpl] He also undertook a large amount of freelance work."David Bailey: Godfather of Cool", BBC.
Along with Terence Donovan and Brian Duffy, Bailey captured and helped create the 'Swinging London' of the 1960s: a culture of fashion and celebrity chic. The three photographers socialised with actors, musicians and royalty, and found themselves elevated to celebrity status. Together, they were the first real celebrity photographers, named by Norman Parkinson "the Black Trinity".[tpl]cite news|last=Pittman|first=Joanna|title=David Bailey:still snapping away at 71|url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/fashion/article6802180.ece|accessdate=20 August 2009|newspaper=The Times|location=London|date=20 August 2009[/tpl]
The film Blowup (1966), directed by Michelangelo Antonioni, depicts the life of a London fashion photographer (played by David Hemmings). This character was inspired by Bailey.PDN Legends Online: David Bailey; retrieved November 15, 2013. The "Swinging London" scene was aptly reflected in his Box of Pin-Ups (1964): a box of poster-prints of 1960s celebrities including Terence Stamp, The Beatles, Mick Jagger, Jean Shrimpton, PJ Proby, Cecil Beaton, Rudolf Nureyev, Andy Warhol and notorious East End gangsters, the Kray twins. The Box was an unusual and unique commercial release.  It reflected the changing status of the photographer that one could sell a collection of prints in this way. (The strong objection to the presence of the Krays on the part of a fellow photographer, Lord Snowdon, was the major reason no American edition of the "Box" ever appeared and that a second British edition was not issued.) The record sale for a copy of 'Box of Pin-Ups' is reported as "north of £20,000".[tpl]cite news|last=Petkanas|first=Christopher|title=Photographer Who Broke Molds|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/25/arts/25iht-photog25.html|accessdate=24 January 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=24 January 2011[/tpl]
Bailey's ascent at Vogue was meteoric. Within months he was shooting covers and, at the height of his productivity, he shot 800 pages of Vogue editorial in one year.[tpl]cite news|last=Ellison|first=Jo|title=Rogue's Gallery|accessdate=June 2010|newspaper=British Vogue[/tpl] Penelope Tree, a former girlfriend, described him as "the king lion on the Savannah: incredibly attractive, with a dangerous vibe. He was the electricity, the brightest, most powerful, most talented, most energetic force at the magazine".
American Vogue's creative director Grace Coddington, then a model herself, said "It was the Sixties, it was a raving time, and Bailey was unbelievably good-looking. He was everything that you wanted him to be – like the Beatles but accessible – and when he went on the market everyone went in. We were all killing ourselves to be his model, although he hooked up with Jean Shrimpton pretty quickly".
Of model Jean Shrimpton, Bailey said: [tpl]quote|She was magic and the camera loved her too. In a way she was the cheapest model in the world – you only needed to shoot half a roll of film and then you had it. She had the knack of having her hand in the right place, she knew where the light was, she was just a natural.[/tpl]
Since 1966, Bailey has also directed several television commercials and documentaries. From 1968 to 1971 he directed and produced TV documentaries titled Beaton, Warhol and Visconti. As well as fashion photography, Bailey photographed album sleeve art for musicians including The Rolling Stones and Marianne Faithfull. One of Bailey's most famous works depicts the Rolling Stones including Brian Jones, who drowned in 1969 while under the influence of drink and drugs. He is seen standing slightly apart from the rest of the group. Bailey was hired in 1970 by Island Records' Chris Blackwell to shoot publicity photos of Cat Stevens for his upcoming album Tea for the Tillerman. Stevens (now known as Yusuf Islam) maintains that he disliked having his photo on the cover of his albums, as had previously been the case, although he allowed Bailey's photographs to be placed on the inner sleeve of the album.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn53iV88SNo|title=A conversation with Yusuf Islam & Alun Davies|last=Islam|first=Yusuf|coauthors=Davies|date=Alun|work=Interview (upon the anniversary of Island Records) of Stevens and Davies|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=4 February 2011|location=England[/tpl]
In 1972 rock musician Alice Cooper was photographed by Bailey for Vogue magazine, almost naked apart from a snake. Cooper used Bailey the following year to shoot for the group's chart topping 'Billion Dollar Babies' album. The shoot included a baby wearing shocking eye makeup and, supposedly, one billion dollars in cash requiring the shoot to be under armed guard. In 1976, Bailey published Ritz Newspaper together with David Litchfield. In 1985, Bailey was photographing stars at the Live Aid concert at Wembley Stadium. As he recalled later: "The atmosphere on the day was great. At one point I got a tap on my shoulder and spun round. Suddenly there was a big tongue down my throat! It was Freddie Mercury."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2004/oct/17/popandrock5|title=Live aid in their own words|work=The Observer|location=London|first=Carl|last=Wilkinson|date=17 October 2004|accessdate=3 April 2013[/tpl]
In 1992, Bailey directed the BBC drama Who Dealt? starring Juliet Stevenson, story by Ring Lardner. In 1995 he directed and wrote the South Bank Film The Lady is a Tramp featuring his wife Catherine Bailey. In 1998 he directed a documentary with Ginger Television Production, Models Close Up, commissioned by Channel 4 Television. [tpl]cn|date=January 2014[/tpl]
