The Catholic sex abuse cases are a series of allegations, investigations, trials and convictions of child sexual abuse crimes committed by Catholic priests, nuns and members of Roman Catholic orders against children as young as three years old with the majority between the ages of 11 and 14.[tpl]cite news|author = Associated Press | title=Hundreds of priests shuffled worldwide, despite abuse allegations |date=2004-06-20 | work=USA Today | url = http://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2004-06-19-church-abuse_x.htm[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Stephens|first=Scott|title=Catholic sexual abuse study greeted with incurious contempt|url=http://www.abc.net.au/religion/articles/2011/05/27/3229135.htm|accessdate=23 July 2012|newspaper=ABC Religion and Ethics|date=27 May 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Lattin|first=Don|title=$30 Million Awarded Men Molested by `Family Priest' / 3 bishops accused of Stockton coverup|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/30-Million-Awarded-Men-Molested-by-Family-3001550.php|accessdate=23 July 2012|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=July 17, 1998|quote=Attorney Jeff Anderson said the Howard brothers were repeatedly molested between 1978 and 1991, from age 3 to 13.[/tpl] Reverend Oliver O'Grady later confessed to the abuse of many other children and the documentary Deliver Us from Evil (2006 film) was made about his story and the coverup by Church officials. These cases include anal and oral penetration and have resulted in criminal prosecutions of the abusers and civil lawsuits against the church's dioceses and parishes. Many of the cases span several decades and are brought forward years after the abuse occurred. Cases have also been brought against members of the Catholic hierarchy who did not report sex abuse allegations to the legal authorities. It has been shown they deliberately moved sexually abusive priests to other parishes where the abuse sometimes continued.[tpl]cite book|last=Bruni|first=Frank|title=A Gospel of Shame: Children, Sexual Abuse, and the Catholic Church|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2002|isbn=0060522321[/tpl] This has led to a number of fraud cases where the Church has been accused of misleading victims by deliberately relocating priests accused of abuse instead of removing them from their positions.[tpl]cite news | date = June 29, 2010 | title = Sex abuse victim accuses Catholic church of fraud | work = USAToday | url = http://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2010-06-24-fraud23_ST_N.htm | accessdate = June 24, 2012 [/tpl]
The cases received significant media and public attention in Canada, Ireland, the United States, and throughout the world. In response to the attention, members of the church hierarchy have argued that media coverage has been excessive and disproportionate.[tpl]Cite news|last=Butt|first=Riazat|author2=Asthana, Anushka|title=Sex abuse rife in other religions, says Vatican (with examples from USA)|work=The Guardian|date=28 September 2009|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/sep/28/sex-abuse-religion-vatican|accessdate=10 October 2009 | location=London[/tpl] According to a Pew Research Center study, media coverage mostly emanated from the United States in 2002, when the Boston Globe began a critical investigation.

==International extent of issue==

Sexual abuse of children under the age of consent by priests receives significant media and public attention in Canada, Ireland, the United States, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Belgium, France, Germany and Australia, while cases have been reported throughout the world. Many of the cases span several decades and are brought forward years after the abuse occurred.
Although nation-wide enquiries have only been conducted in the United States and Ireland, cases of clerical sexual abuse of minors have been reported and prosecuted in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and other countries. In 1994, allegations of sexual abuse on 47 young seminarians surfaced in Argentina.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/globe/spotlight/abuse/extras/bishops_map2.htm |title=Boston Globe / Spotlight / Abuse in the Catholic Church / Scandal and coverup |publisher=Boston.com |accessdate=2010-04-27[/tpl] In 1995, Cardinal Hans Hermann Groër resigned from his post as Archbishop of Vienna, Austria over allegations of sexual abuse, although he remained a Cardinal.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/78503.stm | work=BBC News | title='Exile' for disgraced Austrian cardinal | date=1998-04-14 | accessdate=2010-04-01[/tpl] Since 1995, over one hundred priests from various parts of Australia were convicted of sexual abuse.[tpl]cite web|url=http://brokenrites.alphalink.com.au/nletter/bccrime.html |title=Sex-abuse in the Catholic Church in Australia |publisher=Brokenrites.alphalink.com.au |accessdate=2012-07-05[/tpl][tpl]Primary source-inline|reason=citation is to lobby group|date=August 2012[/tpl]
In Ireland, a report (see Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse) was made which covered six decades (from the 1950s) and noted "endemic" sexual abuse in Catholic boys' institutions, with church leaders aware of what was going on and government inspectors failing to "stop beatings, rapes and humiliation."Garrett,Paul Michael.

Church officials and academics knowledgeable about the Third World Roman Catholic Church say that sexual abuse by clergy is generally not discussed, and thus is difficult to measure. This may be due in part to the more hierarchical structure of the Church in Third World countries, the "psychological health" of clergy in those regions, and because third word media, legal systems and public culture are not as apt to thoroughly discuss sexual abuse. In the Philippines, where [tpl]as of|2002|lc=y[/tpl] at least 85% of the population is Catholic, the revelations of sexual abuse by priests, including child sexual abuse, followed the United States' reporting in 2002.
Academic Mathew N. Schmalz notes India as an example: "you would have gossip and rumors, but it never reaches the level of formal charges or controversies." Traditionally, the Roman Catholic Church has held tight control over many aspects of church life around the globe, including "the words used in prayer", but left sex abuse cases to be handled locally. In 2001, sex abuse cases were first required to be reported to Rome. In July 2010, the Vatican doubled the length of time after the 18th birthday of the victim that clergymen can be tried in a church court and streamlined the processes for removing "pedophile priests".[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jul/15/vatican-declares-womens-ordination-grave-crime|title=Catholics angry as church puts female ordination on par with sex abuse|date=15 July 2010|accessdate=17 July 2010|publisher=The Guardian | location=London|author=John Hooper and Haroon Siddique[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/17/opinion/17sat4.html?_r=1&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss|title=Tone-Deaf in Rome|date=16 July 2010|accessdate=17 July 2010|publisher=New York Times[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2010/0716/Vatican-stirs-storm-on-women-priests-in-clarifying-law-on-clergy-abuse|title=Vatican stirs storm on women priests in clarifying law on clergy abuse|date=16 July 2010|accessdate=17 July 2010|publisher=Christian Science Monitor|author=Robert Marquand[/tpl]
In A Perspective on Clergy Sexual Abuse by Thomas Plante, a psychiatrist specializing in abuse counseling and considered an expert on clerical abuse, he states "approximately 4% of priests during the past half century (and mostly in the 1960s and 1970s) have had a sexual experience with a minor."[tpl]cite web |work=Pastoral Psychology, Vol. 52, No. 5, May 2004| title=The Sexual Abuse Crisis in the Roman Catholic Church: What Psychologists and Counselors Should Know |author=Plante, Thomas G. and Courtney Daniels|publisher=Springer Publishing |url=http://ww.scu.edu/cas/psychology/faculty/upload/Plante-Clergy-Paper-2.pdf |format=PDF [/tpl] According to Newsweek magazine, the figure is similar to that in the rest of the adult population.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/236096 | work=Newsweek | title=Mean Men: The priesthood is being cast as the refuge of pederasts.

Allegations of and convictions for sexual abuse by clergy have been subjects of public debate in many countries. Although there are no figures available on the number of sexual abuse cases in different regions, in 2002, The Boston Globe reported "clearly the issue has been most prominent in the United States."[tpl]cite news|last=Paulson|first=Michael|title=World doesn't share US view of scandal: Clergy sexual abuse reaches far, receives an uneven focus|url=http://www.boston.com/globe/spotlight/abuse/print/040802_world.htm|accessdate=17 July 2012|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=April 8, 2002[/tpl] The US is the country with the highest number of Catholic Sex Abuse cases,Gray, Mark M.

In response to the attention, members of the church hierarchy have argued that media coverage has been excessive and disproportionate.[tpl]failed verification|date=August 2012[/tpl] According to a Pew Research Center study, in 2002 the media coverage was focused on the US, where a Boston Globe series initiated widespread coverage in the region. However, by 2010 the focus had shifted to Europe.
In September 2011, a submission was lodged with the International Criminal Court alleging that the Pope, Cardinal Angelo Sodano (Dean of the College of Cardinals), Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone (Cardinal Secretary of State), and Cardinal William Levada (then-current Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith) had committed a crime against humanity by failing to prevent or punish perpetrators of rape and sexual violence in a "systematic and widespread" concealment which included failure to co-operate with relevant law enforcement agencies.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/sep/13/pope-crimes-humanity-victims-abuse | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Karen | last=McVeigh | title=Pope accused of crimes against humanity by victims of sex abuse | date=2011-09-13[/tpl] In a statement to the Associated Press, the Vatican described this as a "ludicrous publicity stunt and a misuse of international judicial processes."

==Contemporary history of child sex abuse==

Child sexual abuse is an umbrella term describing offenses in which an adult engages in sexual activity with a minor or exploits a minor for the purpose of sexual gratification.Child sexual abuse definition from the NSPCCThe Sexual Exploitation of Children, Chart 1: Definitions of Terms Associated With the Sexual Exploitation (SEC) and Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children (CSEC) (p. 4), University of Pennsylvania Center for Youth Policy Studies, U.S. National Institute of Justice, August 2001. The American Psychiatric Association states that "children cannot consent to sexual activity with adults," and condemns any such action by an adult as "a criminal and immoral act which never can be considered normal or socially acceptable behavior."[tpl]cite press release |title=APA Letter to the Honorable Rep. DeLay (R-Tx) |publisher=American Psychological Association |date=June 9, 1999 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/19991010055703/http://www.apa.org/releases/delay.html |archivedate=October 10, 1999 |url=http://www.apa.org/releases/delay.html |accessdate=2009-03-08[/tpl] Only at the beginning of the 1900s did Western society begin to regard children as fledgling citizens whose "creative and intellectual potential require fostering" rather than "cheap labor".[tpl]cite news|last=Heller|first=Steve|title=The 20th Century Was for Kids|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/07/the-20th-century-was-for-kids/260032/|accessdate=19 August 2012|newspaper=The Atlantic|date=July 19, 2012[/tpl] According to The Atlantic, "the idea of the 'modern child' was shaped by the same forces that shaped the rest of society: industrialization, urbanization, and consumerism."
Child sex abuse has gained public attention in the past few decades and has become one of the most high-profile crimes. Since the 1970s, child molestation and the sexual abuse of children has increasingly been recognized as deeply damaging to children and thus unacceptable for society as a whole.  While sexual use of children by adults has been present throughout history, it has only become the object of significant public attention in recent times.[tpl]cite book | last1 = Delany | first1 = Samuel R. | last2 = Freedman | first2 = Carl | title = Conversations with Samuel R.

===Roman Catholic cases===

In the 1950s, Gerald Fitzgerald, who founded the Congregation of the Servants of the Paraclete (a religious order that treats Roman Catholic priests who struggle with personal difficulties such as pedophilia), concluded that "abuse offenders were unlikely to change and should not be returned to ministry", and this was discussed with Pope Paul VI (1897 – 1978) and "in correspondence with several bishops". In 2001, sex abuse cases were first required to be reported to Rome. After the 2002 revelation that cases of abuse were widespread in the Church, The Dallas Morning News did a year-long investigation. The results made public in 2004 showed that even after the public outcry, priests were moved out of the countries where they had been accused and were still in "settings that bring them into contact with children, despite church claims to the contrary". Among the investigation's findings is that nearly half of 200 cases "involved clergy who tried to elude law enforcement." In July 2010, the Vatican doubled the length of time after the 18th birthday of the victim that clergymen can be tried in a church court and streamlined the processes for removing "pedophile priests".
The cases received significant media and public attention in Canada, Ireland, the United States, and throughout the world. In response to the attention, members of the church hierarchy have argued that media coverage has been excessive and disproportionate. According to a Pew Research Center study, media coverage mostly emanated from the United States in 2002, when a Boston Globe series began a critical mass of news reports; by contrast, in 2010 much of the reporting focused on child abuse in Europe.

===Public and political issues===

Child sexual abuse became a public issue in the 1970s and 1980s. Prior to this point in time, sexual abuse remained rather secretive and socially unspeakable. Studies on child molestation were nonexistent until the 1920s and the first national estimate of the number of child sexual abuse cases was published in 1948. By 1968, 44 out of 50 U.S. states had enacted mandatory laws that required physicians to report cases of suspicious child abuse. Second wave feminism (early 1960s to late 1990s) brought greater awareness of child sexual abuse and violence against women, and made them public, political issues.Paula Reavey, Sam Warner (2003). New feminist stories of child sexual abuse: sexual scripts and dangerous dialogues Routledge, pp. 2 (or more). ISBN 0-415-25944-4, ISBN 978-0-415-25944-6Francis J. Turner (2011). Social Work Treatment: Interlocking Theoretical Approaches Oxford University Press, pp. 215 (or more). ISBN 0-19-539465-8, ISBN 978-0-19-539465-8
Legal action began to become more prevalent in the 1970s with the enactment of the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act in 1974 in conjunction with the creation of the National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect. Since the creation of the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, reported child abuse cases have increased dramatically.  The National Abuse Coalition was created in 1979 to create pressure in congress to create more sexual abuse laws. In 1986, Congress passed the Child Abuse Victims' Rights Act, giving children a civil claim in sexual abuse cases. The number of laws created in the 1980s and 1990s began to create greater prosecution and detection of child sexual abusers. Megan's Law, enacted in 2004, gives the public access to knowledge of sex offenders nationwide.Megan's Law Anne Hastings described these changes in attitudes towards child sexual abuse as "the beginning of one of history's largest social revolutions."From Generation to Generation: Understanding Sexual Attraction to Children, p.15
According to John Jay College of Criminal Justice professor B.J. Cling:
 By the early 21st century, the issue of child sexual abuse has become a legitimate focus of professional attention, while increasingly separated from second wave feminism...As child sexual abuse becomes absorbed into the larger field of interpersonal trauma studies, child sexual abuse studies and intervention strategies have become degendered and largely unaware of their political origins in modern feminism and other vibrant political movements of the 1970s. One may hope that unlike in the past, this rediscovery of child sexual abuse that began in the 70s will not again be followed by collective amnesia. The institutionalization of child maltreatment interventions in federally funded centers, national and international societies, and a host of research studies (in which the United States continues to lead the world) offers grounds for cautious optimism. Nevertheless, as Judith Herman argues cogently, 'The systematic study of psychological trauma...depends on the support of a political movement.'[tpl]Cite book|title=Sexualized Violence Against Women and Children: A Psychology and Law Perspective|author=B.J.

===Lawsuits===

In many jurisdictions growing awareness of child sexual abuse has sparked an increasing number of civil lawsuits for monetary damages stemming from such incidents.  Increased awareness of child sexual abuse has encouraged more victims to come forward, whereas in the past victims often kept their abuse secret.   Some states have enacted specific laws lengthening the applicable statutes of limitations so as to allow victims of child sexual abuse to file suit sometimes years after they have reached the age of majority.  Such lawsuits can be brought where a person or entity—such as a school, church, or youth organization—was charged with supervising the child but failed to do so, with child sexual abuse resulting. Since lawsuits can involve demanding procedures, there is a concern that children or adults who file suit will be re-victimized by defendants through the legal process, much as rape victims can be re-victimized by the accused in criminal rape trials.  Child sexual abuse plaintiffs' attorney Thomas A. Cifarelli has written that children involved in the legal system, particularly victims of sexual abuse and molestation, should be afforded certain procedural safeguards to protect them from harassment during the legal process.Cifarelli, T.A.,"Shielding Minors", Los Angeles Daily Journal, (October 10, 2001).

==Prevalence==

===Australia===

In 2012, an Australian police report in the state of Victoria detailed 40 suicide deaths by people who had been abused by Catholic clergy. The Chief Commissioner of Victoria Police, in a submission to a parliamentary inquiry on the issue, recommended that some of the church's actions to hinder investigations be criminalized.Jane Lee.

===Austria===

In November 2010, an independent group in Austriabetroffen.at that operates a hotline to help people exit the Catholic Church released a report documenting physical, sexual, and emotional abuse perpetrated by Austrian priests, nuns, and other religious officials.  The report is based on hotline calls from 91 women (28%) and 234 men (72%), who named 422 perpetrators of both sexes, 63% of whom were ordained priests.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.betroffen.at/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/PKpressetext-englisch.pdf |format=PDF |first=Philipp |last=Schwärzler | date=2010-11-24 | title=Abused, Ignored, Slandered: Victims of Church-related Violence |accessdate=2010-11-27[/tpl][tpl]Primary source-inline|reason=citation is to what appears to be a lobby/support group|date=August 2012[/tpl]

===Belgium===

In June 2010, Belgian police raided the Belgian Catholic Church headquarters in Brussels, seizing a computer and records of a Church commission investigating allegations of child abuse, as part of an investigation into hundreds of claims that had been raised about alleged child sexual abuse committed by Belgian clergy. The claims emerged after Roger Vangheluwe, who had been the Bishop of Bruges, resigned after admitting that he was guilty of sexual molestation. The Vatican protested against the raids.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/10417102.stm|title=Vatican 'indignant' over Belgium police raids|date=25 June 2010|accessdate=5 July 2010|publisher=BBC|work=BBC News Online[/tpl] In September 2010, an appeals court ruled that the raids were illegal.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11252821|title=Belgian church abuse raids ruled illegal|date=9 September 2010|accessdate=19 February 2013|publisher=BBC|work=BBC News Online[/tpl]

===Canada===

In the late 1980s, allegations were made of physical and sexual abuse committed by members of the Christian Brothers, who operated the Mount Cashel Orphanage in St. John's, Newfoundland.  The government, police, and church colluded in an unsuccessful attempt to cover up the allegations, but in December 1989 they were publicized in the St. John's Sunday Express.  Eventually more than 300 former pupils came forward with allegations of physical and sexual abuse at the orphanage.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/clergy_sex3.htm |title=Sexual abuse by Catholic clergy - The Canadian situation |accessdate=2010-01-16[/tpl] The religious order that ran the orphanage filed for bankruptcy in the face of numerous lawsuits.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/2004/2004canlii66324/2004canlii66324.html |title=2004 CanLII 66324 (ON SC) |publisher=CanLII |accessdate=2012-07-05[/tpl] Since the Mount Cashel scandal, a number of priests across Canada have been accused of sexual abuse.

===Ireland===

====Ireland (Republic)====

In the Republic of Ireland, starting in the 1990s, a series of criminal cases and government enquiries covered allegations that priests had abused hundreds of minors over previous decades. State-ordered investigations documented "tens of thousands of children from the 1940s to the 1990s" who suffered abuse including sexual abuse at the hands of priests, nuns, and church staff in three diocese.[tpl]cite news|title=Pope: Irish clergy child sex abuse a 'mystery'|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&objectid=10813749|accessdate=6 July 2012|newspaper=New Zealand Herald|date=June 18, 2012|deadurl=yes[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=August 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl]
In many cases the abusing priests had been moved by senior clergy to other parishes. By 2010, a number of in-depth judicial reports had been published, but with relatively few prosecutions.  The abuse was occasionally made known to staff at the Department of Education, the police, and other government bodies, who have said that prosecuting clergy was extremely difficult given the "Catholic ethos" of the Irish Republic.
In 1994, Micheal Ledwith resigned as President of St Patrick's College, Maynooth when allegations of sexual abuse were made public. The June 2005 McCullough Report found that a number of bishops had rejected concerns about Ledwith's inappropriate behavior towards seminarians "so completely and so abruptly without any adequate investigation", although his report conceded that "to investigate in any very full or substantial manner, a generic complaint regarding a person's apparent propensities would have been difficult".Irish Independent: Bishops accused in college sex row, 2005

====Northern Ireland====

In Northern Ireland (part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, politically distinct from the Republic of Ireland), the largest inquiry in UK legal history into institutional sexual and physical abuse in institutions that were in charge of children from 1922 to 1995 was held, starting in January 2014. The De La Salle Brothers and the Sisters of Nazareth admitted early in the inquiry to physical and sexual abuse of children in institutions in Northern Ireland that they controlled, and issued an apology to victims. Not all the abuse being investigated by the inquiry is associated with Catholic institutions.The Guardian newspaper, 14 January 2014

===Norway===

In April 2010, it was reported that former bishop of the Norwegian Catholic Church, Georg Müller, had confessed to the Norwegian Police in early January 2010 that he had sexually abused an underaged altar boy 20 years earlier. The Norwegian Catholic Church was made aware of the incident but did not alert the authorities. Müller was made to step down as a bishop in July 2009.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6362KE20100407 |title=Norwegian bishop who resigned in 2009 was abuser |accessdate=2010-04-07 | work=Reuters | date=2010-04-07[/tpl]

===Poland===

In October 2013 the Catholic Church in Poland explicitly refused to publish data on sexual abuse, but said that, if the data were to be published, the scale would be seen to be very low.http://wiadomosci.onet.pl/kraj/marcin-przeciszewski-pedofilia-w-kosciele-ma-charakter-marginalny/sn5xc Bishop Antoni Dydycz said that priests should not be pressed to report sexual abuse to state authorities, invoking the ecclesiastical "seal of confession" which bans them from revealing what is said in the rite of confession.http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/wiadomosci/1,114871,14881054,Bp_Dydycz_w_liscie_do_wiernych_o_pedofilii_i_tajemnicy.html#TRNajCzyt In November 2013 the Minister of Justice said that there were 1,454  persons in prison for acts of pedophilia, of whom one was a Catholic priest.http://naszdziennik.pl/wpis/630,jeden-ksiadz-na-poltora-tysiecy-skazanych-gdzie-ta-pedofilia-w-kosciele.html

Although bishops had been sending sexually abusive priests to facilities such as those operated by the Servants of the Paraclete since the 1950s, there was scant public discussion of the problem until the mid-1960s.  Even then, most of the discussion was held amongst the Catholic hierarchy with little or no coverage in the media.  A public discussion of sexual abuse of minors by priests took place at a meeting sponsored by the National Association for Pastoral Renewal held on the campus of the University of Notre Dame in 1967, to which all U.S. Catholic bishops were invited.
Various local and regional discussions of the problem were held by Catholic bishops in later years. However, it was not until the 1980s that discussion of sexual abuse by Roman Catholic clerics began to be covered as a phenomenon in the news media of the United States.  According to the Catholic News Service public awareness of the sexual abuse of children in the United States and Canada emerged in the late 1970s and the 1980s as an outgrowth of the growing awareness of physical abuse of children.
In 1981 Father Donald Roemer of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles pleaded guilty to felonious sexual abuse of a minor. The case received widespread media coverage.

====Jay Report====

In the United States the 2004 John Jay Report commissioned and funded by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) was based on volunteer surveys completed by the Roman Catholic dioceses in the United States. The 2004 John Jay Report was based on a study of 10,667 allegations against 4,392 priests accused of engaging in sexual abuse of a minor between 1950 and 2002.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.usccb.org/nrb/nrbstudy/nrbreport.htm#johnjay |title=A Report on the Crisis in the Catholic Church in the United States |publisher=USCCB |accessdate=2010-04-27[/tpl]
The surveys filtered provided information from diocesan files on each priest accused of sexual abuse and on each of the priest's victims to the research team, in a format which did not disclose the names of the accused priests or the dioceses where they worked. The dioceses were encouraged to issue reports of their own based on the surveys that they had completed.
The report stated there were approximately 10,667 reported victims (younger than 18 years) of clergy sexual abuse between 1950 and 2002:
The 4,392 priests who were accused amount to approximately 4% of the 109,694 priests in active ministry during that time. Of these 4,392, approximately:
Many of the reported acts of sexual abuse involved fondling or unspecified abuse. There was also a number of allegations of forced acts of oral sex and intercourse. Detailed information on the nature of the abuse was not reported for 26.6% of the reported allegations. 27.3% of the allegations involved the cleric performing oral sex on the victim. 25.1% of the allegations involved penile penetration or attempted penetration.
Although there were reported acts of sexual abuse of minors in every year, the incidence of reported abuse increased by several orders of magnitude in the 1960s and 1970s. There was, for example, a more than sixfold increase in the number of reported acts of abuse of males aged 11 to 17 between the 1950s and the 1970s. After peaking in the 1970s, the number of incidents in the report decreased through the 1980s and 1990s even more sharply than the incidence rate had increased in the 1960s and 1970s.

==Lawsuits and their effects==

The Associated Press estimated the settlements of sex abuse cases from 1950 to 2007 totaled more than $2 billion. BishopAccountability puts the figure at more than $3 billion in 2012.

According to BishopAccountability reports that figure reached more than $3 billion in 2012.
Most sex abuse cases are subject to the law of each state. As of April 2010 many sex abusers associated with the Church in several countries have been tried by secular authorities and some convicted and sentenced to imprisonment.
Addressing "a flood of abuse claims" five dioceses (Tucson, Arizona; Spokane, Washington; Portland, Oregon.; Davenport, Iowa, and San Diego) got bankruptcy protection. Eight Catholic diocese have declared bankruptcy due to sex abuse cases from 2004-2011.
According to Donald Cozzens, "by the end of the mid 1990s, it was estimated that ... more than half a billion dollars had been paid in jury awards, settlements and legal fees." This figure grew to about one billion dollars by 2002.[tpl]Cite book|first=Donald B. |last=Cozzens |title=The changing face of the priesthood: A reflection on the priest's crisis of soul |publisher=Liturgical Press |year=2000 |page=125[/tpl] Roman Catholics spent $615 million on sex abuse cases in 2007.[tpl]dead link|date=July 2012[/tpl]
As of March 2006, dioceses in which abuse was committed or in which abuse allegations were settled out of court had made financial settlements with the victims totaling over $1.5 billion. The number and size of these settlements made it necessary for the dioceses to reduce their ordinary operating expenses by closing churches and schools in order to raise the funds to make these payments.  Several dioceses chose to declare Chapter 11 bankruptcy as a way to litigate settlements while protecting some church assets to ensure it continues to operate.
By 2009, U.S. dioceses have paid more than US$2.6 billion in abuse-related costs since 1950.Letters: Catholic bishops warned in '50s of abusive priests by Rachel Zoll of Associated Press in USAToday, Daily News (New York) and The AgeThe Cost Of Crimen Sollicitationis On The Holy Roman Catholic Church
In many instances, dioceses were forced to declare bankruptcy as a result of the settlements. At least six U.S. dioceses sought bankruptcy protection. In some cases, the dioceses filed bankruptcy just before civil suits against them were about to go to trial. This had the effect of mandating that pending and future lawsuits be settled in bankruptcy court. The sexual abuse scandal costs each of the 195 dioceses "an average of $300,000 annually."United Conference of Catholic Bishops, 2006 Report: Findings and Recommendations (Washington: United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, 2007) p. 16.

====Resignations, retirements and defrockings====

Many of the accused priests were forced to resign. Some priests whose crimes fell within statutes of limitation are in jail. Some have been defrocked. Others — because they are elderly, because of the nature of their offenses, or because they have had some success fighting the charges — cannot be defrocked under canon law. Some priests live in retreat houses that are carefully monitored and sometimes locked.[tpl]Cite news|last=Newman |first=Andy |title=A Choice for New York Priests in Abuse Cases |work=The New York Times |date=2006-08-31 |url =http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/31/nyregion/31priest.html |accessdate=2010-04-05[/tpl]
Bernard Francis Law, Cardinal and Archbishop of Boston, Massachusetts, United States resigned after Church documents were revealed which suggested he had covered up sexual abuse committed by priests in his archdiocese.News/Features | On December 13, 2002 Pope John Paul II accepted Law's resignation as Archbishop and reassigned him to an administrative position in the Roman Curia naming him archpriest of the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore, and he later presided at one of the Pope's funeral masses. Law's successor in Boston, Archbishop (later Cardinal) Seán P. O'Malley found it necessary to sell substantial real estate properties and close a number of churches in order to pay the $120 million in claims against the archdiocese.
Two bishops of Palm Beach, Florida resigned due to child abuse allegations.  Resigned bishop Joseph Keith Symons was replaced by Anthony O'Connell, who later also resigned in 2002.

==Irish government responses==

In an address before the Irish parliament on May 11, 1999, Taoiseach Bertie Ahern announced a comprehensive program to respond to the scandal of abuse in the nation's Catholic-run childcare institutions.  Ahern's speech included the first official apology to those who had been abused physically and sexually while they had been in the care of these institutions. The Taoiseach asked the abuse victims for forgiveness, saying: "On behalf of the State and of all citizens of the State, the Government wishes to make a sincere and long overdue apology to the victims of childhood abuse for our collective failure to intervene, to detect their pain, to come to their rescue."
In response to the furor aroused by the media reports of abuse in Irish government institutions run by religious orders, the Irish government commissioned a study which took nine years to complete.  On May 20, 2009, the commission released its 2600 page report, which drew on testimony from thousands of former inmates and officials from more than 250 institutions.  The commission found that there were thousands of allegations of physical abuse of children of both sexes over a period of six decades. Over the same period there were also around 370 allegations of children who had suffered various forms of sexual abuse from religious and others.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.childabusecommission.com/rpt/03-07.php |publisher=The Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse  |title=Commission Report Vol 3 Ch. 7|accessdate=2009-07-22[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.childabusecommission.com/rpt/03-09.php |publisher=The Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse  |title=Commission Report Vol 3 Ch. 9|accessdate=2009-07-22[/tpl] The report also revealed that government inspectors had failed in their responsibility to detect and stop the abuse.  The report characterized sexual molestation as "endemic" in some church-run industrial schools and orphanages for boys.Irish Time: Sexual abuse endemic in boys' institutions
In the wake of the broadcast of a BBC Television documentary "Suing the Pope", which highlighted the case of Seán Fortune, one of the most notorious clerical sexual offenders, the Irish government initiated an official inquiry into the allegations of clerical sexual abuse in the Irish Roman Catholic Diocese of Ferns. .Suing the Pope BBC News  The inquiry resulted in the publication of the Ferns Report in 2005.
In response to the Ferns Report, Ireland's Prime Minister Brian Cowen stated that he was "ashamed by the extent, length, and cruelty" of child abuse, apologized to victims for the government's failure to intervene in endemic sexual abuse and severe beatings in schools for much of the 20th century. Cowen also promised to reform the Ireland's social services for children in line with the recommendations of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse report.Shamed by child abuse, Ireland to reform services Reuters, May 26, 2009 Irish President Mary McAleese and Cowen made further motions to start criminal investigation against members of Roman Catholic religious orders in Ireland."Irish Church Abusers Should Face Law, McAleese Says", Bloomberg, May 30th 2009

In 2009, The Murphy Report is the result of a three-year public inquiry conducted by Irish government into the Sexual abuse scandal in Dublin archdiocese, released a few months after the report of the Ryan report.  The Murphy report stated that, "The Commission has no doubt that clerical child sexual abuse was covered up by the Archdiocese of Dublin and other Church authorities".  It found that, "The structures and rules of the Catholic Church facilitated that cover-up." Moreover, the report asserted that, "State authorities facilitated that cover-up by not fulfilling their responsibilities to ensure that the law was applied equally to all and allowing the Church institutions to be beyond the reach of the normal law enforcement processes."  The report criticized four archbishops – John Charles McQuaid who died in 1973, Dermot Ryan who died in 1984, Kevin McNamara who died in 1987, and retired Cardinal Desmond Connell – for not handing over information on abusers to legal authorities.[tpl]Cite news|title=Catholic Church in Ireland given immunity for child sexual abuse cover-up, report says |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/religion/6662086/Catholic-Church-in-Ireland-given-immunity-for-child-sexual-abuse-cover-up-report-says.html |date=2009-11-26 |accessdate=2010-01-06 | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London[/tpl]

==Church responses==

The responses of the Catholic Church to the sex abuse cases can be viewed on three levels: the diocesan level, the episcopal conference level, and the Vatican. Responses to the scandal proceeded at levels in parallel, with the higher levels becoming progressively more involved as the gravity of the problem became more apparent. For the most part, responding to allegations of sexual abuse in a diocese was left to the jurisdiction of the local bishop or archbishop. According to Thomas Plante, a psychiatrist specializing in abuse counseling and considered an expert on clerical abuse, "unlike most large organizations that maintain a variety of middle management positions, the organizational structure of the Catholic Church is a fairly flat structure. Therefore, prior to the Church clergy abuse crisis in 2002, each bishop decided for himself how to manage these cases and the allegations of child sexual abuse by priests. Some have handled these matters very poorly (as evidenced in Boston) while others have handled these issues very well."
After the number of allegations exploded following the Boston Globe's series of articles, the breadth and depth of the scandals became apparent in dioceses across the United States. The U.S. bishops felt compelled to formulate a coordinated response at the episcopal conference level. Although the Vatican did not respond immediately to the series of articles published by the Boston Globe in 2002, it has been reported that Vatican officials were, in fact, monitoring the situation in the U.S. closely.
John L. Allen, Jr., senior correspondent for the National Catholic Reporter, characterized the reaction of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) as calling for "swift, sure and final punishment for priests who are guilty of this kind of misconduct." In contrast to this, Allen characterized the Vatican's primary concern as wanting to make sure "that everyone's rights are respected, including the rights of accused clergy" and wanting to affirm that it is not acceptable to "remedy the injustice of sexual abuse with the injustice of railroading priests who may or may not be guilty."

===Diocesan responses===

====United States====

According to the John Jay Report one in four child sex abuse allegations were made within 10 years of the incident. Half were made between 10 and 30 years after the incident and the remaining 25% were reported more than 30 years after the incident.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.usccb.org/nrb/johnjaystudy/response3.pdf |title=Response from Dioceses and Religious Communities |accessdate=2010-01-18[/tpl]

=====Rehabilitation efforts=====

Since 2002, a major focus of the lawsuits and media attention has been criticism of the approach taken by bishops when dealing with allegations of sexual abuse by priests.  As a general rule, the allegations were not reported to legal authority for investigation and prosecution.  Instead, many dioceses directed the offending priests to seek psychiatric treatment and for assessment of the risk of re-offending. In 2004, according to the John Jay report, nearly 40% of accused priests participated in psychiatric treatment programs. The remaining priests did not undergo abuse counseling because allegations of sexual abuse were only made after their death. The more allegations made against a priest, the more likely he was to participate in treatment.
Some bishops repeatedly moved offending priests from parish to parish after abuse counseling, where they still had personal contact with children. In response to these allegations, defenders of the Church's actions have suggested that in re-assigning priests after treatment, bishops were acting on the best medical advice then available.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl] According to the USCCB, Catholic bishops in the 1950s and 1960s viewed sexual abuse by priests as "a spiritual problem, one requiring a spiritual solution, i.e. prayer".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nccbuscc.org/mr/mediatalk/Warnings_of_Sexual_Abuse.shtml |title=Media Talk: Warnings of Sexual Abuse in the 1950s |accessdate=2010-01-04[/tpl]
However, starting in the 1960s, the bishops came to adopt an emerging view based on the advice of medical personnel who recommended psychiatric and psychological treatment for those who sexually abused minors.  This view asserted that with treatment priests who had molested children could safely be placed back into ministry, although perhaps with certain restrictions such as not being in contact with children.Frawley-ODea, Perversion of Power: Sexual Abuse in the Catholic Church  (2007), p. 4  This approach viewed pedophilia as an addiction, such as alcoholism which can be treated and restrained.
Some of the North American treatment facilities most frequently used for this purpose included the Saint Luke Institute in Maryland; centers operated by the Servants of the Paraclete in Jemez Springs, New Mexico, and St. Louis, Missouri; John Vianney Center in Downingtown, Pennsylvania.; the Institute of Living in Hartford, Connecticut; and the Southdown Institute near Toronto, Ontario in Canada.[tpl]citation |journal= |title=Priest treatment unfolds in costly, secretive world |last=Barry |first=Ellen |url=http://www.pulitzer.org/archives/6740 |date=2002-04-03 |accessdate=2009-01-04[/tpl] This approach continued into the mid-1980s, a period which the USCCB characterizes as the "tipping point in the understanding of the problem within the church and in society". According to researcher Paul Isley, however, research on priest offenders is virtually nonexistent and the claims of unprecedented treatment success with clergy offenders have not been supported by published data.[tpl]Cite journal|journal=Pastoral Psychology |first=Paul J. |last=Isley |title=Child sexual abuse and the Catholic church: An historical and contemporary review |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/pv666385476j9037/ |publisher=Springer Netherlands |date = March 1997|pages=277–299[/tpl]

=====Prevention efforts=====

The USCCB perceived a lack of adequate procedures for the prevention of sexual abuse of minors, the reporting of allegations of such abuse and the handling of those reports.  In response to deficiencies in canonical and secular law, both ecclesiastical and civil authorities have implemented procedures and laws to prevent sexual abuse of minors by clergy and to report and punish it if and when it occurs.  In June 2002, the USCCB adopted a zero tolerance for responding to allegations of sexual abuse. It promulgated a Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People that pledged the Catholic Church in the U.S. to providing a "safe environment" for all children in Church-sponsored activities.http://www.beliefnet.com/Faiths/Christianity/Catholic/2002/06/Insiders-Guide-To-The-Catholic-Bishops-Conference.aspx
The Charter instituted reforms to prevent future abuse by requiring background checks for Church employees. The Charter requires dioceses faced with an allegation to alert the authorities, conduct an investigation and remove the accused from duty.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.usccb.org/ocyp/charter.shtml|title=Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People|accessdate=2007-10-08|publisher=United States Conference of Catholic Bishops|year=2005|author=United States Conference of Catholic Bishops[/tpl] A Dallas Morning News article reported nearly two-thirds of the bishops attending the conference had covered for sexually abusive priests.Dallas Morning News | News for Dallas, Texas | Catholic Bishops and Sex Abuse According to Catholic News Service by 2008, the U.S. church had trained "5.8 million children to recognize and report abuse," run criminal checks on volunteers and employees and trained them to create a safe environment for children.[tpl]Cite book| author = Catholic News Service |title = We dare not become complacent on abuse, says U.S. bishops' new child protection head | publisher = Florida Catholic | date = December 19, 2008 – January 1, 2009[/tpl]

=====Reception by the laity=====

A 2006 study by Jesuit Georgetown University Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate (CARA) found lay Catholics were unaware of the specific steps that the church has decided to take, but 78% strongly approved reporting allegations of sexual abuse to civil authorities and 76% strongly approved of removing people credibly accused of sexual abuse of a minor.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.zenit.org/article-9560?l=english |title=Vatican Study on Sex Abuse |first=Delia |last=Gallagher |publisher=Zenit[/tpl]Mark M.

=====Ongoing investigations=====

In 2005, Kathleen McChesney of the USCCB said "In 2004, at least 1,092 allegations of sexual abuse were made against at least 756 Catholic priests and deacons in the United States.

====Ireland====

In June 2001, the hierarchy of the Catholic Church in Ireland established the Catholic Church Commission on Child Sexual Abuse (Ireland), also known as the Hussey Commission, to investigate how complaints about clerical abuse of minors have been handled over the last three decades.
In February 2002, 18 religious orders agreed to provide more than 128 million Euros (approximately $128 million) in compensation to the victims of childhood abuse.  Most of the money was raised from church property transfers to the State; in fact the actual value of the settlement is estimated to be about half that, and the Archbisop of Dublin in 2009 accused the orders of falling short even on the amount promised, and said the church's failure to complete transfers of cash, property and land worth at least €128 million over the past seven years "is stunning".
The agreement also stipulated that any victims who accepted monetary settlements would waive their right to sue both the church and the government, and that the identities of the accused abusers was to be kept secret.Guardian newspaper: Archbishop slams Irish Catholic orders over abuse, 2009 In 2009 the orders agreed to increase their contribution; it was learned that total compensation paid to victims was about €1.2 billion, so that until then the promised €128 m had been about 10% of the total.Catholic News Service: Irish religious orders agree to boost compensation for abuse victims, 2009
In September 2010 the Vatican announced that it would shortly begin an investigation into how the Irish Catholic Establishment's handling of the sex abuse and subsequent scandal. This enquiry will include consulting groups representing victims. Co founder of Irish Survivors of Child Abuse (Soca), stated that "Irish Soca and other survivors' groups are excited over the apostolic visitation because it's the end of allowing the Irish hierarchy to handle the scandal and crises on their own."[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/sep/13/irish-paedophile-priests-vatican-inquiry | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Vatican inquiry into Irish paedophile priests to meet victim groups | first=Henry | last=McDonald | date=2010-09-13[/tpl]

====Philippines====

When sexual scandals involving Catholic priests in the US came to light in 2002, the Philippines media began reporting on abuses by local priests.  In July of that year, the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines apologized for sexual misconduct committed by its priests over the last two decades and committed to drafting guidelines on how to deal with allegations of such offenses.  According to Archbishop Orlando Quevedo, president of the Catholic Bishops Conference, about 200 of the country's 7,000 priests may have committed "sexual misconduct" – including child abuse, homosexuality and affairs – over the past two decades.[tpl]Cite news|title=Philippines Church apologises for sex abuse |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2116154.stm |date=2002-07-08 |accessdate=2010-01-10 | work=BBC News[/tpl]
In August 2011, activist women's group "Gabriela" assisted a 17-year old girl in filing sexual abuse allegations against a priest in Butuan province.

===Episcopal responses===

====United States====

In June 2002, the USCCB established the "Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People", a comprehensive set of procedures for addressing allegations of sexual abuse of minors by Catholic clergy. The charter includes guidelines for reconciliation, healing, accountability, and prevention of future acts of abuse. It also directs action in the following matters:

The Board also approached John Jay College of Criminal Justice to conduct a descriptive study of
the nature and scope of the problem of child sexual abuse in the Catholic Church. The College assembled an experienced team of researchers with expertise in the areas of forensic psychology, criminology, and human behavior, and, working with the Board, formulated a methodology to address the study mandate. Data collection commenced in March 2003, and ended in February 2004.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.usccb.org/nrb/johnjaystudy/ |title=The Nature and Scope of the Problem of Sexual Abuse of Minors by Catholic Priests and Deacons in the United States |publisher=USCCB |accessdate=2010-04-27[/tpl]

====United Kingdom====

The 2001 Lord Nolan recommendations, accepted in full by the bishops, became model guidelines for other bishops' conferences around the world, and a model for other institutions in Britain. One guideline was that in each parish there should be a "safeguarding officer", a lay person who would vet through the Criminal Records Bureau, a government agency, anyone in the parish who had access to young people or vulnerable adults, and would be a contact for anyone with any concerns.[tpl]cite web|url=http://americamagazine.org/blog/entry.cfm?blog_id=2&entry_id=2800 |title=America Magazine |publisher=America Magazine |date=2010-04-22 |accessdate=2010-04-27[/tpl]

===Vatican responses===

John L. Allen, Jr., Vatican correspondent for the National Catholic Reporter, has commented that many American Catholics saw the Vatican's initial silence on the Boston Globe stories as showing a lack of concern or awareness about the issue. However, Allen said that he doesn't know anyone in the Roman Curia, who was not at least horrified "by the revelations that came out of the Globe and elsewhere" or who would defend "Cardinal Law's handling of the cases in Boston" or "the rather shocking lack of oversight that revealed itself" though "they might have different analyses of what should have happened to him". Allen described the Vatican's perspective as being somewhat skeptical of the media handling of the scandal. In addition, he asserted that the Vatican viewed American cultural attitudes toward sexuality as being somewhat hysterical as well as exhibiting a lack of understanding of the Catholic Church.
According to Allen, cultural differences between the Vatican and American Catholics complicated the process of formulating a comprehensive response to the sexual abuse scandal: "there is a lot about the American culture and the American Church that puzzles people in the Vatican, and there is much about the Vatican that puzzles Americans and English speakers generally."[tpl]Cite journal|journal=Connections |url=http://office.ajcunet.edu/connections/display.asp?issue=12&article=8&backissue=open |title=SCU Conference on the Crisis |date = December 2003|volume=4| issue = =4[/tpl]

====1962====

Cardinal Alfredo Ottaviani, Secretary of the Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office, sent a letter which became known as the Crimen sollicitationis.  In this letter, addressed to "all Patriarchs, Archbishops, Bishops and other Local Ordinaries, including those of Eastern Rite", the Holy Office laid down procedures to be followed in dealing with cases of clerics (priests or bishops) of the Catholic Church accused of having used the sacrament of Penance to make sexual advances to penitents; its rules were more specific than the generic ones in the Code of Canon Law.Codex Iuris Canonici (1917), Liber quartus: De processibus
In addition, it instructed that the same procedures be used when dealing with denunciations of homosexual, paedophile or zoophile behaviour by clerics.  It repeated the rule that any Catholic who failed for over a month to denounce a priest who had made such advances in connection with confession was automatically excommunicated and could be absolved only after actually denouncing the priest to the Ordinary of the place or to the Holy Congregation of the Holy Office, or at least promising seriously to do so."18. «Fidelis vero, qui scienter omiserit eum, a quo sollicitatus fuerit, intra mensem denuntiare contra praescriptum (suprarelati) Canonis 904, incurrit in excommunicationem latae sententiae nemini reservatam, non absolvendus nisi postquam obligationi satisfecerit aut se satisfacturum serio promiserit»"

The Vatican promulgated a revised Code of Canon Law which included a canon (1395,§2) which explicitly named sex with a minor by clerics as a canonical crime "to be punished with just penalties, not excluding dismissal from the clerical state if the case so warrants."[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.saintwiki.com/index.php?title=Code_of_Canon_Law,_Book_VI_Part_II:_Penalties_for_Particular_Offenses#TITLE_V:_OFFENSES_AGAINST_SPECIAL_OBLIGATIONS |title=Code_of_Canon_Law,_Book_VI_Part_II:_Penalties_for_Particular_Offenses#TITLE_V:_OFFENSES_AGAINST_SPECIAL_OBLIGATIONS | publisher=Vatican | accessdate=2010-04-18[/tpl]  According to De delictis gravioribus, the letter sent in May 2001 by then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (who later became Pope Benedict XVI) - Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, and according to Father Thomas Patrick Doyle, who has served as an expert witness on Pontifical Canon Law, Crimen Sollicitationis was in force until May 2001.

In April, Pope John Paul II issued a letter stating that "a sin against the Sixth Commandment of the Decalogue by a cleric with a minor under 18 years of age is to be considered a grave sin, or 'delictum gravius.'" In the letter, Sacramentorum sanctitatis tutela (Safeguarding the Sanctity of the Sacraments), "§1 Reservation to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF) is also extended to a delict against the sixth commandment of the Decalogue committed by a cleric with a minor below the age of eighteen years. §2 One who has perpetrated the delict mentioned in §1 is to be punished according to the gravity of the offense, not excluding dismissal or deposition."[tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.bishop-accountability.org/resources/resource-files/churchdocs/SacramentorumAndNormaeEnglish.htm | work=Vatican | title=Sacramentorum Sanctitatis Tutela | accessdate=2010-04-16[/tpl] In other words, the CDF was given a broader mandate to address the sex abuse cases only from 2001[tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.stevencwelsh.com/faith/Catholic-News-sexual-abuse-data-Vatican-news-april-203.php | work=Avvenire | title=Promoter Of Justice At Doctrine Of Faith On Paedophilia | accessdate=2010-04-16[/tpl] – prior to that date, the 1917 Code of Canon Law permitted sexual abuse cases by the clergy to be handled by the Congregation, for the Congregation to open cases itself, or for the Ordinary to handle judgement.Mullaney, Michael.

====2002====

The Vatican instituted reforms to prevent future United States abuse by requiring background checks for all church employees who have contact with children. Since then, in the USA alone, over 2 million volunteers and employees; 52,000 clerics; 6,205 candidates for ordination have had their backgrounds evaluated.[tpl]cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://www.usccb.org/catholic-church-sxl-ab.pdf |title=Powered by Google Docs |publisher=Docs.google.com |accessdate=2012-07-05[/tpl]
In June, the USCCB established the "Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People", a comprehensive set of procedures for addressing allegations of sexual abuse of minors by Catholic clergy. (More details in the Episcopal Responses section above.)

Pope John Paul II stated that "there is no place in the priesthood and religious life for those who would harm the young".Walsh, John Paul II: A Light for the World (2003), p. 62
In April, the Pontifical Academy for Life organized a three-day conference, entitled "Abuse of Children and Young People by Catholic Priests and Religious", where eight non-Catholic psychiatric experts were invited to speak to near all Vatican dicasteries' representatives. The panel of experts overwhelmingly opposed implementation of policies of "zero-tolerance" such as was proposed by the US Conference of Catholic Bishops. One expert called such policies a "case of overkill" since they do not permit flexibility to allow for differences among individual cases.

====2004====

In June, Louisville, Kentucky lawyer William McMurry filed suit against the VaticanLawyers Louisville Kentucky, News on Clergy Sexual Abuse Case against Archdiocese of Louisville Kentucky, William McMurry Lawyers on behalf of three men alleging abuse as far back as 1928, accusing church leaders of organizing a cover-up of cases of sexual abuse of children.

====2005====

In August Pope Benedict was personally accused in a lawsuit of conspiring to cover up the molestation of three boys in Texas by Juan Carlos Patino-Arango in Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston. He sought and obtained immunity from prosecution as head of state of the Holy See."Pope seeks immunity in Texas abuse case", Associated Press, August 17, 2005.

In November the Vatican published Criteria for the Discernment of Vocation for Persons with Homosexual Tendencies, issuing new rules which forbid ordination of men with "deep-seated homosexual tendencies." While the preparation for this document had started ten years before its publication,"'Nothing Extraordinary'?" in Inside the Vatican (ISSN 1068-8579), January 2006 this instruction is seen as an official answer by the Catholic Church to what was seen as a "pedophile priest" crisis.[ref]* [tpl]cite news|title=Vatican Issues New Psychological Screening to Weed Out Pedophiles|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,445187,00.html|accessdate=17 July 2012|newspaper=Associated Press/Fow news|date=October 30, 2008[/tpl]

====2007====

Archbishop Csaba Ternyak, secretary of the Congregation for Clergy, put the following question to the experts: "To what degree one can talk about the rehabilitation of the offender, what are the most effective methods of treatment, and on what grounds we can say that a person who has never offended is at risk to sexually molest someone?"[tpl]Cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1141/is_35_43/ai_n27371508/ |title=Most unaware of bishops' responses to clergy sex abuse |date=2007-08-31 | work=National Catholic Reporter[/tpl]
Ternyak spoke about the way that the crisis had damaged the priest-bishop relationship.  He noted that there was a "sense of gloom" felt by the overwhelming majority of priests who had not been accused of any abuse but nonetheless who perceived that their bishops had turned against them and therefore had "become disillusioned about the effectiveness of the laws of the Church to defend their dignity and their inalienable rights".  Ternyak also noted that "there have been more than a few suicides among accused priests."

In April, during a visit to the United States, Pope Benedict admitted that he was "deeply ashamed" of the clergy sex abuse scandal that has devastated the American church.

Two researchers reported that abuse cases had "steeply declined" after 1985 and that responses to abuse had changed substantially over 50 years, with suspension becoming more common than reinstatement.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2009-11-17-Catholic-abuse-report_N.htm |title=Report:Homosexuality no factor in abusive priests |accessdate= |author=Rachel Zoll |authorlink= |date=2009-11-17 |work= |publisher=USA Today|pages= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= [/tpl]
In a statement, read out by Archbishop Silvano Maria Tomasi at a meeting of the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva on 22 September 2009, the Holy See stated that the majority of Catholic clergy who had committed acts of sexual abuse against under 18 year olds should not be viewed as paedophiles, but as homosexuals who are attracted to sex with adolescent males. The statement said that rather than paedophilia, "it would be more correct to speak of ephebophilia; being a homosexual attraction to adolescent males... Of all priests involved in the abuses, 80 to 90% belong to this sexual orientation minority which is sexually engaged with adolescent boys between the ages of 11 and 17."[tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/sep/28/sex-abuse-religion-vatican | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Sex abuse rife in other religions, says Vatican | first=Riazat | last=Butt | date=2009-09-28 | accessdate=2010-04-01[/tpl]
However, Margaret Smith and Karen Terry, two researchers who worked on the John Jay Report, cautioned against equating the high incidence of abuse by priests against boys with homosexuality, calling it an oversimplification and “an unwarranted conclusion” to assert that the majority of priests who abused male victims are gay. Though “the majority of the abusive acts were homosexual in nature ... participation in homosexual acts is not the same as sexual identity as a gay man.”  She further stated that "the idea of sexual identity should be separated from the problem of sexual abuse...At this point, we do not find a connection between homosexual identity and the increased likelihood of subsequent abuse from the data that we have right now.”[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.politicsdaily.com/2009/11/18/new-catholic-sex-abuse-findings-gay-priests-not-the-problem |title=New Catholic Sex Abuse Findings: Gay Priests Are Not the Problem |accessdate=2010-04-23 |date=2009-11-18[/tpl]   Tomasi's move angered many gay rights organisations, who claimed it was an attempt by the Vatican to redefine the Church's past problems with paedophilia as problems with homosexuality.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.queerty.com/the-vatican-would-prefer-you-refer-to-its-molesting-priests-as-gay-molesting-priests-20090930/ |title=The Vatican Would Prefer You Refer To Its Molesting Priests as Gay Molesting Priests / Queerty |publisher=Queerty.com |accessdate=2010-04-27[/tpl]

====2010====

In April 2010, in response to extensive negative publicity and criticism of the Pope, the Vatican entered what the Associated Press called "full damage control mode". Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, the Vatican's secretary of state, during a visit to Chile, linked the scandal to homosexuality. In response to widespread criticism of that statement, Vatican spokesman, Federico Lombardi said Bertone's statement went outside the remit of church authorities while maintaining that "the statement was aimed at 'clarifying' Cardinal Bertone's remarks and should not be seen as the Holy See 'distancing' itself from them." He also noted that 10 per cent of the cases concerned paedophilia in the "strict sense" and the other 90 per cent concerned sex between priests and adolescents.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/vatican-backs-away-from-no2s-linking-of-paedophilia-with-gays-20100415-shrp.html | publisher=Sydney Morning Herald | title= Vatican Backs Away from No 2's linking of paedophilia with gays | date=April 16, 2010 [/tpl] Giovanni Maria Vian, editor of L'Osservatore Romano, the Vatican's official newspaper, said the continuing criticism of Pope Benedict XVI and the Vatican in handling the clerical sex abuse crisis is part of a media campaign to sell newspapers.

Msgr. Charles J. Scicluna explained in an interview with the Italian newspaper "Avvenire":  "Between 1975 and 1985 I do not believe that any cases of pedophilia committed by priests were brought to the attention of our Congregation. Moreover, following the promulgation of the 1983 Code of Canon Law, there was a period of uncertainty as to which of the "delicta graviora" were reserved to the competency of this dicastery. Only with the 2001 "Motu Proprio" did the crime of pedophilia again become our exclusive remit... In the years (2001–2010) the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF) had "considered accusations concerning around three thousand cases of diocesan and religious priests, which refer to crimes committed over the last fifty years."
Pope Benedict issued an apology to those who had suffered from child abuse in Ireland in March, 2010.Wynne-Jones, Jonathan. (March 20, 2010). "Pope's apology: 'You have suffered grievously and I am truly sorry'". The Daily Telegraph, London. Retrieved February 15, 2013.

In July 2010 the Vatican issued a document to clarify their position. They doubled the length of time after the 18th birthday of the victim that clergymen can be tried in a church court and to streamline the processes for removing pedophile priests. However the new rules are less strict than those already in place in the United States and lack the clarity that pedophilia is a civil offense of the existing rules there.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/15/AR2010071501453.html?hpid=sec-world|title=Vatican issues new rules on abuse by priests; activists call them inadequate|publisher=Washington Post|author=William Wan | date=2010-07-16[/tpl]

The guidelines also reinforce bishops' exclusive authority in dealing with abuse cases. Victims advocacy groups criticized the new guidelines as insufficient, arguing that the recommendations do not have the status of church law and do not provide any specific enforcement mechanisms.Vatican's paedophile guidelines spark fury among sex abuse victims, Belfast Telegraph, May 16, 2011.Vatican sex abuse guidelines 'leave bishops behind cover-ups in control', The Guardian, May 16, 2011.

==Criticisms of church responses==

While the Church in the United States claims to have addressed the issue, some disagree. As Mark Honigsbaum from The Guardian put it in 2006, "...despite the National Review Board's own estimates that there have been some 5,000 abusive priests in the US, to date 150 have been successfully prosecuted."  Some critics of the Church such as Patrick Wall attribute this to a lack of cooperation from the church. In California, for example, the archdiocese has sought to block the disclosure of confidential counseling records on two priests arguing that such action would violate their First Amendment right on religious protection.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2006/may/04/religion.uk |title='Everywhere I turned, I ran into sexual abuse' | work=The Guardian | location=London | first=Mark | last=Honigsbaum | date=2006-05-04 | accessdate=2010-04-01[/tpl] Paul Lakeland claims Church leaders who enabled abuse were too frequently careless about their own accountability and the accountability of perpetrators.Accountability, Credibility and Authority
In 2010, BBC reported that the latest research by experts indicate that Catholic priests may be no more likely than others to abuse. However, a major cause of the scandal was the cover-ups and other alleged shortcomings in the way the church has dealt with the abuses. Particularly, the actions of Catholic bishops in responding to allegations of clerical abuse came under harsh criticism.Marziali, Carl (2003-7-18).

===For non-removal===

The Catholic hierarchy has been criticized for not acting more quickly and decisively to remove, defrock and report priests accused of sexual misconduct. Cardinal Roger Mahony of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, said: "We have said repeatedly that ... our understanding of this problem and the way it's dealt with today evolved, and that in those years ago, decades ago, people didn't realize how serious this was, and so, rather than pulling people out of ministry directly and fully, they were moved."[tpl]cite web|url=http://ncronline.org/news/accountability/bishops-were-warned-abusive-priests |title=Bishops were warned of abusive priests |date=2009-03-20 |first=Tom |last=Roberts |accessdate=2009-07-29[/tpl]
One early opponent of the treatment of sexually abusive priests was Father Gerald Fitzgerald, the founder of The Congregation of the Servants of the Paraclete.  Although Fitzgerald started the Servants of the Paraclete to assist priests who were struggling with alcohol and substance abuse problems, he soon began receiving priests who had sexually abused minors.  Initially, Fitzgerald attempted to treat such priests using the same spiritual methods that he used with his other "guests".  However, as he grew convinced of the futility of treating sexually abusive priests, Fitzgerald came to oppose vehemently the return of sexual abusers to duties as parish priests.  He wrote regularly to bishops in the United States and to Vatican officials, including the pope, of his opinion that many sexual abusers in the priesthood could not be cured and should be defrocked immediately.
Eventually, Fitzgerald lost control of the Servants of the Paraclete.  The center began to employ medical and psychological professionals who added psychiatry and medical treatment to the spiritual regimen of treatment favored by Fitzgerald.  Fitzgerald continued to oppose these modifications to his treatment regimen until his death in 1969.
Bishop Manuel D. Moreno of Tucson, Arizona, USA repeatedly attempted to have two local abusive priests defrocked and disciplined, pleading unsuccessfully in a letter of April 1997 with Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger as head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith to have one of them, who was first suspended in 1990 and convicted by the church in 1997 of five crimes including sexual solicitation in the confessional, defrocked. The two were finally defrocked in 2004.Arizona Daily Star: Moreno struggled to defrock 2 priests Bishop Moreno had been heavily criticized for failing to take action until details of his efforts became public.
In a New York Times article, Bishop Blase J. Cupich, chairman of the United States Bishops Committee for the Protection of Children and Young People, is quoted explaining why Father Fitzgerald's advice "went largely unheeded for 50 years": First, "cases of sexually abusive priests were considered to be rare." Second, Father Fitzgerald's, "views, by and large, were considered bizarre with regard to not treating people medically, but only spiritually, and also segregating a whole population with sexual problems on a deserted island." And finally, "There was mounting evidence in the world of psychology that indicated that when medical treatment is given, these people can, in fact, go back to ministry." This was a view which Cupich characterized as one that "the bishops came to regret."Early Alarm for Church on Abusers in the Clergy by Laurie Goodstein in NY Times

===For secrecy among bishops===

It was revealed that some bishops had facilitated compensation payments to victims on condition that the allegations remained secret.Boston Globe: Scores of priests involved in sex abuse cases, 2002  For example, according to the Boston Globe, the Archdiocese of Boston secretly settled child sexual abuse claims against at least 70 priests from 1992 to 2002.
In November 2009, the Irish Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse reported its findings in which it concluded that:
 "the Dublin Archdiocese's pre-occupations in dealing with cases of child sexual abuse, at least until the mid 1990s, were the maintenance of secrecy, the avoidance of scandal, the protection of the reputation of the Church, and the preservation of its assets. All other considerations, including the welfare of children and justice for victims, were subordinated to these priorities. The Archdiocese did not implement its own canon law rules and did its best to avoid any application of the law of the State".[tpl]Cite news|title =Report by Commission of Investigation into Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin|url=http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/PB09000504[/tpl]

As one of the reasons for the charges they referred also to the "strong suspicion" that Joseph Ratzinger, as head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, covered up the sexual abuse of children and youths and protected the perpetrators.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2011/0223/1224290630240.html|title=Charges initiated against Pope for crimes against humanity|work=Irish Times|date=23 February 2011|accessdate= 28 April 2011|author=Patsy McGarry[/tpl]

In the case of the French bishop Pierre Pican, who did not denounce an abusive priest before trial and as a consequence received a suspended jail sentence, the retired Cardinal Dario Castrillon Hoyos wrote a letter to support Pican in his decision.

In 2011 Hoyos was heavily criticized again. This time the Congregation for the Clergy was blamed of having opposed in 1997 to the newly adapted rules of the Irish bishops, demanding the denouncement of every abusive priest to the police. The Archbishop of Dublin Diarmuid Martin described the cooperation with the Congregation for the Clergy as "disastrous".[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2011/0117/1224287680501.html|title=Vatican edict in 1997 rejected calls to report priests who abused|work=Irish Times|date=17 January 2010|accessdate= 28 April 2011|author=Patsy McGarry[/tpl]

===For Vatican statements denying responsibility (contrary to canon law)===

Canon law states, 
A Vatican spokesman contradicted the canon law above stating,
The Boston Globe compares this inconsistency to Pontius Pilate washing his hands stating the Holy See and the Pope have ultimate authority and responsibility over child abuse throughout the Catholic Church worldwide.
Silvano Tomasi, the Holy See’s ambassador to the U.N. said that, the Vatican was not responsible for abusive priests because "priests are citizens of their own states, and they fall under the jurisdiction of their own country." but the United Nations report differed claiming that priests are “bound by obedience to the pope” under canon law the Vatican is accountable.  The report also urged the Vatican to insist that priests and bishops involve the police in all abuse reports and end a “code of silence” leading to whistleblowers being “ostracized, demoted and fired.” Catholic Church 'systematically' protected abusive priests, U.N. says

===For lack of transparency in Vatican proceedings===

To place the cases under the competence of the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith has been criticized by some as making the process more secretive and lengthening the time required to address the allegations. For example, in his biography of John Paul II, David Yallop asserts that the backlog of referrals to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith for action against sexually abusive priests is so large that it takes 18 months to merely get a reply.[tpl]cite book|last=Yallup|first=David|title=The Power and the Glory: Inside the Dark Heart of Pope John Paul II's Vatican|year=2009|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-465-01542-9|pages=497|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=blCER-BslvAC[/tpl]
Vatican officials have expressed concern that the church's insistence on confidentiality in its treatment of priestly sexual abuse cases was seen as a ban on reporting serious accusations to the civil authorities. Early in 2010 Cardinal Claudio Hummes, the head of the Congregation for Clergy, finally said that instances of sexual abuse by priests were "criminal facts" as well as serious sins and required co-operation with the civil justice system. Italian academic [tpl]Ill|it|Lucetta Scaraffia[/tpl] described the conspiracy involved in hiding the offence as omerta, the Mafia code of silence, and said that "We can hypothesise that a greater female presence, not at a subordinate level, would have been able to rip the veil of masculine secrecy that in the past often covered the denunciation of these misdeeds with silence".
Some parties have interpreted the Crimen sollicitationis - a 1962 document ("Instruction") of the Holy Office (which is now called the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith) codifying procedures to be followed in cases of priests or bishops of the Catholic Church accused of having used the sacrament of Penance to make sexual advances to penitentsThomas Doyle, The 1922 instruction and the 1962 instruction "Crimen sollicitationis" promulgated by the VaticanDe delictis gravioribus, footnote 3 - as a directive from the Vatican to keep all allegations of sexual abuse secret, leading to widespread media coverage of its contents.CBS News Lawyers for some of those making abuse allegations claimed that the document demonstrated a systematic conspiracy to conceal such crimes.The Guardian: Row over Vatican order to conceal priests' sex abuse The Vatican responded that the document was not only widely misinterpreted, but moreover had been superseded by more recent guidelines in the 1960s and 1970s, and especially the 1983 Code of Canon Law.America'': Vatican Official Says 1962 Norms on Solicitation No Longer Apply

===For failure to prevent further abuse===

Mary Dispenza states further that crimes against children took place in the past, take place now and will continue in the future unless Pope Francis and the bishops act decisively to ensure that child safety has higher priority than protecting priests and the image of the Catholic Church.

==United Nations==

The United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child, in early 2014, issued a report asserting that the pope and the Roman Catholic Church have not done enough and protect their reputation rather than protect children."Pope Francis pressured by U.N. committee to act on priest sex abuse cases", AP via New York Daily News, February 5, 2014. The panel of the committee wants all known or suspected child molesters removed, archives on abusers and Bishops who covered up abuse opened, and instances of abuse handed to law enforcement agencies to be investigated and prosecuted.  A joint statement of the panel said,
Committee chair, Kirsten Sandberg enumerated some major findings, that pedophile priests were sent to new parishes or other countries without police being informed, that the Vatican never insisted on bishops reporting abuse to police, and that known abusers still have access to children. Barbara Blaine of SNAP said,
The UN report prompted discussions of specific areas of controversy, including secrecy among bishops and Vatican statements denying responsibility which in canon law they have.
British author Paul Vallely wrote that he felt the UN report had been hurt by the Commission having gone well beyond the issue of ç to issues such as contraception. However, he also felt the report did bring important pressure on the Vatican on important issues like reporting cases to police.Vallely, Paul, "Vatican Missteps and U.N. Blunders", New York Times, February 11, 2014. Retrieved 2014-02-11.

==Media coverage==

The media coverage of Catholic sex abuse cases is a major aspect of the academic literature surrounding the pederastic priest scandal.
In 2002 there was discovery that the sex abuse by Catholic priests was widespread in the U.S. which received significant media coverage. For the first 100 days the New York Times had 225 pieces, including news and commentary and the story appeared on the front page on 26 occasions.[tpl]cite journal|last=Nelson|first=Jeffrey A.|title=Sex Abuse in the American Catholic Church and the Attempt at Redemption|journal=Communication & Theater Association of Minnesota|year=2009|volume=Summer|pages=37–51|quote=From a review of the New York Times, January 9 through April 18, 2002.[/tpl]
Walter V. Robinson, an American journalist and journalism professor led the Boston Globe's coverage of the Roman Catholic sex abuse cases, for which the newspaper won the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service. Robinson was also a Pulitzer Prize finalist in Investigative Reporting in 2007.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/globe/spotlight/abuse/bios/robinson.htm |title=Boston Globe / Spotlight / Abuse in the Catholic Church |publisher=Boston.com |accessdate=2010-08-13[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/city_region/breaking_news/2006/08/walter_v_robins_1.html |title=Walter V.

In Ireland television journalism played a key role in helping public awareness of widespread sexual abuse of children by priests.[tpl]cite journal|last=Kenny|first=Colum|title=Significant Television: Journalism, Sex Abuse and the Catholic Church in Ireland|journal=Irish Communications Review|date=January 2009|volume=11[/tpl]
A Wall Street Journal-NBC News poll found that 64 percent of those queried thought Catholic priests "frequently" abused children despite the fact that there's no data to support the claim at all.

===BBC documentary in 2006===

Produced by a victim of clerical sex abuse for the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) in 2006, the documentary Sex Crimes and the Vatican included the claim that all allegations of sex abuse are to be sent to the Vatican rather than the civil authorities, and that "a secret church decree called 'Crimen sollicitationis' ...  imposes the strictest oath of secrecy on the child victim, the priest dealing with the allegation, and any witnesses. Breaking that oath means instant banishment from the Catholic Church - excommunication."BBC: Panorama - Sex crimes and the Vatican The documentary quoted the 2005 Ferns Report: "A culture of secrecy and fear of scandal that led bishops to place the interests of the Catholic Church ahead of the safety of children".
Canon lawyer Thomas Doyle, who was included in the documentary as supporting the picture that it presented, later wrote with regard to the 1962 Crimen sollicitations and the 2001 De delictis gravioribus as well as the Church's formal investigation into charges of abuse: "There is no basis to assume that the Holy See envisioned this process to be a substitute for any secular legal process, criminal or civil. It is also incorrect to assume, as some have unfortunately done, that these two Vatican documents are proof of a conspiracy to hide sexually abusive priests or to prevent the disclosure of sexual crimes committed by clerics to secular authorities."http://www.bishop-accountability.org/news2010/03_04/2010_03_12_Doyle_VeryImportant.htmhttp://reform-network.net/?m=20100316 However, two years later in 2008 Doyle said of attempts to reform the Catholic Church that it was like "trudging through what can best be described as a swamp of toxic waste".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.votfnj.org/page.cfm?Web_ID=142 |title=Thomas Doyle On Church Reform: VOTF and Reform of the Governmental Structure of the Catholic Church |last=Doyle |first=Thomas |date=January 2008 |work=Voice of the Faithful - New Jersey |publisher=NJ VOTF |accessdate=2010-04-05[/tpl]
The Church was reluctant to hand over to the civil authorities information about the Church's own investigations into charges. In the BBC documentary, Rick Romley, a district attorney who initiated an investigation of the Diocese of Phoenix, stated that "the secrecy, the obstruction I saw during my investigation was unparalleled in my entire career as a DA...it was so difficult to obtain any information from the Church at all." He reported archives of documents and incriminating evidence pertaining to sex abuse that were kept from the authorities, which under the law could not be subpoenaed. "The Church fails to acknowledge such a serious problem but more than that, it is not a passiveness but an openly obstructive way of not allowing authorities to try to stop the abuse within the Church. They fought us every step of the way."

==Debate over causes==

There have been many debates over the causes of sex abuse cases.

===Seminary training===

The 2004 John Jay Report stated "the problem was largely the result of poor seminary training and insufficient emotional support for men ordained in the 1940s and 1950s."[tpl]cite news|last=Zoll|first=Rachel|title=Study: Gays Not to Blame for Pedophile Priests|url=http://www.edgenewyork.com/index.php?ch=news&sc=national&sc2=news&sc3=&id=119731|accessdate=9 July 2012|newspaper=The Edge/Associated Press|date=May 18, 2011|quote=the problem was largely the result of poor seminary training and insufficient emotional support for men ordained in the 1940s and 1950s, who were not able to withstand the social upheaval they confronted as pastors in the 1960s.[/tpl] A report by the National Review Board issued simultaneously with the John Jay Report pointed to two major deficiencies on the part of seminaries: failure to screen candidates adequately, followed by failure to "form" these candidates appropriately for the challenges of celibacy. These themes are taken up by a recent memoirMiles, Vincent J. (2012) Boys of the Cloth: The Accidental Role of Church Reforms in Causing and Curbing Abuse by Priests. Lanham, Maryland: Hamilton Books. that combines a first-hand account of life in a minor seminary during the 1960s with a review of the scientific literature about sexually abusive behavior, and then identifies specific aspects of seminary life that could have predisposed future priests to engage in such behavior.

===Impact of psychology from previous decades===

Some bishops and psychiatrists have asserted that the prevailing psychology of the times suggested that people could be cured of such behavior through counseling.Steinfels, A People Adrift (2003). pp. 40–6 Thomas Plante, a psychiatrist specializing in abuse counseling and considered an expert on clerical abuse, states "the vast majority of the research on sexual abuse of minors didn't emerge until the early 1980s. So, it appeared reasonable at the time to treat these men and then return them to their priestly duties. In hindsight, this was a tragic mistake."Plante, Thomas, "A Perspective on Clergy Sexual Abuse", San Jose Mercury News, March 24, 2002 (updated online version)
Robert S. Bennett, the Roman Catholic Washington attorney who headed the National Review Board's research committee, named "too much faith in psychiatrists" as one of the key problems concerning Catholic sex abuse cases.[tpl]cite web | last = Filteau | first =Jerry | title =Report says clergy sexual abuse brought 'smoke of Satan' into church | publisher =Catholic News Service | year =2004 | url =http://www.catholicnews.com/data/abuse/abuse08.htm | accessdate =2008-03-10 [/tpl]  About 40% of the abusive priests had received counseling before being reassigned.[tpl]cite web | author = Terry, Karen et al.| title = John Jay Report| publisher =John Jay College of Criminal Justice | year = 2004| url =http://www.bishop-accountability.org/reports/2004_02_27_JohnJay/index.html | accessdate =2008-02-09 [/tpl]

===Pedophilia and ephebophilia===

In Sexual Addiction and Compulsivity: The Journal of Treatment and Prevention, Cimbolic & Cartor (2006) noted that because of the large share of post-pubescent male minors among cleric victims there is need to further study the differential variables related to ephebophilia (sexual interest in mid-to-late adolescents, generally ages 15 to 19)[tpl]cite journal |last=Blanchard |first=R. |last2=Lykins |first2=A.

Looking at ephebophilia through the lens of priest sexual abuse. Sexual Addiction and Compulsivity: The Journal of Treatment and Prevention, 13(4), 347–359. Cartor, Cimbolic & Tallon (2008) found that 6 percent of the cleric offenders in the John Jay Report are pedophiles, 32 percent ephebophiles, 15 percent 11 & 12 year olds only (both male and female), 20 percent indiscriminate, and 27 percent mildly indiscriminate.
They also found distinct differences between the pedophile and ephebophile groups. They reported that there may be "another group of offenders who are more indiscriminate in victim choice and represent a more heterogeneous, but still a distinct offender category" and suggested further research to determine "specific variables that are unique to this group and can differentiate these offenders from pedophile and ephebophile offenders" so as to improve the identification and treatment of both offenders and victims.Cartor, Cimbolic & Tallon (2008). Differentiating Pedophilia from Ephebophilia in Cleric Offenders. Sexual Addiction & Compulsivity, Volume 15, Issue 4, pages 311 - 319.
All victims in the John Jay report were minors. Using a non-standard definition of "pre-pubescent," the Causes and Context Study of the John Jay College estimated that only a small percentage of offender priests were true pedophiles.[tpl]citation | author = John Jay College of Criminal Justice | year = 2011| title =  The Causes and Context of Sexual Abuse of Minors by Catholic Priests in the United States, 1950-2010 | publisher = United States Conference of Catholic Bishops | ISBN = 978-1-60137-201-7 | url = http://www.usccb.org/issues-and-action/child-and-youth-protection/upload/The-Causes-and-Context-of-Sexual-Abuse-of-Minors-by-Catholic-Priests-in-the-United-States-1950-2010.pdf | accessdate = July 1, 2012 [/tpl] The study classified victims as pre-pubescent if they were age 10 or younger, whereas the age bracket specified in the current guidelines issued by the American Psychiatric Association is "generally age 13 or younger." A recent book estimates that if the latter definition were used instead of the former, the percentage of victims classified as prepubescent would have been 54% rather than the 18% figure cited by the Causes and Context report, and that a higher percentage of priests would therefore have been classified as pedophiles. The same book also points out that with the pending new definition of "pedohebephilic disorder" in DSM-5, an even higher percentage of victims would fall into a category consistent with their abusers having a recognized psychosexual disorder.

===Gay priests and homosexuality===

According to the John-Jay-Report 80.9% of the alleged abuse victims in the United States were male. This led to William Donohue of the Catholic League to opine: "I maintain it has been a homosexual crisis all along."[tpl]cite news | last = Donohue| first =William| title =Catholic Church's issue is homosexuality, not pedophilia | publisher =The Washington Post | year =2010| url =http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/guestvoices/2010/07/catholic_churchs_issue_is_homosexuality_not_pedophilia.html | accessdate =2010-12-04 [/tpl] This was described as “an unwarranted conclusion” to assert that the majority of priests who abused male victims are gay. Though “the majority of the abusive acts were homosexual in nature ... participation in homosexual acts is not the same as sexual identity as a gay man.”  She further stated that "the idea of sexual identity should be separated from the problem of sexual abuse...At this point, we do not find a connection between homosexual identity and the increased likelihood of subsequent abuse from the data that we have right now.”   Research on pedophilia in general shows a majority of abusers identify themselves as heterosexual.[tpl]cite journal|title=Adult sexual orientation and attraction to underage persons|journal=Archives of Sexual Behaviour|date=May 1978|volume=7|issue=3|pages=175–81|pmid=666571|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/666571?dopt=Abstract|accessdate=29 June 2012|author=Groth AN, Birnbaum HJ|quote=There were no examples of regression to child victims among peer-oriented, homosexual males.

Additionally The New York Times reported "the abuse decreased as more gay priests began serving the church."[tpl]cite news|last=Goodstein|first=Laurie|title=Church Report Cites Social Tumult in Priest Scandals|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/18/us/18bishops.html?_r=1|accessdate=30 June 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 17, 2011|quote=If anything, the report says, the abuse decreased as more gay priests began serving the church.[/tpl]

===Clerical celibacy===

Opinion seems divided on whether there is any definite link or connection between the Roman Catholic institution of celibacy and incidences of child abuse by Catholic clergy.
A 2005 article in the conservative Irish weekly the Western People proposed that clerical celibacy contributed to the abuse problem by suggesting that the institution of celibacy has created a "morally superior" status that is easily misapplied by abusive priests: "The Irish Church's prospect of a recovery is zero for as long as bishops continue blindly to toe the Vatican line of Pope Benedict XVI that a male celibate priesthood is morally superior to other sections of society."Western People, 2 Nov. 2005 Christoph Schönborn and Hans Küng have also said that priestly celibacy could be one of the causes of the sex abuse scandals within the Catholic Church.The Guardian: Archbishop links priestly celibacy and Catholic sex abuse scandals - Christoph Schonborn, archbishop of Vienna, calls for 'unflinching examination' of possible reasons for paedophilia, 11 March 2010
Ernie Allen, president of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, said, "We don't see the Catholic Church as a hotbed of this or a place that has a bigger problem than anyone else. I can tell you without hesitation that we have seen cases in many religious settings, from traveling evangelists to mainstream ministers to rabbis and others."http://www.newsweek.com/id/236096 Philip Jenkins, a long-time Catholic turned Episcopalian, asserts that his "research of cases over the past 20 years indicates no evidence whatever that Catholic or other celibate clergy are any more likely to be involved in misconduct or abuse than clergy of any other denomination—or indeed, than non-clergy. However determined news media may be to see this affair as a crisis of celibacy, the charge is just unsupported."[tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/forum/comm/20020303edjenk03p6.asp | work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | title=Forum: The myth of the 'pedophile priest' | first=Philip | last=Jenkins | date=2002-03-03[/tpl]

===Male culture of the church===

Italian academic Lucetta Scaraffia wrote in L'Osservatore Romano that a greater presence of women in the Vatican could have prevented clerical sexual abuse from taking place.
This view has been challenged and severely criticized by several scholars for denying the cases of nuns implicated in sexual abuse and pedophilia. In 1986, a history scholar from Stanford University, recovered archival information about investigations from 1619 to 1623 involving nuns in Vellano, Italy, secretly exploiting illiterate nuns for several years.Hidalgo, M.L. (2007). Sexual Abuse and the Culture of Catholicism: How Priests and Nuns Become Perpetrators. (p.36) Publisher: Routledge In 1998, a religious research national survey on revealed a very high number of nuns reporting childhood victimizations of sexual abuse by other nuns. It was further noted that the majority of nun-abuse victims are of the same sex.Chibnall, J.T., Wolf, A. & Duckro, P.N. (1998). A National Survey of the Sexual Trauma Experiences of Catholic Nuns. Review of Religious Research Vol. 40, No. 2, pp. 142-167 In 2002, Markham examined the sexual histories of nuns to find several cases of nuns sexually abusing children.Markham, D. J. (2002). Some facts about women religious and child abuse. Covenant, September, 3 In the last decade, many more cases have been recovered suggesting that cases involving nuns are as frequent or more frequent than those involving male priests.

===Priest shortage===

It has been argued that shortage of priests caused the Roman Catholic hierarchy to act in such a way to preserve the number of clergy and ensure that sufficient numbers were available to serve their congregations despite serious allegations that these priests were unfit for duty.Catholic Priests in India 'Outsourced' to Meet Clergy Shortage in West – 2004-06-11 Others disagree and assert that the Church hierarchy's mishandling of the sex abuse cases merely reflected their prevailing attitude at the time towards any illegal or immoral activity by clergy. [tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2010[/tpl]

===Purported declining standards in prevailing culture===

In The Courage To Be Catholic: Crisis, Reform, and the Future of the Church, author George Weigel claims that it was the infidelity to orthodox Roman Catholic teaching, the "culture of dissent" of priests, women religious, bishops, theologians, catechists, Church bureaucrats, and activists who "believed that what the Church proposed as true was actually false" was mainly responsible for this problem.George Weigel on the Church Crisis in U.S catholiceducation.org Cardinal Theodore Edgar McCarrick, retired Archbishop of Washington, blamed the declining morals of the late 20th century as a cause of the high number of sexually abusive priests.Down For Maintenance
The hypothesis that a purported decline in general moral standards was associated with an increase in abuse by clergy was promoted by a study by John Jay College funded by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. The study claimed that the liberal 1960s caused the increase in abuse, and the conservative Reagan years led to its decline. The study was branded the 'Woodstock Defence' by critics who said that the study's own figures showed a surge in abuse reported from the 1950s, and the passage of time meant that reports of abuse from earlier decades were unlikely.[tpl]cite news|last=Silk|first=Mark|title='Woodstock defense' of abuse doesn't hold water|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2011/may/25/woodstock-defence-abuse-catholic-church|accessdate=8 May 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=25 May 2011|location=London[/tpl]
Reinforcing this criticism of the 'Woodstock Defense,' a recent book used data extracted from the Causes and Context report to show that the incidence of abuse actually increased more before the advent of the "permissive society" in the mid 1960s than after it. Given this statistic, the book further argued that Vatican II reforms and the "moral ambiguity" they supposedly created could not have caused the surge in abuse either, since the Council did not end until 1965 and its major reforms then took several years to implement. The book proposes an alternative explanation for the timing of the abuse "epidemic" based on two key factors: the extreme isolation of traditional seminaries from the outside world, and its particularly disorienting effect on future priests who trained during the turbulent and transformational period between the 1930s and 1950s; and a major surge in seminary enrollment that began around 1940 and which –  as first noted by the National Review Board in 2004National Review Board for the Protection of Children and Young People (2004). A Report on the Crisis in the Catholic Church in the United States. Washington: United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. – allowed a larger number of unsuitable characters to enter seminaries and become priests.

==Popular culture==

Many popular culture representations have been made of the sex abuse of children cases. Some are first person like Sex crimes and the Vatican (2006) is a documentary film by Colm O'Gorman, who was raped by a Catholic priest in the diocese of Ferns in County Wexford in Ireland when he was 14 years old.

===Publications===

A number of books have been written about the abuse suffered from priests and nuns, including Andrew Madden's Altar Boy: A Story of Life After Abuse, Carolyn Lehman's Strong at the Heart: How it Feels to Heal from Sexual Abuse, Larry Kelly's The Pigeon House which deals with abuse in the Pigeon House TB Sanatorium at Ringsend, and Kathy O'Beirne's bestseller Kathy's Story which details physical and sexual abuse suffered in a Magdalene laundry in Ireland. Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Ed West has asserted that Kathy Beirne's story is "largely invented" according to Kathy's Real Story, a book by Hermann Kelly, a Derry born journalist on the Irish Daily Mail and former editor of The Irish Catholic."Mis lit: Is this the end for the misery memoir?", Daily Telegraph 5 March 2008.

===Films and documentaries===

The Magdalene laundries caught the public's attention in the late 1990s as claims of widespread abuse from some former inmates gathered momentum and were made the subject a controversial film called The Magdalene Sisters (2002). In 2006, a documentary called Deliver Us From Evil was made about sexual abuse and primarily focused on one priest and his crimes; it also showed the lengths the Catholic Church would go to in order to cover up the many reports of sexual abuse.
Several other films have been made about sex abuse within the Church, including:
A daily updated list of films and documentaries is available at the "Literature List Clergy Sexual Abuse"http://www.verschueren.at/literatuurlijst_seksueel_misbruik_4.html composed by journalist and author [tpl]Ill|nl|Roel Verschueren[/tpl].

===Music===

Death metal band Immolation, already known for their anti-religious themes, has a song called "Father, You're Not A Father" on their 2000 album Close to a World Below about a traumatized child who was abused by a priest.  In 2003, the band Epica released the song "Cry for the Moon" on the album "The Phantom Agony" (it was released as a single the next year), based on the sex abuse scandals of the Catholic Church. This song is part of their anti-religion series, "The Embrace That Smothers". "Altered Boy" on Exodus's album, Shovel Headed Kill Machine (2005), speaks against sexual abuse in the Catholic Church.  The abuse inspired Billy Talent to write their song "Devil in a Midnight Mass" (first released in 2005). Also in 2005, Limp Bizkit released the album The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1), which focuses on dark lyrical subject matter, including Catholic sex abuse cases, terrorism and fame.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-unquestionable-truth-pt-1-r740966/review |title=The Unquestionable Truth, Pt. 1 - Limp Bizkit |author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas |work= |publisher=Allmusic |accessdate=17 December 2011[/tpl]  In 2007, Apocalyptica first released "I'm Not Jesus", featuring singer Corey Taylor, which is a song about a former victim of Catholic sex abuse. Polish band Hunter made song called "Armia Boga" that describes 
sex abuses in Catholic Church.

===Television===

The popular television show South Park parodied the scandal in 2002, with an episode entitled "Red Hot Catholic Love". The local priest in South Park tries to stop priests around the world from having sex with young boys, but they all fail to see the problem and instead of fixing it, try to come up with ways of not getting caught. As early as 1992, singer Sinéad O'Connor protested child abuse in the Catholic Church in a controversial appearance on Saturday Night Live.
