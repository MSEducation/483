T2 Laboratories Inc. of 3043 Faye Road, Jacksonville, Florida, USA, was a facility that specialized in the design and manufacture of specialty chemicals primarily for gasoline additives.[tpl]cite web | title=T2 Labs - Manufacturer of gasoline additives | url=http://www.t2labs.com/index.htm | accessdate=2008-01-03[/tpl][tpl]cite web | title=T2 Labs is the manufacturer of Ecotane | url=http://www.t2labs.com/ecotane/ecotane.htm | accessdate=2008-01-03[/tpl]  The company cites its low environmental impact specialty chemicals intended to replace more toxic and dangerous industrial chemicals.
On December 19, 2007, a massive explosion and fire killed four people in what is considered the U.S.'s most severe industrial accident in nearly three years.[tpl]cite web | title=Plant Blast is Worst U.S. Industrial Accident in Nearly 3 Years | url=http://www.firstcoastnews.com/news/local/news-article.aspx?storyid=98412 | accessdate=2008-01-03[/tpl]  The explosion's force was equivalent to detonating about a ton of TNT and it spread debris up to a mile from the plant.[tpl]cite web | title=Overheated chamber triggered chemical lab blast | url=http://www.tallahassee.com/legacy/special/blogs/2008/01/overheated-chamber-triggered-chemical.html | accessdate=2008-01-05 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080309040204/http://www.tallahassee.com/legacy/special/blogs/2008/01/overheated-chamber-triggered-chemical.html  |archivedate = 2008-03-09[/tpl]  Fourteen people were hospitalized for chemical exposure or their injuries after the blast.
Following the explosion, every hazardous-materials unit in Jacksonville and over 100 firefighters fought the ensuing blaze, which a spokesman termed a "hellish inferno".
The blast killed Robert Scott Gallagher; Charles Budds Bolchoz, 48; Karey Renard Henry, 35; and Parrish Lamar Ashley, 36.  At the time of his death, Gallagher was Marketing Director for T2 Labs.[tpl]cite web | title=Contact T2 Labs Inc. | url=http://www.t2labs.com/contact/contact.htm | accessdate=2008-01-03[/tpl]
T2 Laboratories' chemical reactor ruptured, according to a preliminary investigation by the U.S. Chemical Safety Board.[tpl]cite web | title=Chemical Reactor Rupture Suspected In Fatal Lab Explosion, Safety Board Says | url=http://www.news4jax.com/news/14941969/detail.html | accessdate=2008-01-03[/tpl]  The investigators reported their belief that the reactor ruptured during the production of a gasoline additive.
The explosion occurred in a 2500 gallon batch reactor during production of methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl. The reactor cooling system, which lacked backups, failed; this led to a thermal runaway.
In September 2009, a report was released by the US Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board as to the cause of the accident.http://www.chemsafety.gov/UserFiles/file/T2%20Final%20Report.pdf
