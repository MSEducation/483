Squirtle, known as [tpl]nihongo|Zenigame|ゼニガメ[/tpl] in Japan, is a Pokémon species in Nintendo and Game Freak's Pokémon franchise. It was originally conceived by Game Freak's character development team and finalized by Ken Sugimori. Its name was changed from Zenigame to Squirtle during the English localization of the series in order to give it a "clever and descriptive name." Its English name is a combination of squirt and turtle. In animated appearances, Squirtle is voiced in Japanese by Rikako Aikawa and in English localizations by Eric Stuart. Squirtle, in the anime, never evolved for reasons never truly explained by the creators.

==Design and characteristics==

Squirtle was one of 151 different designs conceived by Game Freak's character development team and finalised by Ken Sugimori for the first generation of Pocket Monsters games Red and Green, which were localized outside Japan as Pokémon Red and Blue.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/interview/irbj/vol1/index2.html |title=2. 一新されたポケモンの世界 |page=2 |work=Nintendo.com |publisher=Nintendo |accessdate=2010-09-10 |author=Staff |language=Japanese[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=91965 |title=Game Freak on Pokémon! |author=Stuart Bishop |publisher=CVG |date=2003-05-30 |accessdate=2008-02-07|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5VSJaR6xT|archivedate=2008-02-08[/tpl] Originally called "Zenigame" in Japanese, Nintendo decided to give the various Pokémon species "clever and descriptive names" related to their appearance or features when translating the game for western audiences as a means to make the characters more relatable to American children.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/99/1122/cover2.html|title=PokéMania|last=Chua-Euan|first=Howard|date=November 22, 1999|publisher=TIME|accessdate=2008-09-15|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080913182631/http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/99/1122/cover2.html |archivedate=2008-09-13[/tpl] Squirtle's English name comes from a combination of the words "squirt" and "turtle."
Squirtle, known as the Tiny Turtle Pokémon, are cute-looking turtle Pokémon, capable of moving either on two feet or on all fours. Their skin is a light blue, and they possess a long, curled tail. When feeling threatened, Squirtle withdraw their limbs into their brown-orange shells and spray water from their mouth with great force, either to attack their opponent or merely to intimidate it.Pokédex: Shoots water at prey while in the water.

The Mega Evolutions for the three Pokémon's final forms were created, and the designers decided that they should give players an opportunity to find on of these Pokémon in order to see their Mega Evolved form.[tpl]cite web |title=Pokemon X/Y: WHY?!

==Appearances==

===In the video games===

The first video game appearance of Squirtle was in Pokémon Red and Blue. Squirtle is a starter Pokémon the player can choose from at the beginning of Pokémon Red and Blue, and their remakes, Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen. Squirtle and the other starters from Red and Blue are replaced by Pikachu in Pokémon Yellow, the only starter available in it. Instead, they are each obtained from certain NPCs. In Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver, as a reward from Professor Oak after defeating the final boss, Red, the player can choose from Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle. In Pokémon X and Y, players can also choose between Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle near the start of the game shortly after having chosen the games' new starter Pokémon.
Aside from the main games, Squirtle appears in Hey You, Pikachu!, Pokémon Snap, Pokémon Puzzle League, the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon games, the Pokémon Ranger games, and PokéPark Wii: Pikachu's Adventure and its sequel, PokéPark 2: Wonders Beyond. Squirtle appears in Super Smash Bros. Melee as one of many Pokémon balloon floats in the stage Poké Floats; it is the first Poké Float to appear. In Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Squirtle is now playable, under the command of the Pokémon Trainer.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.smashbros.com/wii/en_us/characters/pokemon_trainer.html |title=Pokémon Trainer |work=Smash Bros. DOJO!! |publisher=Smashbros.com |accessdate=2008-02-03[/tpl] The Trainer also has an Ivysaur and a Charizard, all three of which can be switched between; unlike the other fighters, these Pokémon become fatigued and consequently weaker, and must be switched out long enough to recover.

===In anime===

In the animated series, Ash Ketchum, Brock, and Misty encounter a gang of five Squirtle known as the Squirtle Squad in his debut episode "Here Comes the Squirtle Squad!". They first appear as delinquents, but their interactions with Ash and Co. result in them becoming honorary firefighters of their town. The leader of the gang, however, chooses to go with Ash and battle for him; throughout Ash's journey through the Kanto region, it is an invaluable member of Ash's team, and proves its strength without ever evolving. Eventually, the Squirtle parts ways with Ash in order to lead its old gang, who were suffering a lack of proper guidance. Despite returning to its hometown, Squirtle will happily aid Ash whenever he requests it.Whenever Squirtle appears he puts on a pair of black pointed sunglasses. some think he does this because of his Pokédex number which is 007 which relates to the movie James Bond. Ash's second female companion, May received her own Squirtle from Professor Oak. May's Squirtle was very young and timid until evolving, despite being recently born, it quickly grows accustomed to the Pokémon Contests May participates in, even helping May win some, earning Ribbons as rewards. After May leaves Ash's group, she temporarily reunites with him in Sinnoh, revealing that many of her Pokémon had now evolved; Squirtle has since evolved into Wartortle. Eric Stuart does the voice of Squirtle up until late in Ash's Hoenn adventure; Michelle Knotz takes over his role afterwards.
Squirtle is also the main protagonist of Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Team Go-Getters Out Of The Gate!; this Squirtle actually happens to be a young boy, transformed and sent to a world completely inhabited by Pokémon.

===In other media===

Green, the original female protagonist in the Pokémon Adventures, stole a Squirtle from Professor Oak's laboratory. It was not seen until Chapter 15, "Wartortle Wars", by which point it had evolved into a Wartortle, nicknamed Turtley, which she used to try and escape from another trainer, Red, chasing her.Kusaka, Hidenori, & Mato. Pokémon Adventures: Legendary Pokémon, Vol. 2; Chapter 33, Chapter 15, "Wartortle Wars", (pg 7-20) VIZ Media LLC, December 6, 2001. ISBN 1-56931-508-6.
In the Pokémon: Pikachu Shocks Back manga, when Pikachu is separated from Ash temporarily it meets a cynical Squirtle, who believes Ash has abandoned Pikachu. Later, Ash has caught a Squirtle of his own, which accompanies Ash throughout his journeys in the Orange Islands.
