In addition to many originals, they have recorded Johnny Cash's "Home of the Blues," "Cry Like a Baby" (originally by the Box Tops), Gamble and Huff's "Cowboys to Girls" (recorded by the The Intruders and the Commodores), Charlie Rich's "Rebound" and "Life's Little Ups and Downs," Penn and Oldham's "It Tears Me Up" (also recorded by Percy Sledge), and "Mental Revenge" (a song written for Waylon Jennings by Mel Tillis).
