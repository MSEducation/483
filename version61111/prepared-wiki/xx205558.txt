The Yakovlev EG (Eksperimentalnyi Gelikopter), also commonly known as the Yak-M11FR-1 and Sh (Shootka), was an experimental aircraft with coaxial rotors. The prototype was first flown by V.V. Tezavrovsky in December 1947.

==Design and development==

The fuselage of the EG was a welded steel tube truss with duralumin skinning on the fwd fuselage back to the rear of the engine compartment. The rear fuselage was fabric covered and supported a tailplane style with twin end-plate fins, as well as a tailskid. The Pilot and Passenger sat side by side under a glazed canopy with a car style door on each side.
The M-11FR engine was mounted behind the gearbox which it drove via a short shaft. The gear box supported the Rotor pylon
which had two, contra-rotating, co-axial, two-bladed rotors. A fixed tri-cycle undercarriage mounted on steel tube trusses supported the helicopter on the ground.
Flight testing revealed vibration at forward spees above 20–30 km/h. In an effort to reduce vibration the tailplane and fins were removed.
In early 1948 the M-11FR engine was replaced by an M-12, which proved troublesome so an M-11FR was refitted to complete the flight trials by 8 July 1948.
