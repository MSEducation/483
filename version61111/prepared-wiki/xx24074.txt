[[Tatws Pum Munud]] is a traditional Welsh stew, made with sliced potatoes, vegetables and smoked bacon. [[Bacon jam]] and bacon marmalade are also commercially sold foods.
In the U.S. and Europe, bacon is commonly used as a condiment or topping on other foods. Streaky bacon is more commonly used as a topping in the U.S. on such items as pizza, salads, sandwiches, hamburgers, baked potatoes, hot dogs, and soups. In the U.S., sliced smoked loin, which Americans call Canadian bacon, is used less frequently than streaky, but can sometimes be found on pizza, salads, and omelettes.
Bacon is also used in adaptations of dishes, for example bacon wrapped meatloaf,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.wkrg.com/recipes/recipe/bacon_wrapped_meatloaf/12659/ |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080610055615/http://www.wkrg.com/recipes/recipe/bacon_wrapped_meatloaf/12659/ |title=Recipe Bacon wrapped meatloaf |publisher=WKRG Mobile, Alabama |accessdate= 2 January 2014 |date=10 April 2008 |archivedate=10 June 2008[/tpl] and can be mixed in with green beans[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.wkrg.com/recipes/recipe/green_beans_with_bacon/16339/ |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090710030207/http://www.wkrg.com/recipes/recipe/green_beans_with_bacon/16339/ |title=Recipe Green Beans with Bacon |publisher=WKRG Mobile, Alabama |date=July 28, 2008 |accessdate=2 January 2014 |archivedate=10 July 2009[/tpl] or served sautéed over spinach

==Bacon fat==

Bacon fat liquefies and becomes bacon drippings when it is heated. Once cool, it firms into lard if from uncured meat, or rendered bacon fat if from cured meat. Bacon fat is flavourful and is used for various cooking purposes. Traditionally, bacon grease is saved in British and southern U.S. cuisine, and used as a base for cooking and as an all-purpose flavouring, for everything from gravy to cornbread[tpl]Cite book | title=The Joy of Cooking | contribution=Pan Gravy | first=Irma | last=Rombauer | first2= Marion | last2 = Rombauer Becker| authorlink = Irma S.

Bacon, or bacon fat, is often used for barding roast fowl and game birds, especially those that have little fat themselves. Barding consists of laying rashers of bacon or other fats over a roast; a variation is the traditional method of preparing filet mignon of beef, which is wrapped in rashers of bacon before cooking. The bacon itself may afterwards be discarded or served to eat, like cracklings.
One teaspoon ([tpl]convert|4|g|disp=or|abbr=on[/tpl]) of bacon grease has [tpl]convert|38|Cal[/tpl]. It is composed almost completely of fat, with very little additional nutritional value. Bacon fat is roughly 40% saturated. Despite the disputed health risks of excessive bacon grease consumption, it remains popular in the cuisine of the American South.[tpl]cite web | url=http://springhouseatcrossroads.com/from-the-chef-balance-essential-to-southern-food-not-just-bacon-drippings/#.Uvccg0JdUQc | title=From the Chef: Balance Essential to Southern Food, not just Bacon Drippings | publisher=SpringHouse at Crossroads | accessdate=9 February 2014 | author=McDaniel, Rob[/tpl]

==Nutrients==

One [tpl]convert|20|g|1|adj=on[/tpl] rasher of cooked streaky bacon contains [tpl]convert|5.4|g|1[/tpl] of fat, and [tpl]convert|4.4|g|1[/tpl] of protein.[tpl]cite web |url=http://caloriecount.about.com/calories-bacon-i69513 |publisher=Calorie Count |title=Calories in Bacon, Streaky, Cooked – Nutrition and Health Facts |accessdate=2 January 2014[/tpl] Four pieces of bacon can also contain up to 800 mg of sodium, which is roughly equivalent to 1.92 grams of salt. The fat and protein content varies depending on the cut and cooking method.

==Religious concerns==

Judaism prohibits the consumption of bacon as part of the Kashrut, the Jewish dietary laws, that are derived from the Book of Deuteronomy. In kashrut, pig is not kosher, which means it is not fit for consumption.  Deuteronomy 14:3-10 states, "Do not eat any detestable thing. ... The pig is also unclean; although it has a split hoof, it does not chew the cud. You are not to eat their meat or touch their carcasses."[tpl]cite web | url=http://meat.tamu.edu/ansc-307-honors/kosher-halal/ | title=Kosher and Halal | publisher=Texas A&M | accessdate=5 January 2014[/tpl] The Islamic faith also prohibits the consumption of bacon: The Quran: Surah 2:172-173 states, "Allah ... hat only forbidden you eat Dead meat, and blood. And the flesh of swine ..." Texas A&M's Meat Science defines the Quran's objection to swine on the basis that swine are filthy animals with its flesh contaminating its consumer, swine are more vulnerable to disease, and the flesh is more fat than muscle.
Some Christian churches also prohibit the consumption of pork: the Seventh-day Adventist Church prohibits the consumption of swine as taboo,[tpl]cite web|title=Selected Biblical References to Diet|url=http://www.sdada.org/biblical.htm|publisher=Seventh-day Adventist church|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510065147/http://www.sdada.org/biblical.htm|archivedate=10 May 2013[/tpl] and the Ethiopian Orthodox Church forbids the consumption of pork because pigs are "unclean".Charles Kong Soo Ethiopian Holy Week clashes with Christians' 21 April 2011 Trinidad and Tobago Guardian Retrieved 3 February 2014

==Health concerns==

Bacon has a large amount of sodium, and the consumption of a large amount of sodium can put a person at risk for heart disease and high blood pressure.
Bacon is considered by many doctors to be unhealthy if eaten in excess. A study conducted by researchers at the University of Zurich found a connection between eating processed meat and the risk of dying from heart disease or cancer. Processed meats contain preservatives known as nitrates that, when absorbed by the human body, convert into nitrosamine, a chemical compound that could cause cancer. A second study by researchers at Columbia University found that the consumption of cured meats increase a person's chances of developing chronic pulmonary disease.[tpl]cite news | last = | first = | authorlink = | title = Too much bacon 'bad for lungs' | work = | publisher = BBC | date = 17 April 2007 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6560121.stm | accessdate = 15 March 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | title = Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease | work = | publisher = New York Times | date = 24 September 2008 | url = http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/risk-factors.html | accessdate = 15 March 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090319083914/http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/risk-factors.html | archivedate= 19 March 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
Researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health found in 2010 that eating processed meats (such as bacon) that are preserved by smoking, curing or salting, or with the addition of chemical preservatives, was associated with an increased risk of both heart disease and diabetes.[tpl]cite web | last = Micha | first = Renata | authorlink = |author2=  Mozaffarian, Dariush|author3= Wallace, Sarah | title = Eating Processed Meats, but Not Unprocessed Red Meats, May Raise Risk of Heart Disease and Diabetes | work = | publisher = Harvard School of Public Health | date = 17 May 2010 | url = http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/2010-releases/processed-meats-unprocessed-heart-disease-diabetes.html | accessdate = 3 June 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100604080116/http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/2010-releases/processed-meats-unprocessed-heart-disease-diabetes.html| archivedate= 4 June 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] The same association was not found for unprocessed meat.

==Alternatives==

===Turkey bacon===

Turkey bacon is a popular alternative to bacon.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/10/22/FDJM13HNUH.DTL&type=printable|title=One turkey bacon stands out in the flock|last=Gold|first=Amanda|date=October 22, 2008|work=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=2009-05-13[/tpl] People may choose turkey bacon over real bacon due to health benefits, religious laws, or other reasons. It is lower in fat and calories than bacon, but may used in a similar manner (such as in a BLT sandwich).

====Production and use====

The meat for turkey bacon comes from the whole turkey and can be cured or uncured, smoked, chopped, and reformed into strips that resemble bacon. Turkey bacon is cooked by pan-frying. Cured turkey bacon made from dark meat can be 90% fat free. The low fat content of turkey bacon means it does not shrink while being cooked and has a tendency to stick to the pan.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/143275/TURKEY-BACON-WINS-SUPPORT-AS-GOOD-MEAT-AT-BREAKFAST.html?pg=all|title=Turkey Bacon Wins Support as Good Meat at Breakfast|date=January 22–23, 1991|work=Deseret News|accessdate=2009-05-13[/tpl]

===Vegetarian bacon===

Vegetarian bacon, also referred to as fakon, veggie bacon, or vacon, is a product marketed as a bacon alternative that is available in supermarkets.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bacon.co.uk/Vegetarian_Bacon.htm|title=Vegetarian Bacon - bacon.co.uk|accessdate=18 June 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325204034/http://www.bacon.co.uk/Vegetarian_Bacon.htm|archivedate=25 March 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-vegetarian-bacon.htm | title=What Is Vegetarian Bacon? | publisher=wiseGEEK | date=3 February 2014 | accessdate=9 February 2014 | author=Brighton, Misty Amber[/tpl] It has no cholesterol, is low in fat, and contains large amounts of protein and fiber. Two slices contain about 74 calories.

==Reception==

Bacon has received mixed reviews from the public.
On one hand, bacon has received a positive reception by the public. Bacon Today states that bacon has a very valuable amount of protein that is "valuable to maintaining our energy levels and a fully functioning, healthy body, with a minimum of those nasty, waist, thigh and butt expanding, fat building carbohydrates."[tpl]cite web | url=http://bacontoday.com/top-10-reasons-bacon-is-actually-healthy-for-you/ | title=Top 10 Reasons Bacon Is Actually HEALTHY For You! | publisher=Bacon Today | accessdate=3 January 2014 | author=Hog, Boss[/tpl] Everything Tastes Better with Bacon, a book by Sara Perry, is a cookbook that compliments bacon's many uses in cooking.[tpl]cite news  | last =Crooks  | first =Laura  | title =Let bacon add a little sizzle to your meal  | url=http://www.spokesmanreview.com/news-story.asp?ID=s1194156&date=080702|work =The Spokesman-Review |publisher=Cowles Publishing Company | page =D1  | date =August 7, 2002  |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20020906192443/http://www.spokesmanreview.com/news-story.asp?ID=s1194156&date=080702|archivedate=September 6, 2002[/tpl]
On the other hand, as with most meat products, producers of bacon have received heavy criticism for how their pigs are treated. Many petitions and protests have occurred trying to raise awareness and change how producers treat their pigs. Many of these protests have turned out successful: for example, following NBC News's report of an undercover investigation of an abusive pig farm, Tyson Foods terminated their contract with the pig farm.[tpl]cite web | url=http://investigations.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/11/20/21534986-tyson-foods-dumps-pig-farm-after-nbc-shows-company-video-of-alleged-abuse?lite | title=Tyson Foods dumps pig farm after NBC shows company video of alleged abuse | publisher=NBC News | last1=Schecter | first1=Anna | last2=Alba | first2=Monica | last3=Perez | first3=Lindsay | date=20 November 2013 | accessdate=3 January 2014 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140125181229/http://investigations.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/11/20/21534986-tyson-foods-dumps-pig-farm-after-nbc-shows-company-video-of-alleged-abuse?lite | archivedate=25 January 2014[/tpl] Similar to NBC's investigation, The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) investigated Seaboard Foods, one of the pig breeding facilities that supply Walmart.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/01/seaboard-corporation-pig-video_n_1244229.html | title=Seaboard Corporation Pig Treatment Challenged By Humane Society Investigation (GRAPHIC VIDEO) | publisher=The Huffington Post | date=1 February 2012 | accessdate=3 January 2014 | author=Zelman, Joanna[/tpl] According to HSUS, the pigs were treated poorly and abused. Walmart spokesperson Diana Gee said, "As soon as we were made aware of the allegations, we immediately reached out to Seaboard to begin investigating the issue ... Pending our review, we will take any action necessary." Petitions also exist that oppose poor treatment of pigs, many of which state that the current treatment of pigs in factories is cruel and unethical.[tpl]cite web | url=http://eatocracy.cnn.com/2012/06/06/gestation-crates/ | title=Clarified – What are gestation crates? | publisher=CNN | date=6 June 2012 | accessdate=9 February 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.mercyforanimals.org/investigations.aspx | title=Undercover Investigations: Exposing Animal Abuse | publisher=Mercy for Animals | accessdate=9 February 2014[/tpl]

==Bacon flavoured products==

The popularity of bacon in the United States has given rise to a number of commercial products that promise to add bacon flavouring without the labour involved in cooking it or the perceived negative qualities of bacon. Some of the more unusual products are evidence of the recent bacon fad, including Bacon vodka, bacon peanut brittle,[tpl]cite web|author=June 4, 2009, 3:30 pm   0 Comments |url=http://www.eatmedaily.com/2009/06/sir-francis-bacon-peanut-brittle-crimes-against-bacon/ |title=Sir Francis Bacon Peanut Brittle against bacon |publisher=Eatmedaily.com |date=2009-06-04 |accessdate=2014-01-02[/tpl] bacon toothpaste,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uncrate.com/men/body/health-fitness/bacon-toothpaste/ |title=Bacon Toothpaste |publisher=Uncrate |date=2012-09-18 |accessdate=2014-01-02[/tpl] Baconnaise (bacon mayonnaise), Bacon Salt, bacon popcorn, and bacon mints.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mcphee.com/shop/products/Bacon-Mints.html |title=Bacon Mints |publisher=Mcphee.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02[/tpl] A range of inedible products are also available including bacon band-aids, dental floss, scarves, soaps, perfumes and air fresheners.

===Bacon bits===

Bacon bits are a frequently used topping on salad or potatoes, and a common element of salad bars. They are usually salted. Bacon bits are made from either small, crumbled pieces of bacon (ends and pieces) or torn or misshapen rashers; in commercial plants they are cooked in continuous microwave ovens. Similar products are made from ham or turkey, and analogues are made from textured vegetable protein, artificially flavoured to resemble bacon.[ref]
