Everton Lock-Up, sometimes referenced by one of its nicknames such as Prince Rupert's Tower or Prince Rupert's Castle is a lock-up located upon Everton Brow in Everton, Liverpool. The 18th century structure is among several which still exist in Merseyside. It is famous for being the centre-piece of the crest of Everton FC.Liverpool History Society.
The Grade II-listed building, which was opened in 1787, was originally an overnight holding place where local drunks and criminals were taken by Parish constables. Prisoners would then be brought before local Justices of the Peace for trial. Punishments would usually be similar to community service such as clearing ditches, unblocking drains or removing rubbish.
The Friends Of Everton Park have included the lock-up in their Everton Park Heritage Trail with information boards displayed near the building. Although the tower is locally called Prince Rupert's Tower, the name is anachronistic because the building was erected 143 years after a Royalist Army camped in the area during the English Civil War in 1644. It's likely the name arose because Everton Brow was historically where preparations were made to attack the Parliamentarian garrison holding Liverpool Castle. Prince Rupert, as commander of the Royalist Cavalry of Charles I is said to have looked down on the fortress and dismissed it with the words: "It is a crow’s nest that any party of schoolboys could take!" It eventually fell after a week of heavy fighting and the loss of 1500 of his men.[tpl]cite book|first=Robert |last=Halley|authorlink=Robert Halley|title=Lancashire: Its Puritanism and Nonconformity|publisher=Tubbs and Brook|year=1872|page=225|isbn=[/tpl]
