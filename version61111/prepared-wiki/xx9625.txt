Oxycodone is a semi-synthetic opioid synthesized from poppy-derived thebaine. It is a narcotic analgesic generally indicated for relief of moderate to severe pain. It was developed in 1916 in GermanyGerman (DE) Patent 296916 as one of several new semi-synthetic opioids in an attempt to improve on the existing opioids.[tpl]cite journal|author=Kalso E|title=Oxycodone|journal =Journal of Pain and Symptom Management|volume=29|issue =5S|pages=S47–S56|year=2005|doi=10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2005.01.010|pmid=15907646[/tpl]
Oxycodone is available as single-ingredient medication in immediate release and controlled release.  Combination products formulated with non-narcotic ingredients such as NSAIDs and paracetamol (acetaminophen) are also available as immediate release formulations.

==Medical uses==

Oxycodone has been in clinical use since 1917,  and it is used for managing moderate to moderately severe acute or chronic pain.[tpl]cite web|title=Oxycodone|url=http://www.drugs.com/monograph/oxycodone.html|work=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists|accessdate=3 April 2011[/tpl] It has been found to improve quality of life for those with many types of pain.[tpl]cite journal|author=Riley J, Eisenberg E, Müller-Schwefe G, Drewes AM, Arendt-Nielsen L|title=Oxycodone: a review of its use in the management of pain|journal=Curr Med Res Opin|volume=24|issue=1|pages=175–192|year=2008 |doi=10.1185/030079908X253708|pmid=18039433[/tpl]
Controlled-release oral tablet form is intended to be taken every 12 hours.[tpl]cite journal |author=Biancofiore, G. |title=Oxycodone controlled release in cancer pain management |journal=Ther Clin Risk Manag |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=229–34 |date=September 2006 |pmid=18360598 |pmc=1936259 |doi=10.2147/tcrm.2006.2.3.229[/tpl] As is the case with other opioids, oxycodone is clearly useful for acute pain and in some instances of chronic cancer pain. Experts are divided in regards to the efficacy of all opioids in non-malignant chronic pain. While the opioids induce acute pain relief, all of them have the potential for dependence, withdrawal and the induction of pain sensitivity and hyperalgesia, thereby causing the symptom (pain) that they are being used to treat.
An Italian study concluded from investigating multiple studies that controlled-release oxycodone is comparable to instant-release oxycodone, morphine and hydromorphone in management of moderate to severe cancer pain. It indicated that side effects appear to be less than those associated with morphine and that it is a valid alternative to morphine and a first-line treatment for cancer pain.[tpl]cite journal|last=Biancofiore|first=G|title=Oxycodone controlled release in cancer pain management.|journal=Therapeutics and clinical risk management|date=September 2006|volume=2|issue=3|pages=229–34|pmid=18360598|pmc=1936259|doi=10.2147/tcrm.2006.2.3.229[/tpl]
In 2001, the European Association for Palliative Care recommended that oral oxycodone could be taken as a second-line alternative to oral morphine for cancer pain.[tpl]cite journal | author = Hanks GW, Conno F, Cherny N, Hanna M, Kalso E, McQuay HJ, Mercadante S, Meynadier J, Poulain P, Ripamonti C, Radbruch L, Casas JR, Sawe J, Twycross RG, Ventafridda V | title = Morphine and alternative opioids in cancer pain: the EAPC recommendations | journal = Br.

===Administration===

Oxycodone can be administered by parenteral or oral route.

==Side effects==

Common side effects include constipation, fatigue, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, anxiety, itching, and sweating.[tpl]cite web|title=Oxycodone Side Effects|url=http://www.drugs.com/sfx/oxycodone-side-effects.html|publisher=Drugs.com|accessdate=22 May 2013[/tpl] Less common side effects (experienced by less than 5% of patients) include loss of appetite, nervousness, abdominal pain, diarrhea, urine retention, dyspnea, and hiccups.
In high doses, overdoses, or in patients not tolerant to opiates, oxycodone can cause shallow breathing, bradycardia, cold-clammy skin, apnea, hypotension, miosis, circulatory collapse, respiratory arrest, and death.

===Dependence, addiction and withdrawal===

The risk of experiencing severe withdrawal symptoms is high if a patient has become physically dependent or addicted and discontinues oxycodone abruptly. Therefore, particularly in cases where the drug has been taken regularly over an extended period of time, use should be discontinued gradually rather than abruptly. People who use oxycodone in a recreational, hazardous, or harmful fashion (not as intended by the prescribing physician) are at even higher risk of severe withdrawal symptoms, as they tend to use higher-than-prescribed doses. The symptoms of oxycodone withdrawal are the same as for other opiate-based painkillers, and may include "anxiety, panic attack, nausea, insomnia, muscle pain, muscle weakness, fevers, and other flu-like symptoms".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cesar.umd.edu/cesar/drugs/oxycodone.asp|title=Oxycodone|accessdate=2009-03-25|date=2005-05-02|publisher=Center for Substance Abuse Research[/tpl]
Withdrawal symptoms have also been reported in newborns whose mothers had been either injecting or orally taking oxycodone during pregnancy.[tpl]cite journal|pmid=12032797|date=June 2002|author=Rao R, Desai NS|title=OxyContin and neonatal abstinence syndrome|volume=22|issue=4|pages=324–5|doi=10.1038/sj.jp.7210744 |url=http://www.nature.com/jp/journal/v22/n4/pdf/7210744a.pdf|format=PDF|journal=J Perinatol|accessdate=2009-03-25[/tpl]

===Hormone imbalance===

As with other opioids, oxycodone (particularly during chronic heavy use) often causes temporary hypogonadism or hormone imbalance.[tpl]cite pmid|23414717[/tpl]

===Detection in biological fluids===

Oxycodone and/or its major metabolites may be measured in blood or urine to monitor for clearance, abuse, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning, or assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Many commercial opiate screening tests cross-react appreciably with oxycodone and its metabolites, but chromatographic techniques can easily distinguish oxycodone from other opiates.R. Baselt, Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man, 9th edition, Biomedical Publications, Foster City, CA, 2011, pp. 1259–1262.

==Pharmacology==

===Mechanism of action===

In 1997, a group of Australian researchers proposed (based on a study in rats) that oxycodone acts on κ-opioid receptors, unlike morphine, which acts upon μ-opioid receptors.[tpl]cite journal|author=Ross FB, Smith MT|title=The intrinsic antinociceptive effects of oxycodone appear to be κ-opioid receptor mediated|journal=Pain|volume=73|issue=2|pages=151–157|year=1997 | pmid=9415500|doi=10.1016/S0304-3959(97)00093-6[/tpl] Further research by this group indicated the drug appears to be a κ2b-opioid agonist.[tpl]cite journal|author=Smith MT|title=Differences between and combinations of opioids re-visited|journal=Curr Opin Anaesthesiol|volume=21|issue=5|pages=596–601|year=2008 |doi=10.1097/ACO.0b013e32830a4c4a|pmid=18784485[/tpl] However, this conclusion has been disputed, primarily on the basis that oxycodone produces effects that are typical of μ-opioid agonists, mainly because oxycodone is metabolized in the liver to oxymorphone as a metabolite, which is a more potent opioid agonist with stronger/higher binding affinity to μ-opioid receptors compared to oxycodone.[tpl]cite journal |author=Kalso E |title=How different is oxycodone from morphine? |journal=Pain |volume=132 |issue=3 |pages=227–228 |year=2007 |pmid=17961923 |doi=10.1016/j.pain.2007.09.027 [/tpl]
In 2006, research by a Japanese group suggested the effect of oxycodone is mediated by different receptors in different situations. Specifically in diabetic mice, the κ-opioid receptor appears to be involved in the antinociceptive effects of oxycodone,[tpl]cite journal |author=Nozaki C, Saitoh A, Kamei J |title=Characterization of the antinociceptive effects of oxycodone in diabetic mice |journal=Eur. J. Pharmacol. |volume=535 |issue=1–3 |pages=145–151 |year=2006 |pmid=16533506 |doi=10.1016/j.ejphar.2006.02.002 [/tpl] while in nondiabetic mice, the μ1-opioid receptor seems to be primarily responsible for these effects.[tpl]cite journal |author=Nozaki C, Kamei J |title=Involvement of mu1-opioid receptor on oxycodone-induced antinociception in diabetic mice |journal=Eur. J. Pharmacol. |volume=560 |issue=2–3 |pages=160–162 |year=2007 |pmid=17292346 |doi=10.1016/j.ejphar.2007.01.021 [/tpl]
After oxycodone binds to the opioid receptor, a G-protein complex is released, which inhibits the release of neurotransmitters by the cell by reducing the amount of cAMP produced, closing the Ca++ channels, and opening the K channels.Chahl, L. Opioids- mechanism of action. Aust Prescr 1996, 19, 63.

===Absorption===

After a dose of conventional oral oxycodone, peak plasma levels of the drug are attained in about one hour;[tpl]cite journal|author=Lalovic B, Kharasch E, Hoffer C, Risler L, Liu-Chen LY, Shen DD|title=Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral oxycodone in healthy human subjects: role of circulating active metabolites|journal=Clin Pharmacol Ther|volume=79|issue=5|pages=461–479|year=2006 | url=http://paincenter.wustl.edu/c/BasicResearch/documents/KharashClinPharm06.pdf|format=PDF|pmid=16678548|accessdate=2009-03-28|doi=10.1016/j.clpt.2006.01.009[/tpl] in contrast, after a dose of OxyContin (an oral controlled-release formulation), peak plasma levels of oxycodone occur in about three hours.[tpl]cite book|title=1. Package insert Oxycontin|publisher=Purdue Pharma L.P|date=2007-11-05|location=Stamford, CT|url=http://www.purduepharma.com/PI/Prescription/Oxycontin.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2009-03-23[/tpl]

===Distribution===

Oxycodone in the blood is distributed to skeletal muscle, liver, intestinal tract, lungs, spleen, and brain. Conventional oral preparations start to reduce pain within 10–15 minutes on an empty stomach; in contrast, OxyContin starts to reduce pain within one hour.

===Metabolism===

Oxycodone is metabolized to α and β oxycodol; oxymorphone, then α and β oxymorphol and noroxymorphone; and noroxycodone, then α and β noroxycodol and noroxymorphone (N-desmethyloxycodone). (14-Hydroxydihydrocodeine that in turn becomes 14-Hydroxydihydromorphine) These metabolites are true only for humans.[tpl]cite journal | author = Moore KA, Ramcharitar V, Levine B, Fowler D | title = Tentative identification of novel oxycodone metabolites in human urine | journal = J Anal Toxicol | volume = 27 | issue = 6 | pages = 346–52 |date=September 2003 | pmid = 14516487 | doi = 10.1093/jat/27.6.346[/tpl] As many as six metabolites for oxycodone (14-hydroxydihydromorphinone, 14-hydroxydihydrocodeine, 14-hydroxydihydrocodeinone N-oxide {oxycodone N-oxide}, 14-hydroxydihydroisocodeine, 14-hydroxydihydrocodeine N-oxide, and noroxycodone) have been found in rabbits,[tpl]cite journal | author = Ishida T, Oguri K, Yoshimura H | title = Isolation and identification of urinary metabolites of oxycodone in rabbits | journal = Drug Metab.

Oxycodone is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system in the liver, making it vulnerable to drug interactions. Some people are fast metabolizers, resulting in reduced analgesic effect, but increased adverse effects, while others are slow metabolisers, resulting in increased toxicity without improved analgesia.[tpl]cite journal | author = Gasche Y, Daali Y, Fathi M, Chiappe A, Cottini S, Dayer P, Desmeules J | title = Codeine intoxication associated with ultrarapid CYP2D6 metabolism | journal = N.

===Elimination===

Oxycodone and its metabolites are mainly excreted in the urine and sweat; therefore, it accumulates in patients with renal impairment.

===Dosage and administration===

Oxycodone can be administered orally, intranasally, via intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous injection, or rectally. The bioavailability of oral administration of oxycodone averages 60–87%, with rectal administration yielding the same results; intranasal varies between individuals with a mean of 46%.Analgesic Expert Group.

==History==

Freund and Speyer of the University of Frankfurt in Germany first synthesized oxycodone from thebaine in 1916,[tpl]cite book|author=Sneader W|title=Drug discovery: a history|publisher=Wiley|year=2005|location=Hoboken, NJ|page=119|isbn=0-471-89980-1[/tpl] a few years after the German pharmaceutical company Bayer had stopped the mass production of heroin due to hazardous use, harmful use, and dependence. It was hoped that a thebaine-derived drug would retain the analgesic effects of morphine and heroin with less dependence. To some extent this was achieved, as oxycodone does not have the same immediate effect as heroin or morphine, nor does it last as long.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]
The first clinical use of the drug was documented in 1917, the year after it was first developed.[tpl]cite journal | author = Sunshine A, Olson NZ, Colon A, Rivera J, Kaiko RF, Fitzmartin RD, Reder RF, Goldenheim PD | title = Analgesic efficacy of controlled-release oxycodone in postoperative pain | journal = J Clin Pharmacol | volume = 36 | issue = 7 | pages = 595–603 |date=July 1996 | pmid = 8844441 | doi = 10.1002/j.1552-4604.1996.tb04223.x| url = http://jcp.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/36/7/59 [/tpl] It was first introduced to the US market in May 1939. In early 1928, Merck introduced a combination product containing scopolamine, oxycodone and ephedrine under the German initials for the ingredients SEE, which was later renamed Scophedal (SCOpolamine ePHEDrine and eukodAL). This combination is essentially an oxycodone analogue of the morphine-based Twilight Sleep with ephedrine added to reduce circulatory and respiratory effects.
In the early 1960s the United States government classified Oxycodone as a schedule II drug.  In 1995 the FDA approved OxyContin.http://www.cesar.umd.edu/cesar/drugs/oxycodone.asp
As of May 2013 an extended release version in the United States is only available as OxyContin brand.http://www.drugs.com/availability/generic-oxycontin.html

About 100,000 men or women per year are admitted to US hospitals due to misuse of this drug, making it the most widely abused opioid drug in America. Diverted oxycodone is taken orally or ingested through insufflation. Other ways of abuse include intravenous injection of oral dosage forms, which are not designed for parenteral use. In 2008, oxycodone and hydrocodone misuse caused 14,800 deaths. Some of the cases, however, were due to the hepatotoxic effect of acetaminophen.Policy Impact: Prescription Pain Killer Overdoses Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

====Legislative changes regulating oxycodone in Canada====

In February 2012, Ontario passed legislation to allow the expansion of an already existing drug-tracking system for publicly funded drugs to include those that are privately insured. This database will function to identify and monitor patient’s attempts to seek prescriptions from multiple doctors or retrieve from multiple pharmacies. Other provinces have proposed similar legislation, while some, such as Nova Scotia, have legislation already in effect for monitoring prescription drug use. These changes have coincided with other changes in Ontario’s legislation to target the misuse of painkillers and high addiction rates to drugs such as oxycodone. As of February 29, 2012, Ontario passed legislation delisting oxycodone from the province’s public drug benefit program. This was a first for any province to delist a drug based on addictive properties. The new law prohibits prescriptions for OxyNeo except to certain patients under the Exceptional Access Program including palliative care and in other extenuating circumstances. Patients already prescribed oxycodone will receive coverage for an additional year for OxyNeo, and after that, it will be disallowed unless designated under the exceptional access program.Olgilvie, Megan. "Ontario delisting OxyContin and its substitute from drug benefit program" Toronto Star (2012-02-17)
Much of the legislative activity has stemmed from Purdue Pharma’s decision in 2011 to begin a modification of oxycodone’s composition to make it more difficult to crush for snorting or injecting. The new formulation, OxyNeo, is intended to be preventative in this regard and retain its effectiveness as a pain killer. Since introducing its Narcotics Safety and Awareness Act, Ontario has committed to focusing on drug addiction, particularly in the monitoring and identification of problem opioid prescriptions, as well as the education of patients, doctors, and pharmacists.Narcotics Safety and Awareness Act. 2010. Ministry of Health and Long Term Care. This Act, introduced in 2010, commits to the establishment of a unified database to fulfill this intention.Irfan Dhalla, Irfan & Born, Karen. Health Debate. (2012-02-22) Both the public and medical community have received the legislation positively, though concerns about the ramifications of legal changes have been expressed. Because laws are largely provincially regulated, many speculate a national strategy is needed to prevent smuggling across provincial borders from jurisdictions with looser restrictions.Ontario OxyContin Rules: New Restrictions Applauded But National Rules Needed. Huffington Post. Canadian Press (2012-02-20)

====Lawsuits in Canada====

Several class action suits across Canada have been launched against the Purdue group of companies and affiliates. Claimants argue the pharmaceutical manufacturers did not meet a standard of care and were negligent in doing so. These lawsuits reference earlier judgments in the United States, which held that Purdue was liable for wrongful marketing practices and misbranding. Since 2007, the Purdue companies have paid over $650 million in settling litigation or facing criminal fines.Martin, Kevin. Lawsuit attacks OxyContin use. C-Health. Sun Media (2008-08-08)
