==Early life==

Rattle was born in Liverpool, the son of Pauline Lila Violet (Greening) and Denis Guttridge Rattle, a Commander in the Royal Navy.[tpl]cite news | author=Nick Barratt | title=Family detective | url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/main.jhtml?xml=/education/2007/09/01/fafamdet101.xml | work=The Daily Telegraph | date=1 September 2007 | accessdate=27 September 2007 | location=London[/tpl] He was educated at Liverpool College. Although Rattle studied piano and violin, his early work with orchestras was as a percussionist. He entered the Royal Academy of Music, University of London, in 1971. There, his teachers included John Carewe. In 1974, his graduation year, Rattle won the John Player International Conducting Competition. After organising and conducting a performance of Mahler's Second Symphony whilst still at the Academy, he was talent-spotted by the music agent Martin Campbell-White, of Harold Holt Ltd (now Askonas Holt Ltd), who has since managed Rattle's career.[tpl]cite web | title=Artist Details: Sir Simon Rattle | url=http://www.askonasholt.co.uk/green/green/home.nsf/ArtistDetails/Sir%20Simon%20Rattle | publisher=Askonas Holt | accessdate=17 August 2007[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] He spent the academic year 1980/81 at St Anne's College, Oxford studying English Language and Literature.[tpl]cite news | author=Sholto Byrnes | title=Simon Rattle: Marching to a revolutionary beat | url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/simon-rattle-marching-to-a-revolutionary-beat-410417.html | work=The Independent | date=4 August 2006 | accessdate=6 August 2007 | location=London[/tpl] He had been attracted to the college by the reputation of Dorothy Bednarowska, Fellow and Tutor in English.[tpl]cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20030117/ai_n9680774 |title=Elisabeth Jay, 'Obituary: Dorothy Bednarowska', The Independent (17 January 2003), paragraph 6 |publisher=Findarticles.com |date= |accessdate=24 December 2012[/tpl][tpl]Verify source|date=December 2012[/tpl] He was elected an Honorary Fellow of St Anne's in 1991.[tpl]cite news | title=Muriel Spark and Simon Rattle in honorands list | url=http://163.1.0.45/gazette/1998-9/weekly/210199/news/story_3.htm | work=Oxford University Gazette | date=21 January 1999 | accessdate=6 August 2007[/tpl]  He was admitted to the degree of Doctor of Music honoris causa of the University of Oxford in 1999.[tpl]cite news | title=Conferment of Honorary Degrees: Degree of Doctor of Music, Sir Simon Rattle, CBE | url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/gazette/1998-9/supps/1_4517.htm#7Ref | work=Oxford University Gazette (Encaenia 1999, Supplement (1) to Gazette No. 4517) | date=25 June 1999 | accessdate=6 August 2007[/tpl]

==UK career==

In 1974, he was made assistant conductor of the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra. His first Prom at the Royal Albert Hall, conducting the London Sinfonietta, was, according to the BBC Proms Archive web-site, on 9 August 1976. The programme included Harrison Birtwistle's Meridian and Arnold Schoenberg's First Chamber Symphony. In 1977 he became assistant conductor of the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic.
His time with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra (CBSO) from 1980 to 1998 drew him to the attention of critics and the public. In 1980, Simon Rattle became the CBSO's Principal Conductor and Artistic Adviser, and in 1990, Music Director. Rattle increased both his profile and that of the orchestra over his tenure. One of his long-term concert projects was the series of concerts of 20th century music titled "Towards the Millennium". One other major achievement during his time was the move of the CBSO from its former venue, Birmingham Town Hall, to a newly built concert hall, Symphony Hall, in 1991. The BBC commissioned film director Jaine Green to follow him in his final year with the CBSO to make Simon Rattle—Moving On.
Rattle was awarded a CBE in 1987 and made a Knight Bachelor in 1994. In 1992, Rattle was named a Principal Guest Conductor of the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment (OAE), along with Frans Brüggen. Rattle now has the title of Principal Artist with the OAE. In 2001, he conducted the OAE at Glyndebourne in their first production of Fidelio with a period-instrument orchestra.[tpl]cite news | author=Peter Conrad | title=What's so funny about Beethoven? | url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,,479986,00.html | work=The Observer | date=29 April 2001 | accessdate=29 March 2007 | location=London[/tpl]
Rattle strongly supported youth music. He led two attempts at gaining the record for the World's Largest Orchestra, both designed to raise awareness of youth music in schools. The first, in 1996, was unsuccessful. The second, in 1998, did succeed and the record held at nearly 4,000 musicians[tpl]cite news | title=Children create world's biggest orchestra | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/220543.stm | work=BBC | date=23 November 1998 | accessdate=27 March 2010[/tpl] until it was broken in 2000 by a group in Vancouver.[tpl]cite news | title=World's Largest Orchestra | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2000/05/15/bc_orchestra000515.html | work=CBC News | date=15 May 2000 | accessdate=27 March 2010[/tpl]
In May 2006 he was made an Honorary Fellow of the Society of Arts. In 2011, the Royal Academy of Music presented him with an Honorary Doctorate. He was appointed Member of the Order of Merit (OM) in the 2014 New Year Honours.[tpl]LondonGazette|issue=60728|supp=yes|startpage=2|endpage=|date=31 December 2013[/tpl]
Rattle conducted the London Symphony Orchestra at the Opening of the London Olympics 2012.

==Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra==

Rattle made his conducting debut with the Berlin Philharmonic (BPO) in 1987, in a performance of Gustav Mahler's Symphony No. 6. In 1999, Rattle was appointed as successor to Claudio Abbado as the orchestra's principal conductor.[tpl]cite news | author=Andrew Clements | title=Picking up the baton | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,288989,00.html | work=The Guardian | date=24 June 1999 | accessdate=22 March 2007 | location=London[/tpl]  The appointment, decided on in a 23 June vote by the orchestra's members, was somewhat controversial, as several members of the orchestra were earlier reported to have preferred Daniel Barenboim for the post.[tpl]cite news | author=Fiachra Gibbons and Kate Connolly | title=Rattle set for classic music's top job | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,292499,00.html | work=The Guardian | date=12 June 1999 | accessdate=22 March 2007 | location=London[/tpl]  Nevertheless, Rattle won the post and proceeded to win over his detractors by refusing to sign the contract until he had ensured that every member of the orchestra was paid fairly, and also that the orchestra would gain artistic independence from the Berlin Senate.[tpl]cite news | author=Ivan Hewett | title=Wilkommen Sir Simon! | url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2002/09/07/bmrat07.xml | work=The Daily Telegraph | date=7 September 2002 | accessdate=23 February 2007 | location=London[/tpl]
Before leaving for Germany and on his arrival, Rattle controversially attacked the British attitude to culture in general, and in particular the artists of the Britart movement,[tpl]cite news | author=Kate Connolly and Amelia Hill | title=Rattle fires parting shot at Brit Art bratpack | url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,780924,00.html | work=The Observer | date=25 August 2002 | accessdate=30 January 2007 | location=London[/tpl] together with the state funding of culture in the UK.[tpl]cite news | author=Vanessa Thorpe | title=Rattle's rage at 'amateur' Arts Council | url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,560610,00.html | work=The Observer | date=30 September 2001 | accessdate=30 January 2007 | location=London[/tpl]
Since his appointment, Rattle has reorganised the Berlin Philharmonic into a foundation, meaning its activities are more under the control of the members rather than politicians. He has also ensured that orchestra members' wages have increased quite dramatically, after falling over the previous few years.[tpl]cite news | author=Kate Connolly | title=Roll over Beethoven, here comes Sir Simon | url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,788189,00.html | work=The Guardian | date=8 September 2002 | accessdate=17 August 2007 | location=London[/tpl] He gave his first concert as principal conductor of the BPO on 7 September 2002, leading performances of Thomas Adès' Asyla and Mahler's Symphony No. 5, performances which received rave reviews from the press worldwide[tpl]cite news | author=Kate Connolly | title=Rattle's rapturous debut | url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,788529,00.html | work=The Guardian | date=9 September 2002 | accessdate=22 March 2007 | location=London[/tpl] and were recorded for CD and DVD release by EMI.

Criticism of Rattle's tenure with the Berlin Philharmonic began to appear after their first season together,[tpl]cite news | author=Stephen Everson | title=The end of the affair | url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1045683,00.html | work=The Guardian | date=20 September 2003 | accessdate=30 January 2007 | location=London[/tpl] and continued in their second season.[tpl]cite news | author=Charlotte Higgins and Ben Aris | title=Is Rattle's Berlin honeymoon over? | url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1205606,00.html | work=The Guardian | date=29 April 2004 | accessdate=30 January 2007 | location=London[/tpl]  Rattle himself stated in 2005 that his relationship with the BPO musicians could sometimes be "turbulent", but also "never destructively so".[tpl]cite news | author=Charlotte Higgins | title=Karaoke, wild tigers, hysteria: Rattle on his turbulent affair with the Berlin Philharmonic | url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1385041,00.html | work=The Guardian | date=7 January 2005 | accessdate=22 March 2007 | location=London[/tpl]

==Musical styles and recordings==

Rattle has conducted a wide variety of music, including some with period instruments (either modern musical instruments whose design is similar to that of instruments commonly in use at the time the piece was composed or the actual historical instrument itself), but he is best known for his interpretations of late 19th- and early 20th-century composers such as Gustav Mahler, with a recording of Mahler's Second Symphony winning several awards on its release[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2008[/tpl] and being regarded by some music critics [tpl]Who|date=April 2008[/tpl] as Rattle's finest recording to date. He has also championed much contemporary music, an example of this being the 1996 TV series Leaving Home, where he presents a 7-part survey of musical styles and conductors with excerpts recorded by the CBSO. His newest recordings with the Berlin orchestra (as of 2006) have, on the whole, been favourably received, notably his recordings of the Dvořák tone poems, Mahler's Symphony No. 9 and Claude Debussy's La mer. The Gramophone Magazine praised the latter as a "magnificent disc" and drew favourable comparisons with interpretations of the piece by Rattle's immediate predecessors, Claudio Abbado and Herbert von Karajan. He has also worked with the Toronto Children's Chorus. Rattle and the BPO also recorded Gustav Holst's The Planets (EMI), which was the BBC Music Magazine Orchestra Choice. In addition, Rattle's acclaimed[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.classicstoday.com/review.asp?ReviewNum=9724 |title=Gershwin: Porgy & Bess/Rattle - Review by Robert Levine |publisher=Classicstoday.com |date= |accessdate=24 December 2012[/tpl] complete 1989 recording of George Gershwin's opera Porgy and Bess was used as the soundtrack for the equally acclaimed[tpl]cite web|url=http://homevideo.about.com/od/dvdreviewslong/a/PorgyBessDVDMoa.htm |title=DVD Pick: "Porgy & Bess" |author=Ivana Redwine |publisher=about.com |date=3 July 2001 |accessdate=24 December 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/2002/may02/Porgy_DVD.htm |title=GERSHWIN Porgy and Bess Rattle DVDIL: Classical Reviews- May2002 MusicWeb(UK) |publisher=Musicweb-international.com |date= |accessdate=24 December 2012[/tpl] 1993 television production of the work. It was the first made-for-television production of Porgy and Bess ever presented. Rattle's 2007 recording of Johannes Brahms's Ein deutsches Requiem received praise from BBC Music Magazine, as "Disc of the Month" for April 2007, "as probably the best new version of the Requiem I've heard in quite some years." Rattle and the BPO have also released recordings of Anton Bruckner's Fourth Symphony (Romantic), and Joseph Haydn's Symphonies Nos. 88, 89, 90, 91, 92 and Sinfonia Concertante.
Rattle's recording of Brahms's Ein deutsches Requiem with the BPO received the Choral Performance Grammy Award in 2008. He has won two other Grammy Awards, one Choral Performance Award for a recording of Stravinsky's Symphony of Psalms in 2007, and another for Best Orchestral Performance for a recording of Mahler's unfinished Symphony No. 10 in 2000.http://www2.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/Winners/Results.aspx The government of France made him a Chevalier de la Légion d'honneur in 2010.
