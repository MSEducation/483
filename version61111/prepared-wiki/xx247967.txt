Upon release, Classic Rock stated "For those who regard Slade as nothing more than a ’70s hit machine,  Live At The BBC (Union Square) is gonna be a right old shock. This is Slade before the hits, a raw, rocking high paced crew.  But then, if you ever saw them live, you’ll know how good this lot were – one of the best."[tpl]cite web|author=mdome |url=http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/news/new-releases-this-weeks-mixed-bag-of-riffs/ |title=Classic Rock » Blog Archive » New Releases: This Week’s Mixed Bag Of Riffs |publisher=Classicrockmagazine.com |date=2009-12-04 |accessdate=2011-08-10[/tpl]
