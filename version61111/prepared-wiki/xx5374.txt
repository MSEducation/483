[[Jones calculus]]

CATEGORIES: Optics, Polarization (waves), Matrices

In optics, polarized light can be described using the Jones calculus, discovered by R. C. Jones in 1941. Polarized light is represented by a Jones vector, and linear optical elements are represented by Jones matrices. When light crosses an optical element the resulting polarization of the emerging light is found by taking the product of the Jones matrix of the optical element and the Jones vector of the incident light.
Note that Jones calculus is only applicable to light that is already fully polarized. Light which is randomly polarized, partially polarized, or incoherent must be treated using Mueller calculus.

==Jones vectors==

The Jones vector describes the polarization of  light.
Thus, the Jones vector represents (relative) amplitude and (relative) phase of electric field in x and y  directions.
The following table gives the 6 common examples of normalized Jones vectors.

==Jones matrices==

The Jones matrices are the operators that act on the Jones Vectors as listed above.  These matrices are implemented by various optical elements such as lenses, beam splitters, mirrors, etc.  The following table gives examples of Jones matrices for polarizers:

==Phase retarders==

Phase retarders introduce a phase shift between the vertical and horizontal component of the field and thus change the polarization of the beam. Phase retarders are usually made out of birefringent uniaxial crystals such as calcite, MgF2 or quartz. Uniaxial crystals have one crystal axis that is different from the other two crystal axes (i.e., ni ≠ nj = nk). This unique axis is called the extraordinary axis and is also referred to as the optic axis. An optic axis can be the fast or the slow axis for the crystal depending on the crystal at hand. Light travels with a higher phase velocity through an axis that has the smallest refractive index and this axis is called the fast axis. Similarly, an axis which has the highest refractive index is called a slow axis since the phase velocity of light is the lowest along this axis. Negative uniaxial crystals (e.g., calcite CaCO3, sapphire Al2O3) have ne o so for these crystals, the extraordinary axis (optic axis) is the fast axis whereas for positive uniaxial crystals (e.g., quartz SiO2, magnesium fluoride MgF2, rutile TiO2), ne > n o and thus the extraordinary axis (optic axis) is the slow axis.
Any phase retarder with fast axis vertical or horizontal has zero off-diagonal terms and thus can be conveniently expressed as 
The special expressions for the phase retarders can be obtained by using the general expression for a birefringent material. In the above expression:

==Rotated elements==

Assume an optical element has its optic axis perpendicular to the surface vector for the plane of incidence and is rotated about this surface vector by angle θ/2 (i.e., the principal plane, through which the optic axis passes, makes angle θ/2 with respect to the plane of polarization of the electric field of the incident TE wave). Recall that a half-wave plate rotates polarization as twice the angle between incident polarization and optic axis (principal plane). Therefore, the Jones matrix for the rotated polarization state, M(θ), is 
This agrees with the expression for a half-wave plate in the table above. These rotations are identical to beam unitary splitter transformation in optical physics given by
where the primed and unprimed coefficients represent beams incident from opposite sides of the beam splitter. The reflected and transmitted components acquire a phase θr and θt, respectively. The requirements for a valid representation of the element are Am. J. Phys. 57 (1), 66 (1988).
