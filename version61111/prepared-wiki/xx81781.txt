Surdas (Sant Kavi Surdas) was a 15th-century blind saint, poet and musician, known for his devotional songs dedicated to Lord Krishna. Surdas is said to have written and composed a hundred thousand songs in his magnum opus the 'Sur Sagar' (Ocean of Melody), out of which only about 8,000 are extant. He is considered a saint and so also known as Sant Surdas, a name which literally means the "slave of melody". His most famous work is  charan kamal bando hari rai

==Early life==

Surdas was  born in 1478 in village Sihi, Faridabad, Haryana. While some say it is Runkta near Agra. He started praising Lord Krishna since he was young. There is a little disagreement regarding the exact birth date of Surdas, some scholars believe it to be 1478 AD, while others believe it to be 1479 AD. Same is the case of the year of his death, it is either considered to be 1581 AD or 1584 AD. As per the limited authentic life history of Surdas, it is said that he lived in Braj(or Bhraj), near Mathura. Surdas was born blind and because of this, he was neglected by his family. As a result, he left his home at tender age of six.

==Surdas attains fame==

Surdas' lilting music and fine poetry attracted many laurels. As his fame spread far and wide, the Mughal emperor Akbar (1542–1605) became his patron. Surdas spent the last years of his life in Braj, the place of his birth and lived on the donations, which he received in return of his bhajan singing and lecturing on religious topics, until he died in c. 1586.
Surdas also attained fame for his purity of devotion towards Lord Krishna. In one incident, Surdas falls into a well and is rescued by Lord Krishna when he calls him for help. Radha asks Krishna why he helped Surdas for which Krishna says its for his devotion. Krishna also warns Radha not to go near him. She however goes near him but Surdas, recognizing the divine sounds, pulls her anklets. Radha tells him who she is but Surdas refuses to return her anklets stating that he cannot believe her as he is blind. Krishna gives Surdas vision and allows him to ask for a boon. Surdas returns the anklets says he has already got what he wanted (the blessings of Krishna) and asks Krishna to make him blind again as he does not want to see anything else in the world after seeing Krishna. Radha is moved by his devotion and Krishna grants his wish by making him blind again thus giving him everlasting fame.

==Poetical works of Surdas==

Although Surdas is known for his greatest work — the Sur Sagar, he also sung Sur-Saravali,is based on the theory of genesis and the festival of Holi, andSahitya-Lahiri, devotional lyrics dedicated to the Supreme Absolute. As if Surdas attained a mystical union with Lord Krishna, which enabled him to compose the verse about Krishna's romance with Radha almost as he was an eyewitness. Surdas' verse is also credited as one that lifted the literary value of the Hindi language, transforming it from a crude to a pleasing tongue.
A Lyric by Surdas: 'The Deeds Of kanha'
There is no end to the deeds of kanha:
true to his promise, he tended the cows in Gokula;
Lord of the gods and compassionate to his devotees, is poor
he came as Nrisingha
and tore apart Hiranyakashipa.
When Bali spread his dominion
over the three worlds,
he begged three paces of land from him
to uphold the majesty of the gods,
and stepped over his entire domain:
here too he rescued the captive elephant.
Countless such deeds figure in the Vedas and the Puranas,
hearing which Suradasa
humbly bows before that Lord.
Surdas was called the sun in the sky of Hindi literature. He is best known for collection of his composition 'Sursagar'. This famous collection is originally said to contain 100,000 songs, however, only 8000 remained today. These songs present vivid description of childhood Lilas of Krishna.

==Influence==

===On Bhakti movement===

The philosophy of Surdas is a reflection of the times.  He was very much immersed in the Bhakti movement that was sweeping  North India.  This movement represented a grass roots spiritual empowerment of the masses. The corresponding spiritual movement of the masses happened in South India in  the first millennium A.D. but also started in 17 years

===On the status of Brij Bhasha===

Surdas' poetry was a dialect of Hindi language, Brij Bhasha, until then considered to be a very plebeian language, as the prevalent literary languages were either Persian or Sanskrit.  The works of Surdas immediately raised the status of Brij Bhasha from a crude language to that of a literary language of great repute.

==Philosophy==

===Shuddhadvaita===

Due to the training he received from his guru Vallabhacharya, Surdas was a proponent of the Shuddhadvaita school of Vaishnavism (also known as Pushti Marg).  This philosophy is based upon the spiritual metaphor of the Radha-Krishna Rasleela (The celestial dance between Radha and Lord Krishna). It propagates the path of Grace of God rather than of merging in Him, which seems an extension of the belief of earlier saints like Kabir Das.

===Foremost amongst the Ashta-chhaap===

Eight Disciples of the Master-Teacher Vallabhacharya are called the Ashta-chhaap, meaning, eight reprints (of the Master). Surdas is considered to be the foremost among them.

==Confusions==

Surdàs, or Bhakat Surdas, whose verse figures in the Guru Granth Sãhib is to be differentiated from Sant Surdas, the blind poet of the same name who wrote Sür Sagar.  Sürdãs, whose original name was Madan Mohan, is said to have been born in 1529, in a high-ranking Brãhman family. As he grew up, he gained proficiency in the arts of music and poetry for which lie had a natural talent. He soon became a celebrated poet, singing with deep passion lyrics of Divine love. He attracted the attention of Emperor Akbar who appointed him governor of the parganah of Sandilà. But Sürdãs’ heart lay elsewhere. He renounced the world and took to the company of holy men dedicating himself solely to the Lord. He died at Banãras. A shrine in the vicinity of the city honours his memory. The Guru Granth Sahib contains one hymn by Bhakta Sürdäs, in the Sãrañg measure[tpl]cite web | url=http://searchgurbani.com/index.php/bhagats/bhagat_surdas | accessdate=23 September 2013[/tpl]
