==Biography==

===Early life===

Lao She was born in Beijing, to a poor family of the Sumuru clan belonging to the Red Banner. His father, who was a guard soldier, died in a street battle with the Eight-Power Allied Forces in the course of the Boxer Rebellion events in 1901. "During my childhood," Lao She later recalled, "I didn't need to hear stories about evil ogres eating children and so forth; the foreign devils my mother told me about were more barbaric and cruel than any fairy tale ogre with a huge mouth and great fangs. And fairy tales are only fairy tales, whereas my mother's stories were 100 percent factual, and they directly affected our whole family.".Lao Shê in Modern Chinese Writers, ed. by Helmut Martin and Jeffrey Kinkley, 1992 In 1913, he was admitted to the Beijing Normal Third High School (currently Beijing Third High School), but had to leave after several months because of financial difficulties. In the same year, he was accepted to Beijing Normal University and graduated in 1918.[tpl]cite book|contribution=Introduction|author=Kwok-Kan Tam|title=駱駝祥子|page=x[/tpl]

===Teaching and Writing Career===

Between 1918 and 1924, Lao She was involved as administrator and faculty member at a number of primary and secondary schools in Beijing and Tianjin. He was highly influenced by the May Fourth Movement (1919). He stated, "The May Fourth Movement gave me a new spirit and a new literary language. I am grateful to The May Fourth Movement, as it allowed me to become a writer."
He went on to serve as lecturer in the Chinese section of the (then) School of Oriental Studies (now the School of Oriental and African Studies) at the University of London from 1924 to 1929. During his time in London, he absorbed a great deal of English literature (especially Dickens, whom he adored) and began his own writing. His later novel 二马 (Ma and Son) drew on these experiences.Witchard, Lao She in London
In the summer of 1929, he left Britain for Singapore, teaching at the Chinese High School. Between his return to China in the spring of 1930 until 1937, he taught at several universities, including Cheeloo University and Shandong University (Qingdao).
In March 1946, Lao She traveled to the United States on a two-year cultural grant sponsored by the State Department, lecturing and overseeing the translation of several of his novels, including The Yellow Storm (1951), which was never published in Chinese, and his last novel, The Drum Singers (1952; its Chinese version, Gu Shu Yi Ren, was not published until 1980).  He stayed in the US from 1946 until December 1949.

===Life in the People's Republic of China===

Like thousands of other intellectuals in China, he experienced mistreatment in the Cultural Revolution of the mid-1960s. Red Guards of the Cultural Revolution had attacked him as a counterrevolutionary. They paraded him through the streets and beat him in public, at the door steps of the Temple of Confucius in Beijing. Greatly humiliated both mentally and physically, he, according to the official record, committed suicide by drowning himself in Beijing's Taiping Lake in 1966.  Lao She did so in following the ancient tradition of Chinese intellectual's ultimate protesting  by sacrificing his own life.  Leo Ou-Fan Lee mentioned the possibility of murder, which is rather doubtful.[tpl]cite book|last=Lee|first=Leo Ou-Fan|editor=Merle Goldman & Leo Ou-Fan Lee|title=An Intellectual History of Modern China|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0KeE7dMNyl8C&pg=PA226|accessdate=10 March 2011|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=0-521-79710-1|page=226|contribution=Literary Trends: The Road to Revolution, 1927–1949[/tpl]  His relatives were accused of implication in his "crimes" but continued to rescue his manuscripts after his death, hiding them in coal piles and a chimney and moving them from house to house.
He was married to the famous painter Hu Jieqing and they had four children, one son and three daughters.

==Works==

===Rickshaw Boy===

His most important novel, Rickshaw Boy, also known in the West as "Camel Xiangzi"  or "Rickshaw"), was published in 1936. It describes the tragic life of a rickshaw puller in Beijing of the 1920s and is considered to be a classic of modern Chinese literature. The English version Rickshaw Boy became a US bestseller in 1945; it was an unauthorized translation that added a bowdlerized happy ending to the story. In 1982, the original version was made into a film of the same title.

===Teahouse===

Teahouse is a play in three acts, set in a teahouse called "Yu Tai" in Beijing from 1898 until the eve of the 1949 revolution.  First published in 1957, the play is a social and cultural commentary on the problems, culture, and changes within China during the early twentieth century.

===Other Works by Lao She===

Among Lao She's most famous stories is 'Crescent Moon' (月芽儿, Yuè Yár), written in the early stage of his creative life. It depicts the miserable life of a mother and daughter and their deterioration into prostitution. "I used to picture an ideal life, and it would be like a dream," the daughter thinks. "But then, as cruel reality again closed in on me, the dream would quickly pass, and I would feel worse than ever. This world is no dream - it's a living hell. " (from 'Crescent Moon')
His other important works include Si Shi Tong Tang (四世同堂, abridged translation The Yellow Storm, directly translated into "Four Generations under One Roof" 1944–1950), a novel describing the life of the Chinese people during the Japanese Occupation; Lao Zhang de Zhexue (老张的哲学, "The Philosophy of Old Zhang"), his first published novel, written in London (1926).
Cat Country (貓城記) is a  satirical fable, sometimes seen as the first important Chinese science fiction novel, published in 1932 as a thinly veiled observation on China.  Lao She wrote it from the perspective of a visitor to the planet Mars.  The visitor encountered an ancient civilisation populated by cat-people.  The civilisation had long past its glorious peak and had undergone prolonged stagnation.  The visitor observed the various responses of its citizens to the innovations by other cultures. Lao She wrote Cat Country in direct response to Japan's invasion of China (Manchuria in 1931, and Shanghai in 1932).
His last novel, The Drum Singers (1952), was first published in English in the United States.

==Legacy==

After the end of the Cultural Revolution, Lao She was posthumously "rehabilitated" in 1978 and his works were republished. Several of his stories have been made into films, including This Life of Mine (1950, dir. by Shi Hui), Dragon Beard Ditch (1952, dir. by Xian Qun), Rickshaw Boy (1982, dir. by Ling Zifeng), The Teahouse (1982, dir. by Xie Tian), The Crescent Moon (1986, dir. by Huo Zhuang), The Drum Singers (1987, dir. by Tian Zhuangzhuang), and The Divorce. Tian Zhuangzhuang's adaptation of The Drum Singers, also known as Street Players, was mostly shot on location in Sichuan. Some of Lao She's plays have also been staged in the recent with past, including Beneath the Red Banner in 2000 in Shanghai, and Dragon's Beard Ditch in 2009 in Beijing as part of the celebration of the writer's 110th birthday.
The Laoshe Tea House, a popular tourist attraction in Beijing that opened in 1988 and features regular performances of traditional music, is named after Lao She, but features primarily tourist-oriented attractions, and nothing related to Lao She. http://english.cri.cn/4026/2007/01/17/167@185996.htm
The Lao She Literary Award has been given every two to three years starting in the year 2000. It is sponsored by the Lao She Literature Fund and can only be bestowed on Beijing writers.
