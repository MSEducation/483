Naltriben is a potent and selective antagonist for the delta opioid receptor, which is used in scientific research. It has similar effects to the more widely used δ antagonist naltrindole, but with different binding affinity for the δ1 and δ2 subtypes, which makes it useful for distinguishing the subtype selectivity of drugs acting at the δ receptors.Sofuoglu M, Portoghese PS, Takemori AE.

Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics. 1991 May;257(2):676-80. PMID 1851833 It also acts as a κ-opioid agonist at high doses.Stewart PE, Holper EM, Hammond DL.
