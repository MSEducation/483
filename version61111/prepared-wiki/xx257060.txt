==Buildings==

In 1951, a new building was erected at 1658 Lurting Avenue (at the intersection of Van Nest Avenue), in the Morris Park section of the Bronx.[tpl]cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=New Church Dedicated In The Bronx Yesterday |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0915F83D551A7B93C1AB178CD85F458585F9 |quote=A new edifice for St. Francis Xavier's Roman Catholic Church, 1658 Lurting Avenue, the Bronx, was blessed and dedicated yesterday morning by Cardinal Spellman with more than a thousand persons attending. ...|newspaper=New York Times |date=July 23, 1951 |accessdate=2011-02-08 [/tpl] The church building was blessed and re-dedicated by Cardinal Spellman with more than 1000 people attending the ceremony. The architecture of the church is very monumental for its neighborhood, if a bit retrograde for its post-ward period of design. However, in contrast to several post-war Modernist brick box churches that the Archdiocese erected in this period, St. Francis Xavier's Church is designed in an early Gothic-style with pointed arched windows and entrances accentuating a stolid masonry mass of low gabled nave and hipped square tower in leafy and manicured lawned surroundings. The architecture is in the style of thirteenth-century Italian Gothic. The general red brick masonry of the walls is elegantly trimmed with white limestone, as is the corbelled tower cornice, which match the white masonry statues above the principal entrance gable and on the tower upper stage side elevations.
"The parish has several substantial buildings, including what appear to be two schools. A convent was refurbished for the Franciscan sisters sponsored by Fr. Benedict Groeschel."[tpl]cite web|url=http://bronxcatholic.blogspot.com/2009/03/st-francis-xavier-van-nest-ave-morris.html|title=St Francis Xavier, Van Nest Ave., Morris Park|date=March 15, 2009|accessdate=9 February 2011[/tpl] The address for the rectory is 1703 Lurting Avenue. The convent was likely originally built for the Sisters of Mercy. The eleven-bay two-storey-over-raised-basement brick school with Romanesque design accents was built 1937, and extended in 1955. The structure has a prominent broad hipped slate roof with an ornamental louvre surmounted by a copper-clad Latin cross. Despite varying dates, all the structures of the complex appear to have been built in harmonious styles with a brick color that very much matches the vernacular neighborhood architecture.

==St. Francis Xavier School==

The parish school is located at 1711 Haight Avenue and has students from New Beginnings to Eighth Grade. Following the parish's founding in 1928, Fr. Kearney founded the school in 1929, which was initially housed in the "portable" (temporary) auditorium building. The school first opened on September 15, 1930; the first principal was Miss Helen Kelly. Ground was broken for a permanent eight-classroom school building on April 11, 1937, which was then staffed by the Sisters of Mercy. An annex for that building was begun in 1955. The school has around 325 to 370 students.

==Music==

The organ at St. Francis Xavier Church was designed in 1951 by the Kilgen Organ Company, successor firm to Geo. Kilgen & Sons of St. Louis, Mo. Kilgen's Opus 7529 for St. Francis Xavier has 2 manuals, 18 stops, 16 ranks.See Trupiano, Larry.
