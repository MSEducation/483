==College of the Holy Cross==

After graduating from Central High School in Providence, Osmanski attended the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts.  He played fullback for the Crusaders from 1936 to 1938.  These three seasons were some of the most successful in Holy Cross' football history with the record of 23–3–3.  "Bullet Bill" was named an All-American in 1938.  He was named the Most Valuable Player at the College All-Star Game in 1939.  His jersey number, 25, was retired by Holy Cross.

==Chicago Bears==

Osmanski was drafted in the 1st round (6th pick overall) of the 1939 NFL Draft by the Chicago Bears.  The pick paid immediate dividends for the Bears as Osmanski led the NFL in rushing in 1939 with 699 yards.  The Bears also selected Hall of Fame quarterback Sid Luckman in the 1st round, forming the backbone of the Bears' great 1940s teams, which won championships in 1940, 1941, 1943, and 1946.  Osmanski did not play for the Bears in the 1944 and 1945 seasons due to World War II.  He served in the United States Marine Corps during these years, in Guam, Guadalcanal, and Okinawa.  Osmanski retired from professional football following the 1947 season.
