The Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue, otherwise known as the Henry Dunant Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue, or the HD Centre, is an independent non-governmental organization that assists in mediation between conflicting parties to prevent or end armed conflicts.
Founded in 1999, the aim of the organisation is to promote and facilitate dialogue among the leadership of the main belligerents.[ref]

It also conducts research and analysis on mediation and peacemaking in support of the operational projects to improve international efforts to secure and sustain peace. To do so, the HD Centre opens channels of communication and mediates between parties in conflict, as well as facilitates dialogue and provides support to the broader mediation and peacebuilding community.[ref]
</ref> The HD Centre will facilitate dialogue in both confidential settings as well as public ones.
It is headquartered in Geneva,[ref]
</ref> which is also the location of its Middle East and North Africa programme. The HD Centre has regional offices in Africa and Asia.

==History==

The initial intention of the HD Centre was to explore new concepts of humanitarian innovation by serving as a venue for dialogue on humanitarian issues - where discreet discussions could take place among those who could have a practical impact on humanitarian policy and practice.[ref]
</ref>
The organisation evolved this approach to include negotiations in support of humanitarian objectives[ref]
</ref> and aimed to create space for humanitarian activities in conflict environments. It quickly broadened, at the behest of conflicting parties in Aceh,<ref name="ReferenceA">The discreet charms of the international go-betweens</ref> to include the resolution of the conflict through mediation and conflict prevention.

===Leadership===

The Founding Executive Director of the HD Centre was Martin Griffiths.[ref]
