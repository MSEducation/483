Participation was inactive after the first few years but in August 2009, the College joined the competitions sponsored by the organization with its new name, Union of Filipino Tourism Educators (UFTE) and has remained active since then.  Membership and participation in these organizations have ensured that the CIHM's network and exposure in the industry is current.
