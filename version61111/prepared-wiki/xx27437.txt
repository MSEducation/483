Futbol Club Barcelona ([tpl]IPA-ca|fubˈbɔɫ ˈkɫub bərsəˈɫonə|-|Futbol Club Barcelona - name.ogg[/tpl]), also known as Barcelona and familiarly as Barça,Pronounced [tpl]IPA-ca|ˈbar.sə|[/tpl]. is a professional football club, based in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.
Founded in 29 November 1899 by a group of Swiss, English and Catalan footballers led by Joan Gamper, the club has become a symbol of Catalan culture and Catalanism, hence the motto "Més que un club" (More than a club).

It is the world's second-richest football club in terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of $613 million, and the third most valuable sports team on the globe, worth $2.6 billion.[tpl]cite web | title = Deloitte Football Money League 2013 | url = http://www.deloitte.com/view/en_GB/uk/industries/sportsbusinessgroup/sports/football/deloitte-football-money-league/7c19cb03a366c310VgnVCM1000003256f70aRCRD.htm | publisher = Deloitte UK | accessdate =30 January 2013[/tpl] The official Barcelona anthem is the "Cant del Barça", written by Jaume Picas and Josep Maria Espinàs.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.fcbarcelona.cat/web/english/club/historia/simbols/himne.html|title= FC Barcelona Hymn| publisher=FC Barcelona[/tpl]

Barcelona was one of the founding members of La Liga, and is one of three clubs which have never been relegated from the top division, along with Athletic Bilbao and Real Madrid. In 2009, Barcelona became the first Spanish club to win the continental treble consisting of La Liga, Copa del Rey, and the Champions League. That same year, it also became the first football club ever to win six out of six competitions in a single year, thus completing the sextuple, comprising the aforementioned treble and the Spanish Super Cup, UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup.[tpl]cite web|url=http://arxiu.fcbarcelona.cat/web/english/club/historia/records/rec_colectius.html|title=FC Barcelona Records|date=12 January 2012|work=FC Barcelona|accessdate=12 January 2012[/tpl] In 2011, the Blaugrana again became European champions and won a total of five titles, missing out only on the Copa del Rey (in which they finished runners-up). This team, which reached a record six consecutive Champions League semi-finals and won 14 trophies in four years under Guardiola's charge, is considered by a few managers, players and experts to one of the greatest team of all time.[tpl]cite news|title=Is this Barcelona team the best of all time?|url=http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com/2011/12/23/is-this-barcelona-team-the-best-of-all-time/ | work=CNN | date=23 December 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=The great European Cup teams: Barcelona 2009–2011|url=http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/may/24/great-european-cup-teams-barcelona[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Who's the Greatest of Them All?
