The Schweizer SGS 1-24, also referred to as the Schweizer-Burr SGS 1-24, is a United States single-seat, mid-wing, Open Class competition glider built by Howard Burr and Schweizer Aircraft of Elmira, New York.Said, Bob: 1983 Sailplane Directory, Soaring Magazine, page 30. Soaring Society of America, November 1983. USPS 499-920
The 1-24 is a development of the Schweizer SGS 1-23 that utilized a 1-23 fuselage and a newly constructed set of 55 foot (16.9 m) span, high aspect ratio wings.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.sailplanedirectory.com/PlaneDetails.cfm?planeID=305|title = SGS 1-24 Schweizer |accessdate = 2008-05-22|last = Activate Media|authorlink = |year = 2006[/tpl] 
The aircraft was constructed as a spare time project by Howie Burr and Ernest Schweizer to produce a competition sailplane. The aircraft first flew in 1953 and one example was completed.

==Design and development==

The early 1950s were the heyday of the SGS 1-23 design. From the time of its introduction in 1948 the production sailplane had dominated soaring contests in the USA.
Schweizer Aircraft employee Howie Burr conceived of creating an improved version of the 1-23 by using the existing fuselage and building a set of 17.10:1 aspect ratio wings for the aircraft. The [tpl]convert|55|ft|m|adj=on[/tpl] span wings gave the aircraft a 30:1 glide ratio and a low [tpl]convert|2.0|ft/s|m/s|adj=on[/tpl] minimum sink speed. Those performance figures are identical to the 1-23D
Burr finished the aircraft in his spare time, flying it first in early 1953. The 1-24 was ready for competition flying in time for the 1953 US Nationals, which were held at Harris Hill, New York.
The 1-24 design was never certified and the sole aircraft that was built is an experimental aircraft in the "racing, exhibition" class and registered as N91888.[tpl]cite web|url = http://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/NNum_Results.aspx?verified=1&NNumbertxt=N91888|title = FAA Registry|accessdate = 2008-05-22|last = Federal Aviation Administration|authorlink = |date=May 2008[/tpl]
The 1-24 is of all metal construction, including aluminum wings.
The design incorporated some innovative concepts in addition to the high aspect ratio wing. It had a shuttle weight that could be moved by cable through the length of the tail that allowed the glider to be trimmed anywhere between 50 mph (80 km/h) and 80 mph (129 km/h).

==Operational history==

The 1-24 was given the name Brigadoon by Howie Burr, after the popular musical stage play and film of the same name.
Burr entered the 1-24 in the 1953 US Nationals and the Snowbird meet held at Harris Hill over Thanksgiving, 1955. In the Snowbird meet, Burr flew the 1-24 to second place against a field of 25 sailplanes.Schweizer, Paul A: Wings Like Eagles, The Story of Soaring in the United States, page 150. Smithsonian Institution Press, 1988. ISBN 0-87474-828-3
The 1-24 was loaned to Paul A. Schweizer to compete in the 1957 US Nationals, which were held in Elmira, New York. Burr was unable to fly the 1-24 in that contest himself, as he was contest director. Paul Schweizer did not complete the competition as his father died during the contest and he withdrew.Schweizer, Paul A: Wings Like Eagles, The Story of Soaring in the United States, page 161. Smithsonian Institution Press, 1988. ISBN 0-87474-828-3
In 1969, the 1-24 was sold to Carl Waters and moved to California. Burr later re-purchased the aircraft from Waters and carried out a complete restoration of it, including the original name  "Brigadoon".

==Accidents==

The 1-24 was substantially damaged on 25 May 1996 at landing at the Mountain Valley Airport, Tehachapi, California when it collided with two other parked gliders.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.ntsb.gov/ntsb/brief2.asp?ev_id=20001208X05827&ntsbno=LAX96LA218&akey=1|title = LAX96LA218|accessdate = 2008-06-05|last = National Transportation Safety Board|authorlink = |date=May 1996[/tpl]

==Aircraft on display==

The 1-24 was initially loaned to the National Soaring Museum, Elmira, New York and later title was transferred to the museum.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.soaringmuseum.org/collection.html|title = Sailplanes in Our Collection|accessdate = 2008-04-15|last = Munson|first = J.|authorlink = |year = undated[/tpl]  It is currently on long-term loan at the Wings Over the Rockies Air and Space Museum. Denver, Colorado.
