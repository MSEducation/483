[[Bilingualism in Hong Kong]]

CATEGORIES: Languages of Hong Kong, English language, Cantonese language

Hong Kong is an officially bilingual territory. Under the Article 9 of the Hong Kong Basic Law and the Official Languages Ordinance, "English and Chinese" are, of equal status, the official languages of the territory.http://www.yearbook.gov.hk/2006/en/01_13.htm However, it is not specified which variety of "Chinese" is referred to. While Mandarin written in simplified Chinese characters is used as the standard language in mainland China, Cantonese in traditional Chinese characters is the de facto standard in Hong Kong.

==Chinese as an official language==

Cantonese, the language of Canton (now called Guangdong) and other parts of southern China became an official language of Hong Kong when the Chinese population of the colony grew (above). Hong Kong's population reached 6.99 million in 2006,"Hong Kong Statistics - Population and Vital Events", Census and Statistics Department. Retrieved 2007-02-02 of which approximately 95% are of Chinese descent, the majority of which was Cantonese, Hakka, and Teochew.

==English as an official language==

Hong Kong became a crown colony of the United Kingdom in 1840, and was established as a free port to serve as an entrep√¥t of the British Empire. The government officials and businessmen from Britain spoke English. The British administration in Hong Kong continued to use English as an official language, but added Chinese (Cantonese) as another official language in 1974. 
Following the 1997 transfer, English is still widely used in law and business, and it is still taught in kindergartens, primary schools, secondary schools, and universities.  The British have also left their language on place names within Hong Kong, particularly on Hong Kong Island, where British rule had the largest impact.

==Code-switching in Hong Kong==

Code-switching, or the practice of using more than one language in conversation, is very common in Hong Kong.  It usually involves a mix of Cantonese and English as a result of the bilingualism in Hong Kong.
