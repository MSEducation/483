==History==

Kansas State began offering women's basketball as an organized intercollegiate sport in the 1968–1969 school year, under head coach Judy Akers.  Because the NCAA did not sponsor women's sports until 1982, the governing bodies for women's basketball in the earliest years were the Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (CIAW) and the AIAW.
The Big Eight Conference likewise did not sponsor women's basketball in its earliest years, so Kansas State competed against the University of Kansas, Wichita State, and other state schools for the "Kansas State Conference" championship.  Kansas State won eight straight Kansas Conference titles, from 1972 to 1979.  The Big Eight Conference began offering a mid-season basketball tournament in the 1975–1976 season, and then began sponsoring a regular season competition in 1982–1983.  Kansas State won the first two Big Eight tournament titles, in 1976 and 1977, and then won the first two Big Eight regular season titles, in 1983 and 1984.[tpl]cite web | title = BigEightSports.com | url = http://bigeightsports.com/ | accessdate = August 13, 2013[/tpl][tpl]Cite news| title = Wildkittens Take Tournament | newspaper = Manhattan Mercury | date = February 15, 1976 | postscript = [/tpl]
The longest-tenured and winningest head coach in team history is Deb Patterson.  Patterson spent eighteen years at Kansas State and compiled a 350-226 ([tpl]Winning percentage|350|226|0[/tpl]) record.  She won two Big 12 Conference titles (2004 and 2008) and a WNIT title (2006).  Before Patterson, the winningest coach at Kansas State was Judy Akers, the first coach in program history, who compiled a 206-94 ([tpl]Winning percentage|206|94|0[/tpl]) record.  Akers also captured eight Kansas State Conference titles (1972–1979) and the first two titles in the Big Eight Conference after it began sponsoring women's basketball (1976 and 1977 mid-season tournaments).
