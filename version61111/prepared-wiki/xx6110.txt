Kiwi are flightless birds endemic to New Zealand, in the genus Apteryx and family Apterygidae. At around the size of a domestic chicken, kiwi are by far the smallest living ratites (which also consist of ostriches, emus, rheas, and cassowaries) and lay the largest egg in relation to their body size of any species of bird in the world.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sandiegozoo.org/animalbytes/t-kiwi.html|title=Birds: Kiwi|publisher=San Diego Zoo|accessdate=2008-09-19[/tpl] There are five recognised species, two of which are currently vulnerable, one of which is endangered, and one of which is critically endangered. All species have been negatively affected by historic deforestation but currently large areas of their forest habitat are well protected in reserves and national parks. At present, the greatest threat to their survival is predation by invasive mammalian predators.
The kiwi is a national symbol of New Zealand, and the association is so strong that the term Kiwi is used in some parts of the world as the colloquial demonym for New Zealanders.

==Etymology==

The Māori language word kiwi ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|k|iː|w|iː[/tpl] [tpl]respell|KEE|wee[/tpl])[tpl]Citation | url = http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Kiwi | title = Unabridged Dictionary | publisher = Random House | year = 2006 | contribution = Kiwi[/tpl]. is generally accepted to be "of imitative origin" from the call.[tpl]Citation | url = http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Kiwi | title = The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language | edition = 4th | year = 2006 | publisher = Houghton Mifflin | contribution = Kiwi[/tpl]. However, some linguists derive the word from Proto-Nuclear Polynesian *kiwi, which refers to Numenius tahitiensis, the Bristle-thighed Curlew, a migratory bird that winters in the tropical Pacific islands.[tpl]Citation | place = NZ | url = http://pollex.org.nz/entry/kiwi.1/ | title = Polynesian Lexicon Project Online | contribution = kiwi[/tpl].
With its long decurved bill and brown body, the curlew resembles the kiwi. So when the first Polynesian settlers arrived, they may have applied the word kiwi to the new-found bird. The genus name Apteryx is derived from Ancient Greek  "without wing": a-, "without" or "not"; pterux, "wing".[tpl]cite book |last1=Gotch |first1=AF |title= Latin Names Explained.

==Taxonomy and systematics==

It was long presumed that the kiwi was closely related to the other New Zealand ratites, the Moa. However, recent DNA studies indicate that the Ostrich is more closely related to the moa and the kiwi is more closely related to the Emu and the cassowaries. This theory suggests that the ancestors of the kiwi arrived in New Zealand from elsewhere in Australasia well after the moa. According to British scientists, the kiwi may be an ancient import from Australia. Researchers at Oxford University have found DNA evidence connected to Australia's Emu and the Ostrich of Africa. Upon examining DNA from the moa, they believe that the kiwi is more closely related to its Australian cousins.[tpl]Citation | url = http://www.abc.net.au/science/news/stories/s243830.htm | title = News in Science | publisher = ABC | place = AU[/tpl].
An extinct genus, Proapteryx, is known from the Miocene deposits of the Saint Bathans formation. Smaller and probably capable of flight, it appears to confirm the hypothesis that kiwis arrived to New Zealand independently from moas, and are more closely related to australian ratites than to the other clade of New Zealand raties, which were already large and flightless by the time this bird lived.Worthy et al. 2013

===Species===

There are five known species of kiwi, as well as a number of subspecies.
Analysis of mitochondrial DNA, ecology, behaviour, morphology, geographic distribution and parasites of the North Island Brown Kiwi has led scientists to propose that the Brown Kiwi is three distinct species. The North Island Brown Kiwi; the Okarito Brown Kiwi (Rowi), whose distribution is restricted to a single site on the West Coast of the South Island of New Zealand; and a third distinct population of the North Island Brown Kiwi, the Southern Tokoeka, distributed in the lowland forest to the north of Franz Josef glacier in the South Island and on Stewart Island, with a small population near Haast being another possibly distinct species, the Haast Tokoeka.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl]

==Description==

Their adaptation to a terrestrial life is extensive: like all the other ratites (Ostrich, Emu, Rhea and Cassowary) they have no keel on the sternum to anchor wing muscles. The vestigial wings are so small that they are invisible under the bristly, hair-like, two-branched feathers. While most adult birds have bones with hollow insides to minimise weight and make flight practicable, kiwi have marrow, like mammals and the young of other birds. With no constraints on weight due to flight requirements, Brown Kiwi females carry and lay a single egg which may weigh as much as [tpl]convert|450|g|oz|abbr=on[/tpl]. Like most other ratites, they have no uropygial gland (preen gland). Their bill is long, pliable and sensitive to touch, and their eyes have a reduced pecten. Their feathers lack barbules and aftershafts, and they have large vibrissae around the gape. They have 13 flight feathers, no tail and a small pygostyle. Finally, their gizzard is weak and their caecum is long and narrow.[tpl]cite encyclopedia |last=Davies |first=S.J.J.F.|editor=Hutchins, Michael |encyclopedia=Grzimek's Animal Life Encyclopedia |title=Kiwis |edition=2 |year=2003 |publisher=Gale Group |title=8 Birds I Tinamous and Ratites to Hoatzins |location=Farmington Hills, MI|isbn=0-7876-5784-0 |pages=89–90[/tpl]

==Behaviour and ecology==

Before the arrival of humans in the 13th century or earlier, New Zealand's only endemic mammals were three species of bat, and the ecological niches that in other parts of the world were filled by creatures as diverse as horses, wolves and mice were taken up by birds (and, to a lesser extent, reptiles).
Kiwi are shy and usually nocturnal. Their mostly nocturnal habits may be a result of habitat intrusion by predators, including humans. In areas of New Zealand where introduced predators have been removed, such as sanctuaries, kiwi are often seen in daylight. They prefer subtropical and temperate podocarp and beech forests, but they are being forced to adapt to different habitat, such as sub-alpine scrub, tussock grassland, and the mountains. Kiwi have a highly developed sense of smell, unusual in a bird, and are the only birds with nostrils at the end of their long beaks. Kiwi eat small invertebrates, seeds, grubs, and many varieties of worms. They also may eat fruit, small crayfish, eels and amphibians. Because their nostrils are located at the end of their long beaks, kiwi can locate insects and worms underground using their keen sense of smell, without actually seeing or feeling them.
Once bonded, a male and female kiwi tend to live their entire lives as a monogamous couple. During the mating season, June to March, the pair call to each other at night, and meet in the nesting burrow every three days. These relationships may last for up to 20 years.[tpl]Citation | url = http://SavetheKiwi.org.nz/ | title = Save the Kiwi | place = NZ[/tpl], formerly Kiwi Recovery. They are unusual among other birds in that along with some raptors, they have a functioning pair of ovaries. (In most birds and in platypuses, the right ovary never matures, so that only the left is functional.Fitzpatrick, F.L., (1934).  Unilateral and bilateral ovaries in raptorial birds.  The Wilson Bulletin, 46(1): 19-22Kinsky, F.C., (1971).  The consistent presence of paired ovaries in the Kiwi (Apteryx) with some discussion of this condition in other birds. Journal of Ornithology 112(3): 334–357.) Kiwi eggs can weigh up to one-quarter the weight of the female. Usually only one egg is laid per season. The kiwi lays the biggest egg in proportion to its size of any bird in the world,[tpl]Citation | publisher = Auckland Zoo | title = Official Guide Book | chapter = Wilderness New Zealand[/tpl]. so even though the kiwi is about the size of a domestic chicken, it is able to lay eggs that are about six times the size of a chicken's egg.[tpl]Citation | url = http://Savethekiwi.org/ | title = Save the kiwi[/tpl]. The eggs are smooth in texture, and are ivory or greenish white.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.chemistry.co.nz/kiwibird.htm | title = The Kiwi Bird, New Zealand's Indigenous Flightless Bird| accessdate= 2009-01-16[/tpl] The male incubates the egg, except for the Great Spotted Kiwi, A. haastii, in which both parents are involved. The incubation period is 63–92 days. Producing the huge egg places a lot of demands on the female. For the thirty days it takes to grow the fully developed egg the female must eat three times her normal amount of food. Two to three days before the egg is laid there is little space left inside the female for her stomach and she is forced to fast.[tpl]Citation | last = Piper | first = Ross | year = 2007 | title = Extraordinary Animals: An Encyclopedia of Curious and Unusual Animals | publisher = Greenwood Press[/tpl].

==Status and conservation==

Nationwide studies show that on average only five percent of kiwi chicks survive to adulthood. However, in areas under active pest management, survival rates for North Island brown kiwi can be far higher. For example, prior to a joint 1080 poison operation undertaken by DOC and the Animal Health Board in Tongariro Forest in 2006, 32 kiwi chicks were radio-tagged. 57% of the radio-tagged chicks survived to adulthood. Thanks to ongoing pest control, the adult kiwi population at Tongariro has almost doubled since 1998.

===Sanctuaries===

In 2000, the Department of Conservation set up five kiwi sanctuaries focused on developing methods to protect kiwi and to increase their numbers.
A number of other mainland conservation islands and fenced sanctuaries have significant populations of kiwi, including:

===Operation "Nest Egg"===

Operation Nest Egg is a programme run by the BNZ Save the Kiwi Trust – a partnership between the Bank of New Zealand, the Department of Conservation and the Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society. Kiwi eggs and chicks are removed from the wild and hatched and/or raised in captivity until big enough to fend for themselves – usually when they weigh around 1200 grams (42 ounces). They are then returned to the wild. An Operation Nest Egg bird has a 65% chance of surviving to adulthood – compared to just 5% for wild-hatched and raised chicks.[tpl]Citation | url = http://www.savethekiwi.org.nz/bnz-save-the-kiwi/operation-nest-egg/operation-nest-egg.html | title = Operation Nest Egg | publisher = Save the wiki | place = NZ[/tpl]. The tool is used on all kiwi species except Little Spotted Kiwi.

===1080 poison===

In 2004, anti-1080 activist Phillip Anderton posed for the New Zealand media with a kiwi he claimed had been poisoned. An investigation revealed that Anderton lied to journalists and the public.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/rosaleen-macbrayne/news/article.cfm?a_id=132&objectid=3588802 |title=Poison campaigner fined after using kiwi in stunt | last = Macbrayne | first = Rosaleen |date= 3 September 2004 |work= The New Zealand Herald |accessdate= 13 October 2011[/tpl] He had used a kiwi that had been caught in a possum trap. Extensive monitoring shows kiwi are not at risk from the use of biodegradable 1080 poison.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.feral.org.au/survival-of-brown-kiwi-exposed-to-1080-poison-used-for-control-of-brushtail-possums-in-northland-new-zealand-2 | title = Survival of brown kiwi exposed to 1080 poison used for control of brushtail possums in Northland, New Zealand | last1 = Robertson | first1 = HA et al | year = 1999[/tpl].

===Threats===

Introduced mammalian predators, namely stoats, dogs, ferrets, and cats, are the number one threat to kiwi. Other threats include habitat modification/loss and motor vehicle strike. The restricted distribution and small size of some kiwi populations increases their vulnerability to inbreeding.
Stoats are responsible for approximately half of kiwi chick deaths in many areas through New Zealand. Cats also to a lesser extent prey on kiwi chicks. Research has shown that the combined effect of predators and other mortality (accidents etc.) results in less than 5% of kiwi chicks surviving to adulthood.[tpl]Citation| title= Role of predation in the decline of kiwi, Apteryx spp., in New Zealand| author = JA McLennan et al| year = 1996| url=http://www.newzealandecology.org.nz/nzje/free_issues/NZJEcol20_1_27.pdf[/tpl] Young kiwi chicks are vulnerable to stoat predation until they reach about 1–1.2 kg in weight, at which time they can usually defend themselves.
Ferrets and dogs often kill adult kiwi. These predators can cause large and abrupt declines in populations. In particular, dogs find the strong distinctive scent of kiwi irresistible and easy to track, such that they can catch and kill kiwi in seconds. Motor vehicle strike is a threat to all kiwi where roads cross through their habitat. Badly set possum traps also kill or maim a large number of kiwi each year.[tpl]Citation | url = http://www.royalsociety.org.nz/1995/08/02/kiwis-killed-by-traps-not-1080-conservation-officer-says/ | title = Kiwis killed by traps, not 1080, conservation officer says | publisher = Royal society | place = NZ | date = 2 August 1995[/tpl].

==Relationship to humans==

The Māori traditionally believed that kiwi were under the protection of Tane Mahuta, god of the forest. They were used as food and their feathers were used for kahu kiwi – ceremonial cloaks.[tpl]Citation | url = http://www.teara.govt.nz/TheBush/NativeBirdsAndBats/Kiwi/4/en | contribution = Kiwi and people: early history | title = Te Ara | publisher = The Government | place = NZ[/tpl]. Today, while kiwi feathers are still used, they are gathered from birds that die naturally or through road accidents or predation, or from captive birds.[tpl]Citation | url = http://www.nzembassy.com/usa/news/new-zealand-embassy-and-smithsonian-national-zoo-host-handover-ceremony-to-return-kiwi-feat | title = New Zealand Embassy and Smithsonian National Zoo host handover ceremony to return kiwi feathers to New Zealand | publisher = New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade[/tpl]. Kiwi are no longer hunted and some Maori consider themselves the birds' guardians.[tpl]Citation | url = http://www.savethekiwi.org.nz/about-the-bird/kiwi-a-maori/kiwi-a-maori.html | contribution = Kiwi a Maori | title = About the bird | publisher = Save the kiwi[/tpl].

===Scientific documentation===

The first kiwi specimen to be studied by Europeans was a kiwi skin brought to George Shaw by Captain Andrew Barclay aboard the ship Providence, who was reported to have been given it by a sealer in Port Jackson (Sydney Harbour) around 1811. George Shaw gave the bird its scientific name and drew sketches of the way he imagined a live bird to look which appeared as plates 1057 and 1058 in volume 24 of The Naturalist's Miscellany in 1813.

===Zoos===

In 1851, London Zoo became the first zoo to keep kiwi. The first captive breeding took place in 1945.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.doc.govt.nz/upload/documents/science-and-technical/tsop24.pdf| title= Captive management plan for kiwi| date= June 2004| page= 10 | format = PDF | publisher = New Zealand Department of Conservation| accessdate = 17 August 2009[/tpl] As of 2007 only 13 zoos outside New Zealand hold kiwi.[tpl]Citation | title = Zoo and Wild Animal Medicine Current Therapy | first1 = Murray E | last1 = Fowler | first2 = R Eric | last2 = Miller | publisher = Elsevier Health Sciences | year = 2007 | page = 215[/tpl]. The Frankfurt Zoo has 12, the Berlin Zoo has seven, Walsrode Bird Park has one, the Washington Zoo has three, the Avifauna Bird Park in the Netherlands has three, the San Diego Zoo has five, the San Diego Zoo Safari Park has one, the National Zoo in Washington, DC has five, the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute has one, and the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium has three.[tpl]cite news |title=Shy envoys off on their OE | first=Eloise |last=Gibson |newspaper=New Zealand Herald |date=29 April 2010 |page=a4 [/tpl]

===As a national symbol===

The kiwi as a symbol first appeared in the late 19th century in New Zealand regimental badges. It was later featured in the badges of the South Canterbury Battalion in 1886 and the Hastings Rifle Volunteers in 1887. Soon after, the kiwi appeared in many military badges, and in 1906 when Kiwi Shoe Polish was widely sold in the UK and the US the symbol became more widely known.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl]
During the First World War, the name "kiwi" for New Zealand soldiers came into general use, and a giant kiwi (now known as the Bulford Kiwi), was carved on the chalk hill above Sling Camp in England. Use has now spread so that now all New Zealanders overseas and at home are commonly referred to as "kiwis".[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl]
The kiwi has since become the most well-known national symbol for New Zealand, and the bird is prominent in the coat of arms, crests and badges of many New Zealand cities, clubs and organisations; at the national level, the red silhouette of a kiwi is in the center of the roundel of the Royal New Zealand Air Force.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nzs.com/about-new-zealand/the-kiwi/| work = About New Zealand | title = The Kiwi | publisher = NZ Search|accessdate=2009-01-16[/tpl] The kiwi is featured in the logo of the New Zealand Rugby League, and the New Zealand national rugby league team are nicknamed the Kiwis.
The reverse of a New Zealand dollar coin contains an image of a kiwi and in currency trading the New Zealand dollar is often referred to as "the kiwi".[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nbr.co.nz/article/nz-dollar-falls-after-rbnzs-wheeler-talks-down-intervention-quantitative-easing-bd-131312 |title=Kiwi falls after Wheeler talks down intervention, QE |date=27 October 2012 |work=The National Business Review |location=NZ |accessdate=27 October 2012[/tpl]
