Cybill is an American television sitcom created by Chuck Lorre, which aired on CBS from January 2, 1995, to July 13, 1998. Starring Cybill Shepherd, the show revolves around the life of Cybill Sheridan, a twice-divorced single mother of two and struggling actress in her 40s, who has never gotten her big show business break. Alicia Witt and Dedee Pfeiffer co-starred as Sheridan's daughters, with Alan Rosenberg and Tom Wopat playing their respective fathers, while Christine Baranski appeared as Cybill's hard-drinking friend Maryann.
The sitcom was produced by Carsey-Werner Productions and YBYL Productions, with Shepherd, Lorre, Howard Gould, Jay Daniel, Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner serving as the show's original executive producers. Broadcast to critical praise, Cybill was nominated for twelve Emmy Awards throughout its run and awarded the 1996 Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy. Shepherd won a third Golden Globe Award for her performance, while Baranski received an Emmy, a SAG and an American Comedy Award.

==Premise==

Cybill takes place in Los Angeles, California, and focuses on the character of a somewhat faded actress, Cybill Sheridan (played by Cybill Shepherd), who, because of her age, had been relegated to playing character roles, bit parts and TV commercials. Also featured are her daughters, headstrong Zoey (Alicia Witt) and uptight Rachel (Dedee Pfeiffer), her two ex-husbands, Ira (Alan Rosenberg) and Jeff (Tom Wopat), and her hard-drinking best friend Maryann (Christine Baranski).  Due to the show's premise, many episodes featured a show-within-a-show format, showing Cybill Sheridan playing a variety of other characters in her various film and TV acting roles.
In her autobiography, Cybill Disobedience, Shepherd stated that the Cybill character was based on herself—or at least what her life as an actress could have been without the successes of The Last Picture Show and Moonlighting. Many of the show's details and situations were mined from her own family, marriages and experiences.Cybill Disobedience

===Ratings===

The series got respectable ratings throughout its run, but was abruptly canceled by CBS at the end of the 1997-98 season, amid allegations by Shepherd that the network was uncomfortable with Cybill's feminist leanings and frank depiction of female sexuality.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.aarpmagazine.org/entertainment/Articles/a2004-05-19-mag-cybill.html|title=Cybill Liberties|last=Griffin|first=Nancy |date=July–August 2004|publisher=AARP Magazine[/tpl]
