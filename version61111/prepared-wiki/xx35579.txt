Stirling Range National Park  is a national park in the Great Southern region of Western Australia, approximately 337 km south-east of Perth.

==Description==

It protects the Stirling Ranges, or Koikyennuruff, a range of mountains and hills over 60 km wide from west to east, stretching from the highway between Mount Barker and Cranbrook eastward past Gnowangerup. Notable features include Toolbrunup, Bluff Knoll - the tallest peak in the southwestern region, and a silhouette called The Sleeping Princess which is visible from the Porongurup Range.  Popular recreational activities in the park include bushwalking, abseiling and gliding.  Camping is not permitted within the park boundaries.

==Environment==

The park has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports populations of endangered Short-billed Black Cockatoos and Western Whipbirds, and is visited by endangered Long-billed Black-Cockatoos.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.birdata.com.au/iba.vm |title=IBA: Stirling Range |accessdate=24 October 2011 |work= Birdata |first= |last= |publisher=Birds Australia |date= [/tpl]
