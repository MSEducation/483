The publication of a manuscript of the Samaritan Pentateuch in 17th-century Europe reawakened interest in the text and fueled a controversy between Protestants and Roman Catholics over which Old Testament textual traditions are authoritative.  Roman Catholics showed a particular interest in the study of the Samaritan Pentateuch on account of the antiquity of the text and its frequent agreements with the Septuagint and the Latin Vulgate, two Bible translations to which Catholics have traditionally ascribed considerable authority.  Some Catholics including Jean Morin, a Jesuit-convert from Calvinism to Catholicism, argued that the Samaritan Pentateuch's correspondences with the Latin Vulgate and Septuagint indicated that it represents a more authentic Hebrew text than the Masoretic.Montgomery 1907, p. 288.  Several Protestants replied with a defense of the Masoretic text's authority and argued that the Samaritan text is a late and unreliable derivation from the Masoretic.Thomson 1919, pp. 275–276.
The 18th century Protestant Hebrew scholar Benjamin Kennicott's analysis of the Samaritan Pentateuch stands as a notable exception to the general trend of early Protestant research on the text.[tpl]cite book |last=Saebo |first=Magne |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=OMlT-FViF40C&pg=PA796 |title=Hebrew Bible / Old Testament: The History of Its Interpretation |publisher=Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht |year=2008 |ISBN=9783525539828[/tpl]  He questioned the underlying assumption that the Masoretic text must be more authentic simply because it has been more widely accepted as the authoritative Hebrew version of the Pentateuch:
Kennicott also statesKennicott 1759, p. 20. that the reading Gerizim may actually be the original reading, since that is the mountain for proclaiming blessings, and that it is very green and rich of vegetation (as opposed to Mt. Ebal, which is barren and the mountain for proclaiming curses) amongst other arguments.
German scholar Wilhelm Gesenius published a study[tpl]cite book|last = Gesenius|first = Wilhelm |title = De Pentateuchi Samaritani origine, indole et auctoritate commentatio philologico-critica |publisher = Halae |url = http://archive.org/details/depentateuchisa00gesegoog |year = 1815[/tpl] of the Samaritan Pentateuch in 1815 which biblical scholars widely embraced for the next century.  He argued that the Septuagint and the Samaritan Pentateuch share a common source in a family of Hebrew manuscripts which he named the "Alexandrino-Samaritanus".  In contrast to the proto-Masoretic "Judean" manuscripts carefully preserved and copied in Jerusalem, he regarded the Alexandrino-Samaritanus as having been carelessly handled by scribal copyists who popularized, simplified, and expanded the text.Vanderkam 2002, pp. 92–93.  Gesenius concluded that the Masoretic text is almost invariably superior to the Samaritan.Gesenius believed that the Samaritan Pentateuch contained only four valid variants as compared to the Masoretic text. (Montgomery 1907, p. 288.)
In 1915 Paul Kahle published a paperKahle, Paul. Theologische Studien und Kritiken 88 (1915): 399–429. which compared passages from the Samaritan text to Pentateuchal quotations in the New Testament and pseudepigraphal texts including the Book of Jubilees, the First Book of Enoch and the Assumption of Moses.  He concluded that the Samaritan Pentateuch preserves "many genuine old readings and an ancient form of the Pentateuch."  Support for Kahle's thesis was bolstered by the discovery of biblical manuscripts among the Dead Sea Scrolls, approximately five percent of which contain a text similar to the Samaritan Pentateuch.Some examples include the Dead Sea Scroll manuscripts conventionally designated as 4QpaleoExodm, 4QExod-Levf and 4QNumb.  See Vanderkam 2002, p. 95. Apart from the sectarian variants unique to the Samaritan Pentateuch such as the reference to the worship of God on Mount Gerizim, the Dead Sea Scroll texts have demonstrated that a Pentateuchal text type resembling the Samaritan Pentateuch goes back to the second century BCE and perhaps even earlier.Tov 2001, p. 80.Vanderkam 2002, p. 95.  Other Dead Sea Scroll Pentateuchal manuscripts show a close affinity to the later Masoretic text.  These discoveries have demonstrated that manuscripts bearing a "pre-Samaritan" text of at least some portions of the Pentateuch such as ExodusVanderkam 2002, p. 106. and NumbersVanderkam 2002, p. 110. circulated alongside other manuscripts with a "pre-Masoretic" text.  One Dead Sea Scroll copy of the Book of Exodus, conventionally named 4QpaleoExodm, shows a particularly close relation to the Samaritan Pentateuch:
Frank Moore Cross has described the origin of the Samaritan Pentateuch within the context of his local texts hypothesis.  He views the Samaritan Pentateuch as having emerged from a manuscript tradition local to Palestine.  The Hebrew texts that form the underlying basis for the Septuagint branched from the Palestinian tradition as Jews emigrated to Egypt and took copies of the Pentateuch with them.   Cross states that the Samaritan and the Septuagint share a nearer common ancestor than either does with the Masoretic, which he suggested developed from local texts used by the Babylonian Jewish community.  His explanation accounts for the Samaritan and the Septuagint sharing variants not found in the Masoretic and their differences reflecting the period of their independent development as distinct Egyptian and Palestinian local text traditions.  On the basis of archaizing and pseudo-archaic forms, Cross dates the emergence of the Samaritan Pentateuch as a uniquely Samaritan textual tradition to the post-Maccabaean age.Frank Moore Cross Harvard Theological Review July 1966 "The language of the Samaritan Pentateuch also includes archaizing forms and pseudo-archaic forms which surely point to the post-Maccabaean age for its date"
Scholars have tended to presuppose that the Samaritan Pentateuch consists of two "layers", one composed of the sectarian variants introduced by Samaritan scribes and a second layer reflecting the text's earlier transmission history as a "pre-Samaritan" Palestinian local text.  In light of recent research "it is now clear that the Samaritan layer is very thin."Crown 2001, p. 401.  Although the majority of scholars continue to favor the Masoretic as a superior text, many other scholars have now adopted Kahle's thesis.  Scholars now widely agree though that many textual variants previously classified as "Samaritan" actually derive from even earlier phases of the Pentateuch's textual history.
Kennicott's claim that Gerizim is the original reading continues to be a subject of discussion.  Dead Sea Scroll fragment 4Q41(981) contains a text of [tpl]bibleverse||Deuteronomy|5:1–25|HE[/tpl] which makes no reference to Mount Gerizim, but matches the Masoretic Text.  The New Testament also agrees with the Masoretic version designating Jerusalem as the "chosen place".John 4:21, 22, Luke 9:53  However, some scholars hold that [tpl]bibleverse||Deuteronomy|27:4–7|HE[/tpl] constitutes one occasion where the Samaritan's "Gerizim" may be the original reading."[tpl]cite book|last = Soggin| first = J.

===Translations===

The Samaritan Targum, composed in the Samaritan dialect of Aramaic, is the earliest translation of the Samaritan Pentateuch.  Its creation was motivated by the same need to translate the Pentateuch into the Aramaic language spoken by the community which led to the creation of Jewish Targums such as Targum Onkelos.  Samaritans have traditionally ascribed the Targum to Nathanael, a Samaritan priest who died circa 20 BCE.[tpl]Catholic|prescript=|wstitle=Samaritan Language and Literature[/tpl]  The Samaritan Targum has a complex textual tradition represented by manuscripts belonging to one of three fundamental text types exhibiting substantial divergences from one another.  Affinities that the oldest of these textual traditions share with the Dead Sea Scrolls and Onkelos suggest that the Targum may originate from the same school which finalized the Samaritan Pentateuch itself.Crown 2001, p. 18.  Others have placed the origin of the Targum around the beginning of the third century or even later.Buttrick 1952, p. 57.  Extant manuscripts of the Targum are "extremely difficult to use" on account of scribal errors caused by a faulty understanding of Hebrew on the part of the Targum's translators and a faulty understanding of Aramaic on the part of later copyists.
Scholia of Origen's Hexapla and the writings of some church fathers contain references to "the Samariticon" (Greek: το Σαμαρειτικον)., a work that is no longer extant.  Despite earlier suggestions that it was merely a series of Greek scholia translated from the Samaritan Pentateuch, scholars now concur that it was a complete Greek translation of the Samaritan Pentateuch either directly translated from it or via the Samaritan Targum.[tpl]cite book|last = Marcos| first = Natalio| title = The Septuagint in Context: Introduction to the Greek Version of the Bible |publisher = Brill |url = http://books.google.com/books?id=8MbvEZ4bgdwC&pg=PA168 | year = 2000 |page = 168 |ISBN = 9789004115743[/tpl]  It may have been composed for the use of a Greek-speaking Samaritan community residing in Egypt.
With the displacement of Samaritan Aramaic by Arabic as the language of the Samaritan community in the centuries following the Muslim conquest of Syria, they employed several Arabic translations of the Pentateuch.  The oldest was an adaptation of Saadia Gaon's Arabic translation of the Jewish Torah.  Although the text was modified to suit the Samaritan community, it still retained many unaltered Jewish readings.Crown 2001, p. 23.  By the 11th or 12th centuries, a new Arabic translation directly based upon the Samaritan Pentateuch had appeared in Nablus.  Manuscripts containing this translation are notable for their bilingual or trilingual character; the Arabic text is accompanied by the original Samaritan Hebrew in a parallel column and sometimes the Aramaic text of the Samaritan Targum in a third.Crown 2001, p. 24.  Later Arabic translations also appeared; one featured a further Samaritan revision of Saadia Gaon's translation to bring it into greater conformity with the Samaritan Pentateuch and others were based upon Arabic Pentateuchal translations used by Christians.Crown 2001, pp. 24–25.
In April 2013, a complete English translation of the Samaritan Pentateuch comparing it to the Masoretic version was published.[tpl]cite book|last = Tsedaka| first = Benyamim| coauthors = Sharon Sullivan| title = The Israelite Samaritan Version of the Torah: First English Translation Compared with the Masoretic Version| location = Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA |publisher = Wm.

===Exegetical and liturgical texts===

Several biblical commentaries and other theological texts based upon the Samaritan Pentateuch have been composed by members of the Samaritan community from the fourth century CE onwards.Montgomery 1907, pp. 293–297.  Samaritans also employ liturgical texts containing catenae extracted from their Pentateuch.Montgomery 1907, pp. 297–298.

==Manuscripts and printed editions==

===Manuscripts===

Samaritans attach special importance to the Abisha Scroll used in the Samaritan synagogue of Nablus.   It consists of a continuous length of parchment sewn together from the skins of rams that, according to a Samaritan tradition, were ritually sacrificed.Barton 1903, p. 9.  The text is written in gold letters.  Rollers tipped with ornamental knobs are attached to both ends of the parchment and the whole is kept in a cylindrical silver case when not in use.Barton 1903, pp. 9–10.  Samaritans claim it was penned by Abishua, great-grandson of Aaron ([tpl]bibleverse|1|Chronicles|6:50|HE[/tpl]), thirteen years after the entry into the land of Israel under the leadership of Joshua, son of Nun,The Abisha scroll makes this claim for itself in a note inserted between columns of text at Deuteronomy 5. (Montgomery 1907, p. 287) although contemporary scholars describe it as a composite of several fragmentary scrolls each penned between the 12th and 14th centuries CE.Eshel 2003, p. 215.  Other manuscripts of the Samaritan Pentateuch consist of vellum or cotton paper written upon with black ink.  Numerous manuscripts of the text exist, but none written in the original Hebrew or in translation predates the Middle Ages.

===Printed editions===

Wider interest in the Samaritan Pentateuch was awakened in 1616 when the traveler Pietro della Valle purchased a copy of the text in Damascus.  This manuscript, now known as Codex B, was deposited in a Parisian library.  In 1645, an edited copy of Codex B was published in Le Jay's (Paris) Polyglot by Jean Morin.  It was republished in Walton's Polyglot in 1657.  Subsequently, Archbishop Ussher and others procured additional copies which were brought to Europe and later, America.[tpl]cite book|last = Cowper| first = B. Harris| title = Journal of Sacred Literature and Biblical Record| publisher = Williams and Norgate| year = 1863| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=kR82AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA131 |page = 131[/tpl]
Until the latter half of the 20th century, critical editions of the Samaritan Pentateuch were largely based upon Codex B.  The most notable of these is Der Hebräische Pentateuch der Samaritaner (The Hebrew Pentateuch of the Samaritans) compiled by August von Gall and published in 1918.  An extensive critical apparatus is included listing variant readings found in previously published manuscripts of the Samaritan Pentateuch.  His work is still regarded as being generally accurate despite the presence of some errors, but it neglects important manuscripts including the Abisha Scroll which had not yet been published at the time.Brotzman notes that Gall's edition "because of the principles used to prepare it, must be used with caution." (Brotzman 1994, p. 66.)  Textual variants found in the Abisha scroll were published in 1959 by Federico Pérez CastroBrotzman 1994, p. 66.  and between 1961 and 1965 by A. and R. Sadaqa in Jewish and Samaritan Versions of the Pentateuch – With Particular Stress on the Differences Between Both Texts.  In 1976 L.F. Giron-Blanc published a Samaritan Pentateuch codex dating to 1100 CE in a critical edition supplemented with variants found in fifteen previously unpublished manuscripts.  Certain recently published critical editions of Pentateuchal books take Samaritan variants into account, including D.L. Phillips' edition of Exodus.Phillips, D.L. Hebrew-English: Paleo Exodus: Scripture at the End of the Iron II Period. Edwin Mellen, 2004. 
Several publications containing the text of the Samaritan Targum have appeared.  In 1875 the German scholar Adolf Brüll published his Das samaritanische Targum zum Pentateuch (The Samaritan Targum to the Pentateuch).  More recently a two volume set edited by Abraham Tal appeared featuring the first critical edition based upon all extant manuscripts containing the Targumic text.[tpl]cite book|last = Tal| first = Abraham F. |title = The Samaritan Targum of the Pentateuch: a critical edition (2 vols.)(Texts and Studies in the Hebrew Language and Related Subjects, 5.) |location = Tel-Aviv |publisher = Tel-Aviv University| year = 1981[/tpl]
