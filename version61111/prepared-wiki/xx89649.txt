==Development==

American Eagle's beginning was with the Silverman family, which owned and operated Silvermans Menswear. By the mid-1970s two of the Silverman brothers—from the third generation of Silvermans in the family business—were running the family business. Jerry Silverman, was the president and CEO, while his brother Mark Silverman, served as executive vice-president and COO. The Silverman brothers were convinced they needed to diversify their product offerings in order to continue growing their company. They also recognized that the addition of new family owned chains would then enable them to operate more than one store in the same mall. Their first attempt was to open American Eagle Outfitters in 1977, positioning it as a proprietor of brand-name leisure apparel, footwear, as well as accessories for men and women, emphasizing merchandise suited for outdoor sports, such as hiking, mountain climbing, and camping.[tpl]cite web|title=American Eagle Company History|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/american-eagle-outfitters-inc-history/[/tpl]  Stores were set up in shopping malls and a catalog was established. The chain grew for much of the 1980s. In 1989, the owners decided to refocus their business on American Eagle Outfitters, selling their other retail chains. At that time, there were 137 American Eagle Outfitters stores including 37 in the United States.
Despite the plans for quick growth after the reorganization, American Eagle Outfitters opened only 16 new stores by 1991 and the company was losing money. At this point, the Schottensteins, who had been 50% owners of the chain since 1980, bought out the founding Silverman family's interest. This change in leadership resulted in American Eagle finding its present niche: casual clothing for men and women selling private label clothes. AE opened the first Canadian store in 2001.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]
When the company began trading on the NASDAQ stock exchange in the second quarter of 1994, it had 167 stores and a healthy cash flow. With the cash infusion from the IPO, the company opened more than 90 new stores within the next year. Several new executives joined the company in 1995 and '96, leading to another change in the target demographic. The company now wanted to reach more women and focus on people between the ages of 18 and 32.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2009[/tpl] The strategy worked,[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2009[/tpl] and over the next five years, revenues quintupled to $1 billion by 2000.  As of January 28, 2012, American Eagle operated 911 American Eagle Outfitters stores, 158 aerie stand-alone stores and 21 77kids stores. The company also had 21 franchised stores operated by franchise partners in 10 countries.  On January 22, 2014, then-CEO Robert Hanson stepped down[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.wwd.com/retail-news/specialty-stores/robert-hanson-exits-american-eagle-7388363?src=n/newsAlert/20140122-4 | title=Robert Hanson Exits American Eagle | publisher=WWD | date=22 January 2014 | accessdate=22 January 2014 | author=Karr, Arnold J.[/tpl] and Jay Schottenstein became interim CEO.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/american-eagle-outfitters-names-jay-schottenstein-interim-ceo-2014-01-22?reflink=MW_news_stmp | title=American Eagle Outfitters Names Jay Schottenstein Interim CEO | publisher=Market Watch by the Wall Street Journal (reprinting BUSINESS WIRE) | date=22 January 2014 | accessdate=22 January 2014 | author=Zaccagnini, Kristen[/tpl]

==Controversies==

===Strike===

In 2004, textile and apparel workers union UNITE HERE launched the "American Vulture" back-to-school boycott of American Eagle[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.americanvulture.org |title=www.americanvulture.org |publisher=www.americanvulture.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-25[/tpl] in protest of alleged workers' rights violations at the company's Canadian distribution contractor National Logistics Services (NLS). On the 2007 second-quarter conference call,American Eagle Outfitters F2Q07 (Qtr End 8/4/07) Earnings Call Transcript - Seeking Alpha CEO James O'Donnell clarified the American Eagle's relationship with NLS and its effect on business. He explained,  [tpl]cquote|We owned NLS with the acquisition of Braemar back in 2000, and we subsequently sold off NLS in 2006, and we are currently a customer of NLS... We have really no involvement at all with Unite Here and NLS. Our only involvement with NLS is basically as a customer, and there have been some allegations made, I think, to some of, to the public about it affecting our business. I can tell you right now it has not affected our business.[/tpl]

===Abercrombie & Fitch lawsuits===

Since 1999, Abercrombie & Fitch has sued American Eagle Outfitters at least three times for allegedly copying its designs and its advertisements. On all occasions, American Eagle prevailed in court under the statement that A&F cannot stop American Eagle from presenting similar designs, since such designs cannot be copyrighted in the United States. Nevertheless, American Eagle clothing designs have since trended away in appearance from Abercrombie & Fitch designs. The merchandise offered by American Eagle is considered to be "retro/vintage" cost-efficient clothing, whereas Abercrombie & Fitch merchandise has become an internationally known "near-luxury" line of clothing with "preppy", high-grade, and high-priced fashions, on the same level with that of companies such as the Polo Ralph Lauren company.[ref]
</ref>  Judges have generally ruled that giving Abercrombie exclusive rights to market its clothing in a certain way ''"would be anti-competitive."''<ref>
