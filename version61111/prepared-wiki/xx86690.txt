Ross has also had a number of television series guest appearances, on shows such as The Cosby Show, Roc, Baywatch Nights, and Providence. Ross also appeared on the popular dating show Blind Date. Much like many dates on the show however, Ross' dating experience was unsuccessful as she did not appear to show interest in her date (unlike her date who was very interested in her).
Ross has a son, Bryce, born in 1988. He was a contestant on The Glee Project during the summer of 2011.
On several occasions, Ross has stated that she identifies most with Ayn Rand's Objectivism, and that Atlas Shrugged is her favorite book.
