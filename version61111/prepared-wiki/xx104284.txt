[[Electoral division of Casuarina]]

CATEGORIES: Electoral divisions of the Northern Territory

Casuarina is an electoral division of the Legislative Assembly in Australia's Northern Territory. It was first created in 1974 and was named after the adjacent suburb of Casuarina. Casuarina is an entirely urban electorate, covering only 18 kmÂ² and taking in the suburbs of Brinkin, Nakara, Tiwi and part of Alawa, as well as the Charles Darwin University. There were 5,031 people enrolled in the electorate as of August 2012.
For the first three decades of its existence, Casuarina, like most seats in the Darwin area, was a stronghold for the Country Liberal Party. Clare Martin did nearly manage to take the seat for the Australian Labor Party upon the retirement of long-serving CLP member Nick Dondas in 1994, but lost out to the CLP's Peter Adamson, who held the seat for the next seven years. It was still widely presumed to be a safe Liberal seat in 2001, when it fell to the ALP in one of the most surprising results of the 2001 election. The seat appears to now be a safe Labor seat, as Vatskalis easily held the seat at the 2005 election with a massive swing in his favour and easily retained it in 2008 and 2012.
