Datura stramonium, known by the common names Jimson weed, Devil's snare or datura, is a plant in the Solanaceae (nightshade) family. It is believed to have originated in the Americas, but is now found around the world.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?13323 |title=Datura stramonium information from NPGS/GRIN |accessdate=2008-02-05 [/tpl] Other common names for D. stramonium include thornapple and moon flower,[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.herbalsafety.utep.edu/facts.asp?ID=46 |accessdate=2013-02-13 |title=Jimsonweed|publisher=University of Texas El Paso / Austin Cooperative Pharmacy Program & Paso del Norte Health Foundation[/tpl] and it has the Spanish name Toloache.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.herbalsafety.utep.edu/detail.asp?ID=46 |accessdate=2013-02-13 |title=Detailed Information: Jimsonweed|publisher=University of Texas El Paso / Austin Cooperative Pharmacy Program & Paso del Norte Health Foundation[/tpl]
For centuries, datura has been used as a herbal medicine to relieve asthma symptoms and as an analgesic during surgery or bonesetting. It is also a powerful hallucinogen and deliriant, which is used spiritually for the intense visions it produces. However, the tropane alkaloids which are responsible for both the medicinal and hallucinogenic properties are fatally toxic in only slightly higher amounts than the medicinal dosage, and careless use often results in hospitalizations and deaths.

==Description==

D. stramonium is a foul-smelling, erect annual, freely branching herb that forms a bush up to [tpl]convert|2|to-|5|ft|cm|-1[/tpl] tall.[tpl]Cite book| last = Stace | first = Clive | title = New Flora of the British Isles | publisher =Cambridge University Press | page = 532 | year = 1997| isbn = 0-521-65315-0 [/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=Henkel, Alice|chapter=Jimson weed|title=American Medicinal Leaves and Herbs|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|year=1911|page=30|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ppUUAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA30[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=Grieve, Maud|title=A Modern Herbal: The Medicinal, Culinary, Cosmetic and Economic Properties, Cultivation and Folk-lore of Herbs, Grasses, Fungi, Shrubs, & Trees with All Their Modern Scientific Uses, Volume 2|publisher=Dover Publications|year=1971|isbn=9780486227993|page=804|url=https://www.botanical.com/botanical/mgmh/t/thorna12.html#des[/tpl]
The root is long, thick, fibrous and white. The stem is stout, erect, leafy, smooth, and pale yellow-green. The stem forks off repeatedly into branches, and at each fork forms a leaf and a single, erect flower.
The leaves are approximately [tpl]convert|3|to-|8|in|cm|0[/tpl] long, smooth, toothed, soft, irregularly undulate. The upper surface of the leaves is a darker green, and the bottom is a light green. The leaves have a bitter and nauseating taste, which is imparted to extracts of the herb, and remains even after the leaves have been dried.[tpl]cite book|author=Grieve, Maud|title=A Modern Herbal: The Medicinal, Culinary, Cosmetic and Economic Properties, Cultivation and Folk-lore of Herbs, Grasses, Fungi, Shrubs, & Trees with All Their Modern Scientific Uses, Volume 2|publisher=Dover Publications|year=1971|isbn=9780486227993|page=805|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=KgfHxvGFHAoC&pg=PA805[/tpl]
Datura stramonium generally flowers throughout the summer. The fragrant flowers are trumpet-shaped, white to creamy or violet, and [tpl]convert|2+1/2|to-|3+1/2|in|cm|0[/tpl] long, and grow on short stems from either the axils of the leaves or the places where the branches fork. The calyx is long and tubular, swollen at the bottom, and sharply angled, surmounted by five sharp teeth. The corolla, which is folded and only partially open, is white, funnel-shaped, and has prominent ribs. The flowers open at night, emitting a pleasant fragrance and is fed upon by nocturnal moths.
The egg-shaped seed capsule is [tpl]convert|1|to-|3|in|cm|0[/tpl] in diameter and either covered with spines or bald. At maturity it splits into four chambers, each with dozens of small black seeds.

==Range and habitat==

Datura stramonium is native to North America, but was spread to the Old World early.  It was scientifically described and named by Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus in 1753, although it had been described a century earlier by herbalists, such as Nicholas Culpeper.[tpl]citation | last = Culpeper | first = Nicholas | title = Culpeper's Complete Herbal | publisher = W Foulsham & Co Ltd | location = Slough | pages = 368–369 | date = n.d.; 20th century edition of 1653 publication | isbn = 0-572-00203-3[/tpl] Today, it grows wild in all the world's warm and moderate regions, where it is found along roadsides and at dung-rich livestock enclosures.,[tpl]cite journal|last=Veblen|first=K.E.|title=Savanna glade hotspots: Plant community development and synergy with large herbivores|journal=Journal of Arid Environments|year=2012|volume=78|pages=119–127|doi=10.1016/j.jaridenv.2011.10.016[/tpl]Oudhia P., Tripathi R.S.(1998).Allelopathic potential of Datura stramonium L..

The seed is thought to be carried by birds and spread in their droppings. Its seeds can lie dormant underground for years and germinate when the soil is disturbed.  People who discover it growing in their gardens, and are worried about its toxicity, have been advised to dig it up or have it otherwise removed.Mail Online, Pensioner finds deadly tropical plant made famous in Harry Potter book in her back garden 3:24 PM on 24 August 2009.

==Toxicity==

All parts of Datura plants contain dangerous levels of the tropane alkaloids atropine, hyoscyamine and scopolamine which are classified as  deliriants, or anticholinergics. There is a high risk of fatal overdose amongst uninformed users, and many hospitalizations occur amongst recreational users who ingest the plant for its psychoactive effects.AJ Giannini,Drugs of Abuse--Second Edition. Los Angeles, Practice Management Information Corporation, pp.48-51.  ISBN 1-57066-053-0.
The amount of toxins varies widely from plant to plant. There can be as much as a 5:1 variation between plants, and a given plant's toxicity depends on its age, where it is growing, and the local weather conditions.[tpl]cite book | author = Preissel, U.; Preissel, H.-G. | title = Brugmansia and Datura: Angel's Trumpets and Thorn Apples | publisher = Firefly Books | year = 2002 | location = Buffalo, NY | pages = 106–129 | isbn = 1-55209-598-3 [/tpl] Additionally, within a given datura plant, toxin concentration varies by part and even from leaf to leaf. When the plant is younger, the ratio of scopolamine to atropine is approximately 3:1; after flowering, this ratio is reversed, with the amount of scopolamine continuing to decrease as the plant gets older.[tpl]Cite book|author=Nellis, David W.|title=Poisonous Plants and Animals of Florida and the Caribbean|publisher=Pineapple Press|year=1997|isbn=9781561641116|page=237|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=C8xJE2NfQpIC&pg=PA237[/tpl] This variation makes Datura exceptionally hazardous as a drug. In traditional cultures, a great deal of experience with and detailed knowledge of Datura was critical in order to minimize harm. An individual datura seed contains about 0.1 mg of atropine, and the approximate fatal dose for adult humans is >10 mg atropine or >2–4 mg scopolamine.[tpl]cite journal|author=Arnett AM|title=Jimson Weed (Datura stramonium) poisoning |work=Clinical Toxicology Review |date=December 1995 |volume=18 |issue=3 |url=http://www.erowid.org/plants/datura/datura_info5.shtml[/tpl]
Datura intoxication typically produces delirium (as contrasted to hallucination); hyperthermia; tachycardia; bizarre behavior; and severe mydriasis with resultant painful photophobia that can last several days. Pronounced amnesia is another commonly reported effect.[tpl]Cite book| last = Freye | first = Enno | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Pharmacology and Abuse of Cocaine, Amphetamines, Ecstasy and Related Designer Drugs | publisher = Springer Netherlands | date = 21 September 2009 | location = | pages = 217–218 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/u42k03r4v3234615/ | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-90-481-2447-3 [/tpl] The onset of symptoms generally occurs approximately 30 minutes to an hour after smoking the herb.

==Medicinal uses==

Datura has long been used as an extremely effective treatment for asthma symptoms. The active anti-asthmatic agent is atropine, which causes paralysis of the pulmonary branches of the lungs, eliminating the spasms that cause the asthma attacks. The leaves are generally smoked either in a cigarette or a pipe. This practice of smoking datura to relieve asthma has its origins in traditional Ayurvedic medicine in India. After this was discovered during the late 18th century by James Anderson, the English Physician-General of the East India Company, the practice quickly became popular in Europe.[tpl]cite book|author=Barceloux, Donald G.|chapter=Cascara|title=Medical Toxicology of Natural Substances: Foods, Fungi, Medicinal Herbs, Plants, and Venomous Animals|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2008|isbn=9781118382769|page=1877|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=aTTBPedwFfAC&pg=PT1877[/tpl][tpl]Cite book|authors=Pennachio, Marcello et al|title=Uses and Abuses of Plant-Derived Smoke: Its Ethnobotany As Hallucinogen, Perfume, Incense, and Medicine|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=9780195370010|page=6|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pr9fgQIr5LkC&pg=PA6[/tpl]

Atropine and scopolamine (both of which are found in very high concentrations in datura) are muscarinic antagonists which can be used to treat Parkinson's disease and motion sickness, and to inhibit parasympathetic stimulation of the urinary tract, respiratory tract, GI tract, heart and eye.
Datura can be used to assist in the process of breaking drug addictions, by reducing the symptoms of delirium tremens and morphine withdrawals.
Other medicinal uses for datura include providing relief from sore throat or toothache and getting rid of parasites.
Datura should be avoided by patients with heart problems, glaucoma, enlarged prostate, urinary difficulties, fluid buildup in the lungs, or bowel obstructions.[tpl]cite book|author=Miller, Robert L.|title=The Encyclopedia of Addictive Drugs|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2002|isbn=9780313318078|page=207|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=G7As-qawdzMC&pg=PA207[/tpl]

==Spiritual uses==

For centuries, Datura stramonium has been used as a mystical sacrament which brings about powerful visions (lasting for days) and opens the user to communication with spirit world.
The ancient inhabitants of what is today central and southern California used to ingest the small black seeds of datura to "commune with deities through visions".[tpl]cite book|authors=Austin, Alfredo Lopez et al.|title=Mexico's Indigenous Past|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|year=2005|isbn=9780806137230|page=22|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=tzB4rfXObCwC&pg=PA22[/tpl] Across the Americas, other indigenous peoples such as the Algonquin, Cherokee, Marie Galente and Luiseño also utilized this plant in sacred ceremonies for its hallucinogenic properties.[tpl]cite book|authors=Biaggioni, Italo et al|title=Primer on the Autonomic Nervous System|publisher=Academic Press|year=2011|isbn=9780123865250|page=77|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=FycmOkb-T1gC&pg=PA77[/tpl][tpl]Cite book|authors=Pennachio, Marcello et al|title=Uses and Abuses of Plant-Derived Smoke: Its Ethnobotany As Hallucinogen, Perfume, Incense, and Medicine|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=9780195370010|pages=82–83|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pr9fgQIr5LkC&pg=PA82[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=Davis, Wade|title=The Serpent and the Rainbow: a Harvard scientist's astonishing journey into the secret societies of Haitian voodoo, zombis and magic|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=1997|isbn=9780684839295|page=[tpl]page needed|date=July 2012[/tpl]|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=NAs-JZ1MhoMC[/tpl] In Ethiopia, some students and debtrawoch (lay priests), use D. stramonium to "open the mind" to be more receptive to learning, and creative and imaginative thinking.[tpl]cite book|author=Molvaer, Reidulf Knut|title=Socialization and Social Control in Ethiopia|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|year=1995|isbn=9783447036627|page=259|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=F6dW0EPJiVAC&pg=PA259[/tpl]
The common name "datura" has its roots in ancient India, where the plant is considered particularly sacred—believed to be a favorite of the Hindu god Shiva Nataraja.

==Cultivation==

Datura prefers rich, calcareous soil. Adding nitrogen fertilizer to the soil will increase the concentration of alkaloids present in the plant. Datura can be grown from seed, which is sown with several feet between each plant. Datura is sensitive to frost, and so should be sheltered during cold weather. The plant is harvested when the fruits are ripe, but still green. To harvest, the entire plant is cut down, the leaves are stripped from the plant, and everything is left to dry. When the fruits begin to burst open, the seeds are harvested. A single intensively planted acre can produce 1,000 to 1,500 pounds (1,100–1,700 kg/ha) of leaf and 700 pounds (780 kg/ha) of seed.[tpl]cite book|author=Chopra, I.C.|title=Indigenous Drugs of India|publisher=Academic Publishers|year=2006|isbn=9788185086804|page=143|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2HyC4-GJ50YC&pg=PA134[/tpl]

==Etymology==

The genus name is derived from dhatura, an ancient Hindu word for a plant. Stramonium is originally from Greek, strychnos στρύχνος "nightshade" and maniakos μανιακός  "mad".[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.ansci.cornell.edu/plants/jimsonweed/jimsonweed.html |accessdate=2010-02-12 |title=Datura species |work=Plants Poisonous to Livestock |publisher=Cornell University Department of Animal Science [/tpl]
In the United States the plant is called jimson weed, or more rarely Jamestown weed; it got this name from the town of Jamestown, Virginia, where British soldiers consumed it while attempting to suppress Bacon's Rebellion. They spent eleven days in altered mental states:
