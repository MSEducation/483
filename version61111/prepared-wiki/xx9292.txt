[[Organelle]]

CATEGORIES: Organelles, Cell anatomy

In cell biology, an organelle [tpl]IPAc-en|ɔr|ɡ|ə|ˈ|n|ɛ|l[/tpl] is a specialized subunit within a cell that has a specific function, and it is usually separately enclosed within its own lipid bilayer.
The name organelle comes from the idea that these structures are to cells what an organ is to the body (hence the name organelle, the suffix -elle being a diminutive). Organelles are identified by microscopy, and can also be purified by cell fractionation. There are many types of organelles, particularly in eukaryotic cells. While prokaryotes do not possess organelles per se, some do contain protein-based microcompartments, which are thought to act as primitive organelles.[tpl]cite journal |pmid=16081736 |doi=10.1126/science.1113397 |date=5 August 2005 |author=Kerfeld, C.

==History and terminology==

In biology organs are defined as confined functional units within an organism. The analogy of bodily organs to microscopic cellular substructures is obvious, as from even early works, authors of respective textbooks rarely elaborate on the distinction between the two.
Credited as the first[tpl]cite book |last= Bütschli|first= O. |authorlink= Otto Bütschli |title=Dr. H. G. Bronn's Klassen  u. Ordnungen des Thier-Reichs wissenschaftlich dargestellt in Wort und Bild.

Naturalist. 23, 1889, p. 183: "It may possibly be of advantage to use the word organula here instead of organ, following a suggestion by Möbius. Functionally differentiated multicellular aggregates in multicellular forms or metazoa are in this sense organs, while, for functionally differentiated portions of unicellular organisms or for such differentiated portions of the unicellular germ-elements of metazoa, the diminutive organula is appropriate." Cited after: Oxford English Dictionary online, entry for "organelle".'Journal de l'anatomie et de la physiologie normales et pathologiques de l'homme et des animaux' at Google Books to use a diminutive of organ (i.e., little organ) for cellular structures was German zoologist Karl August Möbius (1884), who used the term organula (plural of organulum, the diminutive of Latin organum). From the context, it is clear that he referred to reproduction related structures of protists. In a footnote, which was published as a correction in the next issue of the journal, he justified his suggestion to call organs of unicellular organisms "organella" since they are only differently formed parts of one cell, in contrast to multicellular organs of multicellular organisms. Thus, the original definition was limited to structures of unicellular organisms.
It would take several years before organulum, or the later term organelle, became accepted and expanded in meaning to include subcellular structures in multicellular organisms.

Later, both terms came to be used side by side: Bengt Lidforss wrote 1915 (in German) about "Organs or Organells".[tpl]cite book |last=Lidforss |first=B. |authorlink = Bengt Lidforss |editor=Paul Hinneberg |title=Allgemeine Biologie  |year=1915  |publisher=Verlag von B.

Around 1920, the term organelle was used to describe propulsion structures ("motor organelle complex", i.e., flagella and their anchoring)[tpl]cite journal |author=Kofoid CA, Swezy O |title=Flagellate Affinities of Trichonympha |journal=Proc.

Alfred Kühn wrote about centrioles as division organelles, although he stated that, for Vahlkampfias, the alternative 'organelle' or 'product of structural build-up' had not yet been decided, without explaining the difference between the alternatives.[tpl]cite journal | last = Kühn | first = Alfred |year = 1920| title = Untersuchungen zur kausalen Analyse der Zellteilung.

In his 1953 textbook, Max Hartmann used the term for extracellular (pellicula, shells, cell walls) and intracellular skeletons of protists.[tpl]cite book |last=Hartmann |first=Max |title=Allgemeine Biologie |edition=4th |year=1953 |publisher=Gustav Fisher Verlag |location=Stuttgart [/tpl]

definition of organelle emerged, after which only cellular structures with surrounding membrane had been considered organelles.
However, the more original definition of subcellular functional unit in general still coexists.Strasburgers Lehrbuch der Botanik für Hochschulen, 35. Aufl. (2002), p. 42[tpl]cite journal |author=Alliegro MC, Alliegro MA, Palazzo RE |date=June 2006 |title=Centrosome-associated RNA in surf clam oocytes |journal=Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci.

In 1978, Albert Frey-Wyssling suggested that the term organelle should refer only to structures that convert energy, such as centrosomes, ribosomes, and nucleoli.[tpl]cite journal |pmid=689352 |language=German |year=1978 |author=Frey-Wyssling, A |title=Definition of the organell concept |volume=124 |issue=3 |pages=455–7 |issn=0016-5840 |journal=Gegenbaurs morphologisches Jahrbuch[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF01935984|title=Concerning the concept 'organelle'|year=1978|last1=Frey-Wyssling|first1=A.|journal=Experientia|volume=34|issue=4|pages=547–9|pmid=346371[/tpl] This new definition, however, did not win wide recognition.

==Types of organelles==

While most cell biologists consider the term organelle to be synonymous with "cell compartment", other cell biologists choose to limit the term organelle to include only those that are DNA-containing, having originated from formerly autonomous microscopic organisms acquired via endosymbiosis.[tpl]cite journal |pmid=18430636 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2008.02.065 |year=2008 |author=Keeling, Pj; Archibald, Jm |title=Organelle evolution: what's in a name? |volume=18 |issue=8 |pages=R345–7 |journal=Current biology: CB[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |pmid=17403155 |doi=10.1111/j.1550-7408.2007.00245.x |year=2007|author=Imanian B, Carpenter KJ, Keeling PJ |title=Mitochondrial genome of a tertiary endosymbiont retains genes for electron transport proteins |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=146–53 |journal=The Journal of eukaryotic microbiology[/tpl][tpl]cite book |last=Mullins |first=Christopher |authorlink=Christopher Mullins |title=The Biogenesis of Cellular Organelles |chapter=Theory of Organelle Biogenesis: A Historical Perspective |year=2004 |publisher=Springer Science+Business Media, National Institutes of Health |isbn=0-306-47990-7[/tpl]
Under this definition, there would only be two broad classes of organelles (i.e. those that contain their own DNA, and have originated from endosymbiotic bacteria):
Other organelles are also suggested to have endosymbiotic origins, but do not contain their own DNA (notably the flagellum – see evolution of flagella).
Under the more restricted definition of membrane-bound structures, some parts of the cell do not qualify as organelles. Nevertheless, the use of organelle to refer to non-membrane bound structures such as ribosomes is common.Campbell and Reece, Biology 6th edition, Benjamin Cummings, 2002 This has led some texts to delineate between membrane-bound and non-membrane bound organelles.Cormack, David H. (1984) Introduction to Histology, Lippincott, ISBN 0397521146 These structures are large assemblies of macromolecules that carry out particular and specialized functions, but they lack membrane boundaries. Such cell structures include:

===Eukaryotic organelles===

Eukaryotic cells are structurally complex, and by definition are organized, in part, by interior compartments that are themselves enclosed by lipid membranes that resemble the outermost cell membrane. The larger organelles, such as the nucleus and vacuoles, are easily visible with the light microscope. They were among the first biological discoveries made after the invention of the microscope.
Not all eukaryotic cells have each of the organelles listed below. Exceptional organisms have cells that do not include some organelles that might otherwise be considered universal to eukaryotes (such as mitochondria).[tpl]cite journal |author=Fahey RC, Newton GL, Arrack B, Overdank-Bogart T, Baley S |title=Entamoeba histolytica: a eukaryote without glutathione metabolism |journal=Science |volume=224 |issue=4644 |pages=70–72 |year=1984 |pmid=6322306 |doi=10.1126/science.6322306|bibcode = 1984Sci...224...70F [/tpl] There are also occasional exceptions to the number of membranes surrounding organelles, listed in the tables below (e.g., some that are listed as double-membrane are sometimes found with single or triple membranes). In addition, the number of individual organelles of each type found in a given cell varies depending upon the function of that cell.
Mitochondria and chloroplasts, which have double-membranes and their own DNA, are believed to have originated from incompletely consumed or invading prokaryotic organisms, which were adopted as a part of the invaded cell. This idea is supported in the Endosymbiotic theory.
Other related structures:

===Prokaryotic organelles===

Prokaryotes are not as structurally complex as eukaryotes, and were once thought not to have any internal structures enclosed by lipid membranes. In the past, they were often viewed as having little internal organization; but, slowly, details are emerging about prokaryotic internal structures. An early false turn was the idea developed in the 1970s that bacteria might contain membrane folds termed mesosomes, but these were later shown to be artifacts produced by the chemicals used to prepare the cells for electron microscopy.[tpl]cite journal |author=Ryter A |title=Contribution of new cryomethods to a better knowledge of bacterial anatomy |journal=Ann. Inst. Pasteur Microbiol. |volume=139 |issue=1 |pages=33–44 |year=1988 |pmid=3289587 |doi=10.1016/0769-2609(88)90095-6[/tpl]
However, more recent research has revealed that at least some prokaryotes have microcompartments such as carboxysomes. These subcellular compartments are 100–200 nm in diameter and are enclosed by a shell of proteins.[tpl]cite journal |pmid=16081736 | doi = 10.1126/science.1113397 |date=August 2005 |author=Kerfeld CA, Sawaya MR, Tanaka S, Nguyen CV, Phillips M, Beeby M, Yeates TO |title=Protein structures forming the shell of primitive bacterial organelles |volume=309 |issue=5736 |pages=936–8 |journal=Science|bibcode = 2005Sci...309..936K [/tpl] Even more striking is the description of membrane-bound magnetosomes in bacteria,[tpl]cite journal |author=Komeili A, Li Z, Newman DK, Jensen GJ |title=Magnetosomes are cell membrane invaginations organized by the actin-like protein MamK |journal=Science |volume=311 |issue=5758 |pages=242–5 |year=2006 |pmid=16373532 |doi=10.1126/science.1123231|bibcode = 2006Sci...311..242K [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Scheffel A, Gruska M, Faivre D, Linaroudis A, Plitzko JM, Schüler D |title=An acidic protein aligns magnetosomes along a filamentous structure in magnetotactic bacteria |journal=Nature |volume=440 |issue=7080 |pages=110–4 |year=2006 |pmid=16299495 |doi=10.1038/nature04382|bibcode = 2006Natur.440..110S [/tpl] as well as the nucleus-like structures of the Planctomycetes that are surrounded by lipid membranes.[tpl]cite journal |author=Fuerst JA |title=Intracellular compartmentation in planctomycetes |journal=Annu.

The periplasm of gram negative microbes has been proposed to form physiological extensions, suggested to be named periplasmic organelles, as precursors of secretion of bacterial outer membrane bounded vesicles (OMVs). The structure and function of these extensions vis a vis membrane vesicle trafficking at host-pathogen interface have been discussed in detail.[tpl]cite web |author=YashRoy R.C. |date=2003 |title=Eukaryotic cell intoxication by Gram-negative pathogens: A novel bacterial outermembrane-bound nanovesicular exocytosis model for Type III secretory system |journal=Toxicology International |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=1–9. |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230793514_Eukaryotic_cell_intoxication_by_Gram-negative_pathogens_A_novel_bacterial_outermembrane-bound_nanovesicular_exocytosis_model_for_Type-III_secretion_system._Toxicology_International_vol._10_No._1_pages_1-9_year_2003?ev=prf_pub[/tpl]

==Proteins and organelles==

The function of a protein is closely correlated with the organelle in which it resides. Some methods were proposed for predicting the organelle in which an uncharacterized protein is located according to its amino acid composition[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1006/jmbi.1996.0804 | last1 = Cedano | first1 = J. | last2 = Aloy | first2 = P. | last3 = P'erez-Pons | first3 = J.
