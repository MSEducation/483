Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport [tpl]Airport codes|MSY|KMSY|MSY[/tpl] is an international airport in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, United States. It is owned by the city of New Orleans and is 11 miles west of downtown New Orleans. The airport's address is 900 Airline Drive in Kenner, Louisiana. A small portion of Runway 10/28 is in unincorporated St. Charles Parish. Armstrong International is the primary commercial airport for the New Orleans metropolitan area and southeast Louisiana. The airport was formerly known as Moisant Field, and it is also known as Louis Armstrong International Airport and New Orleans International Airport.
At an average of [tpl]convert|4.5|ft|m[/tpl] above sea level, MSY is the 2nd lowest-lying international airport in the world, behind only Amsterdam's Schiphol International Airport in the Netherlands, which is eleven feet below sea level. Prior to Hurricane Katrina, MSY served 9.7 million passengers per year, nearly all of them non-connecting. In 2013 it served 9,207,636 passengers, 7.1% more than 2012.
In February 2008 U.S. News & World Report ranked the travel experience at MSY 4th of the 47 busiest United States airports based upon the relatively small number of flight delays and frequently lower onboard flight loads.America's Most Miserable Airports. US News and World Report. 2008-02-11.
Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport was once a major gateway for Latin American travel from the United States. That travel now mostly goes through other hubs for legacy airlines such as the American Airlines hubs in Dallas/Ft. Worth (DFW) and Miami (MIA), the Delta Air Lines hub in Atlanta (ATL), and the United Airlines hub in Houston (IAH).
MSY opened after World War II, replacing the older New Orleans Lakefront Airport (which kept the NEW and KNEW airport codes and now serves general aviation) as the city's main airport. MSY was renamed in 2001 after Louis Armstrong, a famous jazz musician from New Orleans.  The National Weather Service forecast office for the area was once located at MSY, but has moved to the suburb of Slidell, and now uses the non-airport codes LIX and KLIX.

==History==

The airport was originally named after daredevil aviator John Moisant, who died in 1910 in an airplane crash on agricultural land where the airport is now located. Its IATA code MSY was derived from Moisant Stock Yards, as Lakefront Airport retained the "NEW" code.Welcome to the Best of New Orleans! Blake Pontchartrain March 29, 2005
Plans for Moisant Field began in 1940, as evidence mounted that New Orleans' older Shushan Airport (New Orleans Lakefront Airport) was too small. In World War II the land became a government air base. It returned to civil control after the war and commercial service began at Moisant Field in May 1946.
On September 19, 1947 the airport was shut down as it was submerged under two feet of water in the wake of the 1947 Hurricane's impact.
Starting in 1946 passengers used a large, hangar-like makeshift structure, until a new terminal complex, designed by Goldstein Parham & Labouisse and Herbert A. Benson, George J. Riehl and built by J. A. Jones Company, debuted in 1959 towards the end of Mayor DeLesseps "Chep" Morrison's administration. The core of this structure forms much of the present-day facility.[tpl]cite web |title=Dedication Plaque of Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport - 2012|url=http://airchive.com/html/airplanes-and-airports/new-orleans-louis-armstrong-international-airport-photos-history-new-orleans-la-usa-/dedication-plaque-of-louis-armstrong-new-orleans-international-airport-2012-/25123|work=Airchive|publisher=2CMedia|accessdate=January 8, 2013[/tpl]
The April 1957 Official Airline Guide (OAG) showed 74 weekday departures:  Delta Air Lines 26, Eastern Air Lines 25, National Airlines 11, Capital Airlines 5, Southern Airways 4,  and Braniff International Airways 3. Pan American World Airways had six departures each week while TACA, a Central American airline, had four.
On November 16, 1959 National Airlines Flight 967, a Douglas DC-7 flying from Tampa to New Orleans crashed into the Gulf of Mexico."ASN Aircraft accident Douglas DC-7B N4891C Gulf of Mexico." Aviation Safety Network. Retrieved on December 23, 2009.
During the administration of Morrison's successor, Vic Schiro, the government sponsored studies of the feasibility of relocating New Orleans International Airport to a new site, contemporaneous with similar efforts that were ultimately successful in Houston (George Bush Intercontinental Airport) and Dallas (Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport). This attempt got as far as recommending a site in New Orleans East; a man-made island was to be created south of I-10 and north of U.S. Route 90 in a bay of Lake Pontchartrain. In the early 1970s it was decided that the current airport should be expanded instead, leading to the construction of a lengthened main terminal ticketing area, an airport access road linking the terminal to I-10, and the present-day Concourses A and B. New Orleans Mayor Sidney Barthelemy, in office from 1986 to 1994, later reintroduced the idea of building a new international airport for the city, with consideration given to other sites in New Orleans East, as well as on the Northshore in suburban St. Tammany Parish. Only a couple months before Hurricane Katrina's landfall, Mayor Ray Nagin again proposed a new airport for New Orleans, this time to the west in Montz, Louisiana. These initiatives met with the same fate as 1960s-era efforts concerning construction of a new airport for New Orleans.

==Accidents==

Eastern Air Lines Flight 304 operated with a Douglas DC-8 flying from New Orleans International Airport to Washington Dulles International Airport crashed on February 25, 1964 nine minutes after takeoff. All 51 passengers and 7 crew were killed.
On March 20, 1969, Douglas DC-3 N142D, leased from Avion Airways for a private charter, crashed on landing, killing 16 of the 27 passengers and crew on board. The aircraft was operating a domestic non-scheduled passenger flight from Memphis International Airport, Tennessee.[tpl]cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19690320-2 |title=N142D Accident Description |publisher=Aviation Safety Network |accessdate=9 February 2011[/tpl]

===Pan Am Flight 759===

On July 9, 1982, Pan Am Flight 759, en route from Miami to Las Vegas, departed New Orleans International. The Boeing 727-200 jetliner took off from the east-west runway (Runway 10/28) traveling east but never gained an altitude higher than [tpl]convert|150|ft|m[/tpl]. The aircraft traveled 4,610 feet (1405 m) beyond the end of Runway 10, hitting trees along the way, until crashing into a residential neighborhood. A total of 153 people were killed (all 145 on board and 8 on the ground). The crash was, at the time, the second-deadliest civil aviation disaster in U.S. history. The National Transportation Safety Board determined the probable cause was the aircraft's encounter with a microburst-induced wind shear during the liftoff. This atmospheric condition created a downdraft and decreasing headwind forcing the plane downward. Modern wind shear detection equipment protecting flights from such conditions is now in place both onboard planes and at most commercial airports, including Armstrong International.

===Hurricane Katrina===

The airport was closed to commercial air traffic on August 28, 2005, shortly before Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans, and it remained closed as floods affected the city. The Associated Press reported on August 31 that MSY would receive humanitarian flights, and that the airport "has no significant airfield damage and had no standing water in aircraft movement areas", although the airport did, as the article put it, "sustain damage to its roofs, hangars and fencing."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/newsflash/louisiana/index.ssf?/base/news-18/1125504240320501.xml&storylist=louisiana |title=AP New Orleans News Online Breaking News & Headlines from Associated Press |publisher=nola.com |date=2011-11-01 |accessdate=2012-08-13[/tpl]  In early September, the airport opened only to military aircraft and humanitarian flights, and served as a staging center for evacuees.  The airport reopened to commercial flights on September 13, 2005.[tpl]cite web|last=Nossiter |first=Adam |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/nation/katrina/20050913-1203-katrina-neworleans.html |title= News > Nation > Hurricane Katrina - New Orleans airport reopens |publisher=SignOnSanDiego.com |date=2005-09-13 |accessdate=2012-08-13[/tpl]

===February 2006 tornado===

At about 2:30 EST in the morning on February 2, 2006, a tornado touched down on the grounds of MSY. The damage from the tornado was significant but primarily confined to Concourse C, where American, United, AirTran Airways, and international arrivals were based. Many temporary repairs dating from Hurricane Katrina failed, including one roof patch, forcing airlines based in the concourse to relocate operations to vacant gates.  Jetways and other ground equipment also sustained damage. The damage was rated by the National Weather Service and the tornado was rated F1. As of late 2006, all of this had been repaired.

==Post-Katrina capacity restoration==

MSY reopened to commercial flights on September 13, 2005, with four flights operated by Delta Air Lines to Atlanta and a Northwest Airlines flight to Memphis. Slowly, service from other carriers began to resume, with limited service offered by Southwest Airlines, Continental Airlines, and American Airlines. thumb|left|Armstrong Airport, June 2007 Eventually, all carriers announced their return to MSY, with the exception of America West Airlines (which merged into US Airways two weeks later) and international carrier TACA. In early 2006, Continental Airlines became the first airline to return to pre-Katrina flight frequency levels, and in September 2006, to pre-Katrina seat capacity levels.
MSY served 8,153,511 passengers in 2010, or 83.8% of the pre-Katrina high of 9,733,179 passengers in 2004, as well as the all-time high of 9.9 million passengers who used the airfield in 2000.
In May 2010, AirTran announced new daily nonstop service to its hub in Milwaukee utilizing Boeing 717 twin jet aircraft which then commenced on October 7, 2010.[tpl]cite web|url=http://pressroom.airtran.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=201565&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1428282 |title=AirTran Airways - Press Release |publisher=Pressroom.airtran.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-13[/tpl]  This route marked MSY's first all-new city addition since 1998.  AirTran is now in the process of being acquired by Southwest Airlines which in turn is currently operating a new nonstop route between MSY and Key West, Florida with Boeing 737-700 jetliners.
In November 2010, United Airlines announced resumption of daily nonstop service to San Francisco, the largest pre-Katrina domestic market that had yet to resume service to New Orleans.
On July 16, 2012, Spirit Airlines announced nonstop service from Dallas-Fort Worth to New Orleans, commencing in January 2013.  Spirit became the first all-new domestic carrier, and second all-new carrier overall (after WestJet) to announce service to MSY, since 1998.

===Incentives to airlines===

On November 21, 2006, the New Orleans Aviation Board approved an air service initiative to promote increased service to Armstrong International:
On January 17, 2008, the city's aviation board voted on an amended incentive program which waives landing fees for the first two airlines to fly nonstop into a city not presently served from the airport. Under the new ruling, landing fees will be waived for up to two airlines flying into an "underserved destination airport." The incentive previously referred to service to a "new destination airport."
The airport is also continuing its incentive to airlines that reach 85% of their pre-Katrina flight frequencies.

===Incentives to passengers===

In November 2006, the airport opened a "cell phone lot" at the corner of Airline Drive and Hollandey Street across from the Airport Access Road to allow people picking up arriving passengers to wait until an arriving passenger calls to say they are ready for pickup.
Also, on December 6, 2006, Armstrong International launched an $8 million maintenance campaign to clean and improve the terminal environment. Dubbed Music To Your Eyes, the campaign is designed to transform the airport into a more visitor-friendly facility, with improvements to lighting, cleanliness, seating, baggage claim maintenance, curbside congestion, and designated smoking areas.[tpl]dead link|date=August 2012[/tpl]
Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport covers an area of [tpl]convert|1,500|acre|ha[/tpl] at an elevation of 4 feet (1 m) above mean sea level. It has three runways: 10/28 is 10,104 by 150 feet (3,080 x 46 m) with a concrete surface; 1/19 is 7,001 by 150 feet (2,134 x 46 m) with a concrete surface; 6/24 is 3,570 by 150 feet (1,088 x 46 m) with an asphalt surface.
For the 12-month period ending December 31, 2007, the airport had 129,228 aircraft operations, an average of 354 per day: 58% scheduled commercial, 21% general aviation and 19% air taxi and 1% military. At that time there were 19 aircraft based at this airport: 21% single-engine, 21% multi-engine, 42% jet and 16% helicopter.

==International services==

Armstrong International's Concourse C, located in the airport's West Terminal, contains a fully enclosed US Customs, Immigration, and FIS facility. The majority of the concourse's 15 gates offer direct access to this area and are thus capable of accepting foreign arrivals from all over the world, on aircraft as large as Boeing 747-400 intercontinental jetliners. Currently, only Air Canada operates scheduled international passenger service from the airport with flights to Toronto.

===Past international services===

==Super Bowl XLVII==

Armstrong International Airport processed a record number of passengers through its facility on Monday, February 4, 2013. There were 40,561 passengers processed through the airport, the highest number of passengers in its 67-year history. With the record crowd, there were no significant issues reported with crowds passing through security in less than an hour at peak times. In preparation for Monday’s massive crowd, the airport in conjunction with the TSA doubled the number of passenger screening lanes to meet the outbound demand of Super Bowl Travelers and added additional baggage screening equipment. In addition, TSA checkpoints remained open around the clock from Sunday morning until after the last flight departed on Monday. Concessions remained open with certain locations remaining open all night to meet every traveler’s needs.
"We anticipated that we would have record crowds in the airport and took the necessary steps in advance to adequately accommodate all of our passengers,” says Aviation Director Iftikhar Ahmad. "This is true example of the great staff and personnel that we have here at Armstrong International Airport. Each member of staff from accountants to engineers to maintenance employees were on the floor working together to ensure that everything went off without any problems, and I am very proud of our entire team. ”
