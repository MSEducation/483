==Career==

Froud was the conceptual designer and costume designer for the films The Dark Crystal and Labyrinth (both in conjunction with Jim Henson's Creature Shop). He collaborated with Terry Jones, who was a screenwriter on Labyrinth, on The Goblins of the Labyrinth (1986, re-issued in abridged form as The Goblin Companion: A Field Guide to Goblins in 1996), and subsequently on a number of non-Labyrinth-related books about fairies and goblins, namely of the "Lady Cottington" series, such as Lady Cottington's Pressed Fairy Book.  He has also worked with American writer Ari Berk on more recent books, including Goblins and "The Runes of Elfland", and produced art books such as Good Faeries/Bad Faeries.  One of his most famous art books, Faeries, produced in collaboration with Alan Lee, was the basis of a 1981 animated feature of the same name.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.worldoffroud.com/www/faeries/faeries/index.cfm |title= The World of Brian Froud[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0192008/ |title= Faeries |publisher= Internet Movie Database[/tpl][tpl]cite book |title= Faeries |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=P8a0J7byMhIC&dq=Faeries|author= Brian Froud |coauthor= Alan Lee, |editor= David Larkin |publisher= Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing Group |year= 1979[/tpl]
