</ref>  Central banks in some other countries, notably the German [[Bundesbank]], had considerably better records of achieving price stability drawing on experience from the two episodes of [[hyperinflation]] and economic collapse under the country's [[Reichsbank|previous central bank]].
 Inflation worldwide has fallen significantly since former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker began his tenure in 1979, a period which has been called the Great Moderation; some commentators attribute this to improved monetary policy worldwide, particularly in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.John Taylor, "Monetary Policy and the Long Boom", Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Review, November–December 1998.Peter M. Summers, "What Caused the Great Moderation?

By and large, if the overriding objective is price stability, we did better with the nineteenth-century gold standard and passive central banks, with currency boards, or even with 'free banking.'".

====Public confusion====

The Federal Reserve has established a library of information on their websites, however, many experts have spoken about the general level of public confusion that still exists on the subject of the economy; this lack of understanding of macroeconomic questions and monetary policy, however, exists in other countries as well. Critics of the Fed widely regard the system as being "opaque", and one of the Fed's most vehement opponents of his time, Congressman Louis T. McFadden, even went so far as to say that "Every effort has been made by the Federal Reserve Board to conceal its powers...."[ref]

There are, on the other hand, many economists who support the need for an independent central banking authority, and some have established websites that aim to clear up confusion about the economy and the Federal Reserve's operations.  The Federal Reserve website itself publishes various information and instructional materials for a variety of audiences.

====Criticism of government interference====

Some economists, especially those belonging to the heterodox Austrian School, criticize the idea of even establishing monetary policy, believing that it distorts investment. Friedrich Hayek won the Nobel Prize for his elaboration of the Austrian business cycle theory. 
Briefly, the theory holds that an artificial injection of credit, from a source such as a central bank like the Federal Reserve, sends false signals to entrepreneurs to engage in long-term investments due to a favorably low interest rate. However, the surge of investments undertaken represents an artificial boom, or bubble, because the low interest rate was achieved by an artificial expansion of the money supply and not by savings. Hence, the pool of real savings and resources have not increased and do not justify the investments undertaken. 
These investments, which are more appropriately called "malinvestments," are realized to be unsustainable when the artificial credit spigot is shut off and interest rates rise. The malinvestments and unsustainable projects are liquidated, which is the recession. The theory demonstrates that the problem is the artificial boom which causes the malinvestments in the first place, made possible by an artificial injection of credit not from savings.
According to Austrian economics, without government intervention, interest rates will always be an equilibrium between the time-preferences of borrowers and savers, and this equilibrium is simply distorted by government intervention. This distortion, in their view, is the cause of the business cycle. Some Austrian economists - but by no means all - also support full reserve banking, a hypothetical financial/banking system where banks may not lend deposits. Others may advocate free banking, whereby the government abstains from any interference in what individuals may choose to use as money or the extent to which banks create money through the deposit and lending cycle.

====Reserve requirement====

The Federal Reserve regulates banking, and one regulation under its direct control is the reserve requirement which dictates how much money banks must keep in reserves, as compared to its demand deposits. Banks use their observation that the majority of deposits are not requested by the account holders at the same time.
Currently, the Federal Reserve requires that banks keep 10% of their deposits on hand.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://archive.is/20121202223143/http://www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/fedpoint/fed46.html |title=Board of the Governors of the Federal Reserve System |quote=In April 2007, the reserve requirement was 10% on transaction deposits and 0% on time deposits[/tpl]  Some countries have no nationally mandated reserve requirements—banks use their own resources to determine what to hold in reserve, however their lending is typically constrained by other regulations.http://ideas.repec.org/p/bca/bocawp/97-8.html Kevin Clinton, Bank of Canada: "Implementation of Monetary Policy in a Regime with Zero Reserve Requirements", Bank of Canada Working Paper 97-8, 1997. "A number of countries now have no requirement, such as Australia, Belgium, Canada, Sweden and the United Kingdom." Other factors being equal, lower reserve percentages increases the possibility of Bank runs, such as the widespread runs of 1931. Low reserve requirements also allow for larger expansions of the money supply by actions of commercial banks—currently the private banking system has created much of the broad money supply of US dollars through lending activity.
Monetary policy reform calling for 100% reserves has been advocated by economists such as: Irving Fisher,[ref]
