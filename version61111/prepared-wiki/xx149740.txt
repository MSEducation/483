Since 1961 the Italian Democratic Party of Monarchist Unity (Partito Democratico Italiano di Unit√† Monarchica, PDIUM) was the continuation of the Italian Democratic Party (Partito Democratico Italiano) as they continued to call the PDIUM. It was founded in 1959 by the union of the People's Monarchist Party and the National Monarchist Party.
The new party, like its predecessors, was hampered by provisions in the Italian Constitution of 1946 making it all but impossible to restore the monarchy short of adopting a new constitution.  The document not only specifically foreclosed a referendum on changing the republican form of government, but (until 2002) barred male members of the House of Savoy from ever returning to Italy.  It was never able to repeat the results of its predecessors and saw electoral support for the monarchist cause shrink in the 1963 general election (1.8%) and in those of 1968 (1.3%), due to the successes of the Italian Liberal Party (respectively 7.0 and 5.8%).
In 1972 PDIUM merged in the post-fascist Italian Social Movement (MSI) and so ceased to exist. Alfredo Covelli, long-time monarchist leader, was elected president of MSI. In 1976 Covelli led a moderate split of MSI and established National Democracy.
