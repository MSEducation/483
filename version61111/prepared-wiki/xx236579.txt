[[Pontifical Mission Societies]]

CATEGORIES: Christian missionary societies, Roman Catholic Church organizations

The Pontifical Mission Societies, known in some countries as Missio, is the name of a group of Catholic missionary societies that are under the canonical jurisdiction of the Bishop of Rome (the Pope). These organizations include the Society for the Propagation of the Faith, the Society of St. Peter the Apostle, the Holy Childhood Association and the Missionary Union of Priests and Religious.
Since 1922, Missio has been the Catholic Church’s official support organisation for overseas mission.
The Pope specifically asks the Pontifical Mission Societies to help bring the messages of Christ to the world, especially in countries where Christianity is new, young or poor.  The societies care for and support the younger churches until they are able to be self-sufficient.
Missio raises awareness and fosters prayer and cooperation in the whole Catholic Church, with 120 offices worldwide, it is the only organisation which supports every one of the 1,069 mission dioceses of the world. Missio exists through the generosity of Catholics and plays a crucial role in combating poverty, disease, injustice and exploitation.[tpl]cn|date=September 2013[/tpl]
