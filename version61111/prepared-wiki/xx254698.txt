[[Hobo's Taunt]]

CATEGORIES: 1977 albums, Willie P. Bennett albums

Hobo's Taunt was the second album released by Canadian singer-songwriter  Willie P. Bennett and was released as an LP album by Woodshed Records in 1977 (WS-007). Produced by David Essig, the album was engineered by brothers Daniel Lanois and Bob Lanois.  This production team had trouble capturing Willie's vocals, as he moved around too much, so had him lie down and sing while flat on his back."Woodshed Sessions: Episode 5" - can be viewed on line www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jb7UUNjNpZg
The album contains one of Bennett's better-known songs, "Lace And Pretty Flowers", which has been covered by several other singers, most recently by http://www.stevegoldberger.com Steve Goldberger on his 2009 album The Goldberger Variations.
Bennett re-released the album on compact disc in 2000. The album was digitally remastered by Paul Reiemens at Grant Avenue Studios in Hamilton, Ontario and released on Bennett's independent label, Bnatural Music. In 2003 it was re-released by Japanese label Air Mail Archive (AIRAC-1039), as part of their "Canadian Singer Songwriters Series Vol. 2", in an LP-style slipcase. However, this edition was mastered from a vinyl LP.
