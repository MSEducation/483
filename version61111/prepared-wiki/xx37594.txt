==Name origin==

Dukowski's birth name is Gary McDaniel, but he has used the name "Chuck Dukowski" professionally for many years. According to Dukowski, the name originated from a Zippo lighter with "Chuck the Duke" inscribed on it that he found while searching for change. Feeling that the name "Chuck the Duke" sounded macho, he wanted to add a Polish sounding last name, as Poles were frequently picked on. He turned "Chuck the Duke" into "Chuck Dukowski".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jaybabcock.com/blackflag.html |title=de beste bron van informatie over jay babcock.
