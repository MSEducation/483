[[Jins]]

CATEGORIES: Arabic music, Modes

A jins ([tpl]lang-ar|جنس[/tpl] / ALA-LC: jins, pl. أجناس / ajnās) is a set of three, four, or five stepwise pitches used to build an Arabic maqam, or melodic mode. They correspond to the English terms trichord, tetrachord, and pentachord. A maqam is made up of two or more ajnas.
The word derives from the Greek word genus, meaning "type."http://books.google.com/books?id=L39JSk_d-PgC&pg=PA46&dq=ajnas+music&sig=z-fo5yNV4bYnoIOI-uoiqYArz5I
