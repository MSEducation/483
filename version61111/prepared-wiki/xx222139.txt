The Jassy Conference was a gathering of anti-Bolshevik political figures that met in Iaşi (Jassy), the temporary capital of Romania at the time from November 16 through December 6, 1918.http://www.questia.com/reader/action/open/7895508 The object of the conference, organized by an obscure figure attached to the French consulate in Kiev, was to coordinate the anti-Bolshevik movements of Southern Russia in order to facilitate dealings with the Allied powers. The twenty-one delegates could not reconcile their differences, despite the need to be unified before the Allies in requesting aid. The conference did nothing to forward any agreements.http://books.google.com/books?id=tyuFHvDDsSkC&pg=PA271&lpg=PA271&dq=Jassy+Conference+The+anti-Bolshevik+conference.&source=web&ots=6ty3xq90Xb&sig=MLL65onUJ3x0pqloiiO-9wZaII8&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result#PPA271,M1 The Jassy Conference, however, did agree on two points: the desirability of Allied intervention in the civil war and the indivisibility of Russia. In a vote, no candidate for future ruler of Russia could even garner half the votes – General Denikin had the most with nine.http://books.google.com/books?id=e_fJD9z3SrkC&pg=PA212&lpg=PA212&dq=Jassy+Conference+The+anti-Bolshevik+conference.&source=web&ots=Qb9mvTKDgA&sig=Ex6eeWYr1P-E1WEapZgfEOv52kQ&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=4&ct=result#PPA213,M1
