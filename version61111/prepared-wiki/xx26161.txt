[[Kleptocracy]]

CATEGORIES: Economic problems, Forms of government, Political terminology, Political corruption

Kleptocracy, alternatively cleptocracy or kleptarchy, (from [tpl]lang-el|κλέπτης[/tpl] - kleptēs, "thief"κλέπτης, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus and κράτος - kratos, "power, rule",κράτος, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus hence "rule by thieves") is a form of political and government corruption where the government exists to increase the personal wealth and political power of its officials and the ruling class at the expense of the wider population, often with pretense of honest service.  This type of government corruption is often achieved by the embezzlement of state funds.

==Characteristics==

==Effects==

The effects of a kleptocratic regime or government on a nation are typically adverse in regards to the faring of the state's economy, political affairs and civil rights. Kleptocracy in government often vitiates prospects of foreign investment and drastically weakens the domestic market and cross-border trade. As the kleptocracy normally embezzles money from its citizens by misusing funds derived from tax payments, or money laundering schemes, a kleptocratically structured political system tends to degrade nearly everyone's quality of life.
In addition, the money that kleptocrats steal is often taken from funds that were earmarked for public amenities, such as the building of hospitals, schools, roads, parks and the like – which has further adverse effects on the quality of life of the citizens living under a kleptocracy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://usinfo.state.gov/journals/itdhr/1206/ijde/kleptocracy.htm|title=Combating Kleptocracy|accessdate=8 August 2008[/tpl] The quasi-oligarchy that results from a kleptocratic elite also subverts democracy (or any other political format the state is ostensibly under).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/scp/2006/70236.htm|title=National Strategy Against High-Level Corruption: Coordinating International Efforts to Combat Kleptocracy|accessdate=8 August 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080710105943/http://www.state.gov/r/pa/scp/2006/70236.htm  |archivedate = 10 July 2008[/tpl]

==Other terms==

===Narcokleptocracy===

A narcokleptocracy is a society ruled by "thieves" involved in the trade of narcotics. The term has its origin in a report prepared by a subcommittee of the United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee, chaired by Massachusetts Senator John Kerry.Drugs, Law Enforcement and Foreign Policy, Subcommittee on Terrorism, Narcotics and International Operations of the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, December 1988  The term was used specifically to describe the regime of Manuel Noriega in Panama. The term narcostate has the same meaning.

===Raubwirtschaft===

Raubwirtschaft (German for "plunder economy," "robber economy," or "rapine") is a form of economy where the goal is to plunder the wealth and resources of a country or geographical area. The term is also used in a non-geographical sense, somewhat similar to the term "rapine." The term Raubwirtschaft is often used to describe some late 19th-century colonial and post-colonial practices during the Scramble for Africa.  The Congo Free State of Leopold II of Belgium is frequently described as a Raubwirtschaft. One form of Raubwirtschaft is to start war against one's neighbours and then either plunder their national property and assets, or extort them as war reparations. The term is also used to describe the rainforest destruction.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2007[/tpl] In a non-geographical sense, it may describe the illicit antiquities trade.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2007[/tpl] Arnold J. Toynbee has stated the economy of the Roman Empire was based on Raubwirtschaft. Rome basically plundered the conquered territories and milked the provinces dry; there was little cash flow from Rome to the provinces. The internal economy was based on slavery, and unpaid work had no purchasing power. This effectively also prevented the rise of a middle class with the accompanying growth in domestic consumption and spending by a larger percentage of the population. The economy could be maintained only as long as the Empire was expanding; once the era of conquests ended in the Pax Romana, the empire was doomed.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2010[/tpl] However, the economic and political power of the Western Empire lasted some four centuries after the establishment of the Pax.MacMullen, Ramsay. Corruption and the decline of Rome. ISBN 0-300-04799-1 Yale University Press, 1988. Pp On the other hand, the Roman Empire continued to expand until its territorial zenith in A.D. 117. The Crisis of the Third Century which followed in A.D. 235 was a major threat to Roman political unity, and impacted its future prospects - lending credence to the theory.

===Others===
