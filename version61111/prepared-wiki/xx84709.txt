Relief Society Magazine, including the Relief Society Bulletin of 1914,The guides and bulletins of 1914, although not officially part of the magazine, were bound as the first volume. See "About the Relief Society Magazine Index". was the official publication of the Relief Society of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) from 1915 to 1970. It succeeded the earlier, and privately owned, Woman's Exponent, which was begun in 1872. The magazine was an important publishing outlet for Utah women, and was run by women editors. The founding editor, Susa Young Gates, edited the magazine from 1915 to 1922.
The December 1970 issue of the Relief Society Magazine was its last. The LDS Church discontinued the magazine as part of the implementation of the Priesthood Correlation Program. Thus, the magazine, and several others within the church, was replaced by the Ensign.Sharp, Marianne Clark, "Editorial: Facing Forward", Relief Society Magazine, December 1970, pp. 894-95.
