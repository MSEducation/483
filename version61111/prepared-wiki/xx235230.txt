==History==

Since 1989 Diggers and Dreamers has been the primary resource for information, issues, and ideas about intentional communities and communal living in the UK. The project was an off-shoot of the Communes Network, a loose organisation that was established at a meeting on 15–16 February 1975 organised by the Communes Movement,[tpl]Cite web | last =Dawling | first =Pam | title =What is the Communes Network? | work =Diggers & Dreamers | publisher =Diggers & Dreamers Publications | date =1992–1993 | url =http://www.diggersanddreamers.org.uk/articles/199204.pdf | format = pdf | accessdate =2010-05-28 [/tpl] which itself was started in 1968 by Selene Community, and which had achieved a distribution of 3000 copies of its journal, Communes: Journal of the Communes Movement, in March 1971.[tpl]Cite book | last =Christensen | first =Karen | coauthors =Levinson, David | title =Encyclopedia of community: from the village to the virtual world, Volume 1 | publisher =Berkshire Publishing Group | year =2003 | url =http://books.google.com/books?id=t1geOjQ6R0MC&pg=PA757&lpg=PA757&dq=%22Communes+Movement%22+%22Communes+Network%22&source=bl&ots=6pGl3aU_mN&sig=F9o7859hmqzwPrsMF-Bi2upD7Ls&hl=nl&ei=S3__S6ioM4WUnwO2mPymDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CCYQ6AEwAg | accessdate =2010-05-28 [/tpl]
