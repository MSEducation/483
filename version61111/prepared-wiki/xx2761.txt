[[Extractor (mathematics)]]

CATEGORIES: Graph families, Pseudorandomness, Theoretical computer science

A disperser is a related graph. 
An equivalent way to view an extractor is as a bivariate function 
Extractor functions were originally researched as a way to extract randomness from weakly random sources. See randomness extractor.
Using the probabilistic method it is easy to show that extractor graphs with really good parameters exist. The challenge is to find explicit or polynomial time computable examples of such graphs with good parameters. Algorithms that compute extractor (and disperser) graphs have found many applications in computer science.
