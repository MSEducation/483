The Demopolis Public School is a historic public school building in the city of Demopolis, Alabama.  It was designed by architect Frank Lockwood in the Beaux-Arts style and was completed in 1914.  The new two-story brick building replaced an earlier two-story Queen Anne style wood-frame structure that was built in 1889 and burned in 1913. The contractors for the new building were J.T. Clancy and W.M. Neely.  The building continued as a part of the Demopolis City School System until it closed its doors in June 1981.Marengo County Heritage Book Committee: The heritage of Marengo County, Alabama, page 4.
