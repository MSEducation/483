==History==

The PIRGs emerged in the early 1970s on U.S. college campuses. The PIRG model was proposed in the book Action for a Change by Ralph Nader and Donald Ross.[tpl]cite book|last=Nader|first=Ralph|title=Action for a Change: A Student's Manual for Public Interest Organizing|year=1972|publisher=Grossman Publishers|location=New York|coauthors=Donald Ross[/tpl] 
Among other early accomplishments, the PIRGs were responsible for much of the Container Container Deposit Legislation in the United States, also known as "bottle bills."[tpl]cite web |publisher=Boston College |url=http://newspapers.bc.edu/cgi-bin/bostonsh?a=d&d=bcheights19750922.2.30|title=PIRG Backs "Bottle Bill"|accessdate=2013-08-23[/tpl][tpl]cite web |publisher=Sun Sentinal |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1991-11-08/news/9102150529_1_bottle-bill-beverage-containers-industry-recycling-program|title=Bottle Bill Beverage Containers Recycling Program|accessdate=2013-08-23[/tpl]
