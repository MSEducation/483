In late May 2012, the revised plan was forwarded to state water ministers.[tpl]Cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/rural/news/content/201205/s3512350.htm |title=Murray-Darling plan delivered to states |author=Anna Vidot and rural reporters |accessdate=29 May 2012 |date=28 May 2012 |work=ABC Rural |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation [/tpl] It did not alter the recommendation to cut 2,750 gigalitres of water entitlements.
Following much negotiation between the Commonwealth and State governments and numerous submissions from interested stakeholders and the community,the Basin Plan finally became law in November 2012 and can now be implemented.

====Sustainability and risks====

Although the MDBPG is a positive step towards sustainability the measures keep a significant risk of human activities exacerbating the drought risk (see River Murray which has only dried up twice since records began). The Environmental Water Requirement found that a reduction in allocations of 7600gl (per year) is required to be certain that the river systems would maintain their health to have baby rivers
. However objectors cite socio-economic impacts of major cutbacks to the widescale farming (and in some areas wine-growing) in the basin, and conclude that within plans for population growth, particularly in times of drought, may be a need for sustainable water transportation from new extraction from rivers in the wettest part of the country, the Cape York Peninsula or more desalination.
