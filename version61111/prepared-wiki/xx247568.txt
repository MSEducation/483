Paul "Wine" Jones (July 1, 1946 â€“ October 9, 2005) was an American contemporary blues guitarist and singer.[tpl]cite web|author=Richard Skelly |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/paul-wine-jones-mn0000021699/biography |title=Paul "Wine" Jones | Biography |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2014-01-28[/tpl]
One commentator noted that Jones, R. L. Burnside, Big Jack Johnson, Roosevelt "Booba" Barnes and James "Super Chikan" Johnson were "present-day exponents of an edgier, electrified version of the raw, uncut Delta blues sound."

==Biography==

Jones was born in Flora, Mississippi, and learned to play guitar by the age of four. In his teens he played at house parties, and later worked with James "Son" Thomas and harmonica player Willie Foster.[tpl]cite news |first= |last= |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2005/oct/14/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries1|title=Obituary by Tony Russell |publisher=Guardian.co.uk|accessdate=December 22, 2009 | location=London | date=October 14, 2005[/tpl] However, Jones played music mainly as a pastime, while working on farms up to 1971, when he became a welder in Belzoni, Mississippi. 
In 1995 and 1996, Jones performed outside of Mississippi, when he was a member of Fat Possum's "Mississippi Juke Joint Caravan". His 1995 debut album, Mule, was produced by the music critic Robert Palmer. On the album he was accompanied by drummer Sam Carr, and guitarist Big Jack Johnson. Fat Possum (an independent record label in Oxford, Mississippi), as well as managing the latter careers of Junior Kimbrough and R. L. Burnside, gave opportunity to a number of amateurs, mostly from rural Mississippi, who had seldom or never recorded before. Some, such as T-Model Ford and Asie Payton, moved on to higher billing, but others such as Jones, were left on the sidelines.
Jones died of cancer, at the age of 59, in Jackson, Mississippi, in October 2005.[tpl]cite web|url=http://blog.wfmu.org/freeform/2005/10/paul_wine_jones.html |title=Paul "Wine" Jones R.I.P. - WFMU's Beware of the Blog |publisher=Blog.wfmu.org |date=2005-10-10 |accessdate=2014-01-28[/tpl]
