[[Partita for Violin No. 2 (Bach)]]

CATEGORIES: Suites by Johann Sebastian Bach, Solo violin pieces

The Partita in D minor for solo violin (BWV 1004) by Johann Sebastian Bach was written during 1717–1723. Professor Helga Thoene suggests that this partita, and especially its last movement, was a tombeau written in memory of Bach's first wife, Maria Barbara Bach (who died in 1720), though this theory is controversial. The partita contains five movements, given in Italian as:These movements are more frequently listed by their French names on recordings and in some references[tpl]Weasel-inline|date=January 2013[/tpl] as Allemande, Courante, Sarabande, Gigue, and Chaconne.

==The Ciaccona==

The ciaccona (commonly called by the French form of the word, chaconne), the concluding movement of Partita No. 2 in D minor, BWV 1004, surpasses the duration of the previous four movements combined. Along with its disproportional relationship to the rest of the suite, it merits the emphasis given it by musicians and composers alike. The theme, presented in the first four measures in typical chaconne rhythm with a chord progression based on the repeated bass note pattern D D C[tpl]music|sharp[/tpl] D B[tpl]music|flat[/tpl] G A D, begets the rest of the movement in a series of variations. The overall form is tripartite, the middle section of which is in major mode. It represents the pinnacle of the solo violin repertoire in that it covers every aspect of violin playing known during Bach's time. It is still one of the most technically and musically demanding pieces for the instrument.[tpl]or|date=January 2013[/tpl]
Yehudi Menuhin calls the Chaconne "the greatest structure for solo violin that exists".Autobiography Unfinished Journey, p. 236
Violinist Joshua Bell has said the Chaconne is "not just one of the greatest pieces of music ever written, but one of the greatest achievements of any man in history. It's a spiritually powerful piece, emotionally powerful, structurally perfect." He played the piece busking in L'Enfant Plaza for the Washington Post.Weingarten, Gene. "Pearls Before Breakfast".

===Piano transcriptions===

Since Bach's time, several different transcriptions of the piece have been made for other instruments, particularly for the piano (by Ferruccio Busoni and Joachim Raff), and for the piano left-hand (by Brahms).
Johannes Brahms, in a letter to Clara Schumann, said about the ciaccona:
Felix Mendelssohn and Robert Schumann each wrote piano accompaniments for the work.

===Organ transcriptions===

In the preface to his 1955 transcription, John Cook writes: "The Chaconne is sublimely satisfying in its original form, yet many will agree that a single violin is only able to hint at the vast implications of much of this music ... It is perhaps not unreasonable to suppose that Bach would have chosen the organ, had he transcribed the Chaconne himself, as the instrument best suited to the scale of his ideas ... A good performance on the violin may be taken as the best guide to interpretation on the organ — the two instruments are not without their points in common, and both were beloved of Bach."
The earliest version for organ is by William Thomas Best. Further transcriptions are by John Cook, Wilhelm Middelschulte, Walter Henry Goss-Custard (1915–55), and Henri Messerer (1838–1923).
