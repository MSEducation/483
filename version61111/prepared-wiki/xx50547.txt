[[Flight dynamics (fixed-wing aircraft)]]

CATEGORIES: Aerospace engineering, Aerodynamics, Avionics

Flight dynamics is the science of air vehicle orientation and control in three dimensions. The three critical flight dynamics parameters are the angles of rotation in three dimensions about the vehicle's  center of mass, known as pitch, roll and yaw (quite different from their use as Tait-Bryan angles).
Aerospace engineers develop control systems for a vehicle's orientation (attitude) about its center of mass. The control systems include actuators, which exert forces in various directions, and generate rotational forces or moments about the aerodynamic center of the aircraft, and thus rotate the aircraft in pitch, roll, or yaw.  For example, a pitching moment is a vertical force applied at a distance forward or aft from the aerodynamic center of the aircraft, causing the aircraft to pitch up or down.
Roll, pitch and yaw refer to rotations about the respective axes starting from a defined equilibrium state.  The equilibrium roll angle is known as wings level or zero bank angle, equivalent to a level heeling angle on a ship. Yaw is known as "heading".  The equilibrium pitch angle in submarine and airship parlance is known as "trim", but in aircraft, this usually refers to angle of attack, rather than orientation.  However, common usage ignores this distinction between equilibrium and dynamic cases.
The most common aeronautical convention defines the roll as acting about the longitudinal axis, positive with the starboard (right) wing down.  The yaw is about the vertical body axis, positive with the nose to starboard. Pitch is about an axis perpendicular to the longitudinal plane of symmetry, positive nose up.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl]
A fixed-wing aircraft increases or decreases the lift generated by the wings when it pitches nose up or down by increasing or decreasing the angle of attack (AOA). The roll angle is also known as bank angle on a fixed-wing aircraft, which usually "banks" to change the horizontal direction of flight. An aircraft is usually streamlined from nose to tail to reduce drag making it typically advantageous to keep the sideslip angle near zero, though there are instances when an aircraft may be deliberately "sideslipped" for example a slip in a fixed-wing aircraft.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl]

==Introduction==

===Reference frames===

Three right-handed, Cartesian coordinate systems see frequent use in flight dynamics. The first coordinate system has an origin fixed in the reference frame of the Earth:
In many flight dynamics applications, the Earth frame is assumed to be inertial with a flat xE,yE-plane, though the Earth frame can also be considered a spherical coordinate system with origin at the center of the Earth.
The other two reference frames are body-fixed, with origins moving along with the aircraft, typically at the center of gravity. For an aircraft that is symmetric from right-to-left, the frames can be defined as:
Asymmetric aircraft have analogous body-fixed frames, but different conventions must be used to choose the precise directions of the x and z axes.
The Earth frame is a convenient frame to express aircraft translational and rotational kinematics. The Earth frame is also useful in that, under certain assumptions, it can be approximated as inertial. Additionally, one force acting on the aircraft, weight, is fixed in the +zE direction.
The body frame is often of interest because the origin and the axes remain fixed relative to the aircraft. This means that the relative orientation of the Earth and body frames describes the aircraft attitude. Also, the direction of the force of thrust is generally fixed in the body frame, though some aircraft can vary this direction, for example by thrust vectoring.
The wind frame is a convenient frame to express the aerodynamic forces and moments acting on an aircraft. In particular, the net aerodynamic force can be divided into components along the wind frame axes, with the drag force in the −xw direction and the lift force in the −zw direction.
In addition to defining the reference frames, the relative orientation of the reference frames can be determined. The relative orientation can be expressed in a variety of forms, including:
The various Euler angles relating the three reference frames are important to flight dynamics. Many Euler angle conventions exist, but all of the rotation sequences presented below use the z-y'-x" convention. This convention corresponds to a type of Tait-Bryan angles, which are commonly referred to as Euler angles. This convention is described in detail below for the roll, pitch, and yaw Euler angles that describe the body frame orientation relative to the Earth frame. The other sets of Euler angles are described below by analogy.
To transform from the Earth frame to the body frame using Euler angles, the following rotations are done in the order prescribed. First, rotate the Earth frame axes xE and yE around the zE axis by the yaw angle ψ. This results in an intermediate reference frame with axes denoted x[tpl]'[/tpl],y[tpl]'[/tpl],z[tpl]'[/tpl], where z'=zE. Second, rotate the x[tpl]'[/tpl] and z[tpl]'[/tpl] axes around the y[tpl]'[/tpl] axis by the pitch angle θ. This results in another intermediate reference frame with axes denoted x",y",z", where y"=y[tpl]'[/tpl]. Finally, rotate the y" and z" axes around the x" axis by the roll angle φ. The reference frame that results after the three rotations is the body frame.
Based on the rotations and axes conventions above, the yaw angle ψ is the angle between north and the projection of the aircraft longitudinal axis onto the horizontal plane, the pitch angle θ is the angle between the aircraft longitudinal axis and horizontal, and the roll angle φ represents a rotation around the aircraft longitudinal axis after rotating by yaw and pitch.
To transform from the Earth frame to the wind frame, the three Euler angles are the bank angle μ, the flight path angle γ, and the heading angle σ. When performing the rotations described above to obtain the wind frame from the Earth frame, (μ,γ,σ) are analogous to (φ,θ,ψ), respectively. The heading angle σ is the angle between north and the horizontal component of the velocity vector, which describes which direction the aircraft is moving relative to cardinal directions. The flight path angle γ is the angle between horizontal and the velocity vector, which describes whether the aircraft is climbing or descending. The bank angle μ represents a rotation of the lift force around the velocity vector, which may indicate whether the airplane is turning.
To transform from the wind frame to the body frame, the two Euler angles are the angle of attack α and the sideslip angle β. When performing the rotations described earlier to obtain the body frame from the wind frame, (α,β) are analogous to (θ,ψ), respectively; the angle analogous to φ in this transformation is always zero. The sideslip angle β is the angle between the velocity vector and the projection of the aircraft longitudinal axis onto the xw,zw-plane, which describes whether there is a lateral component to the aircraft velocity, also known as sideslip.  The angle of attack α is the angle between the xw,yw-plane and the aircraft longitudinal axis and, among other things, is an important variable in determining the magnitude of the force of lift.

===Design cases===

In analyzing the stability of an aircraft, it is usual to consider perturbations about a nominal equilibrium position. So the analysis would be applied, for example, assuming:
The speed, height and trim angle of attack are different for each flight condition, in addition, the aircraft will be configured differently, e.g. at low speed flaps may be deployed and the undercarriage may be down.
Except for asymmetric designs (or symmetric designs at significant sideslip), the longitudinal equations of motion (involving pitch and lift forces) may be treated independently of the lateral motion (involving roll and yaw).
The following considers perturbations about a nominal straight and level flight path.
To keep the analysis (relatively) simple, the control surfaces are assumed fixed throughout the motion, this is stick-fixed stability. Stick-free analysis requires the further complication of taking the motion of the control surfaces into account.
Furthermore, the flight is assumed to take place in still air, and the aircraft is treated as a rigid body.

==Aerodynamic and propulsive forces==

===Aerodynamic forces===

====Components of the aerodynamic force====

The expression to calculate the aerodynamic force is:
where:
projected on wind axes we obtain:
where:

====Aerodynamic coefficients====

It is necessary to know Cp and Cf in every point on the considered surface.

====Dimensionless parameters and aerodynamic regimes====

In absence of thermal effects, there are three remarkable dimensionless numbers:
where:
According to λ there are three possible rarefaction grades and their corresponding motions are called:
The motion of a body through a flow is considered, in flight dynamics, as continuum current. In the outer layer of the space that surrounds the body viscosity will be negligible. However viscosity effects will have to be considered when analysing the flow in the nearness of the boundary layer.
Depending on the compressibility of the flow, different kinds of currents can be considered:

====Drag coefficient equation and aerodynamic efficiency====

If the geometry of the body is fixed and in case of symmetric flight (β=0 and Q=0), pressure and friction coefficients are functions depending on:
where:
Under these conditions, drag and lift coefficient are functions depending exclusively on the angle of attack of the body and Mach and Reynolds numbers. Aerodynamic efficiency, defined as the relation between lift and drag coefficients, will depend on those parameters as well.
It is also possible to get the dependency of the drag coefficient respect to the lift coefficient. This relation is known as the drag coefficient equation:
The aerodynamic efficiency has a maximum value, Emax, respect to CL where the tangent line from the coordinate origin touches the drag coefficient equation plot.
The drag coefficient, CD, can be decomposed in two ways. First typical decomposition separates pressure and friction effects:
There's a second typical decomposition taking into account the definition of the drag coefficient equation. This decomposition separates the effect of the lift coefficient in the equation, obtaining two terms CD0 and CDi. CD0 is known as the parasitic drag coefficient and it is the base draft coefficient at zero lift. CDi is known as the induced drag coefficient and it is produced by the body lift.

====Parabolic and generic drag coefficient====

A good attempt for the induced drag coefficient is to assume a parabolic dependency of the lift
Aerodynamic efficiency is now calculated as:
If the configuration of the pane is symmetrical respect to the XY plane, minimum drag coefficient equals to the parasitic drag of the plane.
In case the configuration is asymmetrical respect to the XY plane, however, minimum flag differs from the parasitic drag. On these cases, a new approximate parabolic drag equation can be traced leaving the minimum drag value at zero lift value.

====Variation of parameters with the Mach number====

The Coefficient of pressure varies with Mach number by the relation given below:[tpl]cite book|last=Anderson|first=John D.|title=Introduction to flight|year=2005|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=Boston u.a.|isbn=9780071238182|edition=5. ed., internat. ed.|pages=274–275[/tpl]
where
This relation is reasonably accurate for 0.3 
====Aerodynamic force in a specified atmosphere====

===Propulsive forces===

The major propulsive forces acting on an airplane are: thrust, drag, lift and weight of the airplane itself. For the airplane to be in equilibrium, drag should be equal to thrust and lift should be equal to weight of the airplane.

===Features and selection of the propeller===

==Performances==

==Static stability and control==

===Longitudinal static stability===

see Longitudinal static stability

==Directional stability==

Directional or weathercock stability is concerned with the static stability of the airplane about the z axis. Just as in the case of longitudinal stability it is desirable that the aircraft should tend to return to an equilibrium condition when subjected to some form of yawing disturbance. For this the slope of the yawing moment curve must be positive.
An airplane possessing this mode of stability will always point towards the relative wind, hence the name weathercock stability.

==Dynamic stability and control==

===Longitudinal modes===

It is common practice to derive a fourth order characteristic equation to describe the longitudinal motion, and then factorize it approximately into a high frequency mode and a low frequency mode. The approach adopted here is using qualitative knowledge of aircraft behavior to simplify the equations from the outset, reaching the result by a more accessible route.
The two longitudinal motions (modes) are called the short period pitch oscillation (SPPO), and the phugoid.

====Short-period pitch oscillation====

A short input (in control systems terminology an impulse) in pitch (generally via the elevator in a standard configuration fixed-wing aircraft) will generally lead to overshoots about the trimmed condition. The transition is characterized by a damped simple harmonic motion about the new trim. There is very little change in the trajectory over the time it takes for the oscillation to damp out.
Generally this oscillation is high frequency (hence short period) and is damped over a period of a few seconds. A real-world example would involve a pilot selecting a new climb attitude, for example 5º nose up from the original attitude. A short, sharp pull back on the control column may be used, and will generally lead to oscillations about the new trim condition. If the oscillations are poorly damped the aircraft will take a long period of time to settle at the new condition, potentially leading to Pilot-induced oscillation. If the short period mode is unstable it will generally be impossible for the pilot to safely control the aircraft for any period of time.
where m is the mass.
But the forces are generated by the pressure distribution on the body, and are referred to the velocity vector. But the velocity (wind) axes set is not an inertial frame so we must resolve the fixed axes forces into wind axes.  Also, we are only concerned with the force along the z-axis:
Or:
In words, the wind axes force is equal to the centripetal acceleration.
The moment equation is the time derivative of the angular momentum:
where M is the pitching moment, and B is the moment of inertia about the pitch axis.
The equations of motion, with all forces and moments referred to wind axes are, therefore:
Since the tail is operating in the flowfield of the wing, changes in the wing incidence cause changes in the downwash, but there is a delay for the change in wing flowfield to affect the tail lift, this is represented as a moment proportional to the rate of change of incidence:
The equations of motion, with small perturbation forces and moments become:
This represents a damped simple harmonic motion.

====Phugoid====

which means the centripetal force is equal to the perturbation in lift force.
For the speed, resolving along the trajectory:
The equations of motion become:
These may be expressed as a second order equation in climb angle or speed perturbation:
Now lift is very nearly equal to weight:
The period of the phugoid, T, is obtained from the coefficient of u:
Or:
Since the lift is very much greater than the drag, the phugoid is at best lightly damped. A propeller with fixed speed would help. Heavy damping of the pitch rotation or a large rotational inertia increase the coupling between short period and phugoid modes, so that these will modify the phugoid.

===Lateral modes===

With a symmetrical rocket or missile, the directional stability in yaw is the same as the pitch stability; it resembles the short period pitch oscillation, with yaw plane equivalents to the pitch plane stability derivatives.  For this reason pitch and yaw directional stability are collectively known as the "weathercock" stability of the missile.
Aircraft lack the symmetry between pitch and yaw, so that directional stability in yaw is derived from a different set of stability derivatives. The yaw plane equivalent to the short period pitch oscillation, which describes yaw plane directional stability is called Dutch roll. Unlike pitch plane motions, the lateral modes involve both roll and yaw motion.

====Dutch roll====

It is customary to derive the equations of motion by formal manipulation in what, to the engineer, amounts to a piece of mathematical sleight of hand. The current approach follows the pitch plane analysis in formulating the equations in terms of concepts which are reasonably familiar.
Applying an impulse via the rudder pedals should induce Dutch roll, which is the oscillation in roll and yaw, with the roll motion lagging yaw by a quarter cycle, so that the wing tips follow elliptical paths with respect to the aircraft.
The yaw plane translational equation, as in the pitch plane, equates the centripetal acceleration to the side force.
The moment equations are a bit trickier. The trim condition is with the aircraft at an angle of attack with respect to the airflow. The body x-axis does not align with the velocity vector, which is the reference direction for wind axes. In other words, wind axes are not principal axes (the mass is not distributed symmetrically about the yaw and roll axes). Consider the motion of an element of mass in position -z, x in the direction of the y-axis, i.e. into the plane of the paper.
If the roll rate is p, the velocity of the particle is:
Made up of two terms, the force on this particle is first the proportional to rate of v change, the second is due to the change in direction of this component of velocity as the body moves. The latter terms gives rise to cross products of small quantities (pq, pr,qr), which are later discarded.  In this analysis, they are discarded from the outset for the sake of clarity. In effect, we assume that the direction of the velocity of the particle due to the simultaneous roll and yaw rates does not change significantly throughout the motion.  With this simplifying assumption, the acceleration of the particle becomes:
The yawing moment is given by:
The yawing moment is found by summing over all particles of the body:
where N is the yawing moment, E is a product of inertia, and C is the moment of inertia about the yaw axis.
A similar reasoning yields the roll equation:
where L is the rolling moment and A the roll moment of inertia.

====Lateral and longitudinal stability derivatives====

Roll rate causes incidence at the fin, which generates a corresponding side force.  Also, positive roll (starboard wing down) increases the lift on the starboard wing and reduces it on the port. If the wing has dihedral, this will result in a side force momentarily opposing the resultant sideslip tendency. Anhedral wing and or stabilizer configurations can cause the sign of the side force to invert if the fin effect is swamped.
Yawing generates side forces due to incidence at the rudder, fin and fuselage.
A positive sideslip angle generates empennage incidence which can cause positive or negative roll moment depending on its configuration.  For any non-zero sideslip angle dihedral wings causes a rolling moment which tends to return the aircraft to the horizontal, as does back swept wings.  With highly swept wings the resultant rolling moment may be excessive for all stability requirements and anhedral could be used to offset the effect of wing sweep induced rolling moment.
Yaw increases the speed of the outboard wing whilst reducing speed of the inboard one, causing a rolling moment to the inboard side.  The contribution of the fin normally supports this inward rolling effect unless offset by anhedral stabilizer above the roll axis (or dihedral below the roll axis).

====Equations of motion====

Since Dutch roll is a handling mode, analogous to the short period pitch oscillation, any effect it might have on the trajectory may be ignored.  The body rate r is made up of the rate of change of sideslip angle and the rate of turn. Taking the latter as zero, assuming no effect on the trajectory, for the limited purpose of studying the Dutch roll:
The yaw and roll equations, with the stability derivatives become:
The inertial moment due to the roll acceleration is considered small compared with the aerodynamic terms, so the equations become:
This becomes a second order equation governing either roll rate or sideslip:
Stability requires the "stiffness" and "damping" terms to be positive. These are:
The damping term is dominated by the product of the roll damping and the yaw damping derivatives, these are both negative, so their product is positive.  The Dutch roll should therefore be damped.

====Roll subsidence====

Jerking the stick sideways and returning it to center causes a net change in roll orientation.
The roll motion is characterized by an absence of natural stability, there are no stability derivatives which generate moments in response to the inertial roll angle. A roll disturbance induces a roll rate which is only canceled by pilot or autopilot intervention. This takes place with insignificant changes in sideslip or yaw rate, so the equation of motion reduces to:

====Spiral mode====

Simply holding the stick still, when starting with the wings near level, an aircraft will usually have a tendency to gradually veer off to one side of the straight flightpath.  This is the (slightly unstable)  spiral mode.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2011[/tpl]

=====Spiral mode trajectory=====

where g is the gravitational acceleration, and U is the speed.
Including the stability derivatives:
The sideslip and roll rate vary gradually, so their time derivatives are ignored. The yaw and roll equations reduce to:
Substituting for sideslip and roll rate in the force equation results in a first order equation in roll angle:
Since the spiral mode has a long time constant, the pilot can intervene to effectively stabilize it, but an aircraft with an unstable Dutch roll would be difficult to fly.  It is usual to design the aircraft with a stable Dutch roll mode, but slightly unstable spiral mode.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2010[/tpl]
