"Why Angels Cry" was the Cypriot entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 2006, performed in English by Annet Artani.

==Style and lyrical content==

The song is a ballad, with Artani asking why difficulties occur in the world. In an interview, Artani explained that angels cry for many reasons and that her song was about finding peace around the world and ending sadness and pain. She pointed to the September 11, 2001 attack on the World Trade Center in New York City as the inspiration for the song and revealed that she was supposed to sing at the Windows on the World restaurant on the top floor later that day. Overall, she emphasized that the song symbolized the people who died during the September 11 attacks and also everyone who suffers around the world.

==Eurovision==

As Cyprus had finished outside the top ten in their previous Contest appearance, the song was performed in the semi-final. Here it was performed ninth, following Ireland's Brian Kennedy with "Every Song Is a Cry for Love" and preceding Monaco's SÃ©verine Ferrer with "La Coco-Dance". At the close of voting, it had received 57 points, placing 15th in a field of 23 and requiring Cyprus to qualify through the semi-final at their next Contest appearance.
Prior to the Contest, opinion was divided on the merits of the song. Many fans argued that it was a low-quality entry, while some described it as a "simple, heart-felt song". Criticisms were also raised about the line "innocent children die", with many fans contending that a song with such a pessimistic attitude had no place at the Contest. However other criticisms favored the song as well as Annet's rich vocal talent similar to many other black international music divas.
