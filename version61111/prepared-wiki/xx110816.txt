The Alkonost is, according to Russian mythos and folklore, a creature with the body of a bird but the head of a beautiful woman. It makes sounds that are amazingly beautiful, and those who hear these sounds forget everything they know and want nothing more ever again.[tpl]cite book|title=Mythical Beasts|year=2007|publisher=innovativeKids|pages=23[/tpl] She lives in the underworld with her counterpart the sirin.[tpl]cite book|title=The Element Encyclopedia of Magical Creatures |last=Matthews |first=John |author2=Caitl√≠n Matthews |year=2005 |publisher=HarperElement |isbn=978-1-4351-1086-1 |page=16 |accessdate=July 12, 2012[/tpl] The alkonost lays her eggs on a beach and then rolls them into the sea. When the alkonost's eggs hatch, a thunderstorm sets in and the sea becomes so rough that it is untravelable. The name of the alkonost came from a Greek demigoddess whose name was Alcyone. In Greek mythology, Alcyone was transformed by the gods into a kingfisher.[tpl]cite web|last=Nina|first=Lena G.|title=Everything Slavic Related|url=http://slavic.tumblr.com/post/3618946836/the-alkonost-is-a-legendary-bird-in-slavic|publisher=Tumblr[/tpl]
