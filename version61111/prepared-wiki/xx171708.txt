[[Red Shoes (Muskogean chief)]]

CATEGORIES: Muscogee people, 1783 deaths, Year of birth uncertain

Red Shoes (born about 1720http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=familyties&id=I31314#s1) was a Muskogean leader in the 18th Century.  He primarily lived in modern Alabama but his influence extended well into modern Mississippi.
Red Shoes was the son of Jean Baptiste Louis DeCourtel Marchand and his Muskogee wife Sehoy.  Since lineage among the Muskogee was traced matrilineally, Red Shoes, like his mother, was part of the Wind Clan. However, some sources say that Red Shoes was the son of Sehoy's second husband Red Shoes (Choctaw chief).Sehoy genealogy
His sister, also named Sehoy, was the mother of Alexander McGillivray.  In proper Muskogean tradition, Red Shoes raised Alexander in as if he were his own son.  However, since Red Shoes's own children were members of their mother's clan, Alexander was Red Shoes's heir.
Red Shoes died about 1783.
