[[Source of Labor]]

CATEGORIES: American hip hop groups, Musical groups from Washington (state)

Source of Labor was a rap band loosely associated with the female rap act Beyond Reality, both of which performed at the all day Rap Festival (featuring 30 or more of the top regional rap/hip-hop acts of that time). The event much like Lollapolooza, was strictly Rap and was called "Phunky Phat 95." It took place at the Evergreen State College during the summer of 1995.
Source of Labor's contributions to Northwest hip hop were extremely influential in shaping post-Nastmix hip-hop. Some credit the group's front man, Wordsayer, with personally moving hip-hop out of Seattle's Central District and into the rest of the city.
