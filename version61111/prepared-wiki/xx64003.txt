Krisse Salminen (born Heidi Kristiina Salminen 28 May 1976 in Hollola, Finland) is a Finnish stand-up comedian and television talkshow hostess. She is the daughter of gameshow host Reijo Salminen.

She is one of the central figures of the burgeoning Finnish stand-up scene.
She made an appearance in the Eurovision Song Contest 2007 as a guest host and green room reporter. She has had TV shows called Krisse Show and Krisse Road Show. She is appearing on the 2012 series of Tanssii t√§htien kanssa, the Finnish version of Strictly Come Dancing, with professional partner Matti Puro. She just won with 57% of the vote.
