Shangdu ([tpl]IPA-cmn|ʂɑ̂ŋ tú[/tpl]), also known as Xanadu ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|z|æ|n|.|ə|.|d|uː|[/tpl]; Mongolian: [tpl]Unicode|Šandu[/tpl]), was the capital of Kublai Khan's Yuan Dynasty in China, before he decided to move his throne to the Jin Dynasty capital of Zhōngdū ([tpl]zh|c=[tpl]linktext|中|都[/tpl][/tpl]), which he renamed Dàdū, present-day Beijing.  It then became his summer capital. Xanadu was visited by the Venetian traveller Marco Polo in about 1275, and in 1797 inspired the famous poem Kubla Khan by the English Romantic poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge.

==Description==

Shangdu was located in what is now called Inner Mongolia, [tpl]convert|350|km|mi[/tpl] north of Beijing, about [tpl]convert|28|km|mi[/tpl] northwest of the modern town of Duolun. The layout of the capital is roughly square shaped with sides of about 2,200 m; it consists of an "outer city", and an "inner city" in the southeast of the capital which has also roughly a square layout with sides about 1,400 m, and the palace, where Kublai Khan stayed in summer. The palace has sides of roughly 550 m, covering an area of around 40% the size of the Forbidden City in Beijing. The most visible modern-day remnants are the earthen walls though there is also a ground-level, circular brick platform in the centre of the inner enclosure.
The city, originally named Kaiping ([tpl]linktext|开平[/tpl], Kāipíng), was designed by Chinese architect Liu Bingzhong from 1252 to 1256,[tpl]cite web|url=http://etcweb.princeton.edu/asianart/timeperiod_china.jsp?ctry=China&pd=Yuan|title=Yuan dynasty|publisher=Princeton University Art Museum[/tpl] and Liu implemented a "profoundly Chinese scheme for the city's architecture".[tpl]cite book|title=Chinese imperial city planning|author=Nancy Shatzman Steinhardt|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=1999|page=153|isbn=0-8248-2196-3|quote=Liu Bingzhong implemented a preconceived and profoundly Chinese scheme for the city's architecture.[/tpl] In 1264 it was renamed Shangdu. At its zenith, over 100,000 people lived within its walls. In 1369 Shangdu was occupied by the Ming army and put to the torch. The last reigning Khan, Toghun Temür, fled the city, which was abandoned for several hundred years.[tpl]cite book|last=Man|first=John|title=Kublai Khan: From Xanadu to Superpower|year=2006|publisher=Bantam Books|location=London|isbn=9780553817188|pages=104–119[/tpl]
In 1872, Steven Bushell, affiliated with the British Legation in Beijing, visited the site and reported that remains of temples, blocks of marble, and tiles were still to be found there. By the 1990s, all these artifacts were completely gone, most likely collected by the inhabitants of the nearby town of Dolon Nor to construct their houses. The artwork is still seen in the walls of some Dolon Nor buildings.
Today, only ruins remain, surrounded by a grassy mound that was once the city walls. Since 2002, a restoration effort has been undertaken. In June 2012, Shangdu was made a World Heritage Site.Xanadu (China), Bassari Country (Senegal) and Grand Bassam (Côte d’Ivoire) added to UNESCO’s World Heritage List

==Description by Marco Polo (1278)==

The Venetian explorer Marco Polo is widely believed to have visited Shangdu in about 1275. In about 1298–99, he dictated the following account, one of the most complete descriptions of the city as it existed:

==Description by Toghon Temur (1368)==

The lament of Toghon Temur Khan (the "Ukhaant Khan" or "Sage Khan"), concerning the loss of Daidu (Beijing) and Heibun Shanduu (Kaiping Xanadu) in 1368, is recorded in many Mongolian historical chronicles. The Altan Tobchi version is translated as follows:

"My Daidu, straight and wonderfully made of various jewels of different kinds
My Yellow Steppe of Xanadu, the summer residence of ancient Khans
My cool and pleasant Kaiping Xanadu
My dear Daidu that I've lost on the year of the bald red rabbit
Your pleasant mist when on early mornings I ascended to the heights!
Lagan and Ibagu made it known to me, the Sage Khan.
In full knowledge I let go of dear Daidu
Nobles born foolish cared not for their state
I was left alone weeping
I became like a calf left behind on its native pastures
My eight-sided white stupa made of various precious objects
My City of Daidu made of the nine jewels
Where I sat holding the reputation of the Great Nation
My great square City of Daidu with four gates
Where I sat holding the reputation of the Forty Tumen Mongols
My dear City of Daidu, the iron stair has been broken.
My reputation!
My precious Daidu, from where I surveyed and observed
The Mongols of every place.
My city with no winter residence to spend the winter
My summer residence of Kaiping Xanadu
My pleasant Yellow Steppe
My deadly mistake of not heeding the words of Lagan and Ibagu!
The Cane Palace had been established in sanctity
Kublai the Wise Khan spent his summers there!
I have lost Kaiping Xanadu entirely – to China.
An impure bad name has come upon the Sage Khan.
They besieged and took precious Daidu
I have lost the whole of it – to China.
A conflicting bad name has come upon the Sage Khan.
Jewel Daidu was built with many an adornment
In Kaiping Xanadu, I spent the summers in peaceful relaxation
By a hapless error they have been lost – to China.
A circling bad name has come upon the Sage Khan.
The awe-inspiring reputation carried by the Lord Khan
The dear Daidu built by the extraordinary Wise Khan (Kublai)
The bejeweled Hearth City, the revered sanctuary of the entire nation
Dear Daidu
I have lost it all – to China.
The Sage Khan, the reincarnation of all bodhisattvas,
By the destiny willed by Khan Tengri (King Heaven) has lost dear Daidu,
Lost the Golden Palace of the Wise Khan (Kublai), who is the reincarnation of all the gods,
Who is the golden seed of Genghis Khan the son of Khan Tengri (King Heaven).
I hid the Jade Seal of the Lord Khan in my sleeve and left (the city)
Fighting through a multitude of enemies, I broke through and left.
From the fighters may Buqa-Temur Chinsan for ten thousand generations
Become a Khan in the golden line of the Lord Khan.
Caught unaware I have lost dear Daidu.
When I left home, it was then that the jewel of religion and doctrine was left behind.
In the future may wise and enlightened bodhisattvas take heed and understand.
May it go around and establish itself
On the Golden Lineage of Genghis Khan."[tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl]

==Samuel Purchas (1625)==

In 1614,  the English clergyman Samuel Purchas published Purchas his Pilgrimage – or Relations of the world and the Religions observed in all ages and places discovered, from the Creation unto this Present.  This book contained a brief description of Shangdu, based on the early description of Marco Polo:
 "In Xandu did Cublai Can build a stately Pallace, encompassing sixteen miles of plaine ground with a wall, wherein are fertile Meddowes, pleasant Springs, delightfull streames, and all sorts of beasts of chase and game, and in the middest thereof a sumpuous house of pleasure, which may be moved from place to place."http://www.archive.org/details/purchashispilgri00purc   Samuel Purchas, Purchas his Pilgrimage,  the Fourth Book, chapter 13, page 415. digital version from the copy owned by John Adams in the Boston Public Library. 
In 1625 Purchas published an expanded edition of this book, recounting the voyages of famous travellers, called Purchas his Pilgrimes.  The eleventh volume of this book included a more detailed description of Shangdu, attributed to Marco Polo and dated 1320:
 "This Citie is three dayes journey Northeastward to the Citie Xandu, which the Chan Cublai now reigning built; erecting therein a marvellous and artificiall Palace of Marble and other stones, which abutteth on the wall on one side, and the midst of the Citie on the other. He included sixteene miles within the circuit of the wall on that side where the Palace abutteth on the Citie wall, into which none can enter but by the Palace. In this enclosure or Parke are goodly meadows, springs, rivers, red and fallow Deere, Fawnes carrying thither for the Hawkes (of whom are three mewed above two hundred Gerfalcons which he goeth once a week to see) and he often useth one Leopard or more, sitting on Horses, which he setteth upon the Stagges and Deere, and having taken the beast, giveth it to the Gerfalcons, and in beholding this spectacle he taketh wonderful delight.  In the middest in a faire wood he hath a royall House on pillars gilded and varnished, on every inch of which is a Dragon all gilt, which windeth his tayle about the pillar, which his head bearing up the loft, as also with his wings displayed on both sides; the cover also is of Reeds gilt and varnished, so that the rayne can doe it no injury; the reeds being three handfuls thick and ten yards log, split from knot to knot. The house itselfe also may be sundered, and taken downe like a Tent and erected again. For it is sustained, when it is set up, with two hundred silken cordes. Great Chan useth to dwell there three moneths in the yeare, to wit, in June, July and August.Hakluytus posthumus or Purchas his Pilgrimes, contayning a history of the world in sea voyages and lande travels by Englishmen and others, Volume 11.

==Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1797)==

In 1797, according to his own account, the English poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge was reading about Shangdu in Purchas his Pilgrimage, fell asleep, and had an opium-inspired dream. The dream caused him to begin the poem known as 'Kubla Khan'.  Unfortunately Coleridge's writing was interrupted by an unnamed "man from Porlock", causing him to forget much of the dream, but his images of Shangdu became one of the best-known poems in the English language.
Coleridge described how he wrote the poem in the preface to his collection of poems, Christabel, Kubla Khan, and the Pains of Sleep, published in 1816:
 <blockquote>"In the summer of the year 1797, the Author, then in ill health, had retired to a lonely farm-house between Porlock and Linton, on the Exmoor confines of Somerset and Devonshire. In consequence of a slight indisposition, an anodyne had been prescribed, from the effects of which he fell asleep in his chair at the moment that he was reading the following sentence, or words of the same substance, in 'Purchas's Pilgrimage':
Here the Khan Kubla commanded a palace to be built, and a stately garden thereunto. And thus ten miles of fertile ground were inclosed with a wall.
The Author continued for about three hours in a profound sleep, at least of the external senses, during which time he has the most vivid confidence, that he could not have composed less than from two to three hundred lines; if that indeed can be called composition in which all the images rose up before him as things with a parallel production of the correspondent expressions, without any sensation or consciousness of effort. On awakening he appeared to himself to have a distinct recollection of the whole, and taking his pen, ink, and paper, instantly and eagerly wrote down the lines that are here preserved." "A person on business from Porlock" interrupted him and he was never able to recapture more than "some eight or ten scattered lines and images."Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Christabel, Kubla Khan, and the Pains of Sleep, 2nd edition, William Bulmer, London, 1816.
Coleridge's description of Shangdu has echoes of the works of both Marco Polo and Samuel Purchas.  In his description of Shangdu, Marco Polo wrote:
 "...Round this Palace a wall is built, inclosing a compass of sixteen miles, and inside the Park there are fountains and rivers and brooks and beautiful meadows, with all kinds of wild animals (excluding such as are of ferocious nature)...http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Travels_of_Marco_Polo/Book_1/Chapter_61 The Travels of Marco Polo, Book 1/Chapter 61, Of the City of Chandu, and the Kaan's Palace There. from Wikisource, translated by Henry Yule. 
This became, in Purchas's book Purchas his Pilgrimage:
 In Xandu did Cublai Can build a stately Pallace, encompassing sixteen miles of plaine ground with a wall, wherein are fertile Meddowes, pleasant Springs, delightfull streames, and all sorts of beasts of chase and game, and in the middest thereof a sumpuous house of pleasure, which may be moved from place to place. 
This became, in Coleridge's poem:

==Astronomy==

In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) named a continent-sized area of Saturn's moon Titan as Xanadu after it was referred from Coleridge's poem.[tpl]cite web |url=http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Feature/6958 |title=Planetary Names: Albedo Feature: Xanadu on Titan |publisher=IAU[/tpl] Xanadu has raised considerable interest in scientists after its radar image showed its terrain to be quite similar to earth's terrain with flowing rivers (probably of methane and ethane, not of water as they are on Earth), mountains (of ice, not rock) and sand dunes.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/media/cassini-20060719.html |title=Cassini Reveals Titan's Xanadu Region to Be an Earth-Like Land |publisher=NASA[/tpl]

==In popular culture==

Thanks to the poem by Coleridge, Xanadu became a metaphor for splendor and opulence. It was the name of Charles Foster Kane's estate in the film Citizen Kane, and also that of Mandrake the Magician in the long-running comic strip. The title of the 1980 film Xanadu is a reference to Coleridge's poem. This film starred Gene Kelly and Olivia Newton-John and was widely considered a big-budget flop, but its soundtrack spawned several hit singles for Newton-John, such as the number one hit "Magic", a duet with Cliff Richard called "Suddenly", and, with Electric Light Orchestra accompaniment, the title song "Xanadu". ELO had soundtrack hits of their own with "I'm Alive" and "All Over the World".
In the Kurt Vonnegut novel, Timequake, Xanadu is the name of a retreat for prolific writers in a resort on Cape Cod.  Xanadu was featured in the short story by Ray Bradbury called "A Miracle of Rare Device", written in 1962 and republished in 1964 in the collection The Machineries of Joy. The story was later made into a television episode. In Xanadu is a 1989 travel book by William Dalrymple; at the age of 22 he sets off along the Silk Road from Antioch.
In early 1980, Teena Marie had a US R&B top 40 hit with "Behind the Groove" that mentions Xanadu.  In 1968, UK pop/rock group Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Tich had a UK number one hit with "The Legend of Xanadu".  Another known reference to Coleridge's poem is the song "Xanadu" by Canadian rock band Rush in their 1977 album A Farewell to Kings.   In their debut album Welcome to the Pleasuredome which rocketed to rank one in the UK charts in its very first week in 1984, Frankie Goes to Hollywood referred to the poem in the title track. While they changed the poem's starting line In Xanadu did Kubla Khan, A stately pleasure-dome decree to In Xanadu did Kubla Khan, A pleasure-dome erect, they delivered an atmospheric video that interwove contemporary mid-80's youth culture with elements of a fictitious Xanadu themepark.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3eLwieQ4sA |title=Frankie Goes To Hollywood – Welcome To The Pleasuredome Official Music Video |publisher=ZTT Records[/tpl]
In the Japanese light novel and anime series Shakugan no Shana, Xanadu is the name of the paradise to be created by the God of Creation (Snake of the Festival). In the sci-fi/cyberpunk/fantasy novels Otherland by Tad Williams, Paul Jonas passes through a "simworld", or highly realistic simulation, of Xanadu, as described in Coleridge's poem.
Arthur C. Clarke wrote a parody of Coleridge's poem, describing his tumultuous experience co-scripting the film 2001. It goes:Clarke, Arthur. C. (1972), The Lost Worlds of 2001,page 190
