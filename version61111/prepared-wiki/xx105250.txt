Hume-Fogg Academic Magnet High School is a public magnet high school located in downtown Nashville, Tennessee, teaching grades 9-12.http://www.mnps.org/Page471.aspx

==History==

Hume-Fogg's original incarnation, Hume High School, which opened in 1855 on Eighth Avenue (Spruce Street) and Broad, was the first public school in Nashville.
In 1875 Fogg High School became the second public school in Nashville. It was built on the same property as Hume High School, facing Broad Street. In 1912, the two merged into Hume-Fogg at the present site at 700 Broadway, a Tudor Revival building. The building consists of five floors including a basement, which has several tunnels leading to various places around downtown Nashville. However, they are currently boarded off and inaccessible. In 1942 Hume-Fogg was recast as a Technical and Vocational School. It continued in this capacity until the 1982 court-supervised desegregation of Nashville's public school system. In that year, Hume-Fogg was again recast as an academic magnet school for Nashville's gifted and talented secondary students.
In the 2004–2005 school year, Hume-Fogg celebrated its sesquicentennial anniversary. It was the location for the filming of Taylor Swift's music video for the song "Teardrops on My Guitar" in 2007.http://www.mnps.org/Page504.aspx
In 2010 it was in immediate danger of flooding waters. Being a school that is over 100 years old, it has had roof and leaking issues for several years. The flood waters stopped and receded only a few blocks away from the school and the rain waters did not cause any notable damage to the school. The location of Hume-Fogg's graduation was also put into question as the building which traditionally holds the graduation, Bridgestone Arena, had a flooded basement, but the graduation was held on schedule.

Nearly 100 percent of graduates each year go on to four-year colleges, many earning prestigious academic scholarships in the process. Each year, the Hume-Fogg senior class is granted over ten million dollars in cumulative scholarship and grant money from various universities across the United States.
