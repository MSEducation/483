[[Quebec general election, 1919]]

CATEGORIES: 1919 elections in Canada, Elections in Quebec

The Quebec general election of 1919 was held on June 23, 1919 to elect members of the 15th Legislative Assembly of Quebec, Canada.  The incumbent Quebec Liberal Party, led by Lomer Gouin, was re-elected, defeating the Quebec Conservative Party, led by Arthur Sauvé.
Gouin, who had held office since 1905, resigned precisely one year after the election to make way for his successor Louis-Alexandre Taschereau.  Gouin himself had originally come to power in much the same way, after his predecessor Simon-Napoléon Parent resigned soon after winning his final election.
