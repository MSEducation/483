==History==

The first issue was printed on the day that classes started on September 14, 1908.Columbia Missourian
In 1959, construction began on a new headquarters for the Columbia Missourian. The addition to Jay H. Neff Hall included [tpl]convert|19000|sqft|m2[/tpl] of floor space with newsroom, composing room, and press room.  The new headquarters was dedicated in May 1962.http://journalism.missouri.edu/2008/1960-1969/06.html 
On September 19, 1968, the Columbia Missourian switched from afternoon to morning delivery. The change was originally opposed by Dean Earl English for fear that students would abandon coursework and spend all night working on the newspaper. Printers also threatened to quit because of the change in printing schedule.http://journalism.missouri.edu/2008/1960-1969/12.html
In 1970, the Missourian obtained four federally licensed press-radio units. The radios had a range of [tpl]convert|30|mi|km[/tpl] and enabled students to learn of new assignments without returning to the newsroom, and they were used heavily in field reporting.http://journalism.missouri.edu/2008/1970-1979/01.html
In 1985 the Missourian became the first daily newspaper in the world to use a local-area network for production, and in 1986 the Missourian became the first newspaper in the state of Missouri to install a computerized pagination system. The $250,000 system eliminated hands-on page designing.http://journalism.missouri.edu/2008/1980-1989/13.html
In 1992, the Missourian became one of the first newspapers in the world to offer content in a digital format as well as the traditional print format.http://journalism.missouri.edu/2008/1990-1999/04.html
On April 18, 1995, Lee Hills Hall was dedicated as the new home of the Columbia Missourian. The new headquarters was funded by approximately $5 million in gifts from former Missouri journalism student Lee Hills, who served as the first president of the Knight Ridder news service.http://journalism.missouri.edu/2008/1990-1999/07.html
In 2012, the paper, which is operated by the publicly funded University of Missouri, began charging a $5.95 monthly fee for access to online content.
