Homotherium is an extinct genus of machairodontine saber-toothed cats, often termed scimitar-toothed cats, that ranged from North America, South America, Eurasia, and Africa during the Pliocene and Pleistocene epochs (5 mya–10,000 years ago), existing for approximately [tpl]Mya|5|million years[/tpl].PaleoBiology Database: Homotherium, basic info
It first became extinct in Africa some 1.5 million years ago. In Eurasia it survived until about 30,000 years ago.[tpl]cite journal|last=Reumer|first=J.W.F.|coauthors=L. Rook, K. Van Der Borg, K.

==Anatomy==

Homotherium reached [tpl]convert|1.1|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] at the shoulder and weighed an estimated [tpl]convert|150|-|225|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl] and was therefore about the size of a male African lion.http://dinosaurs.about.com/od/mesozoicmammals/p/homotherium.htmMeade, G.E. 1961: The saber-toothed cat Dinobastis serus. Bulletin of the Texas Memorial Museum 2(II), 23–60.http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/wildfacts/factfiles/3009.shtml Compared to some other machairodonts, like Smilodon or Megantereon, Homotherium had shorter upper canines, but they were flat, serrated and longer than those of any living cat. Incisors and lower canines formed a powerful puncturing and gripping device. Among living cats, only the tiger (Panthera tigris) has such large incisors, which aid in lifting and carrying prey. The molars of Homotherium were rather weak and not adapted for bone crushing. The skull was longer than in Smilodon and had a well-developed crest, where muscles were attached to power the lower jaw. This jaw had down-turned forward flanges to protect the scimitars. Its large canine teeth were crenulated and designed for slashing rather than purely stabbing.
It had the general appearance of a cat, but some of its physical characteristics are rather unusual for a large cat. The limb proportions of Homotherium gave it a hyena-like appearance.  The forelegs were elongated, while the hind quarters were rather squat with feet perhaps partially plantigrade, causing the back to slope towards the short tail. Features of the hind limbs indicate that this cat was moderately capable of leaping. The pelvic region, including the sacral vertebrae, were bear-like, as was the short tail composed of 13 vertebrae—about half the number of long-tailed cats. 
The unusually large, square nasal opening, like that of the cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus), presumably allowed quicker oxygen intake, which aided in rapid running and in cooling the brain. As in the cheetah, too, the brain's visual cortex was large and complex, emphasizing the scimitar cat's ability to see well and function in the day, rather than the night, as in most cats.

==Range and species==

Homotherium probably derived from Machairodus and appeared for the first time at the Miocene-Pliocene border, about 5 million years ago.Alan Turner: "The Evolution of the guild of larger terrestrial carnivores during the Plio-Pleistocene in Africa". Geobios, no 23, fasc. 3, p. 349-368, 1990. During the Pleistocene it occurred in vast parts of Eurasia, North America and until the middle Pleistocene (about 1.5 million years ago) even in Africa. A fossil of H. crenatidens was inadvertently dredged from the bed of the North Sea, which was a flat, low-lying extent of marshy tundra laced with rivers during the recent glaciation.(BBC News) Paul Rincon, "Big cat fossil found in North Sea", 18 November 2008 accessed 18 November 2008 There has also been a discovery of 1.8 million-year-old fossils in Venezuela,[ref]
