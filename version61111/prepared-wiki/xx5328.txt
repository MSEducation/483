Sir John Anthony Pople, [tpl]small|KBE FRS[/tpl] (31 October 1925 – 15 March 2004)[tpl]cite doi|10.1098/rsbm.2006.0021[/tpl][tpl]cite doi|10.1063/1.1955494[/tpl] was a Nobel-Prize winning theoretical chemist. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Walter Kohn  in the year 1998.  He was born in Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset, England and attended the Bristol Grammar School. He won a scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge in 1943. He received his B. A. in 1946. Between 1945 and 1947 he worked at the Bristol Aeroplane Company. He then returned to Cambridge University and was awarded his doctorate degree in mathematics in 1951. He moved to the United States of America in 1964, where he lived the rest of his life, though he retained British citizenship. Pople considered himself more of a mathematician than a chemist, but theoretical chemists consider him one of the most important of their number.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/obituaries/story/0,3604,1172894,00.html|title=Obituary Sir John Pople|publisher=The Guardian|first=Pearce|last=Wright|date=19 March 2004[/tpl]

==Major scientific contributions==

His scientific contributions are in four different areas:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gaussian.com/g_people/pople.htm |title=Reflections on John Pople's Career and Legacy|first=Michael J.|last= Frisch|date= 17 March 2004[/tpl]

===Statistical mechanics of water===

His early paper on the statistical mechanics of water, according to Michael J. Frisch, "remained the standard for many years.[tpl]cite journal | last=Pople | first=J. A. | title=Molecular Association in Liquids: II. A Theory of the Structure of Water| journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A| volume=205| pages=163| year=1951 | doi=10.1098/rspa.1951.0024 | issue=1081 |bibcode = 1951RSPSA.205..163P [/tpl]  This was his thesis topic for his Ph D at Cambridge supervised by John Lennard-Jones.

===Nuclear magnetic resonance===

In the early days of nuclear magnetic resonance he studied the underlying theory, and in 1959 he coauthored the text book High Resolution Nuclear Magnetic Resonance with W.G. Schneider and H.J. Bernstein.

===Semi-empirical theory===

He made major contributions to the theory of approximate molecular orbital (MO) calculations, starting with one identical to the one developed by Rudolph Pariser and Robert G. Parr on pi electron systems, and now called the Pariser-Parr-Pople method.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1002/qua.560382435|last1=Steinborn|first1=E. Otto|last2=Homeier|first2=Herbert H.

In 1970 he and David Beveridge coauthored the book Approximate Molecular Orbital Theory describing these methods.

===Ab initio electronic structure theory===

He pioneered the development of more sophisticated computational methods, called ab initio quantum chemistry methods, that use basis sets of either Slater type orbitals or Gaussian orbitals to model the wave function. While in the early days these calculations were extremely expensive to perform, the advent of high speed microprocessors has made them much more feasible today. He was instrumental in the development of one of the most widely used computational chemistry packages, the Gaussian suite of programs, including coauthorship of the first version, Gaussian 70.Gaussian's page on John Pople One of his most important original contributions is the concept of a model chemistry whereby a method is rigorously evaluated across a range of molecules. His research group developed the quantum chemistry composite methods such as Gaussian-1 (G1) and Gaussian-2 (G2). He was a founder of the Q-Chem computational chemistry program.Pople's Q-Chem page Gaussian molecular orbital methods were described in the 1986 book Ab initio molecular orbital theory by Warren Hehre, Leo Radom, Paul v.R. Schleyer and Pople.

==Career and honors==

After obtaining his Ph D, he was a research fellow at Trinity College, Cambridge and then from 1954 a lecturer in the mathematics faculty at Cambridge. In 1958, he  moved to the National Physical Laboratory, near London as head of the new basics physics division. In 1964 he moved to Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he had experienced a sabbatical in 1961 to 1962. In 1993 he moved to Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois where he was Trustees Professor of Chemistry until his death.John Pople Chronology at Gaussian.
He received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1998.Official homepage of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1998 He was made a fellow of the Royal Society in 1961. He was made a Knight Commander (KBE) of the Order of the British Empire in 2003. He was a founding member of the International Academy of Quantum Molecular Science.
An IT room and a scholarship are named after him at Bristol Grammar School, as is a supercomputer at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center.

==Family and death==

He was married to Joy Bowers from 1952 until her death from cancer in 2002. Pople died of liver cancer in Chicago in 2004. He was survived by his daughter Hilary, and sons Adrian, Mark and Andrew.Notable Biographies In accordance with his wishes, Pople's Nobel Medal was given to Carnegie Mellon University by his family on October 5, 2009.
