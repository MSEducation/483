==Etymology==

The name "Cebu" came from the old Cebuano word sibu or sibo ("trade"), a shortened form of sinibuayng hingpit ("the place for trading"). It was originally applied to the harbors of the town of Sugbo, the ancient name for Cebu City. Sugbo, in turn, was derived from the Old Cebuano term for "scorched earth" or "great fire".[tpl]cite journal|author=Celestino C.

==History==

Before the arrival of the Spaniards, Cebu city was part of the small rajahnate and trade center of Pulua Kang Dayang or Kangdaya (literally "islands which belong to Daya"), now better known as the Rajahnate of Cebu. It was founded by a minor prince of the Hindu Chola dynasty of Sumatra, Sri Lumay. The name Sugbo (shortened form of Kang Sri Lumayng Sugbo, literally "that of Sri Lumay's great fire") refers to Sri Lumay's scorched earth tactics against Moro raiders (Magalos).
On April 7, 1521, Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan landed in Cebu. He was welcomed by Rajah Humabon (also known as Sri Humabon or Rajah Humabara), the grandson of Sri Lumay, together with his wife and about 700 native islanders. Magellan, however, was killed in the Battle of Mactan, and the remaining members of his expedition left Cebu soon after several of them were poisoned by Humabon due to threats of foreign occupation.  The last ruler of Sugbo, prior to Spanish colonization, was Rajah Humabon's nephew, Rajah Tupas (d. 1565).
On February 13, 1565, Spanish conquistadors led by Miguel López de Legazpi together with Augustinian friar Andrés de Urdaneta arrived in Cebu, but left after clashing with hostile natives. The expedition visited Mazaua, Leyte, and Bohol where the famous Sandugo or blood compact was performed between López de Legazpi and Datu Sikatuna, the chieftain of Bohol on March 16, 1565. The Spanish returned to Cebu on April 15, 1565. They then attempted to parley with the local ruler, Rajah Tupas, but found that he and the local population had abandoned the town. Rajah Tupas presented himself at their camp on May 8, and the Treaty of Cebu was formalized on July 3, 1565. López de Legazpi's party named the new city "Villa de San Miguel de Cebú" (later renamed "Villa del Santísimo Nombre de Jesús)." In 1567 the Cebu garrison was reinforced with the arrival of 2,100 soldiers from New Spain. The growing colony was then fortified with the Fuerte de San Pedro.
By 1569 the Spanish settlement in Cebu had become important as a safe port for ships from Mexico and as a jumping-off point for further exploration of the archipelago. Small expeditions led by Juan de Salcedo went to Mindoro and Luzon, where he and Martín de Goiti played a leading role in the subjugation of the Kingdoms of  Tundun  and Seludong in 1570. One year later, López de Legazpi departed Cebu to discuss a peace pact with the defeated Rajahs. An agreement between the conquistadors and the Rajahs to form a city council paved the way for the establishment of a new settlement and the construction of the walled city of Intramuros on the razed remains of Seludong.
On August 14, 1595, Pope Clement VIII created the diocese of Cebu as a suffragan to the Archdiocese of Manila.
On April 3, 1898, local revolutionaries led by the Negrense Leon Kilat rose up against the Spanish colonial authorities and took control of the urban center after three days of fighting. The uprising was only ended by the treacherous murder of Leon Kilat and the arrival of soldiers from Iloilo.http://www.cebu.gov.ph/?getid=2&getsubid=5&infolinkids=6&GetBodyName=History&rightpdisable=0
The signing of the Treaty of Paris at the end of the Spanish-American War provided for the cession of Cebu along with the rest of the Philippine islands to the United States until the formation of the Commonwealth Era (1935-1946). On February 21, 1899 the USS Petrel (PG-2) deployed a landing party of 45 men on the shores of Cebu. Cebu’s transfer to the Commonwealth government was signed by Luis Flores, although others, most notably, Gen. Arcadio Maxilom and Juan Climaco, offered resistance until 1901[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl].
Cebu only became a chartered city in February 24, 1937. Many Philippine cities  such as Dansalan (now Marawi), Iloilo City, and Bacolod City were only incorporated as such at that time (see Cities of the Philippines). Until then, Cebu City had never been more than a town since its original founding in 1565.
The city, along with the rest of the country came under Japanese occupation during WWII. The Japanese encountered some opposition there from guerrillas led by Col. James Cushing and the Cebu Area Command. It was finally liberated with the Battle for Cebu City in March and April 1945. The military general headquarters of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and 8th Infantry Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary was active on 1942 to 1946 and stationed in Cebu City during World War II.
Colon Street, is a dense and compact area in downtown Cebu City, was once the site of fashionable shops, restaurants and movie houses. It was the heart of Cebu City's shopping and business activity, but in recent years (specifically during the early 1990s), much of this activity has shifted to the more modern, bigger and diverse commercial and business districts now spread in almost all of the urban areas of the city in what used to be considered residential and leisure settlements. Colon is the oldest and the shortest national road in the Philippines. Colon also serves as transit point of public utility jeepney (PUJ) covering arterial routes within the city.

==Culture==

Cebu City is a significant cultural centre in the Philippines. The imprint of Spanish and Roman Catholic culture is evident. The city's most famous landmark is Magellan's Cross. This cross, now housed in a chapel, is reputed to have been planted by Ferdinand Magellan (Fernão Magalhães) when he arrived in the Philippines in 1521. It was encased in hollow tindalo wood in 1835 upon the order of the Augustinian Bishop Santos Gómez Marañon to prevent devotees from taking it home chip by chip. The same bishop restored the present template or kiosk, located at the present Magallanes street between the City Hall and Colegio del Santo Niño. Revered by Filipinos, the Magellan's Cross is a symbol of Christianity in the Philippines.
A few steps away from the Magellan's Cross is the Basilica Minore del Santo Niño (Church of the Holy Child). This is an Augustinian church elevated to the rank of Basilica in 1965 during the 400th year celebrations of Christianity in the Philippines, held in Cebu. The church, which was the first to be established in the islands, is built of hewn stone and features the country's oldest relic, the figure of the Santo Niño de Cebú (Holy Child of Cebu).
This religious event is celebrated during the island's cultural festivities known as the Sinulog festival. Held every third Sunday of January, it celebrates the festival of the Santo Niño, who was formerly considered to be the patron saint of Cebu. (This patronage was later changed to that of Our Lady of Guadalupe after it was realised that the St. Niño could not be a patron saint because he was an image of the Christ and not a saint.) The Sinulog is a dance ritual of pre-Hispanic indigenous origin. The dancer moves two steps forward and one step backward to the rhythmic sound of drums. This movement resembles somewhat the current (sulog) of the river. Thus, the Cebuanos called it Sinulog.
When the Spaniards arrived in Cebu, the Italian chronicler, Antonio Pigafetta, sailing under convoy with the Magellan expedition, offered a baptismal gift to Hara Amihan, wife of Rajah Humabon. She was later named Juana, the figure of the Santo Niño. The natives also honored the Santo Niño de Cebú in their indigenous Sinulog ritual[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl]. The Sinulog ritual was preserved but limited to honoring the Santo Niño. Once the Santo Niño church was built in the 16th century, the Christianized-Austronesian natives started performing the Sinulog ritual in front of the church, the devotees offering candles and indigenous dancers shouting "Viva Pit Señor!" [tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl].
In the 1980s and 2000s, the city authorities of Cebu added the religious feast of Santo Niño de Cebú during the Sinulog Festival to its cultural event.

==Local government==

Being a highly-urbanized city, Cebu City (along with Lapu-lapu City), is independent from Cebu province. Its electorate do not vote for provincial officials. There were proposals however during the time of Governor Emilio Mario Osmeña to establish an "administrative district" that would be independent from Cebu City. This would literally mean carving out Cebu City's Barangay Capitol where the provincial capitol and other provincial offices are located. The plan however didn't push through and was even followed by other proposals like the transfer of the capital to Balamban.
Cebu City is governed by a Mayor, Vice Mayor and sixteen councilors (eight representing the northern and eight representing the southern region). Each official is popularly elected to serve for a three-year term. The chief of the Association of Barangay Captains and the President of the Sangguniang Kabataan Federation also managed in the city council. The day to day administration of the city is handled by a city administrator.
Mike Rama is currently the Mayor of the city. Rama, formerly the City Vice Mayor from 2001 to 2010, was elected during the 2010 Philippine elections, meanwhile Joy Augustus G. Young is the current vice mayor.[tpl]cite web | url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/cebudailynews/news/view/20081010-165704/Davide-is-acting-Cebu-City-mayor | title=Davide is acting Cebu City mayor Osmeña in US, Rama off to Korea | publisher=INQUIRER.net|accessdate=10 October 2008 [/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/cebudailynews/news/view/20081008-165293/Osmenas-leave-for-US-amid-prayers | title=Osmeñas leave for US amid prayer | publisher=INQUIRER.net | accessdate=8 October 2008 [/tpl]

===Current city officials (2013-2016)===

==Infrastructure==

The city is readily accessible by air via the Mactan-Cebu International Airport located in Lapu-Lapu City which has direct international flights to Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Japan, China, South Korea and domestic destinations.http://www.cebupacificair.com/pages/PressReleases.aspx?pid=810http://globalnation.inquirer.net/cebudailynews/enterprise/view/20080820-155792/Mactan-Cebu-airport-to-set-aside-P300-M-for-expansion Many international and cargo airlines fly to Cebu. There are also direct transfer flights via the capital's Ninoy Aquino International Airport that readily connects the city to other destinations in the world. The city mostly gets its power from an interconnection grid with the Leyte Geothermal Power Plant which also powers the majority of the Visayas Islands. There are also coal-fired power plants, though these have been controversial due to their environmental impact. Another coal-fired power plant is nearing completion and is envisioned to make the city independent from the interconnection grid once completed.
The city is served by a domestic and international port which are handled by the Cebu Port Authority. Much of the city's waterfront is actually occupied by the port with around 3.5 kilometres of berthing space. The city is home to more than 80% of the country's island vessels traveling on domestic routes mostly in the Visayas and Mindanao.
The South Road Properties (SRP) is a 300-hectare prime property development project on a reclaimed land located a few metres off the coast of Cebu's central business district. It is a mixed-use development that will feature entertainment, leisure, residential and business-processing industries. It is registered with the Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA) and is funded by the Japan Bank for International Cooperation(JBIC).[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.cebucity.gov.ph/srp/srp.htm | title=The Official Cebu City Government Forum | publisher=Republic of the Philippines: Cebu City Government | accessdate=12 January 2010 [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Traversing the property is a 12 kilometres, four-lane highway known as the Cebu Coastal Road that provides the motorists with a good view of Cebu's south coast and the nearby island of Bohol.
Telecommunication facilities, broadband and wireless internet connections are available and are provided by some of the country's largest telecommunication companies.
In the 1990s the Inayawan Sanitary Landfill was constructed to ease garbage disposal within the city. It is however nearing its lifespan although the Provincial Government is planning to build two sanitary landfills to serve both the northern and southern parts of Metro Cebu including Cebu City. In June 2005, the city fully implemented the segregation of wastes as mandated by law.
Mass transportation throughout the city and the metropolitan itself is provided by jeepneys, buses and taxis. The Cebu City Government conducted a feasibility study on implementing its Bus Rapid Transit System that will ease the transportation of the residents in the city and its neighboring cities like Mandaue, Lapu-Lapu, and Talisay.  It has the same concept with the Metro Manila's Light Railway Transit System but it is more cost effective.  This kind of mass transportation is popular in the Latin America and now it is implemented in the United States, Australia, and Indonesia. The project's first phase is expected to be
operational in 2013. The remaining and additional phases is expected to be operational in 2015.  The network will be passing to the Cebu Business Park, North Reclamation Area, South Road Properties, and Mactan-Cebu International Airport.
