[[Mildred Roper]]

CATEGORIES: Sitcom characters

Mildred Roper (n√©e Tremble) was a fictional character from the Thames Television sitcoms Man About The House and George and Mildred. She was portrayed by Yootha Joyce.

==Biography==

Mildred was born in London and had three siblings: Arthur, Ethel (Avril Elgar) and Hilda (Jean Harrow). Her only brother, Arthur, emigrated to New Zealand, and had a job branding sheep. He is only mentioned in 'Family Planning (Series 1, Episode 10 of George and Mildred), and it is hinted at that he is a homosexual. He died around 1955. Her eldest sister, Ethel, married Humphrey Pumphrey (Reginald Marsh), and moved into a large mansion. Her other sister, Hilda, married a gentleman called Fred and had five unnamed children. Mildred married George Roper (Brian Murphy), and moved to Putney where they owned a house, and let out the two upper floors to tenants. They later moved to 46 Peacock Crescent, next door to Jeffrey, Ann, Tristram and Tarquin Fourmile (Norman Eshley, Sheila Fearn, Nicholas Bond-Owen, Simon Lloyd). She adapted easily to the surroundings, but George didn't. Her aging mother (Gretchen Franklin) was a frequent visitor, and where she loved her, George didn't.

==Storylines==

Most of Mildred's storylines for Mildred were for her trying to climb the social ladder, and with George ruining her attempts. In George and Mildred she makes friends with her neighbour Ann Fourmile (Fearn), who is married to the snobbish Jeffrey (Eshley). When Ann gave birth to Tarquin in series three, Mildred thinks of adopting a child, and George agrees (providing the baby is not black). The person from the orphanage later declares that the Roper's cannot adopt, for unknown reasons. Feeling sorry for Mildred, George buys her a Yorkshire Terrier, Truffles, who becomes Mildred's pride and joy, and receives better attention than George himself. This is made most clear in the series one episode 'Family Planning', where Mildred's mother stays with them, and George states:
George: Ever since your mother came to stay for us I've come second-best in this house!
Mildred: Third best, George, you forgot about the dog.
Mildred is known for her frequent asking of if anyone wanted a cup of tea.

==Relationship to George==

George and Mildred's relationship is stained, but in certain episodes they are shown to have a tender and loving one. Throughout George and Mildred, various two of George's relatives visit: His father, and younger brother Charlie. When Charlie Roper visit, all names of the Roper siblings are revealed: Fred, Gloria, Betty, Bill, George, Charlie and Bill (it is stated that the second Bill was named after the first). When George's father Jack arrives, their relationship is put under a serious strain, but he eventually leaves and everything returns to normal. When Ethel and Humphrey arrive, George often runs away to the pub or next door, unless Mildred bellows for him to sit. But overall, their relationship is a happy one.

==Appearances==

Yootha Joyce appeared in all episodes of Man About the House,  and all of the spin-off series, George and Mildred as Mildred Roper. She also appeared as Mildred in the film version. When Yootha Joyce died in 1980, the character of Mildred died with her.

==Analysis==

Maggie Andrews sees her as part of a tradition of portraying women characters as consumerist, social-climbing, and pretentious, prefiguring characters such as Hyacinth Bucket in Keeping up Appearances.Andrews, Maggie, "Housewives, Comedy and the Feminist Movement", in Wagg, Stephen (ed), Because I Tell a Joke or Two: Comedy, Politics and Social Difference. pp57-58 She was also an influence on the character of Dot Cotton in EastEnders.[tpl]cite journal|last=Bracewell|first=Michael|title=Tears before bedtime|journal=Frieze|date=May 2002|issue=67|url=http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/tears_before_bedtime/[/tpl]
