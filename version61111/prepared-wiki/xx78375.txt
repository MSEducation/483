Edward Charles Pickering (July 19, 1846 – February 3, 1919) was an American astronomer and physicist[tpl]cite journal|title=PICKERING, Edward Charles|journal=The International Who's Who in the World|year=1912|page=p. 856|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=I-wRAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA856[/tpl] as well as the older brother of William Henry Pickering.
Along with Carl Vogel, Pickering discovered the first spectroscopic binary stars.  He wrote Elements of Physical Manipulations (2 vol., 1873–76).

==Biography==

Pickering attended Boston Latin School, and received his B.S. from Harvard in 1865. Soon after graduating from Harvard, Pickering taught physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Daintith, John. A Dictionary of Scientists. Oxford: Oxford UP, 1999. Print. Later, he served as director of Harvard College Observatory from 1877 to his death in 1919, where he made great leaps forward in the gathering of stellar spectra through the use of photography.  
At Harvard, he recruited many women to work for him, including Annie Jump Cannon, Henrietta Swan Leavitt, and Antonia Maury.  These women, who came to be known as "Pickering's Harem" by the scientific community, made several important discoveries at HCO.  Leavitt's discovery of the period-luminosity relationship for Cepheids, published by Pickering,Miss Leavitt in Pickering, Edward C. "Periods of 25 Variable Stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud" Harvard College Observatory Circular 173 (1912) 1-3. would prove the foundation for the modern understanding of cosmological distances.
In 1876 he co-founded the Appalachian Mountain Club.

==Discoveries==

In 1882, Pickering developed a method to photograph the spectra of multiple stars simultaneously by putting a large prism in front of the photographic plate.Bunch, Bryan H., and Alexander Hellemans. The History of Science and Technology: A Browser's Guide to the Great Discoveries, Inventions, and the People Who Made Them, from the Dawn of Time to Today. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 2004. Print.
He also, along with Williamina Fleming designed a stellar classification system based on an alphabetic system for spectral classes that was first known as the Harvard Stellar Classification and became the basis for the Henry Draper Catalog.
Pickering is credited for making the Harvard College Observatory known and respected around the world, and it continues today to be a well-respected observatory and program.Clark, David H., and Matthew D.
