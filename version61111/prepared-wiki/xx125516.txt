==Future==

Over the last few years, the Waterpark has drawn up several ideas to improve and add to the park. This includes a large 'half pipe'-style slide, for which a planning application was submitted but later withdrawn. Over the 2010 winter period, new turnstiles were added to control crowd flow into the waterpark and the pool floor has been replaced. At the start of 2013 a 3 week close-down took place within the Waterpark where the following was done; New lighting, new flooring, new stairs, and a lot of painting and general maintenance.
