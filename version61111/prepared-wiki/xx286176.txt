He retired from that position in June, 2011.  On January 26, 2013, he was elected as bishop provisional of the Episcopal Church in South Carolina, a diocese of the ECUSA which was challenged with reorganization in the wake of bishop Mark Lawrence's departure from the Episcopal Church.
VonRosenberg referred to the departed followers of Lawrence as "sincere Christians." In describing his own task as the new Bishop, vonRosenberg said "I want to use the image of rebuilding, for that is what we are called to do â€“ to reorganize and to rebuild the Episcopal Church in South Carolina." He went on to say that the diocese should rebuild the church on the foundation of Jesus Christ, with an attitude of humility and love.http://www.ecumenicalnews.com/article/rebuild-episcopal-church-in-south-carolina-new-bishop-1718
