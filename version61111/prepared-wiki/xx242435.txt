[[Proben]]

CATEGORIES: Philippine cuisine, Street food

Proben (sometimes also "Chicken proben", or spelled "Proven") is a type of street food popular in some regions of the Philippines.  It consists essentially of the proventriculus of a chicken, dipped in cornstarch, and deep-fried.  It is served either in a small bagful of vinegar, or skewered on bamboo sticks to be dipped in the vinegar just before it is eaten.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://filipino_cuisine.totallyexplained.com/|title=Everything about Filipino Cuisine totally explained |accessdate=2009-10-20 |publisher=totallyexplained.com [/tpl]
Proven is particularly favored among towns in Laguna, and by students of the University of the Philippines Los Baños, where enjoying a taste of the snack in the afternoon has become a popular part of campus culture,[tpl]cite journal | author=Barrion, A.S.A. and Hurtada, W.A.| title=Nutritional and microbial quality of the street food chicken proven in Los Banos, Laguna (Philippines)| journal=Philippine Agricultural Scientist| year=2006| volume=89| issue=2| pages=157–164| url=http://www.fao.org/agris/search/display.do?f=2008/PH/PH0712.xml;PH2007001391[/tpl] similar to the iconic status given to Isaw at the University of the Philippines Diliman.

==Nutritional value==

A nutritional study conducted by UPLB noted that, as with most street foods, the microbial quality of the proben is a concern. However, the study noted that the pathogenic food-borne microbes in proben are mostly destroyed when it is cooked.  The microbes only return if the proben is stored at ambient temperature after having been cooked. The study concluded that the risk of contamination can be reduced simply "through practice of personal hygiene employing standard cooking temperature (171-185 deg C) and time (10-15 min)" and by making sure that the proben is cooked just before it is eaten.
Raw proven had 39.08% crude protein, 25.59% carbohydrates, 25.59 % crude fat, 0.61 % crude fiber and 51.50 Kcal per 100 g.
The same study showed that the nutrient content of newly cooked proben increased by "crude fat(31%), fiber (131%), carbohydrates (21%), caloric contents (935%), crude protein (26%), calcium (21%), phosphorus (4%), iron(44 %), ash (32%) and moisture (56%)."
