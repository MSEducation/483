===Original cast===

==Story==

The scenario follows the sequence of the children's poem. After Monday (a "hymn to narcissim"), Tuesday is a pas de trois in a style of Ashton's Monotones. Wednesday’s woe is in the form of a "distortion of the Rose Adagio" from The Sleeping Beauty, Thursday depicts various forms of transport, Friday is a blues pas de deux. Saturday is a send-up of a male ballet class, while the finale mimicked the 'stage revolve' close of Sunday Night at the London Palladium.
