The AK-104 is a shortened carbine version of the AK-103 rifle. The AK-102, AK-105, and AK-104 are very similar in design, the only difference being the caliber and corresponding magazine type. The AK-104 is chambered to fire 7.62Ã—39mm ammunition. 
Compared to the AK-74M, AK-101, and AK-103, which are full-size rifles of similar design, the AK-102, 104, and 105 feature shortened barrels that make them a middle ground between a full rifle and the more compact AKS-74U. Whereas the AK-10x rifles have longer barrels, full-length gas pistons, and solid, side-folding polymer stocks, the AKS-74U is shorter, and features a skeleton stock.Modern Firearms - AK-102/104/105.
