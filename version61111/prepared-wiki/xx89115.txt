This is a List of Canadian Leaders of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition is usually the leader of the party with the second-most seats in the Canadian House of Commons, known as Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition. He or she is entitled to the same levels of pay and protection as a Cabinet Minister, and is often made a member of the Canadian Privy Council, generally the only non-government member of the House of Commons afforded that privilege.
If the leader of the opposition party is not a Member of Parliament, then a sitting MP takes the role of acting Leader of the Opposition until the party leader can obtain a seat. If there is a leadership race occurring within the party, an MP (usually the interim party leader) will serve as Leader of the Opposition until a new party leader is chosen.
The current Leader of the Opposition is Thomas Mulcair, the leader of the New Democratic Party. He is the 44th person to serve in this position, in the 56th term, since 1873. Nine of the previous officeholders only served as an acting Leader of the Opposition, including Deborah Grey (the first of two women to hold the position) making Mulcair the 35th permanent Leader of the Opposition. The title has been held without vacancy since 1948.
Two Leaders of the Opposition have died in office: Wilfrid Laurier in 1919 and Jack Layton in 2011.[tpl]cite news|last=McGregor|first=Janyce|title=Parliament and Layton's passing|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/inside-politics-blog/2011/08/parliament-and-laytons-passing.html|accessdate=August 23, 2011|publisher=CBC News|date=August 22, 2011[/tpl]
