==History==

Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield were childhood friends from New York. While Jerry finished college, he found himself unable to make his way into medical school. Ben dropped out of college.[tpl]cite web|title=Our History|url=http://www.benjerry.com/company/history|publisher=Ben & Jerry's[/tpl]  In 1977 Ben and Jerry completed a correspondence course on ice cream making from Pennsylvania State University's Creamery. Cohen has anosmia and so relied on "mouth feel". This led to the company's trademark chunks being mixed in with their ice cream.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.benjerry.com/company/history |title=Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream – History |publisher=Ben & Jerry's[/tpl] On May 5, 1978, with a $12,000[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.benjerry.com/company/history/ |title=Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream – History |publisher=Ben & Jerry's |accessdate=April 2, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100325004518/http://www.benjerry.com/company/history/| archivedate= March 25, 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] investment the two business partners opened an ice cream parlor in a renovated gas station in downtown Burlington, Vermont.  In 1979, they marked their anniversary by holding the first-ever free cone day, now an international annual celebration.
In 1980, Ben and Jerry rented space in an old spool and bobbin mill on South Champlain Street in Burlington and began packing their ice cream in pints. In 1981, the first Ben and Jerry's franchise opened on Route 7 in Shelburne, Vermont (where Marco's Pizza is now). In 1983, Ben & Jerry’s ice cream was used to build “the world’s largest ice cream sundae” in St. Albans, Vermont; the sundae weighed [tpl]convert|27102|lb|kg[/tpl]. That same year, the cows on their cartons were redesigned by local artist, Woody Jackson.Dan Chu and Martha Babcock.

In 1984, Häagen-Dazs wanted to limit distribution of Ben & Jerry’s in Boston, prompting Ben & Jerry’s to file suit against the parent company, Pillsbury, in its now famous “What’s the Doughboy Afraid Of?” campaign. In 1987, Häagen-Dazs again tried to enforce exclusive distribution, and Ben & Jerry’s filed its second lawsuit against the Pillsbury Company. In 1985, the Ben & Jerry’s Foundation was established at the end of the year with a gift from Ben & Jerry's to fund community-oriented projects; it was then provided with 7.5% of the company’s annual pre-tax profits. In 1986, Ben & Jerry’s launched its “Cowmobile”, a modified mobile home used to distribute free scoops of Ben & Jerry’s ice cream in a unique, cross-country “marketing drive”—driven and served by Ben and Jerry themselves. The “Cowmobile” burned to the ground outside of Cleveland four months later, but there were no injuries. Ben said it looked like “the world’s largest baked Alaska”.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jerrygreenfield.com |title=Jerry Greenfield |date=March 2005 |publisher=Celebrity Websites |accessdate=April 13, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080324115747/http://www.jerrygreenfield.com/| archivedate= March 24, 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

In 2001, Ben & Jerry's U.S. completed the transition to "Eco-Pint" packaging, which packaged all pint flavors in environmentally friendly unbleached paperboard Eco-Pint containers, a decision it later reversed. The use of brown-kraft unbleached paperboard had been a critical first step toward a totally biodegradable pint made without added chlorine. Due to what they described as increasing supply, quality, and cost challenges, Ben & Jerry's discontinued their use of the Eco-Pint in 2006, transitioning to a pint container made out of a bleached paperboard that it said was more readily available with superior forming characteristics.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl]

In 2010, Jostein Solheim, a Unilever executive from Norway, became the new CEO of the company and had this to say about the transition: "My mantra that I've repeated a hundred times since starting at Ben & Jerry's is: ‘Change is a wonderful thing,'" he said. "The world needs dramatic change to address the social and environmental challenges we are facing. Values led businesses can play a critical role in driving that positive change. We need to lead by example, and prove to the world that this is the best way to run a business.

Rumors have suggested that Ben & Jerry's supported the defense of Mumia Abu-Jamal, who was convicted in 1982 of killing Philadelphia Police officer Daniel Faulkner.

The company raised controversy in 2006 after releasing a flavor of ice cream called "Black and Tan." It had named the flavor after the alcoholic drink made by mixing stout with pale ale.

And now Schweddy Balls is its own Ben & Jerry's ice cream flavor. Now, true story, true story, there is a family organization that is angry about the name because they think it is inappropriate for the grocery store aisle.
