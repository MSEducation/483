In 2004, Allmusic's Jason Birchmeier considered Pausini's sales "an impressive feat for someone who'd never really broken into the lucrative English–language market".

Her first live performance was on 16 May 1985, when she sang together with her father in a restaurant in Bologna.[tpl]Cite web | url = http://www.giannimina.it/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=177&Itemid=53 | publisher = Giannimina.it | author = Gianni Minà | accessdate = 1 September 2012 | title = Laura Pausini: una ragazza di provincia con un respiro mondiale | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20110716010503/http://www.giannimina.it/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=177&Itemid=53 | archivedate = 16 July 2011[/tpl]

===1993: Career breakthrough===

Thanks to her performances in local singing competitions, Pausini was noted by Italian producer and songwriter Angelo Valsiglio, who introduced her the manager Marco Marati. Valsiglio proposed her "La solitudine", a song he wrote with Pietro Cremonesi and Federico Cavalli. Pausini's rendition convinced Valsiglio and Marati, who wanted Pausini to audition for some major labels. During one of the auditions, she met Fabrizio Giannini of Warner Music Italy's Compagnia Generale del Disco.[tpl]Cite web | url = http://books.google.it/books?id=MQ8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA46#v=onepage&q&f=false | work = Billboard | accessdate = 2 September 2012 | title = Laura Pausini – The Billboard Interview | author = Mark Worden | date = 15 March 2003 | page = 46[/tpl] After impressing him with a performance of an unreleased Mia Martini song, Pausini obtained her first recording contract, becoming one of the first artists being discovered by Giannini, who later launched the careers of several Italian acts, including Luciano Ligabue and Irene Grandi.
"La solitudine" was selected as one of the entries of the newcomer artists' section of the 43rd Sanremo Music Festival. Pausini performed it for the first time on 23 February 1993, during the first semifinal of the contest.[tpl]Cite web | url = http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1993/02/23/il-programma-delle-tre-serate.html | work = la Repubblica | language = Italian | accessdate = 23 September 2011 | date = 23 February 1993 | title = Il programma delle tre serate[/tpl] After being admitted to the final, held on 27 February 1993, she won the competition, receiving 7,464 votes by the juries and beating Gerardina Trovato with "Ma non ho più la mia città", who took second place with 7,209 votes.[tpl]Cite web | url = http://www.hitparadeitalia.it/sanremo/edizioni/1993.htm | publisher = Hitparadeitalia.it | title = Sanremo 1993 (43a Edizione) – Canzoni in gara e Classifica finale | accessdate = 8 September 2013 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100607084650/http://www.hitparadeitalia.it/sanremo/edizioni/1993.htm|archivedate=7 June 2010 | language = Italian[/tpl]
