==Biography==

He was born as Günszberg Dénes, into a Jewish family in Budapest, Hungary, his family converted to Lutheranism,http://www.bookrags.com/biography/dennis-gabor-wop/ as the first-born son of Günszberg Bernát and Jakobovits Adél. Despite having a religious background, religion played a minor role in his later life and considered himself agnostic.[tpl]cite book|title=Notable Scientists from 1900 to the Present: D-H|year=2001|publisher=Gale Group|isbn=9780787617530|author=Brigham Narins|accessdate=30 May 2012|page=797|quote=Although Gabor's family became Lutherans in 1918, religion appeared to play a minor role in his life. He maintained his church affiliation through his adult years but characterized himself as a "benevolent agnostic".[/tpl] In 1902, the family received the permission to change their family name from Günszberg to Gábor. He served with the Hungarian artillery in northern Italy during World War I.[tpl]cite book |title=Holographic Visions |last=Johnston |first=Sean |year=2006 |location= |isbn=978-0-19-857122-3 |page=17 |chapter=Wavefront Reconstruction and beyond|chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=B8dcFC43QWoC&pg=PA17#PPA17,M1 [/tpl] He studied at the Technical University of Budapest from 1918, later in Germany, at the Charlottenburg Technical University in Berlin, now known as the Technical University of Berlin.[tpl]Cite journal| last = Bor | first = Zsolt| authorlink = Zsolt Bor| title = Optics by Hungarians| journal = Fizikai Szemle| volume = 5| pages = 202| year = 1999| url = http://www.kfki.hu/fszemle/archivum/fsz9905/bor.html| issn = 0015-3257| accessdate = June 5, 2010| bibcode = 1999AcHA....5..202Z[/tpl] At the start of his career, he analysed the properties of high voltage electric transmission lines by using cathode-beam oscillographs, which led to his interest in electron optics. Studying the fundamental processes of the oscillograph, Gabor was led to other electron-beam devices such as electron microscopes and TV tubes. He eventually wrote his Ph.D. thesis on Recording of Transients in Electric Circuits with the Cathode Ray Oscillograph in 1927, and worked on plasma lamps.
Gabor, a Jew, fled from Nazi Germany in 1933, and was invited to Britain to work at the development department of the British Thomson-Houston company in Rugby, Warwickshire. During his time in Rugby, he met Marjorie Louise Butler, and they married in 1936. He became a British citizen in 1946,[tpl]Cite book| last = Wasson| first = Tyler| first2 = Gert H. | last2 = Brieger| title = Nobel Prize Winners: An H. W.

He experimented with a heavily filtered mercury arc light source. However, the earliest hologram was only realised in 1964 following the 1960 invention of the laser, the first coherent light source. After this,  holography became commercially available.
Gabor's research focused on electron inputs and outputs, which led him to the invention of re-holography. The basic idea was that for perfect optical imaging, the total of all the information has to be used; not only the amplitude, as in usual optical imaging, but also the phase. In this manner a complete holo-spatial picture can be obtained. Gabor published his theories of re-holography in a series of papers between 1946 and 1951.
Gabor also researched how human beings communicate and hear; the result of his investigations was the theory of granular synthesis, although Greek composer Iannis Xenakis claimed that he was actually the first inventor of this synthesis technique.[tpl]Cite book| last = Xenakis| first = Iannis| title = Formalized Music: Thought and Mathematics in Composition| publisher = Pendragon Pr.| year = 2001| volume = 9th| edition = 2nd| pages = preface xiii| isbn = 1-57647-079-2[/tpl] Gabor's work in this and related areas was foundational in the development of time–frequency analysis.
In 1948 Gabor moved from Rugby to Imperial College London, and in 1958 became professor of Applied Physics until his retirement in 1967. While spending much of his retirement in Italy at Lavinio Rome, he remained connected with Imperial College as a Senior Research Fellow and also became Staff Scientist of CBS Laboratories, in Stamford, Connecticut; there, he collaborated with his lifelong friend, CBS Labs' president Dr. Peter C. Goldmark in many new schemes of communication and display. One of Imperial College's new halls of residence in Prince's Gardens, Knightsbridge is named Gabor Hall in honour of Gabor's contribution to Imperial College. He developed an interest in social analysis and published The Mature Society: a view of the future in 1972.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Dennis_Gabor |title=Dennis Gabor |author=IEEE Global History Network |year=2011 |publisher=IEEE History Center |accessdate=14 July 2011[/tpl]
Following the rapid development of lasers and a wide variety of holographic applications (e.g., art, information storage, and the recognition of patterns), Gabor achieved acknowledged success and worldwide attention during his lifetime. He received numerous awards besides the Nobel Prize.
Gabor died in a nursing home in South Kensington, London, on 8 February 1979.  In 2006 a blue plaque was put up on No. 79 Queen's Gate in Kensington, where he lived from 1949 until the early 1960s.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.gov-news.org/gov/uk/news/blue_plaque_for_dennis_gabor_inventor_of/63353.html|title=Blue Plaque for Dennis Gabor, inventor of Holograms|publisher=Government News|date=1 June 2006|accessdate=23 November 2013[/tpl]
