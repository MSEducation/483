Dame Jacqueline Wilson, DBE, FRSL (born 17 December 1945) is an English writer known for her vast and diverse work in children's literature. Her novels commonly deal with such challenging themes as adoption, divorce and mental illness. Addressing such issues has made her controversial because her readers are young."Jacqueline Wilson".

==Life and education==

Jacqueline Wilson was born in Bath, Somerset, in 1945, Her father, Harry Aitken, was a civil servant; her mother, Margaret 'Biddy' Aitken was a housewife, having various jobs as a dinnerlady and a bakery worker.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2005/may/26/jacquelinewilson |title=Children's laureateship goes to Jacqueline Wilson |work=The Guardian |location=UK |first=Michelle |last=Pauli |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited |date=26 May 2005 |accessdate=15 August 2008[/tpl][tpl]clarify |date=August 2012 |reason=what does it mean to be a housewife having these jobs?[/tpl] Jacqueline spent most of her childhood in Kingston upon Thames, where she went to Latchmere Primary School. She was an imaginative child who enjoyed both reading and inventing stories. She particularly enjoyed books by Noel Streatfeild, as well as American classics like Little Women and What Katy Did.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2008/jun/10/jacquelinewilson|title=Jacqueline Wilson|work=The Guardian |location=UK|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|date=22 July 2009|accessdate=29 August 2008[/tpl] As early as aged seven, she filled Woolworths notebooks with stories of her imaginary games. At the age of nine she wrote her first "novel" which was 18 sides long.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2007/feb/24/jacquelinewilson |title=I was a girl for gritty realism |work=The Guardian |location=UK |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited |last=Wilson |first=Jacqueline |date=24 February 2007 |accessdate=15 August 2008[/tpl] That story, Meet the Maggots, was about a family with seven children. Although she was good at English, she had no interest in mathematics; she would often stare out the window and imagine rather than pay attention to the class, leading her final-year teacher at Latchmere to nickname her "Jacky Daydream". Jacqueline Wilson later used the nickname as the title of the first stage of her autobiography.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl]
She did very well at school. After Latchmere, she attended Coombe Girls' School, which she visits to till now. Kingston University has named the main hall at its Penrhyn Road campus for her, "Jacqueline Wilson Hall".[tpl]clarify |date=August 2012 |reason=did she attend KU?[/tpl] After leaving school at age 16, she began training as a secretary but then applied to work with the Dundee-based publishing company DC Thomson on a new girls' magazine, Jackie.[tpl]Cite web |year=2003 |url=http://www.jubileebooks.co.uk/2001/10/jaqueline-wilson/ |title=Author profile |publisher=Jubilee Books[/tpl] DC Thomson offered the 17-year-old a job after she penned a piece on the horrors of teen discos. She fell in love with a printer named Millar Wilson. When he joined the police force, the couple moved south for his work, marrying in 1965 when Jackie was 19. Two years later, they had a daughter, Emma. They divorced in 2004.'WILSON, Jacqueline', Who's Who 2008, A & C Black, 2008; online edn, Oxford University Press, December 2007 retrieved 30 May 2008.

When Wilson focused on writing, she completed a few crime fiction novels before dedicating herself to children's books. At the age of 40, she took A-level English and earned a grade A.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1581026/Dame-Jacqueline-Wilson's-nasty-adult-world.html|title=Dame Jacqueline Wilson's nasty adult world|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK|publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited|date=7 March 2008|accessdate=13 August 2009[/tpl] She had mixed success with about 40 books before the breakthrough to fame in 1991 with The Story of Tracy Beaker, published by Doubleday.
Two decades later, Wilson lives in a Victorian villa in Kingston upon Thames. It is filled with books; her library of some 15,000 books extends into the outbuilding at the bottom of her garden.http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article1381142.ece Retrieved 13 August 2008. She remains a keen reader, completing a book a week despite her hectic schedule. Her favourite writers for adults include Katherine Mansfield and Sylvia Plath. She also surrounds herself with old-fashioned childhood objects such as a rocking horse and antique dolls, and has a unique taste in clothes and jewellery, being known for wearing black clothes and an array of large rings.[tpl]cite news|url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/childrenandteens/story/0,,1494760,00.html|title=My inner age is between 10 and 40|author=Kellaway, Kate|work=The Observer |location=UK|date=29 May 2005 |accessdate=30 May 2011[/tpl]

==Style==

Wilson's stories have greater choice than most children's books, including such difficult topics as abuse, grief, divorce, foster care and mental illness. Her prose is often interspersed with ink drawings by illustrator Nick Sharratt, who also designs the covers for her books.
She usually writes first person narrative but has occasionally experimented with alternating viewpoints, as in Secrets, The Lottie Project, Little Darlings and Double Act.
She says: "I want to write to every age group, in a way that can prepare them for what happens in the real world, and raise the awareness levels of many life changing situations. I want to be a friend, really."
Wilson, Melvin Burgess, and others have made "social realism" fashionable, Julia Eccleshare wrote in 2001 obituary of Winifred Cawley. Simply to feature "children from less affluent homes" had been almost unknown in the 1950s —when Wilson was a child reader.
