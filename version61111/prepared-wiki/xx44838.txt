Qinghai ([tpl]zh|c=青海|p=Qīnghǎi|w=Ch'ing-Hai[/tpl]; pronounced [tpl]IPAc-cmn|q|ing|1|h|ai|3[/tpl]), also known as Tsinghai, formerly known in English as Kokonor, is a province of the People's Republic of China located in the northwest of the country. As one of the largest province-level administrative division of China by area, the province is ranked fourth-largest in size, but has the third-smallest population.
Located mostly on the Qinghai-Tibet plateau, the province has long been a melting pot for a number of ethnic groups including the Han, Tibetans, Hui, Tu, Mongols, and Salars.  Qinghai borders Gansu on the northeast, the Xinjiang on the northwest, Sichuan on the southeast, and the Tibet Autonomous Region on the southwest. Qinghai province was established in 1928 under the Republic of China period during which it was ruled by Chinese Muslim warlords known as the Ma clique. The Chinese name, "Qinghai" is named after Qinghai Lake (cyan sea lake), the largest lake in China. The province was known formerly as Kokonur in English, derived from the Oirat name for Qinghai Lake.

==History==

During China's Bronze Age, Qinghai was home to the Qiang people who traditionally made a living in agriculture and husbandry, the Kayue culture. The eastern part of the area of Qinghai was under the control of the Han dynasty about 2000 years ago. It was a battleground during the Tang and subsequent Chinese dynasties when they fought against successive Tibetan tribes.Purdue - Tibetan history.
In the middle of 3rd century CE, nomadic people related to the Mongolic Xianbei migrated to pasture lands around Koko Nur (Qinghai Lake) and established Tuyuhun Kingdom. Since the 7th century, Tuyuhun Kingdom was attacked by both the Tibetan Empire and Tang dynasty as both of them sought control over trade routes. Military conflicts severely weakened the kingdom and it was incorporated into the Tibetan Empire. After the disintegration of the Tibetan Empire, small local factions emerged, some under the titular authority of China. During the Yuan dynasty's administrative rule of Tibet, the region comprising the headwaters of the Yellow and Yangtze rivers - what modern Tibetan nationalists call "Amdo" - was apportioned to different administrative divisions than Tibet proper.[tpl]cite book|title=China's Tibet?: Autonomy or Assimilation|first=Warren W|last=Smith|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|year=2009|pages=24, 252[/tpl]
Most of Qinghai was once also a short time under the control of early Ming dynasty, but later gradually lost to the Khoshut Mongols. The Xunhua Salar Autonomous County is where most Salar people live in Qinghai. The Salars migrated to Qinghai from Samarkand in 1370.[tpl]cite book|title=The Other Middle Kingdom: A Brief History of Muslims in China|first=Chiara|last=Betta|publisher=Indianapolis University Press|year=2004|page=21[/tpl] The chief of the four upper clans around this time was Han Pao-yuan and Ming granted him office of centurion, it was at this time the people of his four clans took Han as their surname.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=uEMeAQAAIAAJ&q=salar+han+ma+surname&dq=salar+han+ma+surname&hl=en&ei=0lCtTMzRJ8H6lwfKu8HuCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CD8Q6AEwAw|title=Gladstone-Gordon correspondence, 1851-1896: selections from the private correspondence of a British Prime Minister and a colonial Governor, Volume 51|author=William Ewart Gladstone, Baron Arthur Hamilton-Gordon Stanmore|year=1961|publisher=American Philosophical Society|location=|page=27|isbn=|accessdate=2010-06-28[/tpl] The other chief Han Shan-pa of the four lower Salar clans got the same office from Ming, and his clans were the ones who took Ma as their surname.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?ei=mDyuTNLQEcH88AbRqanPDw&ct=result&id=uEMeAQAAIAAJ&dq=salar+han+ma+surname&q=The+clan+chief+Han+Shan-pa+had+also+received+the+office+of+centurion.+He+controlled+the+four+lower+Salar+clans%2C+which+had+adopted+the+surname+Ma%2C+and+inhabited+the+region+|title=Gladstone-Gordon correspondence, 1851-1896: selections from the private correspondence of a British Prime Minister and a colonial Governor, Volume 51|author=William Ewart Gladstone, Baron Arthur Hamilton-Gordon Stanmore|year=1961|publisher=American Philosophical Society|location=|page=27|isbn=|accessdate=2010-06-28[/tpl]
From 1640 to 1724, a big part of the area that is now Qinghai was under Khoshut Mongol control, but in that year it was conquered by the armies of the Qing dynasty.The Times Atlas of World History. (Maplewood, New Jersey: Hammond, 1989) p. 175 It was during the 1720s when Xining Prefecture was established and its borders were roughly those of modern Qinghai province. Xining, the capital of modern Qinghai province was built in this period as the administrative center. During the rule of the Qing Dynasty, the governor was a viceroy of the Qing Emperor, but the local ethnic groups enjoyed much autonomy. Many chiefs retained their traditional authority, participating in local administrations.[tpl]Cite book|title=Change, Conflict and Continuity among a community of nomadic pastoralists—A Case Study from western Tibet, 1950-1990., Resistance and Reform in Tibet|author=M.C.

Ma Bufang increased the prominence of the Hui and Salar people in Qinghai's politics by heavily recruiting to his army from the counties in which those ethnic groups predominated. General Ma started a state run and controlled industralization project, directly creating educational, medical, agricultural, and sanitation projects, run or assisted by the state. The state provided money for food and uniforms in all schools, state run or private. Roads and a theater were constructed. The state controlled all the press, no freedom was allowed for independent journalists.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0Caknr1VAqMC&pg=PA38&dq=ma+bufang+communist+saw&hl=en&ei=dYegTcupA-iO0QHU4OWEBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=China's communist revolutions: fifty years of the People's Republic of China|author=Werner Draguhn, David S.

As the 1949 Chinese revolution approached Qinghai, Ma Bufang abandoned his post and flew to Hong Kong, traveling abroad but never returning to China. On January 1, 1950, the Qinghai Province People's Government was declared, owing its allegiance to the new People's Republic of China. Aside from some minor adjustments to suit the geography, the PRC maintained the province's territorial integrity.[tpl]Cite book|title=Authenticating Tibet: Answers to China's 100 Questions|first=Anne-Marie|last=Blondeau|first2=Katia|last2=Buffetrille|publisher=University of California Press|year=2008|pages=203–205|quote=It is often assumed that this current policy not politically uniting all ethnically Tibetan areas reflects the PRC leadership's intention to divide and rule Tibet, but this assumption is not wholly accurate….

==Geography==

Qinghai is located on the northeastern part of the Tibetan Plateau. The Yellow River originates in southern part of the province, while the Yangtze and Mekong have their sources in the southwestern part. Qinghai is separated by the Riyue Mountain into pastoral and agricultural zones in the west and east.[tpl]Cite book|title=Ethnic Minorities and Regional Development in Asia: Reality and Challenges|editor1-first=Huahua|editor1-last=Cao|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|year=2009|chapter=Maximising Opportunities for the Tibetans of Qinghai Province, China|first=Anja|last=Lahtinen|pages=20–22[/tpl]
The average elevation of Qinghai is over [tpl]convert|3000|m[/tpl] above sea level.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl] Mountain ranges include the Tanggula Mountains and Kunlun Mountains, with the highest point being Bukadaban Feng at [tpl]convert|6860|m[/tpl].Bukadaban Feng, Peakbagger.com Due to the high altitude, Qinghai has quite cold winters (harsh in the highest elevations), mild summers, and a large diurnal temperature variation. Its mean annual temperature is approximately [tpl]convert|−5|to|8|°C|°F|0[/tpl], with January temperatures ranging from [tpl]convert|−18|to|−7|°C|°F|0[/tpl] and July temperatures ranging from [tpl]convert|15|to|21|°C|°F|0[/tpl]. It is also prone to heavy winds as well as sandstorms from February to April. Significant rainfall occurs mainly in summer, while precipitation is very low in winter and spring, and is generally low enough to keep much of the province semi-arid or arid.
By area, Qinghai is the largest province in the People's Republic of China (excluding the autonomous regions). Qinghai Lake is the largest salt water lake in China, and the second largest in the world. The Qaidam basin lies in the northwest part of the province. About a third of this resource rich basin is desert. The basin has an altitude between 3000 to 3500 meters.
The Sanjiangyuan National Nature Reserve, is located in Qinghai and contains the headwaters of the Yellow River, Yangtze River, and Mekong River. The reserve was established to protect the headwaters of these three rivers and consists of 18 subareas, each containing three zones which are managed with differing degrees of strictness.

==Politics==

==Administrative divisions==

Because the Han form Qinghai's ethnic majority, and because none of its many ethnic minorities have clear dominance over the rest, the province is not administered as an autonomous region. Instead, the province has many ethnic autonomous areas at the district and county levels.[tpl]Cite book|title=China's Campaign to "Open Up the West": National, Provincial, and Local Perspectives|first=David|last=Goodman|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2004|pages=67–83[/tpl] Qinghai is administratively divided into two prefecture-level cities and six autonomous prefectures:
All of these are in turn divided into five districts, two county-level cities, twenty-nine counties, and seven autonomous counties.

==Economy==

Qinghai's economy is amongst the smallest in all of China. Its nominal GDP for 2011 was just 163.4 billion RMB (US$25.9 billion) and contributes to about 0.35% of the entire country's economy. Per capita GDP was 19,407 RMB (US$2,841), the second lowest in China.Qinghai Province: Economic News and Statistics for Qinghai's Economy
Its heavy industry includes iron and steel production, located near its capital city of Xining. Oil and natural gas from the Qaidam Basin have also been an important contributor to the economy. Salt works operate at many of the province's numerous salt lakes.
Outside of the provincial capital, Xining, most of Qinghai remains underdeveloped. Qinghai ranks second lowest in China in terms of highway length, and will require a significant expansion of its infrastructure to capitalize on the economic potential of its rich natural resources.

===Economic and Technological Development Zones===

Xining Economic & Technological Development Zone (XETDZ) was approved as state-level development zone in July 2000. It has a planned area of [tpl]convert|4.4|km2[/tpl]. XETDZ lies in the east of Xining, [tpl]convert|5|km[/tpl] away from downtown. Located in the east of the province, Xining stands at the upper reaches of the Huangshui River-one of the Yellow River's branches. The city is surrounded by the mountains with an average elevation of 2261 meters and the highest at 4393 meters. Xining Economic and Technological Development Zone (XETDZ) is the first of its kind at the national level on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. It is established to fulfill the nation's strategy of developing the west.
XETDZ enjoys a convenient transportation system, connected by the Xining-Lanzhou expressway and run through by two main roads, the broadest roads of the city. It is 4 kilometers away from the railway station, 15 kilometers from Xi'ning Airport, a grade 4D airport with 14 airlines to other cities such as Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Chengdu and Xi'an. Xining is Qinghai province's passage to the outside world, a transportation center with more than ten highways, over one hundred roads and two railways, Lanzhou-Qinghai and Qinghai-Tibet Railways in and out of the city.
It focuses on the development of following industries: chemicals based on salt lake resources, nonferrous metals, and petroleum and natural gas processing; special medicine, foods and bio-chemicals using local plateau animals and plants; new products involving ecological and environmental protection, high technology, new materials as well as information technology; and services such as logistics, banking, real estate, tourism, hotel, catering, agency and international trade.RightSite.asia | Xining Economic & Technological Development Zone

==Demographics==

There are over 37 recognized ethnic groups among Qinghai's population of 5.2 million, with national minorities making up 46.5% of the population. The demographic mix is similar to Gansu province, with Han (54.5%), Hui (16%), Tibetans (20.7%), Tu (4%), Mongols, and Salars being the most populous groups. Han Chinese predominate in the cities of Xining, Haidong, Delhi and Golmud, and elsewhere in the northeast. The Hui are concentrated in Xining, Haidong, Minhe County, Hualong County, and Datong County. The Tu people predominate in Huzhu County and the Salars in Xunhua County; Tibetans and Mongols are sparsely distributed across the rural western part of the province.
Of the Muslim ethnic groups in China, Qinghai has communities of Hui, Salar, Dongxiang, and Bao'an. Both the indigenous Han and Tibetan people in Qinghai differ from their co-ethnics outside of the province; the Han in Qinghai are more devoutly Buddhist and influenced by Tibetan customs, while the Tibetans may not speak Tibetan and are more integrated into mainstream Chinese culture. Qinghai Tibetans regard themselves as distinct from Tibetans in the Tibet Autonomous Region, and celebrate their region's unbroken independence from Lhasa's control since the fall of the Tubo Empire.

==Culture==

Qinghai has been influenced by the interactions "between Mongol and Tibetan culture, north to south, and Han Chinese and Inner Asia Muslim culture, east to west". The languages of Qinghai have for centuries formed a Sprachbund, with Zhongyuan Mandarin, Amdo Tibetan, Salar, Yugur, and Monguor borrowing from and influencing one another.[tpl]Cite book|chapter=From Manchuria to Amdo Qinghai: On the Ethnic Implications of the Tuyuhun Migration|first=Juha|last=Janhunen|authorlink=Juha Janhunen|title=Tumen Jalafun Jecen Aku|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|year=2006|pages=111–112[/tpl] In mainstream Chinese culture, Qinghai is most associated with the Tale of King Mu, Son of Heaven.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cctv.com/english/tc/sanji/qinghai.html|title=Qinghai|work=English Channel|publisher=CCTV|accessdate=2013-06-05[/tpl] According to this legend, King Mu of Zhou (r. 976–922 BCE) pursued hostile Quanrong nomads to eastern Qinghai, where the goddess Xi Wangmu threw the king a banquet in the Kunlun Mountains.[tpl]cite book|title=Chinese History: Ancient China to 1911|publisher=Asiapac Books|author=Asiapac Editorial|year=2006|page=28[/tpl]

The yak, which is native to Qinghai, is widely used in the province for transportation and its meat. The Mongols of Qinghai celebrate the Naadam festival on the Qaidam Basin every year.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.cultural-china.com/20090721153338.html|title=Qaidam culture shines in Qinghai, NW China|date=2009-07-21|accessdate=2013-06-05|publisher=Global Times[/tpl]

==Transportation==

The Lanqing Railway, running between Lanzhou, Gansu and Xining, the province's capital, was completed in 1959 and is the major transportation route in and out of the province. A continuation of the line, the Qinghai-Tibet Railway via Golmud and western Qinghai, has become one of the most ambitious projects in PRC history. It was completed in October 2005 and now links Tibet with the rest of China through Qinghai.
Construction on the Golmud–Dunhuang Railway, in the province's northwestern part, started in 2012.
Six National Highways run through the province.
Xining Caojiabu Airport provides service to Beijing, Lanzhou, Golmud and Delingha. Smaller regional airports, such as Golmud Airport and Yushu Batang Airport, serve some of the local centers of the far-flung province; plans exist for the construction of three more by 2020.Qinghai to build 3 new airports before 2020

==Telecommunications==

Since the Ministry of Information Industry began its "Access to Telephones Project", Qinghai has invested 640 million yuan to provide telephone access to 3860 out its 4133 administrative villages. At the end of 2006, 299 towns had received Internet access. However, 6.6 percent of villages in the region still have no access to the telephone. These villages are mainly scattered in Qingnan Area, with 90 percent of them located in Yushu and Guoluo. The average altitude of these areas exceeds 3600 meters, and the poor natural conditions hamper the establishment of telecommunication facilities in the region.
Satellite phones have been provided to 186 remote villages in Qinghai Province as of September 14, 2007.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl] The areas benefited were Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture and Guoluo Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. Qinghai has recently been provided with satellite telephone access. In June 2007, China Satcom carried out an in-depth survey in Yushu and Guoluo, and made a special satellite phones for these areas. Two phones were provided to each village for free, and calls were charged at the rate of 0.2 yuan per minute for both local and national calls, with the extra charges assumed by China Satcom. No monthly rent was charged on the satellite phone. International calls were also available.

==Tourism==

Many tourist attractions center on Xining, the provincial seat of Qinghai.
During the hot summer months, many tourists from the hot Southern and Eastern parts of China travel to Xining, as the climate of Xining in July and August is quite mild and comfortable, making the city an ideal summer retreat.
Qinghai Lake ([tpl]lang|zh-s|青海湖[/tpl], qīnghǎi hú) is another tourist attraction, albeit further from Xining than Kumbum Monastery (Ta'er Si). The lake is the largest saltwater lake in China, and is also located on the "Roof of the World," the Tibetan Plateau. The lake itself lies at 3,600m elevation. The surrounding area is made up of rolling grasslands and populated by ethnic Tibetans. Most pre-arranged tours stop at Bird Island ([tpl]lang|zh-s|鸟岛[/tpl], niǎo dǎo). An international bicycle race takes place annually from Xining to Qinghai Lake.
