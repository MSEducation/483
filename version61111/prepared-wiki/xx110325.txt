Tang Shaoyi (January 2, 1862 – September 30, 1938), courtesy name Shaochuan (少川),  was a Chinese politician who briefly served as the first Prime Minister of the Republic of China in 1912. In 1938 he was assassinated by the Kuomingtang in Shanghai.

==Career==

Tang was a native of Xiangshan County, Guangdong. He studied at Queen's College, Hong Kong, and then Columbia University in New York on the Chinese Educational Mission. He was the first president of Shandong University. Tang was a friend of Yuan Shikai; and, during the Xinhai Revolution, negotiated on the latter's behalf in Shanghai with the revolutionaries' Wu Tingfang, ending up with the recognition of Yuan as President of the Republic of China.
Widely respected, he became the Republic's first Prime Minister in 1912, but quickly grew disillusioned with Yuan's lack of respect for the rule of law and resigned.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=OPUTAAAAIAAJ |title=China revolutionized |author=John Stuart Thomson |year=1913 |publisher=The Bobbs-Merrill company |location=INDIANAPOLIS |page=105 |isbn=[/tpl] He later took part in Sun Yatsen's government in Guangzhou. Tang Shaoyi opposed, on constitutional grounds, Sun's taking of the "Extraordinary Presidency" in 1921; Tang resigned from his position. In 1924, he refused an offer to be foreign minister under warlord Duan Qirui's provisional government in Beijing.

==Assassination==

In 1937, Tang bought a house on Route Ferguson in the Shanghai French Concession and retired there.[tpl]cite web |url=http://news.china.com.cn/txt/2012-11/22/content_27198658.htm |title=武康路与民国第一任总理唐绍仪血案 |trans_title=Wukang Road and the assassination of Tang Shaoyi |publisher=China.com.cn |language=Chinese |date=22 November 2012 |accessdate=8 October 2013 [/tpl] The following year, the Japanese invaded and occupied Shanghai (though not yet the foreign concessions). Japanese general Kenji Doihara attempted to recruit Tang to become president of the new pro-Japanese puppet government, and Tang was willing to negotiate with the Japanese. The Kuomintang's intelligence agency Juntong learned about the negotiation, and its chief Dai Li ordered his assassination. On 30 September 1938, Tang was killed in his living room by a Juntong squad who pretended to be antique sellers.[tpl]cite book |last=Wakeman |first=Frederic E. |title=The Shanghai Badlands: Wartime Terrorism and Urban Crime, 1937-1941 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=TbpNjDlPSq0C&pg=PA48 |year=2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521528719 |page=48[/tpl]
