The cave was discovered in 1936 by S. McEachern, J. "Bunny" Hutchesson and the latter's son Alan. They developed the cave as a tourist attraction, with Bunny Hutchesson acting as the first permanent guide, conducting tours from 1941. The cave has been part of Lower Glenelg National Park since 1980.
Guided tours of the cave are conducted on most days, lasting about half an hour.
