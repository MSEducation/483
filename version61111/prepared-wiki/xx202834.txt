Batmobile is a Dutch psychobilly band from Rotterdam and Breda that had its start in 1983. They are one of the best selling acts in psychobilly.[tpl]fact|date=April 2013[/tpl]

==Brief history==

Batmobile was founded in 1983. In 1985 they were signed by the Rockhouse label on which they released their first selftitled (mini) album. This release led to international recognition, making Batmobile the first non-British act to headline international psychobilly festivals, including the London KlubFoot. Their second album (Bambooland) was the first release of their own Count Orlok label. 

After 17 years of intensive touring the band took a break from playing live. In 2000 they played their last show on the New York Rumble. In 2003 Batmobile returned on stage and they are touring internationally again ever since.
In 2008 Batmobile celebrated their 25th birthday by recording and releasing a split-album with Peter Pan Speedrock (Eindhoven) named Cross Contamination, and also launching their new website batmobileforever.com
