==Career==

Bryden was hired by the Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere (CARE) program in January 1988[tpl]cite book|author=Michael Maren|title=The Road to Hell|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=c7yXjjdx53QC&pg=PA243|accessdate=23 September 2013|date=24 November 2009|publisher=Free Press|isbn=978-1-4391-8841-5|pages=182-183[/tpl] and the following year joined the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) in Berbera, Somalia.[tpl]cite book|author=Michael Maren|title=The Road to Hell|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=c7yXjjdx53QC&pg=PA243|accessdate=23 September 2013|date=24 November 2009|publisher=Free Press|isbn=978-1-4391-8841-5|pages=183-184[/tpl] He was re-assigned to Nairobi, Kenya in August 1990, when the UN evacuated non-essential staff.[tpl]cite book|author=Michael Maren|title=The Road to Hell|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=c7yXjjdx53QC&pg=PA243|accessdate=23 September 2013|date=24 November 2009|publisher=Free Press|isbn=978-1-4391-8841-5|pages=187[/tpl]
In 1992, Bryden was appointed Special Advisor to the Canadian Ambassador on Somali Affairs. He led the War-torn Societies Project (WSP) from 1996 to 2003 and in the two years following acted as the Horn of Africa Director for the International Crisis Group (ICG). From 2007 to 2008, he served as an adviser on Somali affairs for the United States Agency for International Development USAID and the US embassy.
In 2008, Bryden was appointed Coordinator of the Monitoring Group on Somalia and Eritrea (SEMG), which monitored violations of an arms embargo introduced in 1992.[tpl]cite news|newspaper=Foreign Policy|first=Robert|last=Pelton|url=http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/09/20/how_the_un_saved_the_somali_pirates?page=0,2|title=Hijacked|date=September 20, 2012|accessdate=September 2, 2013[/tpl] According to journalist Robert Young Pelton, under Bryden's tenure the SEMG's reports "took on a bizarre and voluminous tone accusing both friend and foe of violations." This included allegations that the United States violated the embargo for anti-terrorist missile strikes and an incident where two journalists were detained under suspicions of being mercenaries.[tpl]cite news|newspaper=Foreign Policy|first=Robert|last=Pelton|url=http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/09/20/how_the_un_saved_the_somali_pirates?page=0,2|date=September 20, 2012|accessdate=September 2, 2013[/tpl] Bryden said he considered any munitions delivered to Somalia to be a breach of the embargo.
Bryden accused then Puntland President Abdirahman Farole and other government officials of being on the payroll of pirate gangs.[tpl]cite|url=http://piracy-studies.org/2010/gunmen-fish-and-puntland-the-professionalization-of-piracy/#sthash.XDVxcsTQ.dpuf|title=Gunmen, Fish and Puntland: the Professionalization of Piracy?|publisher=Piracy Studies: Academic Research on Maritime Policy[/tpl] Abdirahman Farole in turn accused Bryden of using his position at the SEMG to create inflated reports of munitions in the neighboring regions of Somaliland in order to support his interest in the secession of Somaliland. He noted Bryden was married to a well-connected woman from the region's dominant, Isaaq clan.[tpl]cite book|author=James Fergusson|title=The World's Most Dangerous Place: Inside the Outlaw State of Somalia|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fV5C-R1Jr_wC&pg=PT72|accessdate=5 September 2013|date=28 May 2013|publisher=Da Capo Press, Incorporated|isbn=978-0-306-82158-5|pages=72–[/tpl] In 2012 a report by the SEMG was leaked accusing Sharif Sheikh Ahmed of corruption and Ahmed responded in July by saying Bryden was "against peace in Somalia."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/UN_Monitoring_Group_is_against_peace_in_Somalia_says_President_Sharif.shtml|title=UN Monitoring Group is against peace in Somalia, says President Sharif|publisher=Garowe Online|accessdate=28 August 2012[/tpl] That summer Bryden was no longer with the UN.[tpl]cite news|title=Weakened Somali terror group may step up recruitment, fundraising here, experts say|first=David|last=Hanners|date=October 19, 2012|accessdate=November 25, 2013|url=http://www.twincities.com/localnews/ci_21812374/weakened-somali-terror-group-may-step-up-recruitment|newspaper=Twin Cities|publisher=Pioneer Press[/tpl][/ref]
