 <nowiki>------END GEEK CODE BLOCK------</nowiki>

==Development==

Some revival attempts have been made since the Geek Code 3.12 became obsolete. See external links. The most faithful adaptation is the Geek Code 3.20[tpl]cite web|author=VGR |url=http://www.fecj.org/extra/The-Geek-Code-Codec-Evolution-Traduction-French-Francais.html |title=The Geek Code : online codec in English, French, Français ++ evolution 2010 |publisher=Fecj.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-12[/tpl] built end-of-2010 which aims at creating a permablock for all kind of geeks.
Some alternatives have also been proposed. For example, the Acorn Code was a version specific to users of Acorn's RISC OS computers.

==Format==

The Geek Code Block formatting, which is optional (though not in Robert Hayden's opinion), is a parody of the output produced by the encryption program PGP. Within the Geek Code Block there is a line specifying the version of Geek Code being used. The next line starts with the letter G (for Geek) followed by the geek's occupation(s): GMU for a geek of music, then the geek code proper begins. For geeks with multiple occupations, a slash or slashes are used: GMD/TW, for instance, for a geek of medicine and technical writing. There are 28 occupations that can be represented. These are:

==Categories==

There are a number of letters in the geek code, each of which represent a category. So, the lower-case letter t represents Star Trek. The geek code's author has this to say about Star Trek:
Meanwhile, the lower-case letter r represents relationships. Geeks are less associated with relationships than they are with Star Trek, and the geek code says this about them:
The geekcode website[tpl]cite web|author=Robert Hayden |url=http://www.geekcode.com/ |title=geekcode.com |publisher=geekcode.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-12[/tpl] contains the complete list of categories, along with all the special syntax options. The choice of categories (from version 3 onwards) reflects what geeks consider important. Appearance takes up three categories, computers – thirteen, computer-related politics – two, general politics – two, computer-related interests – six, other interests – three, lifestyle and sex - four.

==Category-specific modifiers==

Although some categories have special syntax, generally each category is followed by a series of + or - signs showing how much the geek agrees or disagrees with the category. For example, t+++ indicates a geek who thinks this about Star Trek:
On the other hand, someone who puts r--- in their geek code feels the following way about relationships:

==Modifiers==

The meaning of each category can be changed in subtle or not-so-subtle ways using punctuation marks as modifiers. For example, an @ after a category means that the geek's feelings on this category are not very rigid and can change with time, while a dollar sign implies the geek is in the enviable position of being paid for their work in this category.

==Decoding==

Originally, geek codes were designed as a quick reference about a geek's preferences for use in .sig files on Usenet and email.  Pete Williams wrote a program called ungeek.pl that automatically decoded a geek code into the English definitions. In late 1998, Bradley M. Kuhn made Williams' program available as a web service[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ebb.org/ungeek |title=The Geek Code Decoder Page |publisher=Ebb.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-12[/tpl][ref]The site first appears in the Internet Archive on 7 December 1998 (
