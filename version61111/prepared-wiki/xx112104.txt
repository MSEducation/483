[[Advanced Tactical Laser]]

CATEGORIES: Military lasers, Missile defense, Directed-energy weapon of the United States

The Advanced Tactical Laser (ATL) program is a US military program to mount a high energy laser weapon on an aircraft, initially the AC-130 gunship, for use against ground targets in urban or other areas where minimizing collateral damage is important.  The laser will be a 100 kilowatt-class chemical oxygen iodine laser (COIL).  It is expected to have a tactical range of approximately twenty kilometers and weigh about 5,000–7,000 kg. This program is distinct from the Airborne Laser, which is a much larger system designed to destroy enemy missiles in the boost phase.

==History==

In 1996, the blue-beam air-to-ground tactical laser was test-fired from an AC-130 (AC-X Son of Spectrehttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1385143/Americas-laser-of-death-cleared-for-take-off.html The Telegraph) aircraft at the northern annex of the White Sands Proving Grounds near Fort Wingate, New Mexico. Raytheon was later awarded the contract to add the High Energy Microwave Weapon to the same platform where both systems would be operationally available for combat use at the same time. 
In 2002, the Special Operations Command entered into a contract with the Boeing Company, specifically the Lasers and Electro-Optics Systems division in West Hills, CA, to produce a prototype laser system on a test aircraft. This effort was heavily supported by Boeing-SVS Inc.Boeing-SVS Inc. | Albuquerque, NM | Company Profile, Research, News, Information, Contacts in Albuquerque, NM.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2008[/tpl]
On January 18, 2006, the U.S. Air Force's 46th Test Wing handed over to Boeing a C-130H Hercules transport aircraft for use in the ATL program.  Both the laser and the aircraft have undergone testing in the summer of 2006 culminating in the systems joint combined tests in 2007 with full-scale development afterward.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2008[/tpl]

There has been some fear that an airborne laser system could be used to attack targets which would usually be considered 'off-limits', due to the weapon's 'plausible deniability'.US boasts of laser weapon's 'plausible deniability', New Scientist Since no such weapon has ever been observed before, its effects would be hard to identify, meaning that there would rarely be conclusive proof of a laser strike.
On August 13, 2008 Boeing announced the first test firing of the "high-energy chemical laser" mounted in a Hercules transport plane.  The test firing was controlled via the ATL beam control system, which acquired a ground target and fired as "directed by ATL's battle management system."  The ATL weighs 12,000 pounds.[ref]
