[[Chaguo La Teeniez Awards]]

CATEGORIES: Kenyan music, African music awards

The Insyder Magazine' Chaguo La Teeniez Awards (CHAT Awards) is a project that seeks to recognise and award Kenyans youth who have made contributions to society by excelling in academics, arts and sports. 
Initiated in 2002, the CHAT Awards have been hosted annually during April. The April month is key because it is a time when teens are home during the school holidays.
