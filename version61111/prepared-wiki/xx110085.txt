[[File:Lawrence Lessig freesouls.jpg|thumb|right|Harvard Law School professor Lawrence Lessig has called for a Second Constitutional Convention of the United States.]]
Every state except Hawaii has applied for an Article V Convention at one time or another. The majority of such applications were made in the 20th century. While there is no official count of the number of applications, one private count puts the total number of applications at over 700.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.article-5.org/file.php/1/Amendments/index.htm |title=Images of Article V Applications |date= |accessdate=March 22, 2010[/tpl]It should be noted that the listing, prepared by the Friends of the Article V Convention, a group that believes that Congress has purposefully ignored its mandate to call such a convention, includes, as of March 20, 2010, 39 entries where the state legislature rescinded one or more earlier applications.
Even though the Article V Convention process has never been used to amend the Constitution, the number of states applying for a convention has nearly reached the required threshold several times. Congress has proposed amendments to the Constitution on several occasions, at least in part, because of the threat of an Article V Convention. Rather than risk such a convention taking control of the amendment process away from it, Congress acted pre-emptively to propose the amendments instead. At least four amendments (the Seventeenth, Twenty-First, Twenty-Second, and Twenty-Fifth Amendments) have been identified as being proposed by Congress at least partly in response to the threat of an Article V convention.[tpl]sfn|Rogers|2007|p=1008[/tpl]

===1960s===

There have been two nearly-successful attempts to amend the Constitution via an Article V Convention since the late 1960s. The first try was an attempt to propose an amendment that would overturn two Supreme Court decisions, Wesberry v. Sanders and Reynolds v. Sims, decisions that required states to adhere to the one man, one vote principle in drawing electoral districts for state and federal elections. The attempt fell only one state short of reaching the 34 needed to force Congress to call a convention in 1969, but ended by the death of its main promoter Senator Everett Dirksen. After this peak, several states rescinded their applications, and interest in the proposed amendment subsided.[tpl]sfn|Rogers|2007|p=1009[/tpl]

===1970s and 1980s===

The next nearly-successful attempt to call a convention was in the late 1970s and 1980s, in response to the ballooning federal deficit. States began applying to Congress for an Article V Convention to propose a balanced budget amendment. By 1983, the number of applications had reached 32, only two states short of the 34 needed to force such a convention.[tpl]sfn|Rogers|2007|p=1010[/tpl] Enthusiasm for the amendment subsided in response to fears that an Article V Convention could not be limited to a single subject and because Congress passed the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act, which required that the budget be balanced by 1991 (but that Act was overturned by the Supreme Court in 1986).

===2010s===

Single Subject Amendment, a Super PAC registered with the Federal Election Commission on March 1, 2013, is actively engaged in an effort to call an Article V Convention to propose a constitutional amendment to provide that Congress shall pass no bill and no bill shall become law which embraces more than one subject, that subject to be clearly expressed in the bill's title.[tpl]cite web|title=Home|url=http://SingleSubjectAmendment.com[/tpl] As a result of its efforts, the Florida Legislature on April 23, 2014 became the first state to apply for an Article V Convention to propose a single subject amendment.
On November 20, 2013, the Ohio General Assembly applied to Congress for a convention to propose a Balanced Budget Amendment. This effort made Ohio the 20th state to join a push for a national convention of states.[tpl]cite news|last=Pelzer|first=Jeremy|title=Ohio lawmakers join in push for national convention on balanced-budget amendment|url=http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2013/11/ohio_lawmakers_join_in_push_fo.html|accessdate=21 January 2014|newspaper=Cleveland Plain Dealer|date=2013-11-22[/tpl]
On March 26, 2014, the Michigan Legislature applied to Congress for a convention to propose a Balanced Budget Amendment, making Michigan the 22nd to participate in the national effort. If it is ultimately adjudicated that a state may not rescind a prior application, then the threshold of 34 states that Article V requires for triggering a convention has now been met.[tpl]cite news|last=Oosting|first=Jonathan|title=81 comments Michigan petitions Congress for federal balanced budget amendment, constitutional convention|url=http://www.mlive.com/lansing-news/index.ssf/2014/03/michigan_petitions_congress_fo.html|accessdate=31 March 2014|newspaper=MLive|date=2014-03-26[/tpl]

A group called Citizens for Self-Governance (CSG) is actively engaged in an effort to call an Article V Convention. Through an initiative called Convention of States, CSG is seeking "to urge and empower state legislators to call a convention of states." CSG states that it initiated the Convention of States project "for the purpose of stopping the runaway power of the federal government."[tpl]cite web|title=Welcome|url=http://conventionofstates.com/welcome|work=Convention of States|publisher=Citizens for Self-Governance[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Ritz|first=Erica|title=Could a Convention of States Occur as Early as 2016?|url=http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/12/18/could-a-convention-of-states-occur-as-early-as-2016/|accessdate=5 January 2014|newspaper=The Blaze|date=2013-12-18[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Roller|first=Emma|title=Conservatives' Improbable New 'Convention of States' Project|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2013/12/04/alec_ron_johnson_support_convention_of_states.html|accessdate=21 January 2014|newspaper=Slate|date=12-4-2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Benko|first=Ralph|title=Mark Levin's Game Changer: Using The Constitution To Arrest Federal Drift|url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/ralphbenko/2013/08/19/mark-levins-game-changer-using-the-constitution-to-arrest-federal-drift/|accessdate=21 January 2014|newspaper=Forbes|date=2013-08-19[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Weigel|first=David|title=Inside the Secret Conservative Campaign to Rewrite the Constitution|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/12/chris_kapenga_mark_levin_and_article_v_the_secret_campaign_to_pass_conservative.html|accessdate=21 January 2014|newspaper=Slate|date=12-10-2013|author2=Roller, Emma[/tpl] 
Mark Levin has supported CSG's efforts to a call a second constitutional convention.
In December 2013, nearly 100 legislators from 32 states met at Mount Vernon to talk about how to call a convention of states. According to Slate, "The meeting lasted four hours, ending when legislators agreed to meet again in the spring of 2014. That’s the most progress anyone’s made in decades toward a states-first constitutional amendment campaign."
