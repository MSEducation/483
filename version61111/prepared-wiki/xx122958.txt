Modern Life Is War is an American hardcore punk band originally from Marshalltown, Iowa. Formed in 2002, they are known for their incendiary live shows and unique take on the melodic hardcore and hardcore sound, usually avoiding standard songs structures and almost entirely abandoning the use of breakdowns. During Modern Life Is War's six-year original run, the band released three full-length albums and one self-titled 7" EP. Despite a growing profile on the underground hardcore circuit, and garnering critical acclaim from numerous musical outlets, Modern Life Is War announced their dissolution in early 2008. The band reunited in 2012.

==History==

Modern Life Is War's self-titled 7-inch E.P. was released through Lifeline Records in early 2002. Their two subsequent studio albums, 2003's My Love. My Way. and 2005's Witness are now available through the Deathwish Inc. record label, which is owned and operated by Converge singer Jacob Bannon.
In mid-2005, after the release of Witness, guitarist Matt Hoffman and bassist Chris Honeck left the band. They were replaced by Sjarm 13 and Tim Churchman, respectively. On February 9, 2007, M.L.I.W. announced that they had inked a record deal with Equal Vision Records. The band's third full length album, Midnight in America, was released on August 21, 2007 to positive reviews.
On February 19, 2008, the band announced on their Myspace page that they would be breaking up, and that they were planning one final American tour, starting March 29 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and reconvening on April 26 in the band's hometown of Marshalltown. In a separate interview conducted several weeks before the tour, the band members discussed their hopes and achievements in playing together for the last six years: 
 "I hope that we have made some people feel less alone. I hope we have motivated people to think for themselves; to be themselves and to take action. Punk rock changed our lives, and I hope that we as a band contributed something to keep the whole thing going. We are leaving soon, but the future is unwritten..."
In September 2012, the original lineup reunited and wrote an album in John Eich's basement. Modern Life Is War formally announced its reunion in April 2013 and the intent to record and release the new album through Deathwish by September 2013. The band didn't expect to heavily tour during the reunion; as of April 2013, Modern Life Is War were only booked to headline This Is Hardcore Festival and a record release show.[tpl]cite web| last = Wisniewski| first = Kira| title = Modern Life Is War returns| work = Punknews.org| date = April 1, 2013| url = http://www.punknews.org/article/51127/modern-life-is-war-returns| accessdate = April 2, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web| last = Adams| first = Gregory| title = Modern Life Is War Reunites for This Is Hardcore Fest, Reveal Plans for New LP| work = Exclaim!| date = April 1, 2013| url = http://exclaim.ca/News/modern_life_is_war_reunites_for_this_is_hardcore_fest_reveal_plans_for_new_lp| accessdate = April 2, 2013[/tpl] Retrospectively, Modern Life Is War wished they hadn't broken up, but instead scaled back their efforts so they could do it, "without so much stress and life crushing commitment."[tpl]cite web| last = Bourque| first = Zach| title = Modern Life Is War: They Lost The Battle But Won The War| work = LA Weekly| publisher = Voice Media Group| date = November 25, 2013| url = http://blogs.laweekly.com/westcoastsound/2013/11/modern_life_is_war.php| accessdate = December 5, 2013[/tpl] The band released their fourth studio album Fever Hunting on September 9, 2013 through Deathwish, which was produced by Kurt Ballou of Converge.[tpl]cite web| last = Adams| first = Gregory| title = Modern Life Is War Detail 'Fever Hunting'| work = Exclaim!| date = July 15, 2013| url = http://exclaim.ca/News/modern_life_is_war_detail_fever_hunting| accessdate = July 16, 2013[/tpl] Modern Life Is War embarked on a six-date tour in celebration of the new album in October 2013.[tpl]cite web| last = Paul| first = Aubin| title = Tours: Modern Life is War (Record Release)| work = Punknews.org| date = July 29, 2013| url = http://www.punknews.org/article/52420/tours-modern-life-is-war-record-release| accessdate = December 5, 2013[/tpl]
