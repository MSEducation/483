Pedro Pablo ''Petero'' Edmunds Paoa (born 1 July 1961) is a Chilean Christian Democratic politician. He served as the Governor of the Easter Island Province from March 2010 to August 2010. He was previously mayor of Easter Island Commune.
He recently threatened the Chilean government with the unilateral independence, in response to the attempt to launch a casino in Easter Island, without the approval of the population.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2010[/tpl]
He is a supporter of the island autonomy from Valparaíso region, saying this would allow islanders to handle the problems locally rather than rely on an official "more than 4000 kilometers and you do not know the island".Pascuenses claman por autonomia (Article in Spanish), El Mercurio, 6 September 2004
His appointment as Easter Island governor sparked protests from indigenous Polynesians on the island, who feared he planned land deals. In response the "Rapa Nui Parliament", a group of indigenous Polynesians, occupied government buildings, demanded Paoa's resignation and wrote to the Pacific Islands Forum saying they wanted to secede from Chile.Easter Island's indigenous leaders want to sever link with Chile, The Guardian, 13 August 2010 Edmunds resigned from office in early August 2010.Easter Island's governor quits ahead of push to join Oceania, Radio Australia News, 17 August 2010[tpl]cite news|first=|last=|title=Gobernador de Isla de Pascua presentó su renuncia al cargo |url=http://www.cooperativa.cl/prontus_nots/site/artic/20100809/pags/20100809182908.html/125234.html |work=Radio Cooperativa |publisher=|date=9 August 2010 |accessdate=6 June 2012[/tpl] He was temporarily replaced by Jorge Miranda, a lawyer, as interim governor following his resignation.
