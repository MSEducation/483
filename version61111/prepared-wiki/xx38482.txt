The Kinsey scale, also called the Heterosexual–Homosexual Rating Scale,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/research/ak-hhscale.html|title=Kinsey's Heterosexual–Homosexual Rating Scale|publisher=The Kinsey Institute|accessdate=8 September 2011[/tpl] attempts to describe a person's sexual experience or response at a given time. It uses a scale from 0, meaning exclusively heterosexual, to 6, meaning exclusively homosexual. In both the Male and Female volumes of the Kinsey Reports, an additional grade, listed as "X", was used to mean "no socio-sexual contacts or reactions"; in modern times, this represents asexuality.(Male volume, Table 141; Female volume, page 472)[tpl]cite book|authors =Mary Zeiss Stange, Carol K.

==Overview==

Introducing the scale, Kinsey wrote:

Today, many sexologists see the Kinsey scale as relevant to sexual orientation but not comprehensive enough to cover all sexual identity issues. They suggest that sexual identity involves at least three different spectra, sexual orientation being only one of them (two others being biological sex and gender identity).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/sexual-orientation-gender-4329.htm |title=Sexual Orientation & Gender |publisher=Planned Parenthood |date= |accessdate=2012-09-06[/tpl]
There have been similar studies where the scale is from 0 to 10. In such studies, the person would be asked a question such as "If 0 is completely gay and 10 is completely hetero, what is your orientation number?".Sexuality Now: Embracing Diversity (2006) - Janbell L Caroll

==Table of the scale==

The Kinsey scale ranges from 0, for those who would identify themselves as exclusively heterosexual with no experience with or desire for sexual activity with their same sex, to 6, for those who would identify themselves as exclusively homosexual with no experience with or desire for sexual activity with those of the opposite sex, and 1-5 for those who would identify themselves with varying levels of desire for sexual activity with either sex, including "incidental" or "occasional" desire for sexual activity with the same sex.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/research/ak-hhscale.html |title=Kinsey Sexuality Rating Scale |publisher=The Kinsey Institute |date= |accessdate=2013-12-02[/tpl]

==Alternate measures of sexual orientation==

The Kinsey Scale does not address all possible sexual expressions.  Others have stepped forward to define it further. In 1980, Michael Storms proposed a two dimensional chart with an X and Y axis.[tpl]cite web|title=Evaluation of Models of Sexual Orientation|url=http://www.uwlax.edu/pridecenter/images/101/Eval%20of%20Models%20of%20Sexual%20Orientation.pdf|publisher=University of Wisconsin–La Crosse|accessdate=September 6, 2012|format=PDF[/tpl] This scale took into account the case of asexuality and the simultaneous expression of hetero-eroticism and homo-eroticism.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.siue.edu/~cbwilso/203misc4.jpg |title=Graph of Michael Storm Scale versus Kinsey Scale |publisher=Southern Illinois University Edwardsville |date= |accessdate=2012-09-06[/tpl] Fritz Klein, in his Klein Sexual Orientation Grid, included factors such as how orientation can change throughout a person's lifetime, as well as emotional and social orientation.[tpl]cn|date=November 2013[/tpl]
Kinsey, Storm, and Klein are only three of more than 200 scales to measure and describe sexual orientation.[tpl]cite book|title=Handbook of Sexuality-Related Measures|year=2000|publisher=Sage|isbn=978-1-4129-1336-2|url=http://books.google.com/books/about/Handbook_of_Sexuality_Related_Measures.html?id=EFPs55zfAKcC|author=Clive M. Davis, William L. Yarber, Robert Bauserman, George Schreer, Sandra L. Davis[/tpl] For example, there are scales that rate homosexual behaviors from 1 to 14, and measures for gender, masculinity, femininity, and transsexualism.[tpl]cite web|title=Kinsey's Heterosexual-Homosexual Rating Scale|url=http://www.iub.edu/~kinsey/research/ak-hhscale.html|publisher=The Kinsey Institute|accessdate=September 6, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=Handbook of Sexuality-Related Measures|year=2000|publisher=Sage|isbn=978-1-4129-1336-2|page=137|url=http://books.google.com/books/about/Handbook_of_Sexuality_Related_Measures.html?id=EFPs55zfAKcC|author=Clive M.
