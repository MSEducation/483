[[L-kick]]

CATEGORIES: Capoeira

An L-kick is a movement in capoeira, breakdancing and other martial arts and dance forms. It is executed by throwing the body into a cartwheel motion, but rather than completing the wheel, the body flexes while supported by one hand on the ground.  One leg is brought downwards and forwards in a kicking motion while the other remains in the air (giving rise to the name). The kick is sometimes held, like a freeze, then returned to standing.
Variations include a shotgun kick, in which the non-kicking leg is bent dramatically towards the body so that the legs resemble a shotgun shape, an elbow L-kick where the kick is supported by the elbow and forearm placed on the ground rather than just a hand, and a capoeira switch where L-kicks are performed with first one leg then the other, in different directions and without landing the cartwheel motion.
The move was introduced to the b boy world by Chris Gatdula aka Cristyle of the acclaimed dance group Jabbawockeez.
