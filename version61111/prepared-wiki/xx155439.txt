Avenue Road tram stop is a light rail stop in the London Borough of Bromley in the southern suburbs of London. It is located on Avenue Road in a mainly residential area between Penge and Beckenham.
The tram stop is served by Tramlink route 2, which connects central Croydon with Beckenham. 
The tram stop is situated on a short passing loop within an otherwise single track section of Tramlink, where that system runs alongside the National Rail line between Crystal Palace and Beckenham Junction stations. The  tram stop has platforms on each side of the two tracks of the loop. The National Rail line passes behind the northernmost of these platforms, but there is no platform on that line.
