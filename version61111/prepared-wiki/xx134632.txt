==Club career==

Born in Bilbao, Biscay, Casas came through the ranks of Athletic de Bilbao and made his professional debuts during the 2004–05 season. He gained first-choice status the following campaign after the departure of Asier del Horno to Chelsea, managing 24 league appearances and scoring twice during the season, at Getafe CF (1–1 draw)Getafe 1–1 Athletic Bilbao; ESPN Soccernet, 11 September 2005 and Deportivo de La Coruña (2–1 win).Deportivo La Coruña 1–2 Athletic Bilbao; ESPN Soccernet, 7 May 2006
Ironically, Casas was left out of the first-team squad at the start of 2007–08, after Athletic re-signed del Horno on loan from Valencia CF. Unable to find a new club in the January 2008 transfer window, and still without a squad number at Athletic, he was not eligible to play competitively during the entire season, but was reinstated for the following campaign, appearing in the 1–3 home loss against UD Almería on 31 August 2008.Athletic Bilbao 1–3 Almeria; ESPN Soccernet, 31 August 2008
However, due to the permanence of veteran Koikili and the emergence of Real Sociedad youth graduate Mikel Balenziaga, Casas' opportunities were few and so, on 13 January 2009, he was loaned to Córdoba CF, which was then struggling in the second division, until the end of the season, where he appeared very rarely.
Casas was released by Athletic in June 2009, joining FC Cartagena – recently promoted to the second level – on a free transfer.El Cartagena ficha a Javi Casas (Cartagena signs Javi Casas); Marca, 27 June 2009 [tpl]es icon[/tpl] Second-choice to Rafael Clavero and third after the signing in January 2010 of French Franck Signorino from Getafe, he was released, moving to lowly CD Guijuelo.Casas se despacha a gusto contra Caparrós (Casas fires at will against Caparrós); El Athletic Club, 30 June 2012 [tpl]es icon[/tpl]
