Ralph E. Griswold (May 19, 1934, Modesto, CA – October 4, 2006, Tucson, AZ) was a computer scientist known for his research into high-level programming languages and symbolic computation. His language credits include the string processing language  SNOBOL,[tpl]cite book |last1=Griswold |first1=Ralph E. |last2=Poage |first2=J.F. |last3=Polonsky |first3=Ivan P. |title=The SNOBOL 4 Programming Language |publisher=Prentice-Hall |location=Englewood Cliffs NJ |year=1971 |isbn=0-13-815373-6 |edition=2nd [/tpl] SL5,[tpl]cite journal |last1=Griswold |first1=Ralph E. |last2=Hanson |first2=David R. |title=An overview of SL5 |journal=ACM SIGPLAN Notices |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=40–50 |date=April 1977 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last1=Griswold |first1=Ralph E. |last2=Hanson |first2=David R. |title=The SL5 procedure mechanism |journal=Communications of the ACM |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=392–400 |date=May 1978 |url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=359502[/tpl] and Icon.[tpl]cite book |last1=Griswold |first1=Ralph E. |last2=Griswold |first2=Madge T. |chapter=History of the Icon programming language |editor1-last=Bergin |editor1-first=Thomas J. |editor2-last=Gibson |editor2-first=Richard G. |title=History of Programming Languages II |publisher=ACM Press |location=New York NY |year=1996 [/tpl]
He attended Stanford University, receiving a bachelor's degree in physics, then an M.S. and Ph.D. in electrical engineering. Griswold went to Bell Labs in 1962, where he studied ideas for non-numerical computation. SNOBOL was the outcome; it was a radically different language in its time and still is. He became the head of the Labs' Programming Research and Development department in 1967.
In 1971, he was hired by the University of Arizona to be its first professor of computer science, subsequently organized the department, and was its head until 1981. While at Arizona, Griswold developed Icon.  The earlier Ratfor implementation of Icon was discarded and the language rewritten from scratch in C and UNIX.[tpl]cite journal |author=Shapiro, E. |title=SNOBOL and Icon: Language Designer Ralph Griswold Looks at His Language |journal=Byte |volume=10 |issue=7 |pages=341–6 |date=July 1985 [/tpl]
In 1990 Griswold was appointed Regents' Professor, and he retired in 1995. "As one of the founders of the Bell Labs software culture which spawned UNIX, C, and many other essential contributions to modern software, Ralph Griswold brought to his academic research not only brilliance, but also experience and a value system that demanded that research ideas be tested by fire and proven useful and usable by real users, not just good-looking diagrams in academic papers."[tpl]cite web |author=Jeffery, Clinton L. |title=The Icon Language Family |year=2004 |work=CS 580: Compiler Construction Lecture Notes |publisher=New Mexico State University |location=Las Cruces NM |url=http://www.cs.nmsu.edu/~jeffery/courses/580/lecture.html[/tpl]
After his retirement, his interests turned to the mathematical aspects of weaving.Ralph Griswold 1934–2006, retrospective at University of ArizonaOn-Line Digital Archive of Documents on Weaving and Related Topics

Griswold's son, Bill Griswold, is also a computer scientist.
