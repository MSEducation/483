[[The Square, Bournemouth]]

CATEGORIES: Geography of Bournemouth, Squares in England

The Square is a public square that marks the centre of Bournemouth, England.  It has been almost totally pedestrianised since 2000.  Prior to this it was a large roundabout.

==History==

In the 18th century Decoy Pond House stood at the point where a plank was used to cross the Bourne Steam on the track from Poole to Christchurch.
The site of the birthplace of the composer Hubert Parry next door to The Square is marked with a blue plaque.

==Present day==

It has many shops, and in the middle is the Obscura caf√©, so called because it incorporates a camera obscura.  The latter is no longer in use.
The Square separates the Central Gardens from the Lower Gardens.
The River Bourne flows under the Square.
