==Lincoln Catafalque==

In the United States, the Lincoln catafalque,[tpl]cite book|author=William Turner Coggeshall|title=Lincoln Memorial: The Journeys of Abraham Lincoln: from Springfield to Washington, 1861, as President Elect; and from Washington to Springfield, 1865, as President Martyred; Comprising an Account of Public Ceremonies on the Entire Route, and Full Details of Both Journeys|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9f_s-CHjYn8C&pg=PA277|year=1865|publisher=Ohio State Journal|pages=277–[/tpl] first used for Abraham Lincoln's funeral in 1865, has been used for all those who have lain in state in the Capitol Rotunda since Lincoln's death. When not in use, the catafalque is kept on display in the Exhibition Hall at the United States Capitol Visitor Center. 
Lincoln's catafalque was last used on June 6, 2013 for Senator Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey. 
It was noted by commentators that the structure of the original pine timbers and boards has been reinforced, albeit being left 'original'.According to Robert Cromie in his book The Great Chicago Fire, copyright 1958, Lincoln's catafalque was in Woods' Museum in Chicago and was burned in that fire in 1871. However, Lincoln had funeral ceremonies during stops at several major cities as his remains were taken by train from Washington to Springfield, Illinois for burial. Cromie probably meant the catafalque used for ceremonies held at Chicago, rather than the one built for his state funeral in DC and retained at the U.S. Capitol.
