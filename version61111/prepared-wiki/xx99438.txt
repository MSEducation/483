Sir John Warcup "Kappa" Cornforth, Jr.,John Cornforth, NNDB AC, CBE, FRS, FAA (7 September 1917 – 8 December 2013), was an Australian[tpl]Ndash[/tpl]British chemist who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1975 for his work on the stereochemistry of enzyme-catalysed reactions.[tpl]cite doi|10.1038/506035a|noedit[/tpl]Encyclopædia Britannica. (2012.) "Sir John Cornforth".
Cornforth investigated enzymes that catalyse changes in organic compounds, the substrates, by taking the place of hydrogen atoms in a substrate's chains and rings. In his syntheses and descriptions of the structure of various terpenes, olefins, and steroids, Cornforth determined specifically which cluster of hydrogen atoms in a substrate were replaced by an enzyme to effect a given change in the substrate, allowing him to detail the biosynthesis of cholesterol.Deaf Scientist Corner - John Warcup Cornforth, Texas Woman's University For this work, he won a share of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1975, alongside co-recipient Vladimir Prelog, and was knighted in 1977.John Cornforth, Royal Institution of Australia

==Early life==

Born in Sydney, New South Wales, Cornforth was the son and the second of four children of English-born, Oxford-educated schoolmaster and teacher John Warcup Cornforth and Hilda Eipper (1887–1969), a granddaughter of pioneering missionary and Presbyterian minister Christopher Eipper. Before her marriage, Eipper had been a maternity nurse.Sir John Cornforth - Chemistry, The University of Sydney
Cornforth was raised in Sydney as well as Armidale, in the north of New South Wales,John Cornforth - Autobiography, NobelPrize.org where he undertook primary school education.
At about 10 years old,Jim Eckert writes about the Cornforths, The University of Sydney Cornforth had noted signs of deafness, which led to a diagnosis of otosclerosis, a disease of the inner ear which causes progressive hearing loss. This would leave him completely deaf by the age of 20 but also fatefully influence his career direction towards chemistry.John Cornforth, biotechnology-innovation.com.au

==Education==

Cornforth was educated at Sydney Boys' High School, whereat he academically excelled, having passed in English, mathematics, science, French, Greek, and Latin,Sperans. (1932.) "Bright students: intermediate stage", The Sydney Morning Herald, 18 January. and was inspired by his chemistry teacher, Leonard ("Len") Basser,Doherty P. C. (2006.)

Cornforth graduated as the dux of the class of 1933 at Sydney Boys' High School, at the age of 16.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sydney.edu.au/science/chemistry/enewsletters/fund_profiles/cornforth_fund_profile.html|title=Jim Eckert writes about the Cornforth|first=Jim|last=Eckert|publisher=University of Sydney School of Chemistry[/tpl]
In 1934, Cornforth matriculated and studied at the University of Sydney,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/comment/obituaries/john-cornforth-brilliant-chemist-was-profoundly-deaf-20131213-2zcou.html|title=John Cornforth: Brilliant chemist was profoundly deaf|date=14 December 2013|work=The Sydney Morning Herald[/tpl] where he studied organic chemistry at the University of Sydney's School of Chemistry and from which he graduated with a Bachelor of Science with First-Class Honours and the University Medal in 1937.Nobel Laureates - Chemistry, The University of Sydney During his studies, his hearing became progressively worse, thus making listening to lectures difficult.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl] At the time, he could not use hearing aids as the sound became distorted, and he did not significantly use lip reading.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl]
While studying at the University of Sydney, Cornforth met his future wife, fellow chemist, and scientific collaborator, Rita Harradence. Harradence was a graduate of St George Girls High School[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sgghs.com.au/our-school/our-archives/old-girls/page:2|title=Notable Old Girls - History of St George Girls High School - Our School|publisher=St George Girls High School[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://sydney.edu.au/science/chemistry/aboutus/history_articles/history_thecornforths.html|title=History - Chemistry - The Cornforths|publisher=The University of Sydney[/tpl] and a distinguished academic achieverThe Sydney Morning Herald.

In 1939, Cornforth and Harradence, independently of each other, each won one of two Science Research Scholarships (the 1851 Research Fellowship) from the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851,[tpl]cite web|url=http://alumni.royalcommission1851.org/page/history|title=Award History|publisher=1851 Alumni of the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851[/tpl] tenable overseas for two years. At the University of Oxford, they were members of St. Catherine's College[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.stcatz.ox.ac.uk/node/584|title=Sir John Cornforth 1917 - 2013|publisher=St Catherine's College, Oxford[/tpl] and worked with Sir Robert Robinson, with whom they would collaborate for 14 years. During his time at Oxford, Cornforth found working for and with Robinson stimulating, and the two would often deliberate to no end until one had a cogent case against the other's counterargument.Hargittai I. and Hargittai M. (2000.) Candid Science: Conversations with Famous Chemists, Imperial College Press, London, United Kingdom. ISBN 1860942288.

==Career==

After his arrival at Oxford and during World War II, Cornforth significantly influenced the work on penicillin, particularly in purifying and concentrating it. Penicillin is usually very unstable in its crude form; as a consequence of this, researchers at the time were building upon Howard Florey's work on the drug. In 1940, Cornforth and other chemists measured the yield of penicillin in arbitrary units to understand the conditions that favoured penicillin production and activity, and he contributed to the authoring of The Chemistry of Penicillin.Clarke H. T., Johnson J. R., Robinson R (eds.). (1949.) The Chemistry of Penicillin, Princeton University Press, NJ.
In 1946, Cornforth and his wife, Rita, left Oxford and joined the Medical Research Council, working at the National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR), where they continued on earlier work in synthesising sterols, including cholesterol. The Cornforths collaboration with Robinson continued and flourished. In 1951, they completed, simultaneously with Woodward, the first total synthesis of the non-aromatic steroids. At the NIMR, Cornforth collaborated with numerous biological scientists, including George Popják,[tpl]cite doi|10.1161/01.ATV.19.4.830|noedit[/tpl] with whom he shared an interest in cholesterol. Together, they received the Davy Medal in 1968 in recognition of their distinguished joint work on the elucidation of the biosynthetic pathway to polyisoprenoids and steroids.
In 1975, Cornforth was awarded a share of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, alongside Vladimir Prelog. Also in 1975, he had moved to Sussex University as a Royal Society Research Professor.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]
In 1977, Cornforth was recognised by his alma mater, the University of Sydney, with the award of an honorary Doctor of Science.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sydney.edu.au/alumni/our-alumni/prominent-alumni.shtml|title=Prominent Alumni|publisher=University of Sydney[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://sydney.edu.au/news/84.html?newsstoryid=12859|title=Mourning the loss of Australia's only Nobel prize winner in Chemistry, Sir John Warcup Cornforth|first=Kirsten|last=Andrews|date=17 December 2013|publisher=University of Sydney[/tpl]

==Personal life==

In 1941, the year in which they graduated from the University of Oxford, Cornforth married Rita Harriet Harradence (b. 1915),[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eoas.info/biogs/P004913b.htm|title=Cornforth, Rita (1915–2012)|publisher=Encyclopedia of Australian Science[/tpl] with whom he would have one son and two daughters, John and Brenda and Philippa, respectively.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/10547687/Sir-John-Cornforth-obituary.html|title=Sir John Cornforth|work=The Telegraph|date=9 January 2014[/tpl] Cornforth met Harradence after she had broken a Claisen flask in their second year at the University; Cornforth, with his expertise of glassblowing and the use of a blowpipe, mended the break.[tpl]cite web|url=http://vega.org.uk/video/internal/8|title=Kappa interviewed by Bob Thomas|publisher=The Vega Science Trust[/tpl] Rita Cornforth died on 6 November 2012,[tpl]cite web|url=http://sydney.edu.au/science/chemistry/enewsletters/2013/issue-22-2013/ritacornforth.html|title=Obituary: Dr Lady Rita Cornforth|publisher=University of Sydney[/tpl] at home with her family around her,[tpl]cite web|url=http://announce.jpress.co.uk/21321771|title=Lady Rita Harriet Cornforth: Obituary|publisher=Announce.Jpress[/tpl] following a long illness.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.sussex.ac.uk/suss-ex/Newsletter29.html|title=Newsletter No. 29|publisher=The Suss-Ex Club|year=2014[/tpl]
Both John and Rita Cornforth were good friends with fellow Australian and University of Sydney classmate (though John was in the year after Rita and Birch; Rita and Birch were contemporaries), and University of Oxford colleague of Arthur John Birch, who was known for contributions including the Birch reduction.Australian Academy of Science - Biographical Memoirs: Arthur Birch
On an important author or paper that was integral to his success, Cornforth stated that he was particularly impressed by the works of German chemist Hermann Emil Fischer.
