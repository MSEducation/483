The Glasscock County Courthouse is an historic courthouse building located  in Garden City, Glasscock County, Texas. Built in 1909 to 1910 at a cost of $28,000, it was designed by Georgia-born American architect Edward Columbus Hosford, who is noted for the  courthouses and other buildings that he designed in Florida, Georgia and Texas. It was built of granite and rusticated stone with gable front porticoes on all sides, each of which is supported by four 2-story Doric columns. Unlike the Mason County Courthouse also designed by Hosford  and built at the same time for $39,786, the Glasscock County Courthouse has no clock tower cupola in the center of its roof and its side porticoes are smaller than the other two.
