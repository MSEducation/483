==Electoral apportionment==

Based on data from the decennial census, each state is allocated a proportion of the 435 seats in the United States House of Representatives, although each state is guaranteed a minimum of one seat, regardless of population. This apportionment is based on the proportion of each state's population to that of the Fifty States together (without regard to the populations of the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or other U.S. dependencies). The Electoral College is the body that, every four years, elects the president and vice president of the United States. Each state's representation in the Electoral College is equal to that state's total number of members in both houses of the United States Congress. The Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution grants the District of Columbia, which is separate from any state, three votes. More precisely, it gets as many votes in the Electoral College as it would have if it were a state, but no more votes than the state with the fewest votes, which is currently three (e.g. Wyoming). Thus, the total representation in the College is 538 members (equal to 100 senators plus 435 representatives, plus 3 members for the District of Columbia).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/procedural_guide.html|title=A Procedural Guide to the Electoral College|publisher=National Archives and Records Administration|author=Office of the Federal Register|accessdate=2010-08-13[/tpl] The 11 most populous states, representing 56% of the population, have a majority of the Electoral College votes, enough to elect the president.
