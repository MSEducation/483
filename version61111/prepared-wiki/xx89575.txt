==Government career==

Hodel served as United States Secretary of Energy from 1982 to 1985, and the Secretary of the Interior from 1985 to 1989 under President Ronald Reagan.  Prior to that he was Undersecretary of the Interior under James Watt.
Critics disrupted his efforts to impose a new management policy on a large amount of federal land, and blocked his efforts to create vast new wilderness areas. In spite of these criticisms, the Reagan Administration Secretaries added over two million acres (8,000 km²) to the national wilderness system. The Hodel policy was continued under Manuel Lujan Jr. (1989–93)  in the Bush Administration. It was finally rescinded in 1997 by Secretary Bruce Babbitt. 
In an article, Hodel wrote, "Throughout President Reagan's eight years, his secretaries of the Interior pursued these objectives within the framework of his and their conviction that America could have both an improving environment and an adequate energy supply.  We did not and do not have to choose between them, as some have contended. . . ."[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2010[/tpl]
While secretary, Hodel proposed to undertake a study on the removal of the O'Shaughnessy Dam in Yosemite National Park, and the restoration of Hetch Hetchy Valley, a smaller, but inundated version of Yosemite Valley. Senator Dianne Feinstein, former mayor of San Francisco, which owns the dam, however, opposed the study and had it quashed.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2010[/tpl]
In March 1984, the Navajo Nation requested that the Secretary of the Interior, who was then William Clark, make a reasonable adjustment of the coal lease royalty rate paid by Peabody Coal, now Peabody Energy. In July 1985, newly appointed Hodel secretly met ex parte with Peabody’s representative (“a former aide and friend of Secretary Hodel.”). Then after very briefly reviewing the merits of the proposals, Hodel approved lease amendments with royalty rates well below the rate that had previously been determined appropriate by those agencies responsible for monitoring the federal government’s relations with Native Americans. In 2007, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit determined that these actions by Hodel breached the government's duty of trust to the Nation and established a "cognizable money-mandating claim" against the government under the Indian Tucker Act.(The Navajo Nation v United States, No. 2006-5059, USCA Fed. Cir., September 13, 2007 http://www.fedcir.gov/opinions/06-5059.pdf)
