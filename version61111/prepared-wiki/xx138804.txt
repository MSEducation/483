CATEGORIES: Ports and harbours of Maharashtra

Rewas is one of 48 “minor” ports of Maharashtra located near Karanja creek at mouth of the Patalganga River about [tpl]convert|10|km|mi|0[/tpl] southward of Jawaharlal Nehru Port (JNPT) and [tpl]convert|16|km|mi[/tpl] south-east of Mumbai Port. It is controlled by the state government through an agency known as the “Maharashtra Maritime Board”.

==History==

Meka Vijay Paparao discovered the location in 1996. In 1997 the state government signed an MOU with Paparao's company Amma Lines for development of Rewas and Avare for a multi-cargo deep draft all-weather port. In 2002, the cabinet signed a concession agreement for 50 years with Amma Lines to develop this port on a Build, Operate, Own, Share and Transfer (BOOST) basis for handling container traffic.  It formed an SPV known as Rewas Ports Ltd. for the purpose. With a starting investment of US$400 million and ultimate of about 1 billion US$1.3 Billion (Rs 6600 Crore), it is ultimately planned to have over 50 berths with a draft as deep as [tpl]convert|13|to|18|m|ft[/tpl].
In 2006, Amma Lines sold a majority stake to Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Group and Anand Jain's Jai Corp. The state government of Maharashtra also has a minor stake in the port.
To start with, the port will have a [tpl]convert|13|m|ft|adj=on[/tpl] dredged draft, 10 berths with a total quay length of [tpl]convert|3500|m|ft[/tpl].
The project received Environmental Clearance from the Ministry of Environment & Forests, Government of India in May 2007 and also completed Financial Closure for the USD $1.3 billion project.
The port is due to be commissioned in 2011 and due for completion in 2012 with a draft of [tpl]convert|18|m|ft[/tpl]. The cargo to be handled here will be containers, iron ore, coal and other solid and liquid bulk cargo. There is also a proposal to develop a large dry dock and shipyard and ship repair facility. It is in the Raigad district of Maharashtra, India and is [tpl]convert|11|nmi|km[/tpl] from Mumbai.

==Second airport site for the Mumbai Metropolitan region==

The Union Ministry of Environment and Forests had raised objections to the proposed location of the Navi Mumbai International airport near Kopra Panvel  because the construction of the airport would involve reclamation of low-lying areas in an ecologically fragile zone as well as destruction of several hectares of mangroves. As a result of these developments other locations including Rewas were considered.
The proposed airport site centered around the region of Rewas and Mandwa near Alibaug was thought to be the most suitable barring excessive financial cost for building a bridge over Karanja Creek to connect the Uran–JNPT area to the proposed airport at Rewas Mandwa. Its distance of only [tpl]convert|20|nmi|km[/tpl] by sea made it a viable location. However, the site was rejected in 2010 after considering the high capital cost, destruction of scenic coastal environment, rehabilitation of 14 villages, strong local opposition and the presence of the Indian Navy base in the area.[tpl]cite news |title=Navi Mumbai best option for airport, river diversion not harmful: green report |url=http://expressindia.indianexpress.com/latest-news/navi-mumbai-best-option-for-airport-river-diversion-not-harmful-green-report/649549/ |work= Express India |date=21 July 2010 |accessdate=25 May 2013 [/tpl]
