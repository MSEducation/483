[[B minor]]

CATEGORIES: Musical keys, Minor scales, Compositions in B minor

B minor is a minor scale consisting of the pitches B, C[tpl]music|sharp[/tpl], D, E, F[tpl]music|sharp[/tpl], G, and A. Its key signature consists of two sharps. The harmonic minor raises the note A to A[tpl]music|sharp[/tpl]. Changes needed for the melodic and harmonic versions of the scale are written with accidentals as necessary.
Its relative major is D major, and its parallel major is B major.
Christian Friedrich Daniel Schubart (1739–1791) regarded B minor as a key expressing a quiet acceptance of fate and very gentle complaint, something commentators find to be in line with Bach's use of the key in the St John Passion.Tusa, pp. 2–3, n. 5 By Beethoven's time, however, the perception of B minor had changed considerably: Francesco Galeazzi wrote that B minor was not suitable for music in good taste, and Beethoven labelled a B minor melodic idea in one of his sketchbooks as a "black key".Tusa, p. 2, n. 3
