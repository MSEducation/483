[[Design classic]]

CATEGORIES: Design

A design classic is an industrially manufactured object with timeless aesthetic value. It serves as a standard of its kind and, despite the year in which it was designed, is still up to date.[tpl]cite web|title=Phaidon Design Classics|url=http://www.phaidon.co.uk/store/design/phaidon-design-classics-9780714843995/|publisher=Phaidon|accessdate=22 September 2011[/tpl]

For an object to become a design classic it takes time and what lasting impact the design had on society and what influence on later designs it had plays a large role in determining whether something is a design classic or not. Thus design classics are often strikingly simple, going to the essence, and are described with words like iconic, neat, valuable or having meaning.for example a vacuum cleaner is now known as a hoover of which is not the vacuum cleaner's name instead this is the surname of the inventor William Henry Hoover
