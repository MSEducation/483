Nathan Freudenthal Leopold, Jr. (November 19, 1904 – August 29, 1971)NATHAN LEOPOLD (1904-1971), Social Security Death Index and Richard Albert Loeb (June 11, 1905 – January 28, 1936), more commonly known as "Leopold and Loeb", were two wealthy University of Chicago law students who kidnapped and murdered 14-year-old Robert "Bobby" Franks in 1924 in Chicago.Homicide in Chicago 1924 Leopold & Loeb Retrieved March 26, 2008.
The duo was motivated to murder Franks by their desire to commit a perfect crime.
Once apprehended, Leopold and Loeb retained Clarence Darrow as counsel for the defense. Darrow’s summation in their trial is noted for its influential criticism of capital punishment as retributive, rather than a rehabilitative penal system. Leopold and Loeb were sentenced to life imprisonment. Loeb was killed by a fellow prisoner in 1936; Leopold was released on parole in 1958.
Leopold and Loeb have been the inspiration for several works in film, theatre, and fiction, such as the 1929 play Rope by Patrick Hamilton, and Alfred Hitchcock's take on the play in the 1948 film of the same name. Later movies such as Compulsion and Swoon were more accurate portrayals of the Leopold and Loeb case.

Film from the early 1920s shows Leopold participating in the discovery. Leopold planned to transfer to Harvard Law School in September after taking a trip to Europe. He was thought of as having a brilliant mind, and few doubted that Leopold would succeed in life.

===Richard Loeb===

Richard Loeb was born on June 11, 1905, in Chicago to the family of Anna Henrietta (née Bohnen) and Albert Henry Loeb, a wealthy lawyer and vice president of Sears.[tpl]cite web|last=|first=|url=http://www.biography.com/people/richard-loeb-227821|title=Richard Loeb biography|work=The Biography Channel|quote =|year=2012|accessdate=2012-12-16[/tpl] His father was Jewish and his mother was Catholic.http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/famous/loeb/5d.html Like Leopold, Loeb was also exceptionally intelligent, and skipped several grades in school. However, Loeb was more focused on non academic activities. Loeb was the youngest graduate in the history of the University of Michigan and remains so to this day. Loeb planned to enter the University of Chicago Law School after taking some postgraduate courses.

==Lead up==

Both Leopold and Loeb lived in the affluent Kenwood neighborhood on Chicago's Southside, some six miles south of downtown. Loeb's father, Albert, began his career as a lawyer and became the vice president of Sears and Roebuck. Besides owning an impressive mansion in Kenwood, two blocks from the Leopold home, the Loeb family had a summer estate, Castle Farms, in Charlevoix, Michigan.
Although Leopold and Loeb knew each other casually while growing up, their relationship flourished when they met at the University of Chicago as teenagers. They quickly formed a strong friendship. Leopold and Loeb found that they had a mutual interest in crime, Leopold being particularly interested in Friedrich Nietzsche's theory of the superman. It was now that they began to look deeper into their criminal interests that the two boys began to commit crimes for themselves. Leopold agreed to act as Loeb's accomplice.[tpl]cite web|url=http://crimemagazine.com/leopold-and-loebs-perfect-crime-0|title=Leopold and Loeb's Perfect Crime|author=Denise Noe|work=Crime Magazine|date=February 29, 2004[/tpl] They began with petty theft and vandalism. They broke into a fraternity house at the university. They stole penknives, a camera and a typewriter (later used to type the ransom letter). Leopold and Loeb soon committed a series of more and more serious crimes such as arson.
The pair were disappointed when none of their crimes made their way into the papers. Leopold and Loeb then decided to commit a crime that would surely get the public talking. They began to plan out their perfect crime together.

==The Superman==

Because of Leopold's strong interest in Nietschze, Leopold and Loeb believed themselves to be Nietzschean supermen (Übermensch) who could commit a "perfect crime" (in this case, a kidnapping and murder).The Leopold and Loeb Trial:A Brief Account by Douglas O. Linder. 1997. Retrieved April 11, 2007. This theory suggested that superior minds could overcome the laws and regulations that bound the average man. The average man was inferior and was unimportant to those of superior qualities.
Because of his high intelligence, Leopold thought that he needed to show just how superior he really was. This theory fed Leopold with the will to prove himself to be a truly brilliant mind. Before the murder, Leopold had written to Loeb: "A superman ... is, on account of certain superior qualities inherent in him, exempted from the ordinary laws which govern men. He is not liable for anything he may do."Simon Baatz, For the Thrill of It. New York: Harper, 2008.

==Murder of Robert Franks==

Their small crimes weren't enough to thrill the two boys. They needed something bigger and much more thrilling. They began discussing their perfect crime. They planned to kidnap and murder a young boy at random. They would send the boy's family a ransom letter, although the crime wasn't for money. The two boys' families supplied them with more than enough money already. The ransom note was a mere prop for their crime. 
Leopold and Loeb spent seven months planning the murder. They covered everything from the disposal of the body to the murder weapon and how the ransom note was to be written. They also discussed the method of receiving ransom money with little or no risk of being caught.Statement of Nathan F. Leopold Northwestern University Retrieved October 30, 2007. They made sure that their plan would leave as little evidence as possible. Leopold was to hire a rental car for the murder. This is the vehicle into which the young boy would be lured and then killed. He used the fake name 'Morten D. Ballad' to hire the car. A chisel was purchased—this would be the murder weapon.
When Leopold and Loeb were certain that they had perfected their plans, they put their plot into motion on Wednesday, May 21, 1924. At this time, Leopold was 19 and Loeb was 18.
The pair drove around the Harvard School For Boys (closed 1962) in the Kenwood Area, Chicago,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM82VC_Leopold_Loeb_kill_Bobby_Franks_Chicago_IL|title=Leopold & Loeb kill Bobby Franks - Chicago, IL|work=Waymarking.com[/tpl] where Loeb himself had been educated. They were looking for a young boy that they would be able to kill. They spent much time both driving around and walking the grounds. They kept themselves hidden in fear of being seen. Leopold even admitted to have watched the boys from a distance using his bird viewing binoculars. After a search, the pair finally decided upon Robert "Bobby" Franks, the son of Chicago millionaire Jacob Franks. Loeb knew Bobby Franks well, for Bobby had played tennis at the Loeb residence several times. Their choice of victim was at random. Future Hollywood producer Armand Deutsch, the then 11-year-old grandson of Julius Rosenwald, later claimed that he might have been the intended victim of Loeb or Leopold. However, on the day of the murder, he was picked up by his family's chauffeur after school because he had a prior dental appointment.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/list/im/119im.php|title=New York Social Diary|accessdate=July 8, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/18/arts/18deutsch.html|title=Armand S. Deutsch, Hollywood fixture, dies at 92|author=Purdum, Todd S.|authorlink=Todd Purdum|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 18, 2005|accessdate=August 20, 2010[/tpl]
The car pulled up alongside little Franks, and he was offered a ride. At first he refused. However, Loeb pressed on and eventually convinced Bobby to ride with them because he wanted to discuss a tennis racket Bobby Franks had been using. The 14-year-old Bobby Franks, who was both the neighbor and second cousin of Richard Loeb, was lured into the passenger seat of their rented car. With Franks in the vehicle, either Loeb or Leopold drove (it is uncertain which) while the other sat in the back armed with the taped chisel. This was a weapon commonly chosen by Loeb.
It is still unknown exactly who struck Franks, but it is commonly believed that it was Loeb, striking Franks several times in the head with the chisel before dragging him into the back-seat of the car, while Leopold drove.  At this point, Loeb gagged Franks with a rag, and Franks lost consciousness soon thereafter.  After driving into the county near the Indiana line, they pulled the car over and Loeb moved from the back to the passenger seat as the body of the boy lay covered in the back of the car.Statement of Richard Loeb Northwestern University Retrieved October 30, 2007.
Leopold and Loeb had decided that they would hide the body near Wolf Lake in Hammond, Indiana. With the body on the floor of the car and covered out of view, the killers drove to their dumping spot. This was an area Leopold was very familiar with, for he had gone bird-watching there many times. The killers thought it was wise to choose a familiar area. Leopold and Loeb had their dinner at a small sandwich place. After finishing their meal, the two waited until night fall. When it was dark enough for them to proceed with the dumping of the body, Leopold and Loeb removed Franks's clothes and left them at the side of the road. They poured hydrochloric acidCrime Library – Enter Clarence Darrow. Retrieved March 26, 2008. on the face, genitals and a distinctive abdomen scar to make identification more difficult; the boy's circumcision would reveal him as Jewish. They concealed the body in a culvert at the Pennsylvania Railroad tracks near 118th street, north of Wolf Lake. They then left the scene and began to travel home.
By the time Leopold and Loeb returned to Chicago, word had already spread about Franks's disappearance. Leopold called Franks's mother and informed her that her son had been kidnapped. He used the name George Johnson when he called. The same name was used for the ransom note. They later mailed this ransom letter to the Franks family typed by a stolen typewriter. Leopold and Loeb burned their clothing spotted with blood. They also attempted to clean bloodstains from the upholstery of their rented automobile. The two then spent the rest of the evening playing cards.
It was the following morning that the Franks family received the ransom note. The same day, Leopold and Loeb called the Frankses a second time, instructing them to travel to a local drugstore where further instructions would be given to them. In the stress of the situation, the address of the store was forgotten by the receiver of the call. Before the Franks family could pay the ransom, Tony Minke, a Polish immigrant, came across the body which was later confirmed to be Bobby Franks. When Leopold and Loeb learned that the body had been found, they destroyed the typewriter used to write the ransom note and burned the robe used to move the body. Convinced that they had done everything they could to hide their tracks, Leopold and Loeb went about their lives as normal.
Police investigations were now widely spread around Chicago. Rewards were guaranteed to any members of the public who were able to provide the police with clues. Though Leopold went about his day to day routine quietly, Loeb involved himself in the police investigations as much as possible. He offered theories to reporters and whoever else would listen. He even went as far as to say "If I were to murder anybody, it would be such a cocky little son of a bitch as Bobby Franks".[tpl]cn|date=April 2014[/tpl]
For a while, the hunt for clues seemed hopeless. However, Detective Hugh Patrick Byrne, while searching for evidence, discovered a pair of eyeglasses near the body. Though common in prescription and frame, these glasses were equipped with an unusual hinge mechanism (patent 1,342,973Shreiner, E.E.; Hinge for eyeglass or spectacle frames; June 8, 1920; retrieved February 17, 2013; http://www.google.com/patents/US1342973). In Chicago, only three people had purchased glasses with such a mechanism, one of whom was Nathan Leopold.The Glasses: The Key Link to Leopold and Loeb UMKC Law. Retrieved April 11, 2007.  (Leopold's glasses are now in the Chicago History Museum.Yen, Johnny; "The Greatest Sin"; October 30, 2007; retrieved February 17, 2013; http://johnnyyen.blogspot.com/2007/10/greatest-sin.html) The destroyed typewriter used for the ransom note was also found soon after.
Upon being questioned, Leopold told police he had possibly lost the glasses while bird-watching the previous week.Chicago Daily News, June 2, 1924 It seemed possible. The detective asked Leopold to demonstrate how his glasses would have fallen from his pocket. Leopold suggested that he may have tripped on a tree root. He placed the glasses in his jacket pocket and threw himself onto the ground. Despite multiple tries, Leopold's glasses remained in place.[tpl]fact|date=April 2014[/tpl] Suspicions about the two boys began to circulate amongst the public.
Loeb was also taken in for questioning on May 29, 1924.Urbana Daily Courier, October 28, 1924 Loeb told the police that Leopold was with him the night of the murder. Leopold and Loeb claimed they had picked up two women (Edna and May) in Leopold's car and had dropped them off near a golf course, never learning their last names. They both insisted that they drove in Leopold's car. It seemed that they had actually begun to fool the police investigators. However, while the boys were being questioned, Leopold's chauffeur came by the police station to drop off pajamas and toiletry supplies if the police were to keep him there all night. As he was leaving, the chauffeur insisted that the boys could not have possibly been involved with the murder. He claimed that he was repairing Leopold's car at the time of the murder. To the chauffeur's logic, the boys could not have possibly driven anywhere, let alone as far as Wolf Lake. The chauffeur's wife later confirmed that the car had been in the Leopold garage that night. With their alibis broken, it was now certain that Leopold and Loeb had killed Franks.[tpl]fact|date=April 2014[/tpl]

==The confession==

Loeb confessed first. He covered every part of the crime in intense detail. He made sure that the police knew just how brilliantly the murder was planned. Loeb insisted that Leopold had planned everything. He claimed that Leopold was the one who sat in the back of the car and killed Bobby Franks. Loeb said that he drove the car. He made that aspect very clear to the police.
Leopold was next door to Loeb in another room at the time of the confession. While he was being questioned, Leopold still stuck by what he had told the police beforehand. However, when Leopold was informed that his partner had confessed, his confession swiftly followed.Chicago Daily News, September 10, 1924, pg.3 Just like Loeb, Leopold made sure that he told the police everything he could about the murder. Leopold also insisted that he was driving the car while Loeb sat in the back. He said that it was Loeb who killed Bobby, not he.  Although their confessions corroborated most of the facts in the case, each blamed the other for the actual killing. Most commentators believe that Loeb struck the blow that killed Franks. However, which of the two actually wielded the weapon that killed Franks would never be known. Psychiatrists at the trial, impressed by Leopold's intelligence, agreed that Loeb had struck the fatal blow. Nevertheless, the circumstantial evidence in the case, including eyewitness testimony by Carl Ulvigh (who saw Loeb driving with Leopold in the back seat minutes before the kidnapping), indicated that Leopold may have been the killer.Leopold, Loeb & The Crime of the Century, by Hal Higdon, pg 319

==The motive==

The ransom was not their primary motive; the young men's families provided them all the money that they needed. Both had admitted that they were driven by the thrill of the kill and the desire to commit the "perfect crime". The Superman theory may have only deepened the boys obsession with crime and caused them to think that they were above the law, and therefore could not be caught. The fact that two wealthy teenagers kidnapped and murdered a young boy at random confused, baffled and most of all angered the public.[tpl]fact|date=April 2014[/tpl]

==Trial==

Leopold and Loeb became the first criminals of the 20th century to achieve national notoriety. The trial became a media spectacle. Held at Courthouse Place, it was one of the first cases in the U.S. to be dubbed the "Trial of the Century".JURIST - The Trial of Leopold and Loeb, Prof. Douglas Linder. Retrieved November 1, 2007. 
Scared that their child would face the death sentence, Loeb's family hired 67-year-old Clarence Darrow—a well-known opponent of capital punishment—to defend the teenagers against the capital charges of murder and kidnapping.Gilbert Geis and Leigh B. Bienen, Crimes of the Century (Boston, 1998). Clarence Darrow was one of the best criminal lawyers in the country and rumors suggested that his fee was a million dollars. Some were amazed that he had accepted the case considering the physical evidence, confessions, and the nature of the crime that had been committed. There did not appear to be much hope left for Leopold and Loeb.
While the media expected Leopold and Loeb to plead not guilty by reason of insanity, Darrow changed the plea of his clients to plead guilty, in order to avoid the jury, which Darrow believed would most certainly have resulted in a conviction and perhaps even the death penalty. The case was heard by Cook County Circuit Court Judge John R. Caverly. Darrow believed Caverly to be a soft and concerned judge and he hoped that he would be able to convince him to let the boys off with a life sentence rather than death.

==The Alienists==

Both Darrow and the prosecution brought forth some of the county's best psychologists, or as they were known, alienists. Sigmund Freud was offered the job of analyzing Leopold and Loeb, but declined the offer due to health concerns.[tpl]cn|date=April 2014[/tpl] Crowe's alienists argued that the two boys were unusual but sane. Darrow's alienists claimed the opposite, arguing that the boys were driven by unusual and sickly desires (their obsessions with crime and their sexual relationship). 

==Darrow's speech==

During the 12-hour hearing on the final day, Darrow gave a speech that has been called the finest of his career-The Clarence Darrow Home Page, The Leopold and Loeb Trial Home Page, Prof. Douglas Linder. Retrieved March 7, 2012. and a "masterful plea."Urbana Daily Courier, September 10, 1924 It was aimed at the inhuman punishments and ways of the American justice system. The speech included the following:
Darrow's argument lasted for almost twelve hours. He touched on everything from the young age of his clients to the plea for mercy.
This was part of Darrow's court argument:

After Darrow's speech was finally over, the courtroom was left quiet and in awe. It was still uncertain whether the judge would waive the death penalty for the two boys.
In the end, Darrow succeeded. The judge sentenced Leopold and Loeb each to life imprisonment for the murder and 99 years each for the kidnapping. This was mainly on the grounds that, being under 21, Leopold and Loeb were legal minors. Shortly thereafter, on October 27, 1924, Loeb's father, Albert Henry Loeb, died of heart failure.Daily Illini, University of Illinois, October 28, 1924

==Prison==

Leopold and Loeb were initially held at Joliet Prison. Although they were kept apart as much as possible, the two managed to retain their relationship. Leopold was later transferred to Stateville Penitentiary. Loeb was soon transferred there as well. Once reunited, the two taught classes in the prison school.Leopold worked in the prison hospital and showed that he was the perfect model prisoner. He has also organised the prison library. Leopold later said that all his good work later in life was a way of making up for his earlier crime. Life & Death In Prison by Marilyn Bardsley. Crime Library — Courtroom Television Network, LLC. Retrieved April 11, 2007.

==Loeb's death==

Day claimed afterward that Loeb had attempted to sexually assault him. This however may have been the other way around. Rumors suggested that Day had desired sexual favors from Loeb who refused them to him. Many doubted that Day's story was true. It wasn't likely that he acted in self-defence. Day emerged without a scratch while Loeb sustained more than 50 wounds from the attack, including numerous self-defense wounds on his arms and hands. Loeb's throat had also been slashed from behind indicating that it was more likely that Loeb was attacked by surprise. Nevertheless, an inquiry accepted Day's testimony. The prison authorities, embarrassed by publicity sensationalizing alleged decadent behavior in the prison, ruled that Day's attack on Loeb was indeed in self-defense. According to one widely reported account, newsman Ed Lahey wrote this lead for the Chicago Daily News: "Richard Loeb, despite his erudition, today ended his sentence with a proposition." Some papers even went as far as to say that Loeb deserved what he got, and almost seemed to praise James Day for his murder.
Another apparent motive for Loeb's murder was money. Because his money had been cut Loeb could no longer afford to bribe Day with gifts in return for safety.Leopold, Loeb & The Crime of the Century by Hal Higdon, pg 292
There is no evidence that Loeb was a sexual predator while in prison; however, Loeb's murderer was later caught on at least one occasion engaging a fellow inmate sexuallyLeopold, Loeb & The Crime of the Century, pg 302 as well as committing numerous other infractions. In an autobiography entitled Life Plus 99 Years, Leopold referred to Day's claims that Loeb had attempted to sexually assault him as ridiculous and laughable. This is echoed in an interview with the Catholic chaplain at the prison, Father Eligius Weir, who had been a personal confidant of Richard Loeb. Weir stated that James Day had been the sexual predator and had gone after Loeb because Loeb refused to have sexual relations with him.Leopold, Loeb & The Crime of the Century, pg 293
In the end, Loeb didn't only die a famous child killer, he was also named as a sexual predator. Leopold dedicated much time to hopefully reclaim Loeb's name. Leopold composed books for the prison school. On the cover of these books spelt in Latin "Ratione autem liberamur" which translates to "by reason, however, we are set free." In the Latin spelling, Loeb's full name, Richard Albert Loeb, can be spelt out.[tpl]what|date=April 2014[/tpl] According to Leopold, this was no coincidence. Also on the covers of these school books was a picture of a man at a desk with a pen in his hand and a book laid out in front of him. This was meant to be Loeb.
Although Leopold continued with his work in prison after Loeb's death, he drifted off into a state of deep depression. Leopold apparently screamed for hours in his cell before being moved to the prison psychologists. This was meant to help him, but according to Leopold it was a punishment because Loeb's killer, James Day was also among the patients. Despite this set back, Leopold continued to grow in prison.

==Leopold's later life==

After organising the prison library, setting up a better schooling system, teaching students, writing an autobiography and working in the prison hospital, in 1944, Leopold participated in the Stateville Penitentiary Malaria Study. In which he volunteered to be infected with malaria so different medicines and cures may be tested on him.Leopold, Nathan F., Jr. Life Plus 99 Years. Lowe and Brydone (Printers) Limited, 1958.
After trying with many different publishers, Nathan's autobiography Life Plus 99 Years (which he finished in 1954) was published. As well as writing out his life story, Leopold had also attended many parole hearings, all of which were unsuccessful. One day a man named Meyer Levins visited Leopold. Levins had attended school with Leopold and Loeb at the University of Chicago and believed that the true story had been misunderstood. Levins wanted to write a book to explain to the public what really happened. Leopold however didn't wish for his story to be told in third person form. He turned down the book idea but offered Meyer Levins a chance to contribute in his autobiography. Levins was unhappy with this suggestions and went ahead with his book alone. Although the court scenes were accurate, Leopold after reading the book said that the characters could not be further off. He said that reading the book made him sick. Levins' attempt of straightening the story, in Leopold's opinion, did nothing but obscure it further.
Early in 1958, after 33 years in prison, Leopold was released on parole. In April of that year, he set up the Leopold foundation "to aid emotionally disturbed, retarded, or delinquent youths"Daily Defender; May 29, 1958; p9 which would be funded by the royalties from his book, Life Plus 99 Years,Life Plus 99 Years. Intro. By Erle Stanley Gardner, by Leopold, Nathan Freudenthal. Publisher: Garden City, N.Y., Doubleday, 1958. but the State of Illinois voided his charter for the organization in July, saying it violated the terms of his parole.Chicago Daily Tribune, July 16, 1958  p.23
Leopold moved to Puerto Rico to avoid media attention and married a widowed florist. On many occasions he expressed his appreciation for the willingness of the Brethren Service Commission, a Church of the Brethren affiliated program, to accept him upon his parole as a medical technician at its hospital in Puerto Rico. He wrote in an article, "To me the Brethren Service Commission offered the job, the home, and the sponsorship without which a man cannot be paroled. But it gave me so much more than that, the companionship, the acceptance, the love which would have rendered a violation of parole almost impossible.""The Companionship, the Acceptance." The Brethren Encyclopedia.Vol. 2 1983. Print. He was known as "Nate" to neighbors and co-workers at Castañer General Hospital in Adjuntas, Puerto Rico, where he worked as a laboratory and x-ray assistant.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/leoploeb/leopoldemail.html |title=E-mailed comment|publisher=Law.umkc.edu|accessdate=2012-10-29[/tpl] During this period he was active in the Natural History Society of Puerto Rico, traveling throughout the island to observe its birdlife. In 1963 he published the Checklist of Birds of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.
At one time after his release from prison, Leopold talked about his intention to write a book entitled Snatch for a Halo about his life following prison. He never did so. Later, Leopold tried to block the movie Compulsion on the grounds of invasion of privacy, defamation, and making money from his life story.
He died of a diabetes-related heart attack on August 29, 1971, at the age of 66. His corneas were donated.

==In popular culture==

Leopold and Loeb have been the inspiration for several works in film, theatre, and fiction, such as the 1929 play Rope by Patrick Hamilton, which was performed on BBC television in 1939[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0418111|title=Rope (1939)|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=2012-10-29[/tpl] and served as the basis for Alfred Hitchcock's film of the same name in 1948.[tpl]cite web|title=Leopold and Loeb Still Fascinate 90 Years Later|url=http://www.criminalelement.com/blogs/2012/10/leopold-and-loeb-still-fascinate-90-years-later-jake-hinkson-true-historical-film-adaptation-orson-welles-legal-wrangling-suffer-the-children?WT.mc_id=10144&et_cid=29706250&et_rid=497979563&linkid=http%3a%2f%2fwww.criminalelement.com%2fblogs%2f2012%2f10%2fleopold-and-loeb-still-fascinate-90-years-later-jake-hinkson-true-historical-film-adaptation-orson-welles-legal-wrangling-suffer-the-children%3fWT.mc_id%3d10144|publisher=criminalelement.com|accessdate=October 23, 2012|author=Jake Hinkson|date=October 19, 2012[/tpl] Fictionalized versions of the events were also included in Meyer Levin's 1956 novel Compulsion and its 1959 film adaptation.
