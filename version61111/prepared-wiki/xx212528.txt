It suffers grazing pressure from gastropods and amphipods, but amazingly fragments of the algae are able to pass through the grazers' digestive tracts alive - grazing may actually form a mode of dispersal for the organism.

==Life history==

Rhodochorton investiens displays a relatively simple life cycle for a red alga.[tpl]citation|author=Lee, R.E.|title=Phycology, 4th edition|year=2008|isbn= 978-0-521-63883-8|publisher= Cambridge University Press[/tpl]
In the Carposporophyte: a spermatium merges with a trichogyne (a long hair on the female sexual organ), which then divides to form carposporangia - which produce carpospores.
Carpospores germinate into gametophytes, which produce sporophytes.  Both of these are very similar; they produce monospores from monosporangia "just below a cross wall in a filament"
and their spores are "liberated through apex of sporangial cell."
The spores of a sporophyte produce either tetrasporophytes.  Monospores produced by this phase germinate immediately, with no resting phase, to form an identical copy of parent.  Tetrasporophytes may also produce a carpospore, which germinates to form another tetrasporophyte.[tpl]Verify source|date=August 2008[/tpl]
The gametophyte may replicate using monospores, but produces sperm in spermatangia, and "eggs"(?) in carpogonium.
