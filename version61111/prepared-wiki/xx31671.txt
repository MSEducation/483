The Mountain West Conference is one of the collegiate  athletic conferences affiliated with the NCAA Division I FBS (formerly I-A). The MW officially began operations in July 1999. Geographically, the MW covers a broad expanse of the Western United States, with member schools located in California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming. Craig Thompson has served as Commissioner of the MW since its founding in 1999.
The charter members of the MW included the U.S. Air Force Academy, Brigham Young University, Colorado State University, San Diego State University, the University of New Mexico, the University of Nevada at Las Vegas, the University of Utah, and the University of Wyoming. Before forming the Mountain West Conference, seven of its eight charter members had been longtime members of the Western Athletic Conference. Half of these had been charter members of that conference from 1962. Overall, each school that has ever been a member of the MW spent at least three years in the Western Athletic Conference before joining the Mountain West. The 2013-14 academic year will be the 15th anniversary season of the MW.

==History==

The WAC expanded from 10 to 16 schools for the 1996 academic year, absorbing three teams from the defunct Southwest Conference — Rice University, Southern Methodist University, and Texas Christian University — adding two from the Big West Conference — San Jose State University and the University of Nevada, Las Vegas — and also bringing in the University of Tulsa, an NCAA football independent and otherwise a member of the Missouri Valley Conference. However, the expanded WAC was soon wracked by tension between the established and new members.[tpl]cite news|url=http://collegefootball.rivals.com/content.asp?CID=1264788 |title=WAC a cautionary tale for superconferences |first=Tom |last=Deinhart |work=Rivals.com |publisher=Yahoo! Sports |date=September 14, 2011 |accessdate=July 12, 2013[/tpl] The final straw came in spring 1998, when Brigham Young University and the University of Utah proposed a permanent split into two eight-team divisions.  Previously, the WAC's 16 teams had been divided into four four-team "quadrants," two of which rotated between the Mountain and Pacific Divisions every two years.  This would have forced some schools into an unnatural alignment because of the geographic distribution of the conference. The U.S. Air Force Academy was the most strident opponent of this proposal, threatening to become an independent. Soon after the proposal by BYU and Utah, the presidents of Air Force, BYU, Colorado State, Utah, and Wyoming met at Denver International Airport to discuss their future, and they agreed to break away from the WAC to form a new conference.
They invited the WAC members New Mexico, San Diego State, and UNLV, to join them in what became the Mountain West Conference. The next move for the MW came in 2005, when the conference added TCU, who had spent the previous four seasons in Conference USA.
On June 11, 2010, Boise State University agreed to join the conference as its tenth member. On June 17, 2010, Utah announced it would be leaving the Mountain West to join what would become the Pacific-12 Conference. On August 18, 2010, amidst rumors that Brigham Young was considering leaving the Mountain West to go independent in football and rejoin the Western Athletic Conference in all other sports, the Mountain West Conference officially extended invitations to California State University, Fresno and the University of Nevada, Reno. Fresno State and Nevada accepted and would become the tenth and eleventh members of the league.[tpl]cite news |last=Adelson |first=Andrea |url=http://espn.go.com/blog/ncfnation/post/_/id/24908/utah-state-turned-down-invite-to-mwc |title=Utah State turned down invite to MWC |work=ESPN |accessdate=2013-08-09[/tpl] BYU announced on August 31, 2010 that it would leave the Mountain West Conference and go Independent in football and become a member of the West Coast Conference (WCC) in other sports starting in 2011.[tpl]cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncaa/news/story?id=5517305 |title=BYU to leave Mountain West Conference, join West Coast Conference in all sports except football |work=ESPN |date=2010-09-01 |accessdate=2013-08-09[/tpl] On November 29, 2010, Texas Christian University announced all athletic teams would move to the Big East Conference effective in 2012.[tpl]Wayback |date=20101201011523 |url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/40416658/ns/sports-college_football/ [/tpl] (Less than a year later, on October 10, 2011, TCU announced it would not join the Big East but would join the Big 12, home to fellow former SWC members Baylor, Texas, Texas Tech, and formerly Texas A&M, in 2012 instead.)[tpl]cite news|url=http://gofrogs.cstv.com/genrel/101011aad.html|title=TCU Accepts Invitation To Join Big 12 Conference|publisher=TCU Athletic Department|date=October 10, 2011[/tpl] On December 10, 2010, the University of Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i at Mānoa accepted a bid to become the 10th member of the conference for football only.[tpl]Wayback |date=20101213141604 |url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/40611296/ns/sports-college_football/ [/tpl] These changes would leave the Mountain West Conference with 10 teams for the 2012 football season.
The MW champion has qualified for a BCS bowl four times since the BCS formula was tweaked to allow non-BCS conferences to play in BCS bowls if ranked in the top 12; however, two of the three schools that qualified are no longer with the conference.
On October 14, 2011, the Mountain West and Conference USA announced a plan for a football only alliance.[tpl]cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/7102822/mountain-west-conference-usa-announce-football-only-alliance/ |title=Mountain West, Conference USA announce football-only alliance  |work=ESPN |date=2011-10-15 |accessdate=2013-08-09[/tpl] On February 13, 2012, the Mountain West and Conference USA (C-USA) announced that both conferences would be dissolving after the 2012-2013 season to reform into one conference with at least 15 members for all sports, and a 16th team, University of Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i at Mānoa as a football-only member.[tpl]cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/football/ncaa/02/13/mwc.merger.ap/index.html?sct=hp_t2_a16&eref=sihp/ | work=CNN | title=MWC, C-USA to form new league | date=February 13, 2012[/tpl] However, when the two conferences discussed their plans with the NCAA, they were told that due to NCAA rules, they would forfeit substantial revenues. Specifically, the new conference would receive only one automatic bid to NCAA championships; at least one of the former conferences would lose future revenue distributions from the NCAA men's basketball tournament; and at least one former conference would not be able to collect exit fees from any members that departed to join the new conference.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/blog/brett-mcmurphy/18623903 |title=Conference Mountain West merger "unlikely" |first=Brett |last=McMurphy |work=College Football Insider |publisher=CBSSports.com |date=April 17, 2012 |accessdate=April 21, 2012[/tpl] As a result, the Mountain West and C-USA backed away from a full merger. In late March of that year, the commissioners of both conferences stated that all 16 schools had entered into binding agreements to form a new "association",[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/blog/brett-mcmurphy/18065204/new-c-usa-mwc-league-will-be-completed-by-early-june |title=New C-USA, MWC league will be completed by early June |first=Brett |last=McMurphy |work=College Football Insider |publisher=CBSSports.com |date=March 28, 2012 |accessdate=April 10, 2012[/tpl] although the Mountain West and C-USA will now apparently remain separate legal entities.
On May 2, 2012, San Jose State and Utah State agreed to join the conference for the 2013-14 academic year. On December 31 of that year, Boise State announced that it had backed out of its previously announced move to the Big East for football and the Big West for other sports, and would remain in the MW.[tpl]cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/college-sports/story/_/id/8796807/boise-state-broncos-staying-mountain-west-conference-all |title=Boise State spurns Big East |last=McMurphy |first=Brett |work=ESPN |date=December 31, 2012 |accessdate=December 31, 2012[/tpl]
On January 16, 2013, San Diego State accepted an offer to remain/return to the Mountain West Conference in all sports. Keeping SDSU in the conference gives the Mountain West 12 football members, allowing for a Championship Game to be held. The first championship game took place on December 7, 2013.Mountain West planning title game with 'addition' of SDSU
