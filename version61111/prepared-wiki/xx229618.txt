He has contributed to many areas of the atmospheric sciences including developments to general circulation models, atmospheric chemistry, and radiative transfer. He has been a part of major projects such as the Indian Ocean Experiment (INDOEX) and the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE), and is known for his contributions to the area of atmospheric aerosol research. He has received numerous awards, and is a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences. He has spoken about the topic of global warming, and written that "the effect of greenhouse gases on global warming is, in my opinion, the most important environmental issue facing the world today."[tpl]cite web |title=Global Warming | url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/bulletin/spring2006/12globalwarming.pdf | accessdate=2008-10-10[/tpl]

==Background and education==

Ramanathan was born in Madurai, India. At the age of 11, he moved with his family to Bangalore. Unfortunately, the classes at the school he attended were taught in English, and not his native Tamil. He admits that he "lost the habit of listening to my teachers and had to figure out things on my own".[tpl]cite journal | last=Nuzzo | first =Regina  | year = 2005 | title = Biography of Veerabhadran Ramanathan | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 102 | pages = 5323–5325 | url = http://www-ramanathan.ucsd.edu/biography/PNAS_Bio.pdf | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0501756102 | pmid=15811938 | issue=15 | pmc=556241 |bibcode = 2005PNAS..102.5323N [/tpl] He received his bachelors degree in engineering from Annamalai University, and a masters degree from the Indian Institute of Science. In 1970, he arrived in the United States to study interferometry at the State University of New York at Stony Brook under the direction of Robert Cess. Before Ramanathan could begin working on his Ph.D. research, Cess decided to change his research and focus on planetary atmospheres.

==Research and publications==

Ramanathan has contributed to many areas of the atmospheric sciences. His first major findings were in the mid-1970s and were related to the greenhouse effect of CFCs and other trace gases[tpl]cite journal | last=Ramanathan | first = V. | year = 1975 |title = Greenhouse Effect Due to Chlorofluorocarbons: Climatic Implications | journal = Science| volume = 190 | pages = 50–51 | doi=10.1126/science.190.4209.50 | bibcode=1975Sci...190...50R [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | last=Ramanathan | first = V. | coauthors =et al. | year = 1985 | url= http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/1985/JD090iD03p05547.shtml |title = Trace Gas Trends and Their Potential Role in Climate Change | journal = J.

He also contributed to the early development of global circulation models[tpl]cite journal | last=Ramanathan | first = V. | coauthors =et al. | year = 1983 | url=http://ams.allenpress.com/perlserv/?request=get-abstract&doi=10.1175%2F1520-0469(1983)040%3C0605%3ATROASG%3E2.0.CO%3B2 |title = The Response of a Spectral General Circulation Model to Refinements in Radiative Processes | journal = J.

Ramanathan | year = 1980 | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/209/4458/763 |title = Detecting Climate Change due to Increasing Carbon Dioxide | journal = Science | volume = 209 | pages = 736–768 |doi = 10.1126/science.209.4458.763 | pmid=17753291 | issue=4458 |bibcode = 1980Sci...209..763M [/tpl]
His focus then shifted to the radiative effects of clouds on the climate. This was done using the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE), which showed that clouds have a large cooling effect on the planet.[tpl]cite journal | last=Ramanathan | first = V. | coauthors =et al. | year = 1989 | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/243/4887/57 |title = Cloud-Radiative Forcing and Climate: Results from the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment | journal = Science | volume = 243 | pages = 57–63 |doi = 10.1126/science.243.4887.57 | pmid=17780422 | issue=4887 |bibcode = 1989Sci...243...57R [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | last=Ramanathan | first = V. | coauthors =et al. | year = 1995 | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/267/5197/499 |title = Warm Pool Heat Budget and Shortwave Cloud Forcing: A Missing Physics? | journal = Science | volume = 267 | pages = 499–503 |doi = 10.1126/science.267.5197.499 | pmid=17788784 | issue=5197 |bibcode = 1995Sci...267..499R [/tpl] ERBE was also able to measure the greenhouse effect without the use of climate models.[tpl]cite journal | last=Raval | first = A. | coauthors = V. Ramanathan | year = 1989 | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v342/n6251/abs/342758a0.html |title = Observational determination of the greenhouse effect | journal = Nature | volume = 342 | pages = 758–761 |doi = 10.1038/342758a0 | issue=6251|bibcode = 1989Natur.342..758R [/tpl]
Recently, he has published on the aerosol radiative properties. His work has shown that aerosols have a cooling effect on the surface of the planet, and at the top of the atmosphere, but the forcing at the top of the atmosphere was only one-third the magnitude as the surface forcing. This has implications for the hydrologic cycle.[tpl]cite journal | last=Satheesh | first = S. K. | coauthors = V. Ramanathan | year = 2000 | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v405/n6782/abs/405060a0.html |title = Large differences in tropical aerosol forcing at the top of the atmosphere and Earth's surface | journal = Nature | volume = 405 | pages = 60–63 |doi = 10.1038/35011039 | pmid=10811216 | issue=6782 [/tpl] While working on the Central Equatorial Pacific Experiment, he discovered that absorbing black carbonaceous aerosols have a larger influence on climate than previously thought, which led to the development of the Indian Ocean Experiment (INDOEX).[tpl]cite web |title=INDOEX - The Indian Ocean Experiment | url=http://www-indoex.ucsd.edu/ | accessdate=2008-10-10[/tpl] In the 1990s, he led the Indian Ocean Experiment with Paul Crutzen and discovered the widespread existence of atmospheric brown clouds covering much of the Indian Ocean region. They found that the vast majority of the aerosols were anthropogenic in origin, and that the surface cooling caused by the aerosols is more important than the atmospheric heating.[tpl]cite journal | last=Ramanathan | first = V. | coauthors = et al. | year = 2001 | url=http://www-abc-asia.ucsd.edu/APMEX/Ram%20et%20al-INDOEX-JGR-2001.pdf |title = Indian Ocean Experiment: An integrated analysis of the climate forcing and effects of the great Indo-Asian haze | journal = J.

Ramanathan is also interested in the impact of climate change on agriculture in India. While atmospheric brown clouds partially offset the warming due from carbon dioxide, their effect on agriculture has been less certain. A statistical rice model couple to a regional climate model has shown that reductions of both carbon dioxide and atmospheric brown clouds will increase crop yield.[tpl]cite journal | last=Auffhammer| first = M. | coauthors =et al. | year = 2006 | url= http://www.pnas.org/content/103/52/19668.abstract |title = Integrated model shows that atmospheric brown clouds and greenhouse gases have reduced rice harvests in India | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.| volume = 103 | pages = 19668–19672 |doi = 10.1073/pnas.0609584104 | pmid=17158795 | issue=52 | pmc=1693867 |bibcode = 2006PNAS..10319668A [/tpl]
He has also written on avoiding dangerous anthropogenic climate change. Ramanathan writes that there are several tipping points in the climate system, and that they do not all occur at the same temperature threshold; the tipping point for the arctic summer sea ice is likely to be smaller than that for the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. While the planet has seen an observed warming of 0.6°C since pre-industrial times, it has already most likely committed itself to 2.4°C (1.4°C to 4.3°C) of warming. These values surpass several of the tipping point thresholds.[tpl]cite journal | last=Ramanathan | first = V. | coauthors = Y.

==Project Surya==

In March 2007, Ramanathan wrote a white paper with Balakrishnan on a potential project that will reduce air pollution and global warming.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www-ramanathan.ucsd.edu/Surya-WhitePaper.pdf |title=Project Surya: Reduction of Air Pollution and Global Warming by Cooking with Renewable Sources |accessdate=10 November 2008 |date=2007-03-05 [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Project Surya, which means Sun in Sanskrit, will use inexpensive solar cookers in rural India, and document the reductions in carbon dioxide and soot emissions. The byproducts of biofuel cooking and biomass burning are significant contributors to global warming, and the expanded use of renewable energy is expected to decrease their effects. 
The burning of solid fuels causes substantial health risks as well. An estimated 440,000 deaths per year are attributed to unsanitary food preparation techniques due to aerosol exposure.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.downtoearth.org.in/full6.asp?foldername=20080515&filename=news&sec_id=4&sid=10 |title=New stick to beat developing countries on GHGs |accessdate=10 November 2008 |date= [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Over 3 billion people cook and heat their home by burning biomass such as wood and feces. The project, costing an estimated $4.5 million, will buy 3,500 cookers and impact up to 15,000 people. As of November 2008, the project has not been funded.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/metro/20080511-9999-1n11rama.html |title=Climate scientist out to change the world |accessdate=10 November 2008 |date=2008-05-11 [/tpl]
Project Surya was soft launched in March 2009. Each household in the village of Khairatpur, Uttar Pradesh received a biomass cook stoves and a solar lamp. Surya has since received $150,000 in funding from UNEP.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www-ramanathan.ucsd.edu/Project%20Surya/Surya-Launch-Announcement.pdf |title=Project Surya Soft Launch Announcement |date=9 April 2009 [/tpl]
