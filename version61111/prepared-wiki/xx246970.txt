The Gulf snapping turtle or Lavarack's turtle (Elseya lavarackorum) is a large species of freshwater turtle in the sidenecked family Chelidae.Georges, A. & Thomson, S. 2010. Diversity of Australasian freshwater turtles, with an annotated synonymy and keys to species. Zootaxa 2496: 1–37. It is endemic to northern Australia in north-west Queensland and north-east Northern Territory. The species is totally aquatic coming ashore to lay eggs and bask only, as is typical of the members of the Australian snapping turtles (Elseya).Cann, J 1998, Australian freshwater turtles, Beaumont, Singapore. The Gulf snapping turtle is chiefly a herbivore consuming pandanus and figs.

==Taxonomy==

The species was first described in 1994, as Emydura lavarackorum, from fossil material from Riversleigh in North West Queensland. It was later demonstrated on the basis of the anatomy of the anterior bridge struts that it actually belonged to the genus Elseya and further to a living, although undescribed form. The species was also declared at this time to be Australia's first living fossil freshwater turtle and an extant population of a Pleistocene taxon.[tpl]cite journal |author= Thomson, S.A.; White, A.; & Georges, A. |date= 1997-06-30 |title= Re-evaluation of Emydura lavarackorum: identification of a living fossil |journal= Memoirs of the Queensland Museum |volume= 42 |issue= |pages= 327–336 |url= http://aerg.canberra.edu.au/reprints/1997_Thomson_White_Georges_Elseya_lavarackorum.pdf[/tpl] The later managed significant public attention to this species with a story appearing in Discover Magazine in January, 1997.Zimmer, C. 1997.

After placing this species in the correct genus it became possible to look at the deeper phylogeny of the Elseya and this species lends its name to the group within the Elseya known as the Queensland Elseya or Elseya lavarackorum group.Thomson, S., Georges, A. and C. Limpus (2006). A New Species of Freshwater Turtle in the Genus Elseya (Testudines: Chelidae) from Central Coastal Queensland, Australia. Chelon. Conserv. Biol. 5 (1): 74–86.

==Description==

The turtle is a large, brown to dark brown, short-necked turtle. Its carapace, or upper shell, reaches [tpl]convert|35|cm|in|0[/tpl] in length; it has an undulating suture between the hemeral and pectoral shields in the white plastron, or under shell.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/threatened/species/pubs/67197-conservation-advice.pdf |title= Approved Conservation Advice for Elseya lavarackorum (Gulf snapping turtle) |accessdate= 8 January 2010 |work= |publisher= Department of the Environment and Water Resources, Australia |date= 3 July 2008 [/tpl] The undulating (rather than straight) suture in the plastron distinguishes it from the northern snapping turtle (Elseya dentata).[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.nt.gov.au/nreta/wildlife/animals/threatened/pdf/herps/gulf_snapping_turtle_lc.pdf |title= Threatened Species of the Northern Territory: Gulf Snapping Turtle |accessdate= 8 January 2010 |work= John Woinarski (compiler) |publisher= Department of Natural Resources, Environment and the Arts, Northern Territory |date= May 2006 [/tpl]

==Distribution and habitat==

The turtle is restricted to rivers draining into the Gulf of Carpentaria in the Northern Territory and Queensland, from the Nicholson to Calvert River systems in the Northern Territory, to the Gregory River in Queensland.

==Behaviour==

The turtles are mainly herbivorous, eating fruits, flowers, leaves, bark and Pandanus roots, with the juveniles also eating insect larvae. Figs may be an important food. They are readily trapped using meat as bait. Their eggs are laid in soil near the edge of the water.

==Status and conservation==

The turtle is listed as Endangered under the Commonwealth Endangered Species Protection Act 1992, as Vulnerable under Queensland's Nature Conservation Act 1992, and as of Least Concern under the Northern Territory's Territory Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 2000.
The main threats to the turtle include disturbance to nesting sites by feral animals such as pigs, habitat destruction by grazing and watering cattle, and potentially through changes to hydrology, disturbance, and climate change. They are sometimes caught in fishing nets.
