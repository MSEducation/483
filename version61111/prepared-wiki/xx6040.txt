However, a working Komondor's coat may be discolored by the elements, and may appear off-white if not washed regularly. Traditionally the coat protected the Komondor from wolves' bites, as the bites were not able to penetrate the thick coat.<ref>The dog selector, David Alderton, 2010, IBSN 978-91-7401-2460 or 0-7641-6365-5 or 978-07-641-6365-4.</ref>  The coat of the Komondor takes about two and a half days to dry after a bath.

==Temperament==

The Komondor is built for livestock guarding. The Komondor's temperament is like that of most livestock guarding dogs; it is calm and steady when things are normal, but in case of trouble, the dog will fearlessly defend its charges. It was bred to think and act independently and make decisions on its own.
It is affectionate with its family, and gentle with the children and friends of the family. Although wary of strangers, they can accept them when it is clear that no harm is meant,[ref]
</ref> but is instinctively very protective of its family, home and possessions.<ref name="k9web"/> The Komondor is good with other family pets but is intolerant to trespassers and teasing, and is not a good dog for city life. The dog is vigilant, will rest in the daytime, keeping an eye on the surroundings, but at night is constantly moving, patrolling the place, moving up and down around the whole area.<ref name="Kovács"/> The dogs usually knock down intruders and keep them down until the owner arrives.<ref name="Kovács"/> Hungarian Komondor breeders used to say that an intruder may be allowed to enter the property guarded by a Komondor, but he will not be allowed to come out again.<ref name="Kovács"/>

==Uses==

The breed has a natural guardian instinct and ability to guard livestock.The dog selector, David Alderton, page 1562011, IBSN 978-91-7401-2460 An athletic dog, the Komondor is fast and powerful and will leap at a predator to drive it off or knock it down. It can be used successfully to guard sheep against wolves or bears. It is a big, strong dog breed, armored with a thick coat. The coat provides protection against wild animals, weather and vegetation, the coat of the dog looks similar to that of a sheep so it can easily blend into a flock and camouflage itself giving it an advantage when predators such as wolves attack. The Komondor is one breed of livestock guardian dog which has seen a vast increase in use as a guardian of sheep and goats in the United States to protect against predators such as coyotes, cougars, bears, and other predators.

==Training==

Due to the Komondor's size, power, speed and temperament, a lack of obedience training can result in danger to others.  Komondors generally take well to training if started early (ideally between 4 – 8 months). A Komondor can become obstinate when bored, so it is imperative that training sessions be upbeat and happy. Praise is a must, as are consistent and humane corrections. Once a Komondor gets away with unfriendly or hostile behavior, it will always think such behavior is appropriate. Therefore, consistent corrections even with a young puppy are necessary to ensure a well-adjusted adult. Socialization is also extremely important. The Komondor should be exposed to new situations, people and other dogs as a puppy. Because it is a natural guard dog, a Komondor that is not properly socialized may react in an excessively aggressive manner when confronted with a new situation or person.
Given the proper environment and care, a Komondor is a responsible, loving dog. They are devoted and calm without being sluggish. As in any breed, there is quite a range of personalities, so your needs should be outlined clearly to your breeder. An experienced breeder can try to identify that personality which would be happier as an independent livestock dog,[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2009[/tpl] or that which wants more to please and would make a good obedience dog or family pet. Adolescence can be marked by changes in a Komondor's temperament, eating habits, trainability and general attitude. Many Komondors are "late bloomers," not fully mature until nearly three years of age.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2009[/tpl]
Breed-specific legislation requires some breeds to be muzzled in public places. Romania is the only country that requires  Komondors to be muzzled.[tpl]cite news |title=Cainii din rasa Pitbull vor fi interzisi in Romania |date=2002-04-26 |language=Romanian |location=Bucharest, Romania |newspaper=Adevǎrul |url=http://www.adevarul.ro/articole/2002/cainii-din-rasa-pitbull-vor-fi-interzisi-in-romania.html |accessdate=2009-11-16|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6Gqr2wSgO|archivedate=24 May 2013[/tpl]
