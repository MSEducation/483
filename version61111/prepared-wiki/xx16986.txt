In Old Arizona is a 1929 American Western film directed by Irving Cummings and Raoul Walsh, nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture. The film, which was based on the character of the Cisco Kid in the story The Caballero's Way by O. Henry, was a major innovation in Hollywood: it was the first major Western to use the new technology of sound and the first talkie to be filmed outdoors. The film made extensive use of authentic locations, filming in Bryce Canyon National Park and Zion National Park in Utah and the San Fernando Mission and the Mojave Desert in California.  The movie was released on January 20, 1929 (wide); (Dec. 25, 1928 Los Angeles Premiere).
In Old Arizona was also instrumental in developing the image of the singing cowboy, with its star, Warner Baxter, singing "My Tonia". Baxter went on to win the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance.  Other actors included Edmund Lowe, Dorothy Burgess and J. Farrell MacDonald,
Other nominations included Best Director for Irving Cummings, Best Writing for Tom Barry Best Cinematography for Arthur Edeson, and Best Picture.
