As Léon's father acquired a plantation in Algeria, Léon left France to join him on June 30, 1832. Léon would stay for the next 32 years on the African continent. Léon learned the Arab tongue very rapidly, and after two years was recruited as translator for the French Army in Africa. He became an Officer (Sous-Lieutenant) of cavalry in the Garde Nationale d'Algerie from 1835 to 1839. General Bugeaud asked him to negotiate with Abd-el-Kader in order to stop fighting with the French. He is noted as having been highly respected by Arab chieftains.
Under Bugeaud's recommendation, Roches joined the French Foreign Ministry as an interpreter in 1845. In 1846 he became Secretary of the legation in Tanger, and then took responsibilities at the French mission in Morocco.
Using his experiences in North Africa, he wrote a book titled Trente-deux ans à travers l′Islam (Thirty-two years through Islam).[tpl]cite encyclopedia|last= |first= |authorlink= |editor-first= |editor-last= |editor-link= |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|title=Abdelkader |edition=15th |year=2010| publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica, Inc.|volume=I: A-Ak - Bayes|location= Chicago, IL|isbn=978-1-59339-837-8|pages=18–19[/tpl]

==Trieste==

By an exceptional nomination, Roches became first-class Consul in Trieste, allowing him to acquire a strong experience in trading matters. After three years, he was nominated to become Consul in Tripoli. In 1855, he was Consul in Tunis. He often wore the Arab dress and was renowned for his abilities with guns and horses.

==Japan==

On October 7, 1863, Roches was nominated Consul General of France in Edo, Japan. His great rival was Harry Parkes. The French government took the side of the Tokugawa Bakufu and thus was not very popular in Japan after the Meiji Restoration.
Roches was an advocate of the use of strength against the anti-foreign adversaries of the Shogunate. He fully supported the 1864 allied Bombardment of Shimonoseki.
Roches also helped the Shogunate modernize. He arranged for an "Ecole Franco-Japonaise" to be established, and organized the building of the Yokosuka arsenal. In 1866, he wrote to the French Minister Drouyn de Lhuys:
