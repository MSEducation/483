Two-time defending champion Pieter van den Hoogenband finished the race in fifth place at 47.75. Although he missed an opportunity to attain a third straight triumph in the same event, Van den Hoogenband became the first ever swimmer to reach the final at his fourth Olympics. Four months later, he announced his retirement from the sport, ending an Olympic career with a total of seven medals, including three golds.[tpl]cite news|last=Linden|first=Julian|title=Van den Hoogenband hangs up his goggles|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2008/08/14/us-olympics-swimming-hoogenband-idUSSP1606020080814|publisher=Reuters|date=13 August 2008|accessdate=13 May 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Ian Thorpe honours Pieter van den Hoogenband|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/archive/old-sport-pages/thorpe-honours-hoogie/story-e6frfgko-1111118260699|publisher=Herald Sun|date=9 December 2008|accessdate=13 May 2013[/tpl]
Van den Hoogenband was followed in sixth by South Africa's Lyndon Ferns (48.04), and in seventh by Sullivan's teammate Matt Targett (48.20). After missing out the semifinals in Athens four years earlier, Sweden's Stefan Nystrand rounded out the finale to eighth place in 48.33.
Earlier in the semifinals, Bernard and Sullivan exchanged world-record performances to set up a battle race for the final. Swimming in the first heat, Bernard delivered a time of 47.20 to erase a 0.04-second standard set by Sullivan during his lead-off leg in the 4×100 m freestyle relay. A few minutes later, Sullivan had taken back the record in the second semifinal at 47.05.[tpl]cite news|last=Lohn|first=John|title=Olympics, Swimming: Flash Alain Bernard Reclaims World Record in Semifinal 1 of 100 Free, Eamon Sullivan Says Give Me That Back|url=http://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/lane9/news/18790.asp|publisher=Swimming World Magazine|date=12 August 2008|accessdate=13 May 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Johanson|first=Simon|title=Sullivan smashes world record – again|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/swimming/sullivan-smashes-world-record--again/2008/08/13/1218306948185.html|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|date=13 August 2008|accessdate=13 May 2013[/tpl]
