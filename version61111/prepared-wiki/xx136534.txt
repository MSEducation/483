Daniel Gerard McGowan (born 1974) is an American environmental and social justice activist who was arrested and charged in federal court on multiple counts of arson and conspiracy, relating to the arson of Superior Lumber company in Glendale, Oregon on January 2, 2001, and Jefferson Poplar Farms in Clatskanie, Oregon on May 21, 2001, the latter of which the Earth Liberation Front (ELF) claimed responsibility for. His arrest is part of what the US government has dubbed Operation Backfire.
McGowan was facing a minimum of life in prison if convicted when he accepted a non-cooperation plea agreement, pleading guilty on November 9, 2006.  A terrorism enhancement was applied to his sentence, and McGowan was ultimately sentenced to 7 years imprisonment.

==Arrest and Operation Backfire==

On December 7, 2005, one of the largest arrests of environmental activists in American history began. Using the code name Operation Backfire, the FBI arrested six people.  Chelsea Gerlach, William Rodgers, Kendall Tankersley, Kevin Tubbs, McGowan and Stanislas Meyerhoff were arrested for allegedly taking part in a wide variety of crimes, including arson and domestic terrorism.[tpl]cite press_release | url=http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2006/January/06_crm_030.html | title=Eleven Defendants Indicted on Domestic Terrorism Charges | publisher=U.S. Dept. of Justice | date=Jan 20, 2006 | accessdate=April 26, 2011[/tpl] Meyerhoff agreed to be a federal cooperating witness almost immediately. On December 22, Rodgers was found dead in his cell in Flagstaff, Arizona, from an apparent suicide. 
On January 20, federal prosecutors, the head of the FBI, and US Attorney General Alberto Gonzales held a press conference announcing a 65-count indictment against 11 individuals relating to 17 different incidents in Oregon, Washington and California. In addition to the six arrested on December 7, the Oregon indictment also named Jonathan Paul, Suzanne Savoie, Joseph Dibee, Rebecca Rubin and Josephine Overaker.
The Oregon indictment charged certain defendants with arson, attempted arson, and using and carrying a destructive device. The destructive device charge carried a 30-year mandatory sentence and a life sentence for a second conviction. 
On June 28, the government arraigned Nathan Block, Joyanna Zacher, McGowan and Jonathan Paul on a 65-count superseding indictment. All four pleaded not guilty.

==Criticism of prosecution==

The Christian Science Monitor reports that the "Operation Backfire" indictments have elicited concern, from activists, that authorities have "cracked the super-secrecy of ALF and ELF".[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0130/p20s01-sten.html | title=Backstory: Eco-vigilantes: All in 'The Family?' | work=The Christian Science Monitor | date=January 30, 2006 | accessdate=April 26, 2011 | last=Knickerbocker | first=Brad[/tpl] Alternative media organizations have condemned the arrests, some calling them a "witch-hunt", "aimed at disrupting and discrediting political movements".Independent Media Center | www.indymedia.org | ((( i ))) Activists, alluding to the Red Scare, claim the operations are "fishing expeditions" carried out "in the midst of 9/11 McCarthyism.Environmental + Anarchist witch-hunt under way, a very coherent summary : Indybay The FBI disputes these claims.

==Plea agreement==

On November 9, 2006, McGowan and co-defendants Jonathan Paul, Joyanna Zacher and Nathan Block pleaded guilty and signed a plea agreement. The agreement does not require the defendants' cooperation (i.e., informing on others).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.supportdaniel.org/files/McGowanPlea.pdf|title=RE United States v.

All four defendants were free to argue for a lesser sentence.
Prosecutors asked the court to apply a "terrorism enhancement" at sentencing.Construction and Apllication of Federal Domestic Terrorism Sentencing Enhancement The defendants could have faced up to 20 years in prison in addition to the terms of the plea agreement. The government was seeking the enhancement because, despite the fact that the crimes involved only the destruction of private property, it was possible their actions could have led to people's injuries or deaths. No government property was damaged in any of the incidents.http://www.cldc.org/TEhearing.html Notes from Terrorism Enhancement Hearing, May 15, 2007
