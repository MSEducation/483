Messua is a spider genus of the Salticidae family (jumping spiders).

==Etymology==

The genus name is derived from Messua, a female character from Rudyard Kipling's Jungle Book. Other salticid genera with names of Kipling's characters are  Akela, Bagheera and Nagaina.

==Taxonomy==

The genus was first described in 1896 by American arachnologists George and Elizabeth Peckham based on the type species Messua desidiosa.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Peckham|first1=George|last2=Peckham|first2=Elizabeth|title=Spiders of the family Attidae from Central America and Mexico|year=1896|journal=Occasional Papers of the Natural History Society of Wisconsin|volume=3|issue=1|url=http://www.peckhamia.com/editions/Peckham%201896%20Spiders%20of%20the%20family%20Attidae%20from%20Central%20America%20and%20Mexico.pdf|pages=1–101[/tpl]
The genus Messua was synonymized with Zygoballus by Eugène Simon in 1903. After examining the type specimen for Messua desidiosa, Simon commented that it was "much less divergent from typical Zygoballus than Peckhams' description would indicate."[tpl]cite book|title=Histoire Naturelle des Araignées|edition=2nd|first=Eugène|last=Simon|location=Paris|year=1897–1903|page=863|language=French[/tpl] This was reversed by Wayne Maddison in 1996, and Messua restored as a valid genus. Maddison also transferred several species that had previously been placed in Metaphidippus into Messua.[tpl]cite journal|title=Pelegrina Franganillo and other jumping spiders formerly placed in the genus Metaphidippus (Araneae: Salticidae)|first=Wayne P.|last=Maddison|authorlink=Wayne Maddison|journal=Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology|publisher=Harvard University|year=1996|volume=154|pages=215–368[/tpl]
