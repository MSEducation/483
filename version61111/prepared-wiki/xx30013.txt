[[Flaviviridae]]

CATEGORIES: Flaviviridae

The Flaviviridae are a family of viruses that are primarily spread through arthropod vectors (mainly ticks and mosquitoes). The family gets its name from Yellow Fever virus, a type virus of Flaviviridae; flavus means yellow in Latin. (Yellow fever in turn was named because of its propensity to cause jaundice in victims.)[tpl]cite web|title=Flaviviridae|url=http://microbewiki.kenyon.edu/index.php/Flaviviridae|publisher=Microbe Wiki|accessdate=July 22, 2008[/tpl]
Flaviviridae have monopartite, linear, single-stranded RNA genomes of positive polarity, 9.6 to 12.3 kilobase in length. The 5'-termini of flaviviruses carry a methylated nucleotide cap, while other members of this family are uncapped and encode an internal ribosome entry site. Virus particles are enveloped and spherical, about 40â€“60 nm in diameter.
