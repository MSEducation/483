[[Universal jurisdiction]]

CATEGORIES: Human rights instruments, Human rights, International criminal law, Universal jurisdiction, Legal doctrines and principles, Globalization terminology

Universal jurisdiction or universality principle allows states or international organizations to claim criminal jurisdiction over an accused person regardless of where the alleged crime was committed, and regardless of the accused's nationality, country of residence, or any other relation with the prosecuting entity. Crimes prosecuted under universal jurisdiction are considered crimes against all, too serious to tolerate jurisdictional arbitrage. 
The concept of universal jurisdiction is therefore closely linked to the idea that some international norms are erga omnes, or owed to the entire world community, as well as the concept of jus cogens – that certain international law obligations are binding on all states. See Lyal S. Sunga Individual Responsibility in International Law for Serious Human Rights Violations, Nijhoff (1992) 252 p. ISBN 978-0-7923-1453-0
The concept received a great deal of prominence with Belgium's 1993 law of universal jurisdiction, which was amended in 2003 in order to reduce its scope following a case before the International Court of Justice regarding an arrest warrant issued under the law, entitled Case Concerning the Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000 (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Belgium).Hans Köchler, "The judgment of the International Court of Justice (2002) and its implications for the exercise of universal jurisdiction by national courts: the case of Belgium," in: Global Justice or Global Revenge? International Criminal Justice at the Crossroads. Vienna and New York: Springer, 2003, pp. 85–101. ISBN 3-211-00795-4 The creation of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in 2002 reduced the perceived need to create universal jurisdiction laws, although the ICC is not entitled to judge crimes committed before 2002.
According to Amnesty International, a proponent of universal jurisdiction, certain crimes pose so serious a threat to the international community as a whole, that states have a logical and moral duty to prosecute an individual responsible for it; no place should be a safe haven for those who have committed genocide,The Program for Humanitarian Policy and Conflict Research, "Brief Primer on Genocide" Accessed at http://ihl.ihlresearch.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.viewpage&pageid=1638 crimes against humanity, extrajudicial executions, war crimes, torture and forced disappearances.[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/engIOR530202001|title=UNIVERSAL JURISDICTION: Questions and answers[/tpl]
Opponents, such as Henry Kissinger, argue that universal jurisdiction is a breach on each state's sovereignty: all states being equal in sovereignty, as affirmed by the United Nations Charter, "Widespread agreement that human rights violations and crimes against humanity must be prosecuted has hindered active consideration of the proper role of international courts. Universal jurisdiction risks creating universal tyranny – that of judges."[tpl]cite news|authorlink=Henry Kissinger|last=Kissinger|first=Henry|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20010701faessay4996/henry-a-kissinger/the-pitfalls-of-universal-jurisdiction.html|title=The Pitfalls of Universal Jurisdiction|work=Foreign Affairs|date= July–August 2001[/tpl][tpl]cite news|authorlink=Kenneth Roth|first=Kenneth|last=Roth|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20010901faresponse5577/kenneth-roth/the-case-for-universal-jurisdiction.html|title=The Case for Universal Jurisdiction|work=Foreign Affairs|date=September–October 2001[/tpl] According to Kissinger, as a practical matter, since any number of states could set up such universal jurisdiction tribunals, the process could quickly degenerate into politically driven show trials to attempt to place a quasi-judicial stamp on a state's enemies or opponents.

==History==

"All nations," says the Institutional Treatise published under the authority of Roman Emperor Justinian (c. 482-565) "...are governed partly by their own particular laws, and partly by those laws which are common to all, that natural Reason appoints for all mankind."[tpl]cite book| last =Maine| first =Sir Henry Sumner| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Ancient Law: Its Connection With the Early History of Society and Relation to Modern Ideas| publisher =John Murray| publication-place = London | edition = 1861 first| date =| page = 46| language = | isbn =| url = http://archive.org/stream/ancientlawitsco18maingoog#page/n58/mode/2up[/tpl] Expanding on the classical understanding of universal law accessible by reason, in the Seventeenth Century the Dutch jurist Grotius laid the foundations for Universal Jurisdiction in modern international law, promulgating in his De Jure Pradae (Of Captures) and later De jure belli ac pacis (Of the Law of War and Peace) the Enlightenment view that there are universal principles of right and wrong.[tpl]cite book |last=Grotius|authorlink=Grotius |title=De Jure Pradae: (Of the Law of Captures)|publisher=Oxford University Press |location=London |year=1604 |pages=xviii |isbn=[/tpl] (discussing in introductory notes Grotius' account of universal principles of right and wrong derived from reason and divine Will, the underpinning of much modern international law).
At about the same time, international law came to recognize the analogous concept of hostes humani generis ('enemies of the human race'): pirates, hijackers, and similar outlaws whose crimes were typically committed outside the territory of any state. The notion that heads of state and senior public officials should be treated like pirates as outlaws before the global bar of justice is, according to Henry Kissinger, a new gloss on this old concept. From these premises, representing the Enlightenment belief in trans-territorial, trans-cultural standards of right and wrong, derives Universal Jurisdiction.[tpl]cite book |author= Anthony Pagden|coauthors= |title=The Enlightenment, and Why It Still Matters |year=2013 |publisher=Random House |quote= If there does exist some concept of universal justice, if even the most powerful states on occasion feel compelled to abide by the demands of international law, that we owe to the Enlightenment. | url= |isbn=978-1-4000-6068-9 [/tpl]
Perhaps the most notable and influential precedent for Universal Jurisdiction were the mid-20th century Nuremberg Trials. U.S. Justice Robert H. Jackson then chief prosecutor, famously stated that the International Military Tribunal could prosecute Nazi "crimes against the peace of the world" even though the acts might have been perfectly legal at the time in Fascist Germany (indeed one charge was the Nazis distorted the law itself into an instrument of oppression.)[tpl]cite web |url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/nuremberg/jackson.html |title=Justice Jackson's Opening statement for the Prosecution |author=Jackson, Robert, U.S. Supreme Court Justice  |date=21 November 1945 |work= Proceedings, Trial of the Major War Criminals Before the International MIlitary Tribunal|publisher=International Military Tribunal |accessdate=3 November 2012[/tpl] Kenneth Roth, the executive director of Human Rights Watch, argues that universal jurisdiction allowed Israel to try Adolf Eichmann in Jerusalem in 1961. Roth also argues that clauses in treaties such as the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and the United Nations Convention Against Torture of 1984, which requires signatory states to pass municipal laws that are based on the concept of universal jurisdiction, indicate widespread international acceptance of the concept.

==Extraterritorial jurisdiction==

International jurisdiction differs from "territorial jurisdiction", where justice is exercised by a state in relation to crimes committed on its territory (territorial jurisdiction). States can also exercise jurisdiction on crimes committed by their nationals abroad (extraterritorial jurisdiction), even if the act the national committed was not illegal under the law of the territory in which an act has been committed. As an example, the American law the Protect America Act of 2007 asserts jurisdiction over terror-suspects on a worldwide basis.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl]
States can also in certain circumstances exercise jurisdiction over acts committed by foreign nationals on foreign territory. This form of jurisdiction tends to be much more controversial. Bases on which a state can exercise jurisdiction in this way:

==International tribunals==

Universal jurisdiction asserted by a particular nation is analogous to the jurisdiction of an international tribunal, such as the International Criminal Court, established in 2002, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (1994) and International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (1993), or the Nuremberg Trials (1945–49). Whether criminal jurisdiction is exercised by an international organization or by a state, the result is the same: individuals become answerable for crimes defined and prosecuted outside of their home jurisdiction, and regardless of where the conduct occurred.
Established in The Hague in 2002, the International Criminal Court (ICC) is an international tribunal empowered with the right to prosecute state-members' citizens for genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes, as defined by several international agreements, most prominently the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court signed in 1998. It provides for ICC jurisdiction over state party or on the territory of a non-state party where that non-state party has entered into an agreement with the court providing for it to have such jurisdiction in a particular case.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2007[/tpl]
However, Amnesty International argues that since the end of the Second World War over fifteen states have conducted investigations, commenced prosecutions and completed trials based on universal jurisdiction for the crimes or arrested people with a view to extraditing the persons to a state seeking to prosecute them. These states include: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Israel, Mexico, Netherlands, Senegal, Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States.
  All states parties to the Convention against Torture and the Inter-American Convention are obliged whenever a person suspected of torture is found in their territory to submit the case to their prosecuting authorities for the purposes of prosecution, or to extradite that person. In addition, it is now widely recognized that states, even those that are not states parties to these treaties, may exercise universal jurisdiction over torture under customary international law.Universal Jurisdiction: The duty of states to enact and implement legislation – Chapter Nine (Torture: The legal basis for universal jurisdiction), Amnesty International 1 September 2001. Section II. Universal Jurisdiction over torture 

==Immunity for state officials==

On 14 February 2002 the International Court of Justice in the ICJ Arrest Warrant Case concluded that State officials may have immunity under international law while serving in office. The court stated that immunity was not granted to State officials for their own benefit, but instead to ensure the effective performance of their functions on behalf of their respective States. The court also stated that when abroad, State officials may enjoy immunity from arrest in another State on criminal charges, including charges of war crimes or crimes against humanity.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.unis.unvienna.org/unis/pressrels/2002/afr379.html|title=ICJ rejects Belgian arrest warrant for foreign ministers of Democratic Republic of Congo|publisher=United Nations Information Service|date=14 September 2002[/tpl] But the ICJ qualified its conclusions, saying that State officers "may be subject to criminal proceedings before certain international criminal courts, where they have jurisdiction. Examples include the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda... , and the future International Criminal Court."Cesare P.R. Romano and André Nollkaemper. The Arrest Warrant Against The Liberian President, Charles Taylor, on the website of the American Society of International Law, June 2003. Cites in footnote 6: Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000 (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Belgium), Judgment, Merits, para. 61.
In 2003 Charles Taylor, the former president of Liberia, was served with an arrest warrant by the Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL) that was set up under the auspices of a treaty that binds only the United Nations and the Government of Sierra Leone.Cesare P.R. Romano and André Nollkaemper. The Arrest Warrant Against The Liberian President, Charles Taylor, on the website of the American Society of International Law, June 2003. Taylor contested the Special Court's jurisdiction, claiming immunity, but the Special Court for Sierra Leone concluded in 2004 that "the sovereign equality of states does not prevent a Head of State from being prosecuted before an international criminal tribunal or court."{{cite web|url=http://www.sc-sl.org/CASES/ProsecutorvsCharlesTaylor/tabid/107/Default.aspxIn sum, the question whether a former Head of State might have immunity depends on which international court or tribunal endeavors to try him, how the court is constituted, and how it interprets its own mandate.

==Universal jurisdiction laws around the world==

===Australia===

The High Court of Australia confirmed the authority of the Australian Parliament, under the Australian Constitution, to exercise universal jurisdiction over War Crimes in the Polyukhovich v Commonwealth case of 1991.

===Belgium===

In 1993, Belgium's Parliament passed a "law of universal jurisdiction" (sometimes referred to as "Belgium's genocide law"), allowing it to judge people accused of war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide. In 2001, four Rwandan citizens were convicted and given sentences from 12 to 20 years' imprisonment for their involvement in 1994 Rwandan genocide.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/french/press/2003/justice02.htm |title=Belgique : Questions et Réponses sur la loi de Compétence Universelle |publisher=Human Rights Watch |accessdate=18 February 2012[/tpl] There was a rapid succession of cases:
Confronted with this sharp increase in cases, Belgium established the condition that the accused person must be Belgian or present in Belgium. An arrest warrant issued in 2000 under this law, against the then Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, was challenged before the International Court of Justice in the case entitled ICJ Arrest Warrant Case. The ICJ's decision issued on 14 February 2002 found that it did not have jurisdiction to consider the question of universal jurisdiction, instead deciding the question on the basis of immunity of high-ranking state officials.ICJ's decision See paragraph 43 However, the matter was addressed in separate and dissenting opinions,separate and dissenting opinions[tpl]dead link|date=February 2012[/tpl] such as that of President Guillaume who concluded that universal jurisdiction exists only in relation to piracy;separate opinion of President Guillaume at paragraph 12 and the dissenting opinion of Judge Oda who recognised piracy, hijacking, terrorism and genocide as crimes subject to universal jurisdiction.dissenting opinion of Judge Oda, paragraph 12
On 1 August 2003, Belgium repealed the law on universal jurisdiction, and introduced a new law on extraterritorial jurisdiction similar to or more restrictive than that of most other European countries. However, some cases that had already started continued. These included those concerning the Rwandan genocide, and complaints filed against the Chadian ex-President Hissène Habré (dubbed the "African Pinochet").[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/press/2003/08/belgium080103.htm|title=Belgium: Universal Jurisdiction Law Repealed|publisher=Human Rights Watch|date=1 August 2003[/tpl] In September 2005, Habré was indicted for crimes against humanity, torture, war crimes and other human rights violations by a Belgian court. Arrested in Senegal following requests from Senegalese courts, he is now under house arrest and waiting for (an improbable) extradition to Belgium.Trial Watch : Hissène Habré[tpl]dead link|date=February 2012[/tpl]

===Canada===

To implement the Rome Statute, Canada passed the Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes Act. Michael Byers, a University of British Columbia law professor, has argued that these laws go further than the Rome Statute, providing Canadian courts with jurisdiction over acts pre-dating the ICC and occurring in territories outside of ICC member-states; “as a result, anyone who is present in Canada and alleged to have committed genocide, torture ... anywhere, at any time, can be prosecuted Canada.”[tpl]cite book |author=Michael Byers|title=Intent for a Nation|year=2007 |publisher=Douglas & McIntyre |location=Vancouver |isbn=978-1-55365-250-2|page=111 |authorlink=Michael Byers (Canadian author)[/tpl]

The following infractions may be prosecuted:

===Germany===

===Ireland===

===Israel===

The moral philosopher Peter Singer, along with Kenneth Roth, has cited Israel's prosecution of Adolf Eichmann in 1961 as an assertion of universal jurisdiction. He claims that while Israel did invoke a statute specific to Nazi crimes against Jews, its Supreme Court claimed universal jurisdiction over crimes against humanity.[tpl]cite book |last=Singer |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Singer |title=One World |year=2002 |publisher=Yale University Press |page=114 |isbn=0-300-09686-0[/tpl]
Eichmann's defense lawyer argued that Israel did not have jurisdiction on account of Israel not having come into existence until 1948. The Genocide Convention also did not come into effect until 1951, and the Genocide Convention does not automatically provide for universal jurisdiction. It is also argued that Israel agents obtained Eichmann illegally, violating international law when they seized and kidnapped Eichmann, and brought him to Israel to stand trial. The Argentinian government settled the dispute diplomatically with Israel.[tpl]cite court |litigants=Attorney General of Israel v. Eichmann |vol=Criminal Case 40/61 |reporter= |court=District Court of Jerusalem |date=1961 |url=http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/people/e/eichmann-adolf/transcripts/ [/tpl] [tpl]citation|title=Transcripts |accessdate=6 February 2013 |url=http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/people/e/eichmann-adolf/transcripts/ |  archiveurl =http://web.archive.org/web/20061001235018/http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/people/e/eichmann-adolf/transcripts/ |archivedate = 11 June 2007[/tpl]
Israel argued universal jurisdiction based on the "universal character of the crimes in question" and that the crimes committed by Eichmann weren not only in violation of Israel law, but were considered "grave offenses against the law of nations itself.  It's also asserted that the crime of genocide is covered under international customary law. As a supplemental form of jurisdiction, a further argument is made on the basis of protective jurisdiction. Protective jurisdiction is a principle that, "...provides that states may exercise jurisdiction over aliens who have committed an act abroad which is deemed prejudicial to the security of the particular state concerned."

In November 2011 the Kuala Lumpur War Crimes Commission purportedly exercised universal jurisdiction to try and convict in absentia former US President George W. Bush and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair for the invasion of Iraq.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-501712_162-57324770/symbolic-war-crimes-tribunal-to-try-bush-blair/ |title=Symbolic 'war crimes' tribunal to try Bush, Blair |date=15 November 2011 |publisher=CBS News |accessdate=16 May 2012 |deadurl=yes[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2014|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ottawacitizen.com/news/Bush+Blair+guilty+Malaysia+crimes+trial/5748925/story.html#ixzz1eaKHipRQ |title=Bush, Blair guilty in Malaysia 'war crimes trial'|work=Ottawa Citizen |date=22 November 2011 |accessdate=24 November 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120113051951/http://www.ottawacitizen.com/news/Bush+Blair+guilty+Malaysia+crimes+trial/5748925/story.html#ixzz1eaKHipRQ|archivedate=13 January 2012[/tpl]  In May 2012 the tribunal again under a purported exercise of universal jurisdiction took testimony from victims of torture at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo, and convicted in absentia former President Bush, former Vice President Dick Cheney, former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, former Deputy Assistant Attorneys General John Yoo and Jay Bybee, former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, and former counselors David Addington and William Haynes II for conspiracy to commit war crimes.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.newjerseynewsroom.com/international/are-george-w-bush-and-dick-cheney-war-criminals-malaysian-court-says-yes |title=Are George W.

While the tribunal says it follows the Nuremberg-style process and rules of evidence, critics say it follows more the Russell Tribunal. While e.g. Abbas Abid testified that his fingernails were pulled out with a pair of pliers, and according to the Tribunal, the U.S. violated the 1984 Torture Convention and the Geneva Conventions. Critics say that this conventions do not apply for suspected al-Qaeda and Taliban detainees. So no torture according to the Torture Convention occurred, and cruel, inhumane, degrading interrogation techniques are actually allowed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://the-diplomat.com/2012/05/15/bush-and-cheney-on-trial/|title=Bush and Cheney on Trial|author=Hunt, Luke|date=15 May 2012 |publisher=The Diplomat |accessdate=17 May 2012[/tpl]

===Spain===

Spanish law recognizes the principle of the universal jurisdiction. Article 23.4 of the Judicial Power Organization Act (LOPJ), enacted on 1 July 1985, establishes that Spanish courts have jurisdiction over crimes committed by Spaniards or foreign citizens outside Spain when such crimes can be described according to Spanish criminal law as genocide, terrorism, or some other, as well as any other crime that, according to international treaties or conventions, must be prosecuted in Spain. On 25 July 2009 the Spanish Congress passed a law that limits the competence of the Audiencia Nacional under Article 23.4 to cases in which Spaniards are victims, there is a relevant link to Spain, or the alleged perpetrators are in Spain.[tpl]cite news|title=Spain reins in crusading judges |publisher=BBC News | date=25 June 2009 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8119920.stm |first=Steve |last=Kingstone[/tpl] The law still has to pass the Senate, the high chamber, but passage is expected because it is supported by both major parties.[tpl]cite news | title=Spanish court ends Israel bombing probe | url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5g7nVX6JkK9c3ofnkBpgD_5eFF84AD9950VPO0 | agency=Associated Press | date=30 June 2009[/tpl]

It also wounded some 150 Palestinians, according to the complaint (or 50, according to other reports).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/?id=31854 |title=Spanish judge to go ahead with Gaza raid probe |publisher=Middle-east-online.com |date=4 May 2009 |accessdate=18 February 2012[/tpl]Yuval Yoaz, State commission to examine civilian deaths in 2002 Shahade assassination, Haaretz, 19 September 2007[tpl]cite news|author= Walter Rodgers |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/meast/09/04/palestinian.collaborators/index.html |title= Palestinians grapple with collaborators  |publisher=CNN |date= 4 September 2002|accessdate=19 May 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=LYxtAAAAMAAJ&q=Salah+Shehade+precision+bomb&dq=Salah+Shehade+precision+bomb |title=Right to exist: a moral defense of Israel's wars|author= Yaacov Lozowick |publisher=Doubleday|ISBN=0-385-50905-7 |year=2003 |accessdate=19 May 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/meast/07/23/hamas.assassination/index.html|author=Pierre Klochendler  |title= Israeli general apologizes for civilian deaths  |publisher=CNN |date=23 July 2002 |accessdate=19 May 2010[/tpl]  The Israeli chief of operations and prime minister apologized officially, saying they were unaware, due to faulty intelligence, that civilians would be in the house.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2C3NcBIl_60C&pg=PA166&dq=Salah+Shehade+apologized#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Israeli counter-insurgency and the Intifadas: dilemmas of a conventional army|author= Sergio Catignani |publisher=Routledge|ISBN= 0-203-93069-X |year=2008 |accessdate=20 May 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/jpost/access/141530041.html?dids=141530041:141530041&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Jul+25%2C+2002&author=DAVID+RUDGE%2C+News+agencies+contributed+to+this+report.&pub=Jerusalem+Post&desc=Peres+apologizes+for+Shehadeh+hit&pqatl=google|author=David Rudge |title=Peres apologizes for Shehadeh hit |work=The Jerusalem Post |date=25 July 2002 |accessdate=20 May 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/packages/iraq/globe_stories/042003_code.htm|author=David B.

The investigation in the case was halted on 30 June 2009 by a decision of a panel of 18 judges of the Audiencia Nacional. The Spanish Court of Appeals rejected the lower court's decision, and on appeal in April 2010 the Supreme Court of Spain upheld the Court of Appeals decision against conducting an official inquiry into the IDF's targeted killing of Shehadeh.

An offence is generally only triable in the jurisdiction where the offence took place, unless a specific statute enables the UK to exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction.

===Finland===

A Finnish high court sentenced a Rwandan preacher to life in jail in 2010 for his participation in Rwanda's genocide in 1994. Francois Bazaramba, 59, moved in 2003 to Finland seeking asylum. Finland allows prosecutions for crimes against humanity wherever they are committed.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10294529 | work=BBC News | title=Finland sentences Rwanda preacher to life for genocide | date=11 June 2010[/tpl] At the time of the genocide, he was a pastor in the Baptist church in Nyakizu in southern Rwanda. According to Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat, the court found him guilty of orchestrating deadly attacks, and organising the torching of Tutsi homes. In a statement the court said he had spread anti-Tutsi propaganda and incited "killings through fomenting anger and contempt towards Tutsis". "The court has found Bazaramba guilty of an offence which without a genocidal intent would be judged as a murder or incitement to murder," the statement said. "For those crimes, the only possible punishment is life imprisonment." He was acquitted of 10 counts of murder and of providing training and acquiring weapons, Helsingin Sanomat reports. During the trial, the court heard from 68 witnesses, travelling to Rwanda and Tanzania to hear some testimonies.
