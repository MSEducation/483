CATEGORIES: Dairy products

Fromage blanc (also known as maquée and similar to some kinds of quark) is a cheese originating from the north of France and the south of Belgium. The name means "white cheese" in French. Fromage frais differs from fromage blanc in that, according to French legislation:Note d'information accompagnant le décret n°2007-628 relatif aux fromages et spécialités fromagères Ministère de l'économie
So the former must contain live cultures when sold, whereas with fromage blanc fermentation has been halted. Fromage frais is a creamy soft cheese made with whole or skimmed milk and cream. It has the consistency of cream cheese, but less fat. Pure fromage blanc is virtually fat free, but cream is frequently added to improve the flavour, which also increases the fat content, frequently to as high as eight percent of total weight. 
Fromage blanc can be served either as a dessert similar to yogurt, frequently with added fruit, or in savoury dishes. In many Western countries, fromage blanc is sold in supermarkets alongside yogurts.
