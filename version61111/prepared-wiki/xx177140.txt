CATEGORIES: Suburbs of Sydney

Lansdowne is a suburb in south-western Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Lansdowne is located 27 kilometres west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government areas of the City of Bankstown and is part of the South-western Sydney region.

==History==

Lansdowne took its name from the Lansdowne Bridge which was named by Governor Richard Bourke to honour Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 3rd Marquess of Lansdowne (1780-1863), a Whig politician. 
The Lansdowne Bridge was built in 1834-35 from stone quarried on the banks of the Georges River. It replaced a hardwood bridge called Bowler’s Bridge because it led to Bowler’s Inn. The Lansdowne Bridge was one of the finest works by Scottish stonemason David Lennox (1788-1873), who arrived in Sydney in 1832 and was made Superintendent of Bridges with the task of replacing hardwood bridges that were frequently swept away in floods. 
Many minor roads in the area bounded by the Hume Highway, Prospect Creek and Hazel Street have been resumed to form the Mirambeena Regional Park and Lansdowne Park, which boast pedestrian/cycle-paths, a number of man-made lakes, recreational reserves and a quality restaurant. 
Note that this suburb's name has occasionally in the past appeared on maps with a spelling of 'Landsdowne'.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollen, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia ISBN 0-207-14495-8
