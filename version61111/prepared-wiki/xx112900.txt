Written by the same team that had produced their previous hit single, "This Is Me" again featured lead vocals by Holly Blake-Arnstein.  The interlude was alternately sung and spoken by Ashley Poole and Melissa Schuman, respectively.
Many versions of this song were recorded.  The music video version contains the phrase "It Was All a Dream" spoken by Melissa Schuman after the interlude.  A remix featuring P. Diddy and Kain was recorded and released as the third and final single from It Was All a Dream.

==Music video==

The music video for "This Is Me" was shot February 20 and 21, 2001 and directed by Marcus Raboy, who had directed Dream's first video as well.  
The first setting depicted each Dream member in a different colored room: red for Holly, gold for Melissa, blue for Diana, and white for Ashley. In the second setting, the girls danced in a rave, with Ashley and Diana performing solo dance breaks. In the third setting, the girls emerged from a limousine and performed in a crowded dance club.
The video debuted at #10 on MTV's countdown show Total Request Live (TRL) on April 20, 2001.  The video peaked at #1 on May 2, 2001, making them the first girl group to reach that spot on the countdown.
The video for the remix of "This Is Me" was directed by Chris Robinson and featured two settings:
In the first setting, the girls, sporting "Bad Girl" t-shirts, are dancing in a blue and white room with P. Diddy also dancing and playing around with the girls. The second setting had them in a black room, with Kain performing with the girls and P. Diddy. A dance break by P. Diddy is also featured in both settings of the video, intercut with scenes of Mario Winans playing the drums.
