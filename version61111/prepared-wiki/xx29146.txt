Julia is usually a woman's given name. It is a Latinate feminine form of the name Julius. Julius was a Roman family, derived from a founder Julus, the son of Aeneas and Creusa in Roman mythology, although the name's etymology may possibly derive from Greek [tpl]lang|grc|ἴουλος[/tpl] ([tpl]lang|grc-Latn|ioulos[/tpl]) "downy-bearded"[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2009[/tpl] or alternatively from the name of the Roman god Jupiter.
