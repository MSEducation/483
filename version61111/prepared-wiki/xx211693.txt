 - South Carolina Department of Parks & Tourism</ref> It is located in [[Jenkinsville, South Carolina|Jenkinsville]].  While it does not dam any major rivers, its outflow flows directly into [[Parr Reservoir]], an artificial lake created along the [[Broad River (Carolinas)|Broad River]], via the Fairfield Pumped Storage power station.
The lake is mainly used to cool the turbines of a nearby nuclear power plant. It is famous locally for its catfishing, as some 60 lb. and up fish have been pulled from its waters.
Fluctuations in the level of the reservoir are thought to have increased the incidence of induced seismicity in the area.[tpl]cite journal|last=Talwani|first=P.|year=1997|title=On the Nature of Reservoir-induced Seismicity|journal=Pure and Applied Geophysics|volume=150|issue=3-4|pages=473–492|issn=0033-4553|doi=10.1007/s000240050089[/tpl]
The referenced study by Talwani 2 actually states that after an initial increase, levels of seismicity at Monticello have returned to pre-reservoir levels. Therefore induced seismicity is linked with the initial impoundment, and is not an ongoing issue at this location.
