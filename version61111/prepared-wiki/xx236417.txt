Aaron Columbus Burr, born Aaron Burr ColombeIsenberg, Nancy. Fallen Founder: The Life of Aaron Burr, New York, 2007, pp. 396–397 (1808 – July 27, 1882), was adopted as a son by American politician Aaron Burr after 1816. He was born in Paris, France. Some sources say that his biological father was Count Verdi de Lesle, who died when he was young. Others say he was a natural (illegitimate) son of Aaron Burr, conceived when the politician spent time in Paris during a political exile. The younger Burr grew up in New York City, where he became a silversmith and jewelry merchant; later he traded in tropical hardwoods. 

==Early life and education==

Aaron Columbus Burr was born as Aaron Burr Colombe in 1808 in Paris, France, purportedly the son of Count Verdi de Lesle. Historians Nathan Schachner and Milton Lomask maintain that Aaron Columbus Burr, née Aaron Burr Columbus, was Burr's son by a Frenchwoman from his period of exile in France.Nathan Schachner, Aaron Burr: A Biography (New York: A. S. Barnes, 1961), p.513. Quote: Schachner described Aaron Columbus Burr as "the product of a Paris adventure," conceived presumably during Aaron Burr's exile from the United States between 1808-14.Milton Lomask, Aaron Burr: The Conspiracy and Years of Exile, 1805-1836 (New York: Farrar, Straus, Giroux, 1982), pp. 387-88 The boy sailed to New York in 1816 under the guardianship of Aaron Burr, who adopted him.

During the Civil War, he and Anna Ella Carroll lobbied Abraham Lincoln to have the government fund what they proposed to call "the Lincoln Colony" for freedmen in British Honduras (known today as Belize). This would have been similar to the colonies established in the late 18th and early 19th centuries in Africa by Great Britain in Sierra Leone and by the American Colonization Society in Liberia. In August 1860 Burr had received a letter from James Grant of British Honduras, offering land for sale in the Stann Creek District. Burr had written to him earlier with an inquiry about the land. 
This colonization plan failed. Burr and Grant founded the American Honduras Company to harvest and export mahogany as a trade product.Coryell, Janet L. "The Lincoln Colony: Aaron Columbus Burr's Proposed Colonization of British Honduras", Civil War History 43 (March 1997): 5–16 This tropical hardwood became widely used in fine furniture.
