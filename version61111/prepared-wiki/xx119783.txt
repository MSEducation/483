May has maintained membership throughout the band's line-up, which otherwise underwent many changes over the years, and he was one of the band's main lyricists. He was the primary lyricist for the album, S.F. Sorrow, which has been considered to be the first rock opera and an influence on The Who's Tommy, which appeared shortly afterward.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2011[/tpl]  Controversy still exists as to which band member had the original idea for the piece.Alan Lakey, The Pretty Things: Growing Old Disgracefully (2002)
