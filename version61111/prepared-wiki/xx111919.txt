[[Leonov (crater)]]

CATEGORIES: Impact craters on the Moon

Leonov is a small lunar crater that lies to the south of  Mare Moscoviense, one of the few maria on the far side of the Moon. This crater has a heart-shaped outline, due to an outward bulge along the northwest side. The rim of Leonov is worn, and several tiny craterlets lie along the edge. The inner walls and interior floor are relatively featureless.
