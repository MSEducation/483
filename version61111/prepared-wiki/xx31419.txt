Permaculture is a branch of ecological design, ecological engineering, environmental design, construction and Integrated Water Resources Management that develops sustainable architecture, regenerative and self-maintained habitat and agricultural systems modeled from natural ecosystems.[tpl]cite book|author=Hemenway, Toby|title=Gaia's Garden: A Guide to Home-Scale Permaculture|publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing|year=2009|isbn=978-1-60358-029-8|page=5|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=gxW0MGXha6cC&pg=PA5#v=onepage[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=Mars, Ross|title=The Basics of Permaculture Design|publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing|year=2005|isbn=978-1-85623-023-0|page=1|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=MWb6i-G6QAkC&pg=PA1[/tpl]
The term permaculture (as a systematic method) was first coined by Australians Bill Mollison and David Holmgren in 1978. The word permaculture originally referred to "permanent agriculture" King, FH (Franklin Hiram) Farmers of Forty Centuries: Or Permanent Agriculture in China, Korea and Japan (1911) but was expanded to stand also for "permanent culture," as it was seen that social aspects were integral to a truly sustainable system as inspired by Masanobu Fukuoka's natural farming philosophy.
 
 "Permaculture is a philosophy of working with, rather than against nature; of protracted and thoughtful observation rather than protracted and thoughtless labor; and of looking at plants and animals in all their functions, rather than treating any area as a single product system." - Bill Mollison Mollison, B. (1991). Introduction to permaculture. Tasmania, Australia: Tagari.

==History==

In 1929, Joseph Russell Smith took up an antecedent term as the subtitle for Tree Crops: A Permanent Agriculture, a book in which he summed up his long experience experimenting with fruits and nuts as crops for human food and animal feed.[tpl]cite book | first1=Joseph Russell |last1=Smith |first2=John |last2=Smith | title=Tree Crops: A permanent agriculture| publisher=Island Press | year=1987|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0PQvqpVnFbAC&lpg=PP1&vq=permaculture&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false | isbn=9781597268738[/tpl] Smith saw the world as an inter-related whole and suggested mixed systems of trees and crops underneath. This book inspired many individuals intent on making agriculture more sustainable, such as Toyohiko Kagawa who pioneered forest farming in Japan in the 1930s.[tpl]cite book|title=Forest Gardening|author=Robert Hart|year=1996|page=41|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=N01940btQAQC&lpg=PA41&pg=PA41#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn=9781603580502[/tpl]
The definition of permanent agriculture as that which can be sustained indefinitely was supported by Australian P. A. Yeomans in his 1973 book Water for Every Farm. Yeoman introduced an observation-based approach to land use in Australia in the 1940s; and the keyline design as a way of managing the supply and distribution of water in the 1950s.
Stewart Brand's works were an early influence noted by Holmgren.[tpl]cite web | title = The Essence of Permaculture | url = http://www.holmgren.com.au/frameset.html?http://www.holmgren.com.au/html/Writings/weeds.html|author= David Holmgren |publisher= Holmgren Design Services  |accessdate= 10 September 2011 |year=2006[/tpl] Other early influences include Ruth Stout and Esther Deans, who pioneered "no-dig gardening methods", and Masanobu Fukuoka who, in the late 1930s in Japan, began advocating no-till orchards, gardens and natural farming.[tpl]cite news |title=The One-Straw Revolution by Masanobu Fukuoka |first=Bill |last=Mollison |newspaper=Nation Review |date=1978 September 15–21 |page=18 |url= [/tpl]
The first recorded modern application of permaculture concepts as a systematic method was possibly by Austrian farmer Sepp Holzer in the 1960s.

==Core tenets==

The core tenets of permaculture are:Greenblott, Kara, and Kristof Nordin. 2012.

Arlington, VA: USAID's AIDS Support and Technical Assistance Resources, AIDSTAR -One, Task Order 1. http://www.aidstar-one.com/focus_areas/ovc/resources/technical_briefs/permaculture_for_OVC[tpl]cite book |title=Permaculture: A Designers' Manual |last=Mollison |first=Bill |year=1988 |publisher=Tagari Publications |location= |isbn=0-908228-01-5 |page=2[/tpl][tpl]cite book |title=Permaculture: Principles & Pathways Beyond Sustainability |last=Holmgren |first=David |year=2002 |publisher=Holmgren Design Services |isbn=0-646-41844-0 |page=1[/tpl]
Permaculture design emphasizes patterns of landscape, function, and species assemblies. It determines where these elements should be placed so they can provide maximum benefit to the local environment. The central concept of permaculture is maximizing useful connections between components and synergy of the final design. The focus of permaculture, therefore, is not on each separate element, but rather on the relationships created among elements by the way they are placed together; the whole becoming greater than the sum of its parts. Permaculture design therefore seeks to minimize waste, human labor, and energy input by building systems with maximal benefits between design elements to achieve a high level of synergy. Permaculture designs evolve over time by taking into account these relationships and elements and can become extremely complex systems that produce a high density of food and materials with minimal input.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.edibleforestgardens.com/|title=Edible Forest Gardening[/tpl]
The design principles which are the conceptual foundation of permaculture were derived from the science of systems ecology and study of pre-industrial examples of sustainable land use. Permaculture draws from several disciplines including organic farming, agroforestry, integrated farming, sustainable development, and applied ecology.[tpl]cite web | title = Weeds or Wild Nature | url = http://holmgren.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/23_weeds_or_wild_nature.pdf |author= David Holmgren |publisher= Permaculture International Journal |accessdate= 10 September 2011 |year=1997[/tpl] Permaculture has been applied most commonly to the design of housing and landscaping, integrating techniques such as agroforestry, natural building, and rainwater harvesting within the context of permaculture design principles and theory.

==Theory==

===Twelve design principles===

Twelve Permaculture design principles articulated by David Holmgren in his Permaculture: Principles and Pathways Beyond Sustainability:[tpl]cite web|url=http://holmgren.com.au/product/principles/ |title=Permaculture: Principles and Pathways Beyond Sustainability|publisher=Holmgren Design|date= |accessdate=2013-10-21[/tpl]

===Patterns===

Permaculture is a design philosophy which seeks to exploit and imitate naturally occurring patterns. Patterns occur in nature in many forms: From studying  Fractals, patterns emerge as mathematical principles from apparently random things such as the shape of plants.
Permaculture designers are encouraged to develop a sensitivity to the patterns that exist in nature, to determine their complex functions and the various interrelations. Since humans have complex intentions and a wide variety of goals, permaculture design draws upon a variety patterns, building a pattern language as defined by Christopher Alexander. These natural patterns can often be utilized—either exploited or imitated or both exploited and imitated—to satisfy specific design goals. For example, "the application of pattern on a design site involves the designer recognizing the shape and potential to fit these patterns or combinations of patterns comfortably onto the landscape".Sampson-Kelly[tpl]Full|date=April 2013[/tpl] Patterns such as spiral, branching, wave, net and honeycomb are structural patterns that are repeated throughout nature. "A lot of the structural patterns combine strength and beauty with efficiency of space through large surface area or extensive edges. Looking at the benefits of these characteristics provides us with attitudes that we can emulate in our design work."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.loobymacnamara.com/|author=Macnamara, Looby|title=People and Permaculture: caring and designing for ourselves, each other and the planet|publisher=Permanent Publications|year=2012|page=14|isbn=1856230872[/tpl]

===Layers===

Layers are one of the tools used to design functional ecosystems that are both sustainable and of direct benefit to humans. A mature ecosystem has a huge number of relationships between its component parts: trees, understory, ground cover, soil, fungi, insects, and animals. Because plants grow to different heights, a diverse community of life is able to grow in a relatively small space, as each layer is stacked one on top of another. There are generally seven recognized layers in a food forest, although some practitioners also include fungi as an eighth layer:[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2012[/tpl]

===Guilds===

A guild is any group of species where each provides a unique set of diverse functions that work in conjunction, or harmony. Guilds are groups of plants, animals, insects, etc. that work well together. Some plants may be grown for food production, some have tap roots that draw nutrients up from deep in the soil, some are nitrogen-fixing legumes, some attract beneficial insects, and others repel harmful insects. When grouped together in a mutually beneficial arrangement, these plants form a guild.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Simberloff|first1=D|last2=Dayan|first2=T|title=The Guild Concept and the Structure of Ecological Communities|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|volume=22|page=115|year=1991|doi=10.1146/annurev.es.22.110191.000555[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-70591/community-ecology |title=Encyclopaedia Britannica article on guilds |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-21[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last1=Williams|first1=SE|last2=Hero|first2=JM|title=Rainforest frogs of the Australian Wet Tropics: guild classification and the ecological similarity of declining species|journal=Proceedings. Biological sciences / the Royal Society|volume=265|issue=1396|pages=597–602|year=1998|pmid=9881468|pmc=1689015|doi=10.1098/rspb.1998.0336[/tpl]

===Edge effect===

The edge effect in ecology is the effect of the juxtaposition or placing side by side of contrasting environments on an ecosystem. Permaculturists argue that, where vastly differing systems meet, there is an intense area of productivity and useful connections. An example of this is the coast; where the land and the sea meet there is a particularly rich area that meets a disproportionate percentage of human and animal needs. So this idea is played out in permacultural designs by using spirals in the herb garden or creating ponds that have wavy undulating shorelines rather than a simple circle or oval (thereby increasing the amount of edge for a given area).

===Zones===

Zones are a way of intelligently organizing design elements in a human environment on the basis of the frequency of human use and plant or animal needs. Frequently manipulated or harvested elements of the design are located close to the house in zones 1 and 2. Less frequently used or manipulated elements, and elements that benefit from isolation (such as wild species) are farther away. Zones are about positioning things appropriately. Zones are numbered from 0 to 5.Burnett, G, 'Permaculture a Beginner's Guide' (Spiralseed, 2001 ISBN 978-0955349218)

===People and permaculture===

Permaculture uses observation of nature to create regenerative systems, and the place where this has been most visible has been on the landscape. There has been a growing awareness though that firstly, there is the need to pay more attention to the peoplecare ethic, as it is often the dynamics of people that can interfere with projects, and secondly that the principles of permaculture can be used as effectively to create vibrant, healthy and productive people and communities as they have been in landscapes.

===Domesticated animals===

Domesticated animals are often incorporated into site design.[tpl]cite book|title=Permaculture: A Designers' Manual|author=Bill Mollison|year=1988|page=5|quote=Deer, rabbits, sheep, and herbivorous fish are very useful to us, in that they convert unusable herbage to acceptable human food. Animals represent a valid method of storing inedible vegetation as food.[/tpl]

==Common practices==

===Agroforestry===

Agroforestry is an integrated approach of using the interactive benefits from combining trees and shrubs with crops and/or livestock. It combines agricultural and forestry technologies to create more diverse, productive, profitable, healthy and sustainable land-use systems.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.unl.edu/nac/ |title=USDA National Agroforestry Center (NAC) |publisher=Unl.edu |date=2011-08-01 |accessdate=2011-10-21[/tpl] In agroforestry systems, trees or shrubs are intentionally used within agricultural systems, or non-timber forest products are cultured in forest settings.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2012[/tpl]
Forest gardening is a term permaculturalists use to describe systems designed to mimic natural forests.  Forest gardens, like other permaculture designs, incorporate processes and relationships that the designers understand to be valuable in natural ecosystems.  The terms forest garden and food forest are used interchangeably in the permaculture literature.  Numerous permaculturists are proponents of forest gardens, such as Graham Bell, Patrick Whitefield, Dave Jacke, Eric Toensmeier and Geoff Lawton. Bell started building his forest garden in 1991 and wrote the book The Permaculture Garden in 1995, Whitefield wrote the book How to Make a Forest Garden in 2002, Jacke and Toensmeier co-authored the two volume book set Edible Forest Gardening in 2005, and Lawton presented the film Establishing a Food Forest in 2008.[tpl]cite web|url=http://permaculture.mediamice.net/?page_id=26|title=Graham Bell's Forest Garden[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://transitionculture.org/2009/02/11/film-review-%E2%80%9Cestablishing-a-food-forest-the-permaculture-way-series/|title=Establishing a Food Forest review[/tpl]
Tree Gardens, such as Kandyan tree gardens, in South and Southeast Asia, are often hundreds of years old.  Whether they derived initially from experiences of cultivation and forestry, as is the case in agroforestry, or whether they derived from an understanding of forest ecosystems, as is the case for permaculture systems, is not self-evident.  Many studies of these systems, especially those that predate the term permaculture, consider these systems to be forms of agroforestry.  Permaculturalists who include existing and ancient systems of polycropping with woody species as examples of food forests may obscure the distinction between permaculture and agroforestry.
Food forests and agroforestry are parallel approaches that sometimes lead to similar designs.

===Hügelkultur===

Hügelkultur is the practice of burying large volumes of wood to increase soil water retention. The porous structure of wood acts as a sponge when decomposing underground. During the rainy season, masses of buried wood can absorb enough water to sustain crops through the dry season.Wheaton, Paul. "raised garden beds: hugelkultur instead of irrigation" Richsoil.com. Retrieved 2012-07-15. This technique has been used by permaculturalists Sepp Holzer, Toby Hemenway, and Masanobu Fukuoka.Hemenway, Toby (2009). Gaia's Garden: A Guide to Home-Scale Permaculture.

===Natural building===

A natural building involves a range of building systems and materials that place major emphasis on sustainability.  Ways of achieving sustainability through natural building focus on durability and the use of minimally processed, plentiful or renewable resources, as well as those that, while recycled or salvaged, produce healthy living environments and maintain indoor air quality.
The basis of natural building is the need to lessen the environmental impact of buildings and other supporting systems, without sacrificing comfort, health or aesthetics. To be more sustainable, natural building uses primarily abundantly available, renewable, reused or recycled materials.  In addition to relying on natural building materials, the emphasis on the architectural design is heightened. The orientation of a building, the utilization of local climate and site conditions, the emphasis on natural ventilation through design, fundamentally lessen operational costs and positively impact the environment. Building compactly and minimizing the ecological footprint is common, as are on-site handling of energy acquisition, on-site water capture, alternate sewage treatment and water reuse.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2012[/tpl]

===Rainwater harvesting===

Rainwater harvesting is the accumulating and storing of rainwater for reuse before it reaches the aquifer.[tpl]cite web|url=http://aramo.de/rain.html |title=Rainwater harvesting 2012 |year=2012 |accessdate=2012[/tpl] It has been used to provide drinking water, water for livestock, water for irrigation, as well as  other typical uses. Rainwater collected from the roofs of houses and local institutions can make an important contribution to the availability of drinking water. It can supplement the subsoil water level and increase urban greenery. Water collected from the ground, sometimes from areas which are especially prepared for this purpose, is called stormwater harvesting.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2012[/tpl]
Greywater is wastewater generated from domestic activities such as laundry, dishwashing, and bathing, which can be recycled on-site for uses such as landscape irrigation and constructed wetlands. Greywater is largely sterile, but not potable (drinkable). Greywater differs from water from the toilets which is designated sewage or blackwater, to indicate it contains human waste. Blackwater is septic or otherwise toxic and cannot be reused.

===Sheet mulching===

In agriculture and gardening, mulch is a protective cover placed over the soil. Any material or combination can be used as mulch, stones, leaves, cardboard, wood chips, gravel, etc., though in permaculture mulches of organic material are the most common because they perform more functions. These include: absorbing rainfall, reducing evaporation, providing nutrients, increasing organic matter in the soil, feeding and creating habitat for soil organisms, suppressing weed growth and seed germination, moderating diurnal temperature swings, protecting against frost, and reducing erosion. Sheet mulching is an agricultural no-dig gardening technique that attempts to mimic natural processes occurring within forests. Sheet mulching mimics the leaf cover that is found on forest floors. When deployed properly and in combination with other Permacultural principles, it can generate healthy, productive and low maintenance ecosystems.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.agroforestry.net/pubs/Sheet_Mulching.html |title=Sheet Mulching: Greater Plant and Soil Health for Less Work |publisher=Agroforestry.net |date=2011-09-03 |accessdate=2011-10-21[/tpl]''Sustainable Agriculture by J. Mason, Landlinks Press 2003
Sheet mulch serves as a "nutrient bank," storing the nutrients contained in organic matter and slowly making these nutrients available to plants as the organic matter slowly and naturally breaks down. It also improves the soil by attracting and feeding earthworms, slaters and many other soil micro-organisms, as well as adding humus. Earthworms "till" the soil, and their worm castings are among the best fertilizers and soil conditioners. Sheet mulching can be used to reduce or eliminate undesirable plants by starving them of light, and can be more advantageous than using herbicide or other methods of control.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2012[/tpl]

===Managed intensive rotational grazing===

Grazing has long been blamed for much of the destruction we see in the environment. However, it has been shown that when grazing is modeled after nature, the opposite effect can be seen.[tpl]cite web|title=Prince Charles sends a message to IUCN's World Conservation Congress|url=http://www.iucn.org/knowledge/multimedia/video/?10774/Prince-Charles-sends-a-message-to-IUCNs-World-Conservation-Congress|work=International Union for Conservation of Nature|accessdate=6 April 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Undersander|first=Dan et al.|title=Grassland birds: Fostering habitat using rotational grazing|url=http://learningstore.uwex.edu/assets/pdfs/a3715.pdf|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Extension|accessdate=5 April 2013[/tpl]  Also known as cell grazing, managed intensive rotational grazing (MIRG) is a system of grazing in which ruminant and non-ruminant herds and/or flocks are regularly and systematically moved to fresh pasture, range, or forest with the intent to maximize the quality and quantity of forage growth. This disturbance is then followed by a period of rest which allows new growth. MIRG can be used with cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, chickens, rabbits, geese, turkeys, ducks and other animals depending on the natural ecological community that is being mimicked. Sepp Holzer and Joel Salatin have shown how the disturbance caused by the animals can be the spark needed to start ecological succession or prepare ground for planting. Allan Savory's holistic management technique has been likened to "a permaculture approach to rangeland management".[tpl]cite book| title=Meat: A Benign Extravagance | first=Simon | last=Fairlie | publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing | year=2010 |isbn=9781603583251 | pages=191–193 [/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Bradley|first=Kirsten|title=Holistic Management: Herbivores, Hats, and Hope|url=http://milkwood.net/2010/04/27/holistic_management_herbivores_hats_and_hope/|publisher=Milkwood|accessdate=25 March 2014[/tpl]  One variation on MIRG that is gaining rapid popularity is called eco-grazing. Often used to either control invasives or re-establish native species, in eco-grazing the primary purpose of the animals is to benefit the environment and the animals can be, but are not necessarily, used for meat, milk or fiber.[tpl]cite web|title=Munching sheep replace lawn mowers in Paris|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/breaking-news/world/story/munching-sheep-replace-lawn-mowers-paris-20130404|work=The Sunday Times Apr 04, 2013|accessdate=7 April 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Ash|first=Andrew et al.|title=The Ecograze Project - developing guidelines to better manage grazing country|url=http://www.cse.csiro.au/publications/2002/Ecograzepart1.pdf|work=ISBN 0-9579842-0-0|publisher=CSIRO PUBLISHING|accessdate=7 April 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=McCarthy|first=Caroline|title=Things to make you happy: Google employs goats|url=http://news.cnet.com/things-to-make-you-happy-google-employs-goats/?tag=mncol;title|work=CNET|accessdate=7 April 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Gordon|first=Ian|title=A systems approach to livestock/resource  interactions in tropical pasture systems|url=http://www.be-troplive.be/betroplive/pdf/20121205_944831251_2%20iain%20gordon.pdf|work=The James Hutton Institute|accessdate=7 April 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Littman|first=Margaret|title=Getting your goat: Eco-friendly mowers|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-07-26/classified/sc-home-0725-garden-goat-20110726_1_goats-invasive-plants-gardeners|work=Chicago Tribune News|accessdate=7 April 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Stevens|first=Alexis|title=Kudzu-eating sheep take a bite out of weeds|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/news/local/kudzu-eating-sheep-take-a-bite-out-of-weeds/nQwKL/|work=ajc.com|publisher=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|accessdate=7 April 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Klynstra|first=Elizabeth|title=Hungry sheep invade Candler Park|url=http://www.cbsatlanta.com/story/19864571/100-sheep|work=CBS Atlanta|accessdate=7 April 2013[/tpl]

===Keyline design===

Keyline design is a technique for maximizing beneficial use of water resources of a piece of land developed in Australia by farmer and engineer P. A. Yeomans. The Keyline refers to a specific topographic feature linked to water flow which is used in designing the drainage system of the site.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.permaculture.co.uk/videos/creating-permaculture-keyline-water-systems-don-tipping | title=Creating Permaculture Keyline Water Systems with Don Tipping| author=Beaver State Permaculture | date= 4 January 2013[/tpl]

===Fruit tree management===

Masanobu Fukuoka, as part of early experiments on his family farm in Japan, experimented with no-pruning methods, noting that he ended up killing many fruit trees by simply letting them go, which made them become convoluted and tangled, and thus unhealthy.Masanobu Fukuoka 1985 -revised ed. 1987 "The Natural Way Of Farming-The Theory and Practice of Green Philosophy" Japan Publications, Tokyo. -page 204Masanobu Fukuoka 1978 "The One–Straw Revolution" Rodale Press, U.S.A. -pages 13, 15-18, 46, 58-60 Then he realised this is the difference between natural-form fruit trees and the process of change of tree form that results from abandoning previously-pruned unnatural fruit trees. He concluded that the trees should be raised all their lives without pruning, so they form healthy and efficient branch patterns that follow their natural inclination. This is part of his implementation of the Tao-philosophy of Wú wéi translated in part as no-action (against nature), and he described it as no unnecessary pruning, nature farming or "do-nothing" farming, of fruit trees, distinct from non-intervention or literal no-pruning. He ultimately achieved yields comparable to or exceeding standard/intensive practices of using pruning and chemical fertilisation.The 1988 Ramon Magsaysay Award for Public Service - "BIOGRAPHY of Masanobu Fukuoka" The Ramon Magsaysay Award Foundation website. (Retrieved 2011-3-2).

===Mollison and Holmgren===

In the mid-1970s, Bill Mollison and David Holmgren started developing ideas about stable agricultural systems on the southern Australian island state of Tasmania. This was a result of the danger of the rapidly growing use of industrial-agricultural methods. In their view, highly dependent on non renewable resources, these methods were additionally poisoning land and water, reducing biodiversity, and removing billions of tons of topsoil from previously fertile landscapes. A design approach called permaculture was their response and was first made public with the publication of their book Permaculture One in 1978.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2012[/tpl]
By the early 1980s, the concept had broadened from agricultural systems design towards sustainable human habitats. After Permaculture One, Mollison further refined and developed the ideas by designing hundreds of permaculture sites and writing more detailed books, notably Permaculture: A Designers Manual. Mollison lectured in over 80 countries and taught his two-week Permaculture Design Course (PDC) to many hundreds of students. [tpl]citation needed|date=June 2012[/tpl]
In 1991, a four-part television documentary by ABC productions called "The Global Gardener" showed permaculture applied to a range of worldwide situations, bringing the concept to a much broader public.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2012[/tpl] In 2012, the UMass Permaculture Initiative won the White House "Champions of Change" sustainability contest, which declared that "they demonstrate how permaculture can feed a growing population in an environmentally sustainable and socially responsible manner".[tpl]cite news|title=UMass Amherst permaculture project wins White House award|url=http://www.boston.com/2012/03/13/champion/r2XazdAkdr4SrYpzQWBT7K/story.html[/tpl]
In 1997, Holmgren explained that the primary agenda of the permaculture movement is to assist people to become more self-reliant through the design and development of productive and sustainable gardens and farms.[tpl]cite web | title = Weeds or Wild Nature | url = http://www.holmgren.com.au/frameset.html?http://www.holmgren.com.au/html/Writings/weeds.html |author= David Holmgren |publisher= Permaculture International Journal |accessdate= 10 September 2011 |year=1997[/tpl]

==Trademark and copyright issues==

There has been contention over who if anyone controls the legal rights to the word permaculture, meaning is it trademarked or copyrighted, and if so, who holds the legal rights to the use of the word. For a long time Bill Mollison claimed to have copyrighted the word, and his books said on the copyright page, "The contents of this book and the word PERMACULTURE are copyright." These statements were largely accepted at face-value within the permaculture community. However, copyright law does not protect names, ideas, concepts, systems, or methods of doing something; it only protects the expression or the description of an idea, not the idea itself. Eventually Mollison acknowledged that he was mistaken and that no copyright protection existed for the word permaculture.[tpl]cite web | title = The Permaculture Papers 5: time of change and challenge — 2000-2004 | url = http://pacific-edge.info/the-permaculture-papers-5-time-of-change-and-challenge-%E2%80%94-2000-2004/ |author= Russ Grayson |publisher= www.pacific-edge.info |accessdate=8 September 2011 |year=2011 |quote= In a letter to me, the Institute explained that they were seeking the trademarks because they had been mistaken in their belief that the terms were protected by copyright. This belief had endured for years, Bill occasionally making public statements about copyright protecting Permaculture and how it could be used.Bill also set up a train the trainer system, where others, including April Sampson-Kelly were certified (1993) to teach the PDC Permaculture Design Certificate, the first online PDC via permaculturevisions com. This certification system was changed in 2000 and more contention arose when Bill Mollison then only certified  teachers via his own website. Copyright protects only the expression of an idea, not the idea itself, the Institute confirmed. Copyright protected Bill’s books as an expression of Permaculture, but the idea of Permaculture itself and the elements that make it up remained unprotected[/tpl]
In 2000 Mollison's US based Permaculture Institute sought a service mark (a form of trademark) for the word permaculture when used in educational services such as conducting classes, seminars, or workshops.[tpl]cite web | title =Trademark Electronic Search System (TESS)| url = http://tess2.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&state=4005:o81il1.2.1 |author= United States Patent and Trademark Office |publisher= US Department of Commerce |accessdate=8 September 2011|year=2011 |quote= Word Mark PERMACULTURE -Goods and Services (ABANDONED) IC 041.

==Criticisms==

===General criticisms===

In 2011, Owen Hablutzel argued that "permaculture has yet to gain a large amount of specific mainstream scientific acceptance," and that "the sensitiveness to being perceived and accepted on scientific terms is motivated in part by a desire for Permaculture to expand and become increasingly relevant." Bec-Hellouin permaculture farm engaged in a research program in partnership with INRA and AgroParisTech to collect scientific data.[tpl]cite web|url=http://planetshifter.com/node/1954 |title=Symbols & Patterns.

In his books Sustainable Freshwater Aquaculture and Farming in Ponds and Dams, Nick Romanowski expresses the view that the presentation of aquaculture in Bill Mollison's books is unrealistic and misleading. However Sustainable Freshwater Aquaculture has likewise received criticism as being "too basic", "for primary school children" and "negative" in its approach.http://www.amazon.com/Sustainable-Freshwater-Aquacultures-Complete-Backyard/dp/0868408352 Linda Chalker-Scott alleges that Toby Hemenway's views regarding invasive species in the permaculture book Gaia's Garden are pseudoscience.https://sharepoint.cahnrs.wsu.edu/blogs/urbanhort/archive/2010/04/28/permaculture-beginning-a-discussion.aspxhttps://sharepoint.cahnrs.wsu.edu/blogs/urbanhort/archive/2010/05/26/permaculture-my-final-thoughts.aspx

===Agroforestry===

Greg Williams argues that forests cannot be more productive than farmland because the net productivity of forests decline as they mature due to ecological succession.[tpl]cite news| url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:xIuXvGwog_IJ:findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0GER/is_2001_Winter/ai_81790195/+http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0GER/is_2001_Winter/ai_81790195/&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=au&source=www.google.com.au | work=Whole Earth | title=Gaia's Garden: A Guide to Home-Scale Permaculture | first=Greg | last=Williams | year=2001[/tpl] Proponents of permaculture respond that this is true only if one compares data from between woodland forest and climax vegetation, but not when comparing farmland vegetation with woodland forest.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0GER/is_2001_Winter/ai_81790196 |title=A toolbox, not a tool |publisher=Findarticles.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-21[/tpl] For example, ecological succession generally results in a forest's productivity rising after its establishment only until it reaches the woodland state (67% tree cover), before declining until full maturity.
