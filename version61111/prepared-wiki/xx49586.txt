Bill Richmond (August 5, 1763 â€“ December 28, 1829) was an African American boxer, born a slave in Cuckold's Town (now Richmondtown), Staten Island, New York.  His nickname was 'The Black Terror'.
During the American Revolutionary War, Richmond was the servant of Lord Percy, the Duke of Northumberland, who took him to England in 1777. On September 22, 1776, Richmond was the hangman who executed Nathan Hale.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.redstone.army.mil/history/integrate/CHRON1.html |title=A CHRONOLOGY OF AFRICAN AMERICAN MILITARY SERVICE |accessdate=2007-02-09 |work=Integration of the Armed Forces |publisher=Redstone Arsenal Historical Information |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070301002822/http://www.redstone.army.mil/history/integrate/CHRON1.html  |archivedate = 2007-03-01[/tpl] Later, Richmond was sent to school in Yorkshire and apprenticed to a cabinet maker in York. However, he made his career as a boxer, narrowly losing to later British and world champion Tom Cribb. After his retirement from boxing, he bought the Horse and Dolphin pub in Leicester Square and set up a boxing academy.
Richmond received no boxing tutoring and was entirely self-taught. By today's standards, Richmond, who weighed between [tpl]Convert|140|and|147|lbs|kg[/tpl], would have been a welterweight, and yet he often fought men who weighed [tpl]Convert|4|to|5|st|kg[/tpl] heavier than himself. He had excellent footwork and quick hands, which enabled him to avoid the big punches and outwork bigger fighters (the bob and weave technique). This was demonstrated in his fight with Tom Cribb, who was unable to land a punch in the early rounds. However, Cribb's superior weight and power eventually caught up with Richmond, who lost in the 60th round.
He was also a friend and coach of Tom Molineaux, another freed slave who took up boxing in England and fought Cribb twice for the title of world champion.
He died at his home in London, England in 1829.
