It rises in the remote mountains of southwestern Polk County, about [tpl]convert|10|mi|km[/tpl] west of Pedee. It flows southeast to Hoskins in Benton County, then northeast into Polk County, past Pedee, then east across southern Polk County. It is joined from northwest by the Little Luckiamute River. It joins the Willamette from the west about [tpl]convert|10|mi|km[/tpl] north of Albany. The mouth of the river is located about [tpl]convert|1/4|mi|m[/tpl] downstream from the mouth of the Santiam River, which enters the Willamette from the east.
Among the tributary creeks are Waymire, Vincent, Plunkett, Woods, Maxfield, and Soap. The Luckiamute Watershed Council includes Ash Creek in its watershed study area, although it drains directly into the Willamette River.[tpl]cite web|title=About Luckiamute Watershed Council (LWC)|publisher=Luckiamute Watershed Council|url=http://www.luckiamutelwc.org/about-us.html|accessdate=October 24, 2011[/tpl]
