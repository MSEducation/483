==Background==

Following in the footsteps of policies initiated under the White Revolution that directed the further emancipation of Iranian women, Mohammad Reza Shah determined to make a symbolic gesture by crowning his consort, Empress Farah, during his own elaborate coronation ceremony in October 1967.  Until that date, the wives of Persian monarchs had never been crowned, so it was therefore necessary to design a new crown for the occasion. That honor was bestowed upon the French jewelers, Van Cleef & Arpels.http://www.iranchamber.com/museum/royal_jewels/national_iranian_jewels07.php 
In accordance with tradition, the gems used were selected from loose stones already in the Imperial treasury.  Since it was against the law for items from the Imperial Treasury to leave Iran, Van Cleef & Arpels were obliged to send a team of jewelers to Tehran in order to construct the crown,Pahlavi, Farah.
