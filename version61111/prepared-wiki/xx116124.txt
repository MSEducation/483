The Learning Grid is a UK charity that promotes hands-on activities related to science and engineering for school pupils and students in the United Kingdom. The name Learning Grid is also used to refer collectively to the activities themselves.
The Learning Grid began as a recommendation of the Motorsport Competitiveness Panel, a body set up by the UK Department of Trade and Industry whose final report was announced by the then Secretary of State Patricia Hewitt on 11 July 2003.DTI announcement The name 'Learning Grid' is thought to refer to a motorsport starting grid, since many of the activities have a motorsport theme, although another derivation could be the representation of activities on a map or grid showing the age group on the X axis and level of time commitment required on the Y axis.
22 separate activities have achieved the Learning Grid quality standard, including Formula Student, F1 in Schools, Primary Engineer, Greenpower, STEM days and residential courses run by the Smallpeice Trust, the Shell Eco-marathon, F1 in Schools, the Engineering Education Scheme and The Year in Industry. Accreditation is valid for 3 years, with an annual review.
The Learning Grid has created a quality standard for engineering and science activities. Accredited programmes feature in a Guide published each autumn which is available to assist teachers in choosing suitable programmes for their pupils. The Learning Grid also runs an annual showcase event at Rockingham Motor Speedway near Corby in Northamptonshire.
