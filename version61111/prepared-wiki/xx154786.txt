==About==

Peter Sweatman founded Charity Technology Trust to bring together key players in the charity, business and technology arenas. He was CEO of CTT for 4 years during which its first charitable initiative in online raffles, significantly supported by James Redhead, developed into a broader outsourced platform for Charity IT.  Among the initial supporters of CTT were Charles Dunstone, Peter Wheeler, Lord Joel Joffe, Tessa Baring and Michael Young, Baron Young of Dartington.
The charity’s first initiative was CTT Raffles, which provided online raffling technology to UK charities.[tpl]cite web|url=http://society.guardian.co.uk/conferences/instfundraising/story/0,,751485,00.html|title=Charity Technology Trust|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=7 January 2013[/tpl] The CTT Raffles platform offered a tailored online raffling engine, along with data capture, collation and processing of entries and marketing support.  CTT's raffles platform launched in May 2001 with the support of Oxfam, Guide Dogs for the Blind, Barnardo's, PDSA and the National Trust.
The charity first branched out into e-communications in 2003, offering a charity email service, allowing many leading charities to make a number of email marketing campaigns throughout the year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.civilsociety.co.uk/fundraising/news/content/558/free_email_marketing_facility_on_offer|title=Free email marketing facility on offer|publisher=CivilSociety.co.uk|accessdate=4 Apr 2008[/tpl] In 2004, CTT offered a low-cost charity payment processing terminal and facilities for web processing of direct debits together with tailored web design and integration services.  CTT offered a new paid low-cost email marketing system, using the dotmailer platform to charities and not-for-profits in 2008. In 2010, CTT sent over 24 million emails on behalf of its charity clients. The service was known as CTTMail, but has now been rebranded to tt-mail.
In 2008, CTT joined the global software donation programme run by TechSoup, to deliver Microsoft’s donation programme in the UK. The scheme is open to all registered charities and housing associations, who pay an administration fee, usually of between 4 and 8 per cent of retail price. CTT was already providing Cisco donated products through an online shop on its CTXchange website[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tt-exchange.org/partner_catalogues|title=tt-exchange Product Catalogue|publisher=Technology Trust|accessdate=24 December 2013[/tpl] (now tt-exchange) – Microsoft products were made available on 1 July 2008.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.civilsociety.co.uk/finance/news/content/3211/ctt_wins_microsoft_deal|title=CTT wins Microsoft deal|publisher=CivilSociety.co.uk|accessdate=29 Jan 2008[/tpl] Since then, the programme has expanded to include 14 different technology partners.
In August 2012, the charity was shortlisted for two Charity Times Awards. The partnership with Microsoft was selected in for the Corporate National Partnership Champion category and the partnership between CTT, SCIE (Social Care Institute for Excellence) and Lasa on the Get Connected project have also been recognised, with the project being named as one of six finalists in the Cross-Sector Partnership of the Year category.
In 2013, CTT changed its name to Technology Trust. The registered charity name and company name remains the same.
Current CEO is Richard Craig, and the current Chair is Charles Mindenhall.
