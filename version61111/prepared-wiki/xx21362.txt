Madison is the capital of the U.S. state of Wisconsin and the county seat of Dane County. As of July 1, 2012, Madison had an estimated population of 240,323,[tpl]GR|2[/tpl] making it the second largest city in Wisconsin, after Milwaukee, and the 81st largest in the United States. The city forms the core of the United States Census Bureau's Madison Metropolitan Statistical Area, which includes all of Dane County and neighboring Iowa and Columbia counties. The Madison Metropolitan Statistical Area had a 2010 population of 568,593.

==History==

Madison's origins begin in 1829, when former federal judge James Duane Doty purchased over a thousand acres (4 km²) of swamp and forest land on the isthmus between Lakes Mendota and Monona, with the intention of building a city in the Four Lakes region. When the Wisconsin Territory was created in 1836 the territorial legislature convened in Belmont, Wisconsin. One of the legislature's tasks was to select a permanent location for the territory's capital. Doty lobbied aggressively for Madison as the new capital, offering buffalo robes to the freezing legislators and promising choice Madison lots at discount prices to undecided voters.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl] He had James Slaughter plat two cities in the area, Madison and "The City of Four Lakes", near present-day Middleton. Doty named the city Madison for James Madison, the fourth President of the U.S. who had died on June 28, 1836 and he named the streets for the other 39 signers of the U.S. Constitution.Historic Madison, Inc., Madison's Past – Early History Although the city existed only on paper, the territorial legislature voted on November 28 in favor of Madison as its capital, largely because of its location halfway between the new and growing cities around Milwaukee in the east and the long established strategic post of Prairie du Chien in the west, and between the highly populated lead mining regions in the southwest and Wisconsin's oldest city, Green Bay in the northeast. Being named for the much-admired founding father James Madison, who had just died, and having streets named for each of the 39 signers of the Constitution, may have also helped attract votes.WiC-hear, WiCourts.gov.

===Creation and expansion===

The cornerstone for the Wisconsin capitol was laid in 1837, and the legislature first met there in 1838.  On October 9, 1839, Kintzing Prichett registered the plat of Madison at the registrar's office of the then-territorial Dane County.[tpl]cite book| title= Reports of cases argued and determined in the Supreme Court of the State of Wisconsin| volume= 6 | publisher= E.E.

When Wisconsin became a state in 1848, Madison remained the capital, and the following year it became the site of the University of Wisconsin (now University of Wisconsin–Madison). The Milwaukee & Mississippi Railroad (a predecessor of the Milwaukee Road) connected to Madison in 1854. Madison incorporated as a city in 1856, with a population of 6,863, leaving the unincorporated remainder as a separate Town of Madison.Madison, Dane County and Surrounding Towns, Madison: Wm. J. Park, 1877, pp. 543–558. The original capitol was replaced in 1863 and the second capitol burned in 1904. The current capitol was built between 1906 and 1917.[tpl]cite web | url= http://www.wisconsin.gov/state/core/wisconsin_state_capitol_tour.html | title=Wisconsin State Capitol Tour | publisher=State of Wisconsin |accessdate=2007-05-24[/tpl]
During the Civil War, Madison served as a center of the Union Army in Wisconsin. The intersection of Milwaukee, East Washington, Winnebago and North Streets is known as Union Corners, because a tavern located there was the last stop for Union soldiers before heading to fight the Confederates. Camp Randall, on the west side of Madison, was built and used as a training camp, a military hospital, and a prison camp for captured Confederate soldiers. After the war ended, the Camp Randall site was absorbed into the University of Wisconsin and Camp Randall Stadium was built there in 1917. In 2004 the last vestige of active military training on the site was removed when the stadium renovation replaced a firing range used for ROTC training.
The City of Madison continued annexations from the Town of Madison almost from the date of the city's incorporation, leaving the latter a collection of discontinuous areas subject to annexation. In the wake of continued controversy and an effort in the state legislature to simply abolish the town, an agreement was reached in 2003 to provide for the incorporation of the remaining portions of the Town into the City of Madison and the City of Fitchburg by October 30, 2022.[tpl]cite web | url=ftp://doaftp04.doa.state.wi.us/doadocs/Madison-Madison-FitchburgAgreement.pdf | title=2003 City of Madison, City of Fitchburg and Town of Madison Cooperative Plan |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-11-14[/tpl]

==Geography and climate==

Madison is located in the center of Dane County in south-central Wisconsin, [tpl]convert|77|mi|km|0[/tpl] west of Milwaukee and [tpl]convert|122|mi|km|0[/tpl] northwest of Chicago. The city completely surrounds the smaller Town of Madison, the City of Monona, and the villages of Maple Bluff and Shorewood Hills. Madison shares borders with its largest suburb, Sun Prairie, and three other communities, Middleton, McFarland and Fitchburg. The city's boundaries also approach the villages of Verona, Cottage Grove, DeForest, and Waunakee.
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of [tpl]convert|94.03|sqmi|sqkm|2[/tpl], of which, [tpl]convert|76.79|sqmi|sqkm|2[/tpl] is land and [tpl]convert|17.24|sqmi|sqkm|2[/tpl] is water.[tpl]cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=2012-11-18[/tpl]
The city is sometimes described as The City of Four Lakes, comprising the four successive lakes of the Yahara River: Lake Mendota ("Fourth Lake"), Lake Monona ("Third Lake"), Lake Waubesa ("Second Lake") and Lake Kegonsa ("First Lake"),[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&term_id=9293&term_type_id=2&term_type_text=Places&letter=F|title=Dictionary of Wisconsin History: Four Lakes|publisher=Wisconsin Historical Society[/tpl] although Waubesa and Kegonsa are not actually in Madison, but just south of it. A fifth smaller lake, Lake Wingra, is within the city as well; it is connected to the Yahara River chain by Wingra Creek. The Yahara flows into the Rock River, which in turn, flows into the Mississippi River. Downtown Madison is located on an isthmus between Lakes Mendota and Monona. The city's trademark of "Lake, City, Lake" reflects this geography.
Local identity varies throughout Madison, with over 120 officially recognized neighborhood associations.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cityofmadison.com/residents/Community/index.cfm|title=City of Madison Website, Communities and Neighborhoods[/tpl] Neighborhoods on and near the eastern part of the isthmus, some of the city's oldest, have the strongest sense of identity and are the most politically liberal.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl] Historically, the north, east, and south sides were blue collar while the west side was white collar, and to a certain extent this remains true. Students dominate on the University of Wisconsin campus and to the east into downtown, while to its south and in Shorewood Hills on its west, faculty have been a major presence since those neighborhoods were originally developed. The turning point in Madison's development was the university's 1954 decision to develop its experimental farm on the western edge of town; since then, the city has grown substantially along suburban lines.
Madison, along with the rest of the state, has a humid continental climate (Köppen: Dfb/Dfa), characterized by variable weather patterns and a large seasonal temperature variance: winter temperatures can be well below freezing, with moderate to occasionally heavy snowfall and temperatures reaching [tpl]convert|0|°F|0[/tpl] on 17 nights annually; high temperatures in summer average in the lower 80s °F (27–28 °C), reaching [tpl]convert|90|°F|0[/tpl] on an average 12 days per year, often accompanied by high humidity levels. Summer accounts for a greater proportion of annual rainfall, but winter still sees significant precipitation.

Wisconsin state government and the University of Wisconsin–Madison remain the two largest Madison employers.

Much of the expansion has occurred on the city's south and west sides, but it has also affected the east side near the Interstate 39-90-94 interchange and along the northern shore of Lake Mendota. Underpinning the boom is the development of high-tech companies, many fostered by UW–Madison working with local businesses and entrepreneurs to transfer the results of academic research into real-world applications, especially bio-tech applications.

===Films===

Several films have been made in Madison. One of the most noted was the documentary The War at Home, which chronicled the anti-Vietnam War movement in Madison. Another that made extensive use of the city as a backdrop was the 1986 comedy Back to School, starring Rodney Dangerfield. The 2006 film The Last Kiss used Madison and the university as a back-drop. In 2008, scenes were shot at the state capitol and surrounding area for use in the 2009 film Public Enemies, featuring Christian Bale and Johnny Depp.

===Architecture===

The Wisconsin State Capitol dome, closely based on the dome of the U.S. Capitol, is the jewel of the Madison skyline, and is visible throughout the Madison area because of its position on the high point of the isthmus. A state law limits building heights within one mile (1.6 km) of the structure. The Wisconsin capitol's dome is the second tallest in the nation, after that of the capitol in Washington D.C.Christian A. Holst, The Wisconsin Capitol: Official Guide and History. 2nd ed. Madison, WI: Author, 1919, p. 23. Because of its location in the urban core, Capitol Square is well integrated with everyday pedestrian traffic and commerce, and the spoke streets—especially State Street and E. Washington—offer dramatic views of the capitol.
Architect Frank Lloyd Wright spent much of his childhood in Madison and studied briefly at the University, and is responsible for several Madison buildings. Monona Terrace, a convention and community center overlooking Lake Monona, designed by Taliesin Architect and student of Wright Anthony Puttnam, was based on a 1957 Wright design. Wright designed the seminal Usonian House, which is located here. Another key Wright building, the Unitarian Meeting House, is in the adjacent suburb of Shorewood Hills. The Harold C. Bradley House in the University Heights neighborhood, designed collaboratively by Louis H. Sullivan and George Grant Elmslie in 1908–1910, now serves as the Sigma Phi Fraternity.
The Overture Center for the Arts, designed by Argentina-born architect César Pelli, stands on State Street near the capitol. Since opening in 2004, the center has presented shows and concerts in its Overture Hall, Capitol Theater and The Playhouse. The center houses the Madison Museum of Contemporary Art. Its style, unlike Pelli's Petronas Towers, leans toward sleek modernism, with simple expanses of glass framed by stone that are intended to complement the historic building facades preserved as part of the building's State Street exposure.
Many of the over 175 Madison buildings designed by the architectural firm of Claude and Starck are still standing, including Breese Stevens Field, Doty School (now converted to condominiums), and many private residences."Behold...The Genius Of Claude And Starck", Madison Magazine.
The UW–Madison campus includes many buildings designed or supervised by architects J. T. W. Jennings, including the Dairy Barn and Agricultural Hall, and by Arthur Peabody, including the Memorial Union and the Carillon Tower. The density of the campus has grown to include 8- to 10-story high-rises including dormitories, research facilities, and classrooms. Several campus buildings erected in the 1960s exhibit brutalist architecture, which is now unpopular. In 2005 the University of Wisconsin embarked on a major redevelopment initiative that will transform the east end of its campus. The plan calls for the razing of a nearly a dozen 1950s to 1970s vintage buildings and the construction of new dormitories, administration, and classroom buildings, as well as the development of a new pedestrian mall extending to Lake Mendota.

===Politics===

City voters have supported the Democratic Party in national elections in the last half-century, and a liberal and progressive majority is generally elected to the city council. Detractors often refer to Madison as The People's Republic of Madison, the "Left Coast of Wisconsin" or as "77 square miles surrounded by reality." This latter phrase was coined by former Wisconsin Republican governor Lee S. Dreyfus, while campaigning in 1978, as recounted by campaign aide Bill Kraus.[tpl]cite book |title=Surrounded by reality |last=Moe |first=Doug |authorlink=Doug Moe (writer) |year=2005 |publisher=Jones Books |location=Madison |isbn=0976353938 |page=xiii |pages= |accessdate=July 26, 2012 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8EgjAQAAMAAJ&q=dreyfus+78+square+miles+surrounded+by+reality&dq=dreyfus+78+square+miles+surrounded+by+reality&source=bl&ots=E3LcgUapq_&sig=laOz0X2BD2VP6-_n9fb-7z9ZDmQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=SMoQUIXGMILt0gHTkYHgDQ&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA[/tpl] In 2013, there was a motion in the city council to turn Dreyfus' insult into the official city "punchline," but it was voted down by the city council.http://www.ibmadison.com/In-Business-Madison/July-2013/Madison-to-stay-real-City-Council-rejects-Soglins-proposed-slogan/
The city's voters are generally much more liberal than voters in the rest of Wisconsin. For example, 76% of Madison voters voted against a 2006 state constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage,[tpl]cite web| title=Fair Wisconsin News Release | url=http://www.fairwisconsin.com | accessdate=2007-04-14[/tpl] even though the ban passed statewide with 59% of the vote.[tpl]cite news| title=Key Ballot Measures | publisher=CNN.com | url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2006/pages/results/ballot.measures/ | accessdate=2007-04-16[/tpl]

====Current politics====

Madison city politics remain dominated by activists of liberal and progressive ideologies. In 1992, a local third party, Progressive Dane, was founded. Recently enacted city policies supported in the Progressive Dane platform have included an inclusionary zoning ordinance, later abandoned by the mayor and a majority of the city council, and a city minimum wage. The party holds several seats on the Madison City Council and Dane County Board of Supervisors, and is aligned variously with the Democratic and Green parties.
In early 2011, Madison was the site for large protests against a bill proposed by Governor Scott Walker that abolished almost all collective bargaining for public worker unions. The protests at the capitol ranged in size from 10,000 to over 100,000 people and lasted for several months.

====Historical politics====

In the 1960s and 1970s, the Madison counterculture was centered in the neighborhood of Mifflin and Bassett streets, referred to as "Miffland". The area contained many three-story apartments where students and counterculture youth lived, painted murals, and operated the co-operative grocery store, the Mifflin Street Co-op. Residents of the neighborhood often came into conflict with authorities, particularly during the administration of Republican mayor Bill Dyke. Dyke was viewed by students as a direct antagonist in efforts to protest the Vietnam War because of his efforts to suppress local protests. The annual Mifflin Street Block Party became a focal point for protest, although by the late 1970s it had become a mainstream community party.
During the late 1960s and early 1970s, thousands of students and other citizens took part in anti-Vietnam War marches and demonstrations, with more violent incidents drawing national attention to the city and UW campus. These include:
These protests were the subject of the documentary The War at Home.[tpl]cite news | url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/52754/The-War-at-Home/overview | title=The War at Home (1979) Review Summary | publisher=New York Times | accessdate=July 10, 2012[/tpl] David Maraniss's book, They Marched into Sunlight, incorporated the 1967 Dow protests into a larger Vietnam War narrative. Tom Bates wrote the book Rads on the subject (ISBN 0-06-092428-4). Bates wrote that Dyke's attempt to suppress the annual Mifflin Street block party "would take three days, require hundreds of officers on overtime pay, and engulf the student community from the nearby Southeast Dorms to Langdon Street's fraternity row. Tear gas hung like heavy fog across the Isthmus." In the fracas, student activist Paul Soglin, then a city alderman, was arrested twice and taken to jail. Soglin was later elected mayor of Madison, serving from 1973 to 1979, 1989 to 1997, and is the current mayor, elected again in April, 2011. During his middle term he led the construction of the Frank Lloyd Wright designed Monona Terrace.

====Political groups and publications====

Madison is home to the Freedom from Religion Foundation, which attempts to influence government in matters relating to the separation of church and state. The largest national organization advocating for non-theists, FFRF is known for its lawsuits against religious displays on public property, and for advocating removal of "In God We Trust" from American currency. The group publishes a monthly newspaper, Freethought Today.
