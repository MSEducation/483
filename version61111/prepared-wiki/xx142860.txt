Sangertown Square is regional shopping mall located in New Hartford, New York off Rts. 5 and 5A near Utica, New York. The mall was built in 1980 and has about 80 stores and a central food court. This mall is owned by The Pyramid Companies.  
Much of the mall proper retains the decorations and architecture from the original design, which was dark brown floors and a quaint faux facades reminiscent of "Main Street" America perched above the food court.  They continue to be repainted in the color scheme of their respective tenants below.
In 2005, the mall's once sunken center court was elevated, and brick ornamentation around its food court columns were removed.  In 2007, the unique "boulder" fountain in front of JC Penney was buried with wood chips and artificial vegetation.  All of the globular tinted glass torches have been removed due to remodeling in June, 2013. Originally in the food court was a fountain, with a restaurant surrounding it. It was later removed because of noise issues. The fountain in front of the Sears entrance was removed as well in the early 2000's. The only current fountain is in front of the Macy's entrance.  In the summer of 2013, tthe "boulder" fountain in front of JC Penny was removed.  The last remaining fountain in front of Macy's is due to be removed as well. The mall has had many entertainment options over the years, but in recent time many have gone away. The only arcade closed in late 2011 for construction of DSW. The only entertainment is The Golf Shack, located in the JC Penney wing. The last sit-down restaurant, Friendly's, closed in January, 2013, bringing other smaller food stores along such as Gerturde Hawk and Chicken Now, leaving only 7 restaurants.
