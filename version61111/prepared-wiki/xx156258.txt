==Outline==

Similar with Bushin Kirahagane, this new work comes under "Chou SD Sengokuden". But now the stage is set approximately a hundred years after the previous work so direct connection is subtle.
The main characters are derived from plamodel "Master Grade" that are sold at that time and the mobile weapons from After War Gundam X. Some of the characters who are not released as BB Senshi can be recreated using parts from previous BB Senshis. Another special point of the BB Senshi of this work is their oversized weapons.

==Story==

Thanks to the past efforts of the Touba San Daishougun, Ark had been peaceful for about a hundred years. But suddenly the Tekki Musha Army started going against the Gundams and to counter this the Shinsei Musha Army is formed. In the intense battle, Greatmaru lost both his brothers. Later he came to know the reason for the revolt of the Tekki Musha Army is due to someone changing the Tekki Kokoroe. Mazin Gundam is found to be the culprit behind the events. Through the power of the three Touba Ken, Greatmaru and Tekki Musha Master Zeta became the Touba Daishougun. Touba Daishougun then defeated Mazin Gundam restoring peace to Ark.
