Let's Make a Deal is a television game show which originated in the United States and has since been produced in many countries throughout the world. The show is based around deals offered to members of the audience by the host. The traders usually have to weigh the possibility of an offer for valuable prizes, or undesirable items, referred to as "Zonks". Let's Make a Deal is also known for the various unusual and crazy costumes worn by audience members, who dressed up that way in order to increase their chances of being selected as a trader.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.letsmakeadeal.com/showinfo.htm | title=LetsMakeADeal.com—Show Info | accessdate=2009-12-20 | quote=Wearing costumes was the audience’s idea. To attract Monty’s attention, the traders got creative to out-do each other.[/tpl] The show was hosted for many years by Monty Hall, who co-created and co-produced the show with Stefan Hatos.  The current version is hosted by Wayne Brady, with Jonathan Mangum (announcer), Tiffany Coyne (model), and Cat Gray (live musician) assisting.

==Broadcast history==

The original and most widely known version of the show was broadcast from 1963–68 on NBC-TV, then moved to ABC-TV where it ran until 1976. A weekly nighttime syndicated version of the show was broadcast from 1971–77. Two daily syndicated versions were telecast in the 1980s, one a Canadian-based revival that was broadcast from 1980–81, and The All New Let's Make a Deal, which was telecast from 1984–86. NBC-TV telecast a daytime series in 1990–91 and three episodes of a weekly prime-time version in 2003.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/TV/03/19/television.deal.reut/| title=New Let's Make a Deal gets Zonked| publisher=CNN| date=2003-03-19| accessdate=2009-09-01[/tpl]
The weekly nighttime syndicated series, seen from 1971–77, was distributed by ABC Films and its successor, Worldvision Enterprises. The 1980 daily syndicated series was co-produced and distributed by Canadian production company Catalena Productions, with its American partner Rhodes Productions distributing the series in the United States (as it would later do with another Catalena production, Pitfall). The 1984 daily syndicated series was distributed by Telepictures. A partial remake called Big Deal, hosted by Mark deCarlo, telecast in the fall of 1996 on FOX-TV. In 1998 and 1999, Buena Vista Television (now Disney–ABC Domestic Television) was in talks to create a revival hosted by Gordon Elliott, but it was never picked up.[tpl]cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1999-04-04/entertainment/9904050247_1_hollywood-squares-game-show-show-network|title=The secret words are: game show|last=Petrozzello|first=Donna|date=4 April 1999|work=The Baltimore Sun|accessdate=19 December 2013[/tpl] One episode of the show was part of the summer replacement series Gameshow Marathon on CBS in 2006, hosted by Ricki Lake.
On July 8, 2009 a pilot was taped at CBS Television City, with Wayne Brady as host and Jonathan Mangum as the announcer.  Alison Fiori was the show's first model, but was replaced by Tiffany Coyne midway through the first season.  Danielle Demski replaced Coyne for the majority of the 2013-14 season during Coyne's maternity leave (Coyne taped until her eighth month of pregnancy, and ended with an expectant mothers show;  Coyne returned in late September 2013 taping sessions into the end of the season tapings in December 2013, with those episodes airing late February 2014).  Cat Gray was added in 2011 as live musician.  The program premiered on CBS on October 5, 2009, and affiliates may broadcast this show at different times depending on their commitments to syndicated programming. CBS briefly screened two new episodes daily between the cancellation of As the World Turns and the debut of The Talk in alternating weeks with the other CBS Daytime game show.
With the conversion of CBS's children's block to an all-HD schedule on September 28, 2013, Let's Make a Deal is the only current network program on the five major American broadcast networks besides CBS's Big Brother not yet broadcast in HDTV, instead broadcasting solely in standard-definition 480i.

==Format==

===Game play===

Each episode of Let's Make a Deal consists of several "deals" between the host and a member or members of the audience as traders. Audience members are picked at the host's whim as the show moves along, and couples are often selected to play together as traders. The deals are mini-games within the show that take several formats.
In the simplest format, a trader is given a prize of medium value (such as a television set), and the host offers them the opportunity to trade for another prize. However, the offered prize is unknown. It might be concealed on the stage behind one of three curtains, or behind "boxes" onstage (large panels painted to look like boxes), within smaller boxes brought out to the audience, or occasionally in other formats. The initial prize given to the trader may also be concealed, such as in a box, wallet or purse, or the trader might be initially given a box, envelope or curtain. The format varies widely.
Technically, traders are supposed to bring something to trade in, but this rule has seldom been enforced. On several occasions, a trader is actually asked to trade in an item such as their shoes or purse, only to receive the item back at the end of the deal as a "prize". On at least one occasion, the purse was taken backstage and a high-valued prize was placed inside of it.
Prizes generally are either a legitimate prize, cash, or a "Zonk". Legitimate prizes run the gamut of what is typically given away on game shows, including trips, electronics, furniture, appliances, and cars. Zonks are unwanted booby prizes (e.g., live animals, large amounts of food, fake money, fake trips or something outlandish such as a giant article of clothing, a room full of junked furniture, etc.). Sometimes Zonks are legitimate prizes but of a low value (e.g., Matchbox cars, wheelbarrows, T-shirts, grocery prizes, etc.). On rare occasions, a trader appears to get Zonked, but the Zonk is a cover-up for a legitimate prize.
Though usually considered joke prizes, traders legally win the Zonks.[tpl]cite web |title=Interview with Monty Hall |work=Archive of American Television |url=http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=%22Archive+of+American+Television+Interview+with+Monty+Hall%22&page=1&lv=1# |accessdate=2008-06-24 [/tpl] However, after the taping of the show, any trader who had been Zonked is offered a consolation prize (currently $100) instead of having to take home the actual Zonk. This is partly because some of the Zonks are intrinsically or physically impossible to receive or deliver to the traders (such as live animals or the guy in an animal costume), or the props/employees are owned by the studio. A disclaimer at the end of the credits of later 1970s episodes read "Some traders accept reasonable duplicates of Zonk prizes."  Starting in the 2012–13 season, CBS invited viewers to provide Zonk ideas to producers.  At the end of the season, the Zonk declared the most creative was worth $2,500 to the winner, and other viewers' Zonk ideas were also used.  For every viewer-developed Zonk, the host announced the viewer who provided the Zonk.  The contest has been renewed for its second season in 2013.

===Quickie Deals===

As the end credits of the show roll, it is typical for the host to ask random members of the studio audience to participate in fast deals.  In the current Wayne Brady version, these are often referred on the CBS version as "quickie deals", and are conducted by the host, announcer, and model each.  CBS will post information on the show's Twitter address (@LetsMakeDealCBS) days before taping to encourage audience members to carry and win additional cash for carrying such items. The deals are usually in the form of the following:

===Other deal formats===

Deals were often more complicated than the basic format described above. Additionally, some deals took the form of games of chance, and others in the form of pricing games.

====Trading deals====

====Games of chance====

Games of chance range wide in variety and format:
Depending on the game, the contestant is given the opportunity to stop the game at various points and take a "sure thing" deal or cash/prizes already accumulated or continue on and risk possibly losing.

=====Beat the Dealer=====

"Beat the Dealer" is a game played with three players.  The three contestants choose a card from a board of nine cards to begin the game. The contestant selecting the lowest-ranked card is eliminated (and wins $100), while the other two receive $500.  In the second round, a prize package is shown to the contestants.  The two advancing players select two more cards.  Same elimination rules apply, with the contestant having the higher card winning the prize package in addition to advancing to the final round.  The remaining contestant could quit with their winnings so far or risk them in an attempt to add a car. If the contestant chose to play, he or she selected a card for himself or herself, and one for the host. Before the draw, the contestant was given the option to assign the card to either themself or the host. If the contestant again chose the higher card, he or she won all the prizes announced, but the lower card would forfeit all prizes.
Prior to 2011, the three contestants each choose an envelope which contained cash (two each of $500 or $1,000, depending on the version; with the third containing $50 or $100). The contestant who found the smaller amount was eliminated, while the other two advanced to the second round.

====Pricing games====

Other deals related to pricing merchandise are featured in order to win a larger prize or cash amounts. Sometimes traders are required to price individual items (either grocery products or smaller prizes generally valued less than $100) within a certain range to win successively larger prizes or a car. Other times traders must choose an item that a pre-announced price or two items with prices that total a certain amount to win a larger prize. These games are not used on the CBS version because of their similarities to ''The Price is Right.
Other deals are related to products in the form of when they were introduced to the market, general knowledge quizzes, or knowledge of geography of trips to certain locales used as prizes.  These games are often used on the CBS version.

====Door #4/Go for a Spin====

Played every few days on the 1984–86 version, a trader was chosen at random by a computer based on a number (from 1–36) which appeared on the trader's name tag. The rules were revised several times in early playings, with the rules most associated with the game going into effect by later in the fall of 1984.
Those most common rules saw Hall give the contestant a check for $1,000 and then offered an opportunity to spin a carnival wheel, containing amounts ranging from $100 to $4,000, plus several spaces marked "Zonk." Two other spaces were marked with the word "car", which won a new car if landed on. The contestant could either keep the $1,000 or exchange it for spinning the wheel. Wherever the wheel landed on, that's what the contestant won; if the wheel stopped on a "Zonk" space, he/she received a T-shirt saying "I was ZONKED by Monty Hall." Even if the contestant decided to keep the initial $1,000, he/she was asked to spin the wheel to see how the game would have ended.
In the first playings, the trader was offered a sure-thing prize package or going for Door #4, which hid a cash amount of anywhere from $1–$5,000. When the carnival wheel was initially introduced, the wheel contained cash amounts from $100–$5,000. The trader spun the wheel and could keep the cash amount on which the wheel stopped, or risk their winnings for another spin. However, if the amount of the second spin was less than the first amount spun, the trader won nothing. Also on the wheel was a space marked "Double Deal", which doubled the trader's spin, for a possible total of $10,000. If the trader spun Double Deal with both spins, they also won $10,000. When the permanent rules were first introduced, the initial cash prize was $750, with the wheel's top cash prize at $3,000.
A revamped version, titled "Go for a Spin", was first played on the December 20, 2011 episode.[tpl]Cite episode |series=Let's Make a Deal |network=CBS |airdate=20 December 2011 |minutes=37:24[/tpl] A contestant is selected and shown a sixteen-space wheel, with various cash amounts, five Zonk spaces and one car space. The trader is then asked three questions with two choices each, and attempts to choose the option preferred by the audience in an earlier poll. For each correct choice selected, the trader wins $500 and one Zonk space of the trader's choice is converted to a car space. The trader can keep the money earned or trade it in for one spin of the wheel. If the trader chooses to spin, the trader wins whatever is indicated in the space on which the wheel stops.

===Big Deal===

Each show ends with the Big Deal. Beginning with the day's biggest winner, and moving in order to the winner of the lowest prize value, the host asks each trader if they want to trade their winnings for a spot in the Big Deal (whose value was usually revealed at that point). He continues asking until two traders agreed to participate. However, in the CBS version, only one trader is asked to participate in the Big Deal.
The Big Deal involves three doors, famously known as "Door #1", "Door #2", and "Door #3", each of which contains a prize or prize package. In the two-trader format used until 2003, the top winner of the two was offered the first choice of a door, and the second trader was then offered a choice of the two remaining doors. In the one-trader format used since 2009, the trader simply selects a door.
One door hides the day's Big Deal, which is usually valued higher than the top prize offered on that specific episode to that point. It often includes the day's most expensive prize (a luxury or sports car, a trip, furniture/appliances, a fur, cash, or a combination of items). The other two doors conceal prizes or prize packages of lesser value. The Big Deal does not offer Zonks, although there is always the possibility that a trader could wind up with less than their original winnings. All three doors are opened, in order of increasing value; however, the order of reveal often changes on the CBS version based upon the trader's selection.
Sometimes one of the doors contains a cash prize, contained within a container such as "Monty's Cookie Jar", "Monty's Piggy Bank", a "LMaD Claim Check", or in the CBS version, the "Let's Make a Deal Vault". In some cases these cash prizes have been the Big Deal, but often they are not.

====Super Deal====

During the 1975–76 syndicated season, a new "Super Deal" was offered for Big Deal winners. At this point, Big Deals were limited to a range of $8,000 to $10,000. The trader could risk their Big Deal winnings on a 1-in-3 shot at adding a $20,000 cash prize. A trader who chose one of the other doors forfeited the "Big Deal", but received a $1,000 or $2,000 consolation cash prize. Given this scenario, a Super Deal winner could win as much as $30,000 in cash and prizes. Later, the consolation cash prize was changed to $2,000 and a "mystery amount" between $1,000 and $9,000.
The Super Deal was discontinued when the show permanently moved to Las Vegas for the final season (1976–77), and Big Deal values returned to the previous range of $10,000 to $15,000.
The Super Deal returned on March 26, 2012 on the CBS version in celebration of its 500th episode that day and again on February 18, 2013 to celebrate the show's 50th anniversary and each Super Deal lasted for two weeks and again on the week of April 22. Three envelopes, ruby, emerald, and sapphire, hid cash prizes of $1,000, $2,000, and $50,000. As before, if the $50,000 envelope was chosen, the contestant won the cash and kept their Big Deal.

==Reception==

Upon the original Let's Make a Deal's debut, journalist Charles Witbeck was skeptical of the show's chances of success, noting that the previous four NBC programs to compete with CBS' Password had failed.[tpl]cite journal|last = Witbeck|first = Charles|date = 1964-01-26|title = Two New Daytime Shows Aired|journal = The Blade|publisher = The Toledo Blade Company|page = 10H|url = http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Jh4VAAAAIBAJ&sjid=TQEEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7305,499594|accessdate = 2009-09-28[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Some critics described the show as "mindless" and "demeaning to contestants and audiences alike."[tpl]cite journal|date = 1974-04-28|title = Monty Hall's "Let's Make a Deal" Most Successful Television Program|journal = Boca Raton News|publisher = South Florida Media Company|page = 9B|url = http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hdgPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=pIwDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6753,7961554&dq|accessdate = 2009-09-28[/tpl]
By 1974, however, the show had spent more than a decade at or near the top of daytime ratings, and became the highest-rated syndicated primetime program. At the time, the show held the world's record for the longest waiting list for tickets in show-business history[tpl]cite journal|date = 1974-04-30|last = Buck|first = Jerry|title = Monty Hall Deals in Entertainment|journal = St. Petersburg Times|page = 10D|url = http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fsUNAAAAIBAJ&sjid=LHMDAAAAIBAJ&pg=7197,4484603&dq|accessdate = 2009-09-28[/tpl] – there were 350 seats available for each show, and a wait time of two-to-three years after requesting a ticket.
In 2001, Let's Make a Deal was ranked as #18 on TV Guide's list of "The 50 Greatest Game Shows of All Time."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gameshowfame.com/articles/greatestshows4.htm |title=TV Guide Names the 50 Greatest Game Shows of All Time |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=12 September 2010[/tpl] In 2006, GSN aired a series of specials counting down its own list of the "50 Greatest Game Shows of All Time", on which Let's Make a Deal was #7.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3QrpH7r5s |title=GSN's list of the 50 Greatest Game Shows of All Time slideshow |author= |date= |work= |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=12 September 2010[/tpl]

==Home games==

In 1964, Milton Bradley released a home version of Let's Make a Deal featuring gameplay somewhat different from the television show. In 1974, Ideal Toys released an updated version of the game featuring Hall on the box cover, which was also given to all traders on the syndicated version in the 1974–75 season. An electronic tabletop version by Tiger Electronics was released in 1998.

In 1999, Shuffle Master teamed up with Bally's to do a video slot machine game based on the show with the voice and likeness of Monty Hall.
In 2004, IGT (International Gaming Technology) did a new video slot game based on the show still featuring Monty Hall.
In 2013, Aristocrat Technology did an all-new video slot machine game based on the Wayne Brady version.

==The Monty Hall Problem==

The Monty Hall Problem, also called the Monty Hall paradox, is a veridical paradox because the result appears impossible but is demonstrably true. The Monty Hall problem, in its usual interpretation, is mathematically equivalent to the earlier Three Prisoners problem, and both bear some similarity to the much older Bertrand's box paradox. The problem examines the counterintuitive effect of switching one's choice of doors, one of which hides a "prize."
The problem has been analyzed many times, in books, articles and online.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=sesXaPoWyb0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=gary+gruber#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=The World's 200 Hardest Brain Teasers |author=Gruber, Gary R. |year=2010 |work= |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=May 1, 2011 |isbn=978-1-4022-3857-4[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Adams|first=Cecil|title=On "Let's Make a Deal," you pick Door #1.
