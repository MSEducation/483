Cho Oyu (Nepali: चोयु; [tpl]bo|t=ཇོ་བོ་དབུ་ཡ|w=jo bo dbu yag|z=Qowowuyag[/tpl]: [tpl]zh|c=卓奧友山|p=Zhuó'àoyǒu Shān[/tpl]) is the sixth highest mountain in the world at [tpl]convert|8201|m|ft[/tpl] above sea level. Cho Oyu means "Turquoise Goddess" in Tibetan.  The mountain is the westernmost major peak of the Khumbu sub-section of the Mahalangur Himalaya 20 km west of Mount Everest.  The mountain stands on the  Tibet-Nepal border. 
Just a few kilometres west of Cho Oyu is Nangpa La (5,716m/18,753 ft), a glaciated pass that serves as the main trading route between the Tibetans and the Khumbu's Sherpas. This pass separates the Khumbu and Rolwaling Himalayas.  Due to its proximity to this pass and the generally moderate slopes of the standard northwest ridge route, Cho Oyu is considered the easiest 8,000 metre peak to climb,.Cho Oyu on Peakware  It is a popular objective for professionally guided parties.

==Climbing history==

Cho Oyu was first attempted in 1952 by an expedition organised and financed by the Joint Himalayan Committee of Great Britain as preparation for an attempt on Mount Everest the following year. The expedition was led by Eric Shipton and included Edmund Hillary & Tom Bourdillon.[tpl]cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/6h1/3/3|title=Cho Oyu expedition team, 1952|encyclopedia=The Dictionary of New Zealand Biography|first=Shaun|last=Barnett|date=7 December 2010[/tpl]  A foray by Hillary and George Lowe was stopped due to technical difficulties and avalanche danger at an ice cliff above [tpl]convert|6650|m|ft|-1|abbr=on[/tpl] and a report of Chinese troops a short distance across the border influenced Shipton to retreat from the mountain rather than continue to attempt to summit.Hillary, pp. 79-80
The mountain was first climbed on October 19, 1954, via the north-west ridge by Herbert Tichy, Joseph Jöchler and Sherpa Pasang Dawa Lama of an Austrian expedition.[tpl]cite web|title=Cho Oyu History| url=http://www.k2news.com/co5.htm|author=Everest News.com|accessdate=2008-04-12[/tpl] Cho Oyu was the fifth 8000 metre peak to be climbed, after Annapurna in June 1950, Mount Everest in May 1953, Nanga Parbat in July 1953 and K2 in July 1954.
