The Canadian Payments Association (CPA) is the organisation that operates a payment clearing and settlement system in Canada. The organisation is a not-for-profit organization that: 

==Clearing and settlement systems==

Clearing and settlement systems are essential to the smooth functioning of the economy.  These systems allow financial institutions to calculate how much is owed to each other as a result of their customer's transactions and to transfer those funds to settle those balances.
The CPA operates three main clearing and settlement systems:

==Statistics==

==History and governance==

The CPA was established in 1980 by an Act of Parliament, which was amended and renamed the Canadian Payments Act (CP Act) in 2001.  The Association has 135 members including the Bank of Canada, chartered banks, trust and loan companies, credit union centrals, federations of caisses populaires and other financial institutions.http://www.cdnpay.ca/imis15/eng/Membership/Member_List/eng/mem/Member_List.aspx  The Minister of Finance has oversight responsibilities for the CPA. The Governor of the Bank of Canada has oversight responsibility for the LVTS under the Payment Clearing and Settlement Act.  The Minister of Finance makes three appointments to the Board of Directors and the Bank of Canada appoints the chair, while members elect the remaining 12 directors.  
A 20-person Stakeholder Advisory Council (SAC) provides advice and input to represent the diverse interests of users of the payments system.   The SAC was established by the Canadian Payments Association in 1996 on a voluntary basis and was formalized in the Canadian Payments Act in 2001. The SAC provides advice to the CPA Board of Directors on payment, clearing, and settlement matters, and contributes input on proposed initiatives, including by-laws, policy statements, and rules that affect third parties. It also identifies issues that might concern payment system users and third-party service providers, and suggests how they could be addressed.http://www.cdnpay.ca/imis15/eng/Act_Rules/Stakeholder_Advisory_Council/eng/rul/Stakeholder_Advisory_Council.aspx
The CPA is administered by a full-time staff of approximately 80 and is headquartered in Ottawa.

==Consultation==

The Canadian Payments Act also provides that the CPA must “promote the efficiency, safety and soundness of its clearing and settlement systems and take into account the interests of users”.  Consumers, corporations, merchants, governments and payment service providers represent significant groups of system users, and as such, their interests are taken into account by the CPA in pursuing its objectives.  Uniquely positioned as a consensus broker within the payments industry, the CPA ensures that significant rule changes follow an established public consultation process to seek input from key user groups.  As an example of this consultation, in 2010 the CPA facilitated industry-wide innovation with frameworks for contactless debit payments. In 2012, the Association held consultations on ISO 20022

==Activities==

In March 2010, the CPA released its long-term Payments Strategy: Vision 2020, a roadmap for personal, corporate and wholesale payments which ensures that the systems for payments, clearing and settlement continue to evolve to meet the needs of Canadians until the year 2020, and beyond. Vision 2020 focuses on five pillars:
As part CPA’s Payments Strategy,the Association launched its Payments Strategy Refresh project earlier in 2012 to gauge the strategy against the current domestic and global environment, assess the relevancy of its initiatives and identify any strategic gaps.http://www.cdnpay.ca/imis15/pdf/pdfs_publications/forum_28_4.pdf A roadmap will be developed for the next three to five years, identifying and prioritizing all Vision 2020 initiatives.
