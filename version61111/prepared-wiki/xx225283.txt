[[Lady of all Nations]]

CATEGORIES: Marian apparitions, 1945 in the Netherlands

“The Lady of All Nations” is the name used to describe the series of Marian apparitions to Ida Peerdeman in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.http://catholicexchange.com/the-fifth-marian-dogma-the-churchs-unused-weapon/#.UkJSJxn1zRA.twitter Peerdeman allegedly received a total of 207 visions, the first 56 of which involved the Virgin Mary and began on 25 March 1945. After the Marian visions ceased on 31 May 1959, Peerdeman claimed to have received 151 of what she called “Eucharistic Experiences” for 26 years, where she was given divine revelation, usually during Mass.

==Ida Peerdeman==

Peerdeman was born on 13 August 1905 in the city of Alkmaar, in the Netherlands. The youngest of five siblings, she was an average woman who worked in a perfume factory, and God was the centre of her life. She said she was aged 40 when the apparitions began on the Feast of the Annunciation. Her confessor, Father Frehe, was visiting the family, and Ida recalled seeing a light from the corner of the room. From it came a woman who revealed herself as the “Lady of All Nations", and instructed her to repeat everything she was told. Ida did so, and Father Frehe ordered her sister to write down every word. This reportedly occurred in 1945, while Nazi Germany still occupied the Netherlands. Ida claimed that she had seen the Virgin Mary as she was huddled by a stove with her sisters and priest chatting about the war and the possibilities of what could happen in the future. Ida suffered attacks both from the Church and, she said, from demons for believing in the apparition of The Lady of All Nations until her death in 1996.

==New dogma==

Followers of the Lady of all Nations have asked for a fifth and final Marian dogma of the Co-Redemptrix, Mediatrix and Advocate, and cite four dogmas that have preceded it: http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/MEDIATRI.htm

==Prayer==

This is the prayer that the Virgin Mary is said to have given to Ida Peerdeman:  
In July 2005, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith required that "who once was Mary" must be left out of the prayer given by The Lady of All Nations. The proper ending to the prayer is now "May the Lady of All Nations, the Blessed Virgin Mary, be our Advocate."Our Lady of All Nations
