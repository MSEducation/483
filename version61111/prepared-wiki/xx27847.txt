The periodontium is the supporting structure of a tooth, helping to attach the tooth to surrounding tissues and to allow sensations of touch and pressure. It consists of the cementum, periodontal ligaments, alveolar bone, and gingiva. Of these, cementum is the only one that is a part of a tooth. Periodontal ligaments connect the alveolar bone to the cementum. Alveolar bone surrounds the roots of teeth to provide support and creates what is commonly called an alveolus, or "socket". Lying over the bone is the gingiva or gum, which is readily visible in the mouth.

===Periodontal ligaments===

The periodontal ligament is a specialized connective tissue that attaches the cementum of a tooth to the alveolar bone. This tissue covers the root of the tooth within the bone. Each ligament has a width of 0.15–0.38mm, but this size decreases over time.[tpl]harvnb|Cate|1998|page=256[/tpl] The functions of the periodontal ligaments include attachment of the tooth to the bone, support for the tooth, formation and resorption of bone during tooth movement, sensation, and eruption. The cells of the periodontal ligaments include osteoblasts, osteoclasts, fibroblasts, macrophages, cementoblasts, and epithelial cell rests of Malassez.[tpl]harvnb|Cate|1998|page=260[/tpl] Consisting of mostly Type I and III collagen, the fibers are grouped in bundles and named according to their location. The groups of fibers are named alveolar crest, horizontal, oblique, periapical, and interradicular fibers.Listgarten, Max A. "Histology of the Periodontium: Principal fibers of the periodontal ligament," University of Pennsylvania and Temple University. Created May 8, 1999, revised 16 January 2007. Page accessed April 2, 2007. The nerve supply generally enters from the bone apical to the tooth and forms a network around the tooth toward the crest of the gingiva.[tpl]harvnb|Cate|1998|page=270[/tpl] When pressure is exerted on a tooth, such as during chewing or biting, the tooth moves slightly in its socket and puts tension on the periodontal ligaments. The nerve fibers can then send the information to the central nervous system for interpretation.

===Alveolar bone===

The alveolar bone is the bone of the jaw which forms the alveolus around teeth.[tpl]harvnb|Cate|1998|page=274[/tpl] Like any other bone in the human body, alveolar bone is modified throughout life. Osteoblasts create bone and osteoclasts destroy it, especially if force is placed on a tooth.[tpl]harvnb|Ross|2002|page=452[/tpl] As is the case when movement of teeth is attempted through orthodontics, an area of bone under compressive force from a tooth moving toward it has a high osteoclast level, resulting in bone resorption. An area of bone receiving tension from periodontal ligaments attached to a tooth moving away from it has a high number of osteoblasts, resulting in bone formation.

===Gingiva===

The gingiva ("gums") is the mucosal tissue that overlays the jaws. There are three different types of epithelium associated with the gingiva: gingival, junctional, and sulcular epithelium. These three types form from a mass of epithelial cells known as the epithelial cuff between the tooth and the mouth.[tpl]harvnb|Cate,|1998|pages=247 and 248[/tpl] The gingival epithelium is not associated directly with tooth attachment and is visible in the mouth. The junctional epithelium, composed of the basal lamina and hemidesmosomes, forms an attachment to the tooth. The sulcular epithelium is nonkeratinized stratified squamous tissue on the gingiva which touches but is not attached to the tooth.[tpl]harvnb|Cate|1998|page=280[/tpl]

==Tooth decay==

===Plaque===

Plaque is a biofilm consisting of large quantities of various bacteria that form on teeth."Oral Health Topics: Plaque", American Dental Association. Page accessed April 2, 2007. If not removed regularly, plaque buildup can lead to periodontal problems such as gingivitis. Given time, plaque can mineralize along the gingiva, forming tartar. The microorganisms that form the biofilm are almost entirely bacteria (mainly streptococcus and anaerobes), with the composition varying by location in the mouth.Introduction to dental plaque, Leeds Dental Institute. Page accessed April 2, 2007. Streptococcus mutans is the most important bacterium associated with dental caries.
Certain bacteria in the mouth live off the remains of foods, especially sugars and starches. In the absence of oxygen they produce lactic acid, which dissolves the calcium and phosphorus in the enamel.[tpl]harvnb|Ross|2002|page=448[/tpl]Ophardt, Charles E. "Sugar and tooth decay", Elmhurst College. Page accessed April 2, 2007. This process, known as "demineralisation", leads to tooth destruction. Saliva gradually neutralises the acids which cause the pH of the tooth surface to rise above the critical pH. This causes 'remineralisation', the return of the dissolved minerals to the enamel. If there is sufficient time between the intake of foods then the impact is limited and the teeth can repair themselves. Saliva is unable to penetrate through plaque, however, to neutralize the acid produced by the bacteria.

===Caries (cavities)===

Dental caries (cavities), described as "tooth decay", is an infectious disease which damages the structures of teeth.Dental Cavities, MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia, page accessed August 14, 2006. The disease can lead to pain, tooth loss, and infection. Dental caries has a long history, with evidence showing the disease was present in the Bronze, Iron, and Middle ages but also prior to the neolithic period. The largest increases in the prevalence of caries have been associated with diet changes.Epidemiology of Dental Disease, University of Illinois at Chicago. Page accessed January 9, 2007.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Suddick RP, Harris NO |title=Historical perspectives of oral biology: a series |journal=Crit. Rev. Oral Biol.

In the United States, dental caries is the most common chronic childhood disease, being at least five times more common than asthma.Healthy People: 2010. Html version hosted on Healthy People.gov website. Page accessed August 13, 2006. Countries that have experienced an overall decrease in cases of tooth decay continue to have a disparity in the distribution of the disease."Dental caries", from the Disease Control Priorities Project. Page accessed August 15, 2006. Among children in the United States and Europe, 60–80% of cases of dental caries occur in 20% of the population.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Touger-Decker R, van Loveren C |title=Sugars and dental caries |journal=Am. J. Clin. Nutr. |volume=78 |issue=4 |pages=881S–892S |year=2003|pmid=14522753 [/tpl]
Tooth decay is caused by certain types of acid-producing bacteria which cause the most damage in the presence of fermentable carbohydrates such as sucrose, fructose, and glucose.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Hardie JM |title=The microbiology of dental caries |journal=Dent Update |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=199–200, 202–4, 206–8 |year=1982|pmid=6959931[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal|author=Moore WJ |title=The role of sugar in the aetiology of dental caries. 1.

Depending on the extent of tooth destruction, various treatments can be used to restore teeth to proper form, function, and aesthetics, but there is no known method to regenerate large amounts of tooth structure. Instead, dental health organizations advocate preventative and prophylactic measures, such as regular oral hygiene and dietary modifications, to avoid dental caries.

==Tooth care==

Oral hygiene is the practice of keeping the mouth clean and is a means of preventing dental caries, gingivitis, periodontal disease, bad breath, and other dental disorders. It consists of both professional and personal care. Regular cleanings, usually done by dentists and dental hygienists, remove tartar (mineralized plaque) that may develop even with careful brushing and flossing. Professional cleaning includes tooth scaling, using various instruments or devices to loosen and remove deposits from teeth.
The purpose of cleaning teeth is to remove plaque, which consists mostly of bacteria.Introduction to Dental Plaque. Leeds Dental Institute, page accessed August 14, 2006. Healthcare professionals recommend regular brushing twice a day (in the morning and in the evening, or after meals) in order to prevent formation of plaque and tartar.Oral Health Topics: Cleaning your teeth and gums. American Dental Association. Page accessed August 15, 2006. A toothbrush is able to remove most plaque, except in areas between teeth. As a result, flossing is also considered a necessity to maintain oral hygiene. When used correctly, dental floss removes plaque from between teeth and at the gum line, where periodontal disease often begins and could develop caries.
Electric toothbrushes are a popular aid to oral hygiene. A user without disabilities, with proper training in manual brushing, and with good motivation, can achieve standards of oral hygiene at least as satisfactory as the best electric brushes, but untrained users rarely achieve anything of the kind. Not all electric toothbrushes are equally effective and even a good design needs to be used properly for best effect, but: "Electric toothbrushes tend to help people who are not as good at cleaning teeth and as a result have had oral hygiene problems." Thumbs down for electric toothbrush, BBC News, January 21, 2003. Page accessed January 23, 2007. The most important advantage of electric toothbrushes is their ability to aid people with dexterity difficulties, such as those associated with rheumatoid arthritis.
Fluoride therapy is often recommended to protect against dental caries. Water fluoridation and fluoride supplements decrease the incidence of dental caries. Fluoride helps prevent dental decay by binding to the hydroxyapatite crystals in enamel.[tpl]harvnb|Cate|1998|page=223[/tpl] The incorporated fluoride makes enamel more resistant to demineralization and thus more resistant to decay. Topical fluoride, such as a fluoride toothpaste or mouthwash, is also recommended to protect teeth surfaces. Many dentists include application of topical fluoride solutions as part of routine cleanings.

==Restorations==

After a tooth has been damaged or destroyed, restoration of the missing structure can be achieved with a variety of treatments. Restorations may be created from a variety of materials, including glass ionomer, amalgam, gold, porcelain, and composite."Oral Health Topics: Dental Filling Options", ada.org, page accessed May 8, 2007. Small restorations placed inside a tooth are referred to as "intracoronal restorations". These restorations may be formed directly in the mouth or may be cast using the lost-wax technique, such as for some inlays and onlays. When larger portions of a tooth are lost, an "extracoronal restoration" may be fabricated, such as an artifical crown or a veneer, to restore the involved tooth.
When a tooth is lost, dentures, bridges, or implants may be used as replacements."Prosthodontic Procedures", The American College of Prosthodontists. Page accessed May 16, 2007. Dentures are usually the least costly whereas implants are usually the most expensive. Dentures may replace complete arches of the mouth or only a partial number of teeth. Bridges replace smaller spaces of missing teeth and use adjacent teeth to support the restoration. Dental implants may be used to replace a single tooth or a series of teeth. Though implants are the most expensive treatment option, they are often the most desirable restoration because of their aesthetics and function. To improve the function of dentures, implants may be used as support."Dental Implants", American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons. Page accessed May 16, 2007.

==Abnormalities==

Tooth abnormalities may be categorized according to whether they have environmental or developmental causes.[tpl]harvnb|Neville|2002|page=50.[/tpl] While environmental abnormalities may appear to have an obvious cause, there may not appear to be any known cause for some developmental abnormalities. Environmental forces may affect teeth during development, destroy tooth structure after development, discolor teeth at any stage of development, or alter the course of tooth eruption. Developmental abnormalities most commonly affect the number, size, shape, and structure of teeth.

===Environmental===

====Alteration during tooth development====

Tooth abnormalities caused by environmental factors during tooth development have long-lasting effects. Enamel and dentin do not regenerate after they mineralize initially. Enamel hypoplasia is a condition in which the amount of enamel formed is inadequate.[tpl]harvnb|Ash|2003|page=31[/tpl] This results either in pits and grooves in areas of the tooth or in widespread absence of enamel. Diffuse opacities of enamel does not affect the amount of enamel but changes its appearance. Affected enamel has a different translucency than the rest of the tooth. Demarcated opacities of enamel have sharp boundaries where the translucency decreases and manifest a white, cream, yellow, or brown color. All these may be caused by a systemic event, such as an exanthematous fever.[tpl]harvnb|Neville|2002|page= 51[/tpl] Turner's hypoplasia is a portion of missing or diminished enamel on a permanent tooth usually from a prior infection of a nearby primary tooth. Hypoplasia may also result from antineoplastic therapy. Dental fluorosis is condition which results from ingesting excessive amounts of fluoride and leads to teeth which are spotted, yellow, brown, black or sometimes pitted. Enamel hypoplasia resulting from syphilis is frequently referred to as Hutchinson's teeth, which is considered one part of Hutchinson's triad.Syphilis: Complications, Mayo Clinic. Page accessed January 21, 2007.

====Destruction after development====

Tooth destruction from processes other than dental caries is considered a normal physiologic process but may become severe enough to become a pathologic condition. Attrition is the loss of tooth structure by mechanical forces from opposing teeth."Loss of Tooth Structure", American Dental Hygiene Association. Page accessed April 25, 2007. Attrition initially affects the enamel and, if unchecked, may proceed to the underlying dentin. Abrasion is the loss of tooth structure by mechanical forces from a foreign element."Abnormalities of Teeth", University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Dentistry. Page accessed April 25, 2007. If this force begins at the cementoenamel junction, then progression of tooth loss can be rapid since enamel is very thin in this region of the tooth. A common source of this type of tooth wear is excessive force when using a toothbrush. Erosion is the loss of tooth structure due to chemical dissolution by acids not of bacterial origin.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.agd.org/library/2003/aug/200308_yip.pdf |pmid=15055615|year=2003|last1=Yip|first1=KH|last2=Smales|first2=RJ|last3=Kaidonis|first3=JA|title=The diagnosis and control of extrinsic acid erosion of tooth substance|volume=51|issue=4|pages=350–3; quiz 354|journal=General dentistry[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|author=Gandara B.K., Truelove E.L. |url=http://www.jaypeejournals.com/eJournals/ShowText.aspx?ID=1427&Type=PAID&TYP=TOP&IN=~/eJournals/images/JPLOGO.gif&IID=121&isPDF=NO|pmid=12167897|year=1999|title=Diagnosis and management of dental erosion|volume=1|issue=1|pages=16–23|journal=The journal of contemporary dental practice[/tpl] Signs of tooth destruction from erosion is a common characteristic in the mouths of people with bulimia since vomiting results in exposure of the teeth to gastric acids. Another important source of erosive acids are from frequent sucking of lemon juice. Abfraction is the loss of tooth structure from flexural forces. As teeth flex under pressure, the arrangement of teeth touching each other, known as occlusion, causes tension on one side of the tooth and compression on the other side of the tooth. This is believed to cause V-shaped depressions on the side under tension and C-shaped depressions on the side under compression. When tooth destruction occurs at the roots of teeth, the process is referred to as internal resorption, when caused by cells within the pulp, or external resorption, when caused by cells in the periodontal ligament.

====Discoloration====

Discoloration of teeth may result from bacteria stains, tobacco, tea, coffee, foods with an abundance of chlorophyll, restorative materials, and medications.[tpl]harvnb|Neville|2002|page= 63[/tpl] Stains from bacteria may cause colors varying from green to black to orange. Green stains also result from foods with chlorophyll or excessive exposure to copper or nickel. Amalgam, a common dental restorative material, may turn adjacent areas of teeth black or gray. Long term use of chlorhexidine, a mouthwash, may encourage extrinsic stain formation near the gingiva on teeth. This is usually easy for a hygienist to remove. Systemic disorders also can cause tooth discoloration. Congenital erythropoietic porphyria causes porphyrins to be deposited in teeth, causing a red-brown coloration. Blue discoloration may occur with alkaptonuria and rarely with Parkinson's disease. Erythroblastosis fetalis and biliary atresia are diseases which may cause teeth to appear green from the deposition of biliverdin. Also, trauma may change a tooth to a pink, yellow, or dark gray color. Pink and red discolorations are also associated in patients with lepromatous leprosy. Some medications, such as tetracycline antibiotics, may become incorporated into the structure of a tooth, causing intrinsic staining of the teeth.

====Alteration of eruption====

Tooth eruption may be altered by some environmental factors. When eruption is prematurely stopped, the tooth is said to be impacted. The most common cause of tooth impaction is lack of space in the mouth for the tooth.[tpl]harvnb|Neville,|2002|page=66[/tpl] Other causes may be tumors, cysts, trauma, and thickened bone or soft tissue. Ankylosis of a tooth occurs when the tooth has already erupted into the mouth but the cementum or dentin has fused with the alveolar bone. This may cause a person to retain their primary tooth instead of having it replaced by a permanent one.
A technique for altering the natural progression of eruption is employed by orthodontists who wish to delay or speed up the eruption of certain teeth for reasons of space maintenance or otherwise preventing crowding and/or spacing. If a primary tooth is extracted before its succeeding permanent tooth's root reaches ⅓ of its total growth, the eruption of the permanent tooth will be delayed. Conversely, if the roots of the permanent tooth are more than ⅔ complete, the eruption of the permanent tooth will be accelerated. Between ⅓ and ⅔, it is unknown exactly what will occur to the speed of eruption.

===Developmental===

====Abnormality in number====

Some systemic disorders which may result in hyperdontia include Apert syndrome, Cleidocranial dysostosis, Crouzon syndrome, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, Gardner syndrome, and Sturge–Weber syndrome.[tpl]harvnb|Neville|2002|page=70[/tpl]  Some systemic disorders which may result in hypodontia include Crouzon syndrome, Ectodermal dysplasia, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, and Gorlin syndrome.[tpl]harvnb|Neville|2002|page=69[/tpl]

====Abnormality in size====

Microdontia of a single tooth is more likely to occur in a maxillary lateral incisor. The second most likely tooth to have microdontia are third molars. Macrodontia of all the teeth is known to occur in pituitary gigantism and pineal hyperplasia. It may also occur on one side of the face in cases of hemifacial hyperplasia.
