The World in Action was a series of propaganda films from the National Film Board of Canada (NFB), created to boost morale and show the Allied war effort during World War II.
The series was inspired by the success of the NFB's Canada Carries On series. Patterned after the popular American March of Time newsreels, The World in Action was designed to appear to a broader international audience than Canada Carries On . It was distributed internationally by United Artists.[tpl]cite book|last=Ellis|first=Jack C.|coauthors=Betsy A.
