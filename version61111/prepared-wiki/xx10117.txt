==Language==

French is the only official language of Reunion. Although not official, Réunion Creole is also commonly spoken by the majority of the population. One can hear it in any administration or office, but education is only in French.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=rcf |title=Ethnologue report (language code:rcf) |publisher=Ethnologue.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-16[/tpl]
Tamil is taught as optional language in some schools. Due to the diverse population, other languages such as Mandarin, Hakka and Cantonese are also spoken by members of the Chinese community, but fewer people speak these languages as younger generations start to converse in French. The number of speakers of Indian languages (mostly Urdu and Gujarati) is also dropping sharply. Arabic is taught in mosques and spoken by a small community of Arabs.

==Ethnic groups==

Ethnic groups present include people of European, African, Malagasy, Indians and Chinese origin as well as many of mixed race. Local names for these are used: Yabs, Cafres, Malbars and Zarabes (both ethnic groups of Indian origin) and Chinois (Réunion).
The fraction of people of each ethnicity is not known exactly, since the 1958 constitution bans ethnic censuses in France,[tpl]cite web|url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1236362 |title=SSRN-Why France Needs to Collect Data on Racial Identity - In a French Way by David Oppenheimer |publisher=Papers.ssrn.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-16[/tpl] and applies in Réunion. Extensive and long-going intermarriage also blurs the issue. Whites are estimated to make up approximately one-quarter of the population, Indians also roughly a quarter, and people of Chinese ancestry to form roughly 3%. The percentages for mixed race people and those of Afro-Malagasy origins vary wildly between estimates. Some people of Vietnamese ancestry also live on the island, though they are very few in number.[tpl]cite web |title=La Réunion Métisse |author=Clicanoo |url=http://www.clicanoo.com/index.php?id_article=97657&page=article[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=Anthropometric evaluations of body composition of undergraduate students at the University of La Réunion |url=http://advan.physiology.org/cgi/content/full/30/4/248[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2010[/tpl]
People of Tamil and Gujarati origin make up the majority of the Indo-Réunionnais people; Bihari and other origins form the remainder of the population.[tpl]cite web|url=http://indiandiaspora.nic.in/diasporapdf/chapter6.pdf |title=NRI |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-04-16[/tpl] The island's community of Muslims from North Western India and elsewhere is also commonly referred to as Zarab.
Creoles (a name given to those born on the island, of various ethnic origins), make up the majority of the population. Groups that are not creole include people from Metropolitan France (known as zoreils) and those from Mayotte and the Comoros.

===Genetics===

In 2005, a genetic study on mixed race people of Réunion found the following.
For maternal (mitochondrial) DNA, the haplogroups are Indian (44%), East Asian (27%), European/Middle Eastern (19%) or African (10%). The Indian lineages are M2, M6 and U2i, the East Asian ones are E1, D5a, M7c, and F (E1 and M7c also found only in South East Asia and in Madagscar), the European/Middle Eastern ones are U2e, T1, J, H, and I, and the African ones are L1b1, L2a1, L3b, and L3e1.
For paternal (Y-chromosome) DNA, the haplogroups are European/Middle Eastern (85%) or East Asian (15%). The European lineages are R1b and I, the Middle Eastern one E1b1b1c (formerly E3b3) (also found in Northeast Africa), and the East Asian ones are R1a (found in many parts of the world including Europe and Central and Southern Asia but the particular sequence has been found in Asia) and O3.
