Aurora ([tpl]IPA-la|awˈroːra|lang[/tpl]) is the Latin word for dawn, and the goddess of dawn in Roman mythology and Latin poetry.

In Roman mythology, Aurora, goddess of the dawn, renews herself every morning and flies across the sky, announcing the arrival of the sun.

(Ovid, Fasti iv. 373. or the daughter of Hyperion.Fasti v.159; also Hyginus, Preface to Fabulae. She has two siblings, a brother (Sol, the sun) and a sister (Luna, the moon). Rarely Roman writersThe examples given in translation at TheoiProject are all Greeks or Greek-inspired. imitated Hesiod and later Greek poets and named Aurora as the mother of the Anemoi (the Winds), who were the offspring of Astraeus, the father of the stars .
Aurora appears most often in sexual poetry with one of her mortal lovers. A myth taken from the Greek by Roman poets tells that one of her lovers was the prince of Troy, Tithonus. Tithonus was a mortal, and would therefore age and die. Wanting to be with her lover for all eternity, Aurora asked Jupiter to grant immortality to Tithonus. Jupiter granted her wish, but she failed to ask for eternal youth to accompany his immortality, and he became forever old.  Aurora turned him into a grasshopper.
