[[Top-hat transform]]

CATEGORIES: Mathematical morphology, Digital geometry

In mathematical morphology and digital image processing, top-hat transform is an operation that extracts small elements and details from given images. There exist two types of top-hat transform: The white top-hat transform is defined as the difference between the input image and its opening by some structuring element; The black top-hat transform is defined dually as the difference between the closing and the input image. Top-hat transforms are used for various image processing tasks, such as feature extraction, background equalization, image enhancement, and others.

==Mathematical definitions==

Then, the white top-hat transform of f is given by:
The black top-hat transform of f (sometimes called the bottom-hat transform[tpl]Cite web|last=Tcheslavski|first=Gleb V.|url=http://www.ee.lamar.edu/gleb/dip/10-3%20-%20Morphological%20Image%20Processing.pdf|title=Morphological Image Processing: Gray-scale morphology|year=2010|accessdate=4 November 2013[/tpl]
) is given by:

==Properties==

The white top-hat transform returns an image, containing those "objects" or "elements" of an input image that:
The black top-hat returns an image, containing the "objects" or "elements" that:
Both top-hat transforms are images that contain only non-negative values at all pixels.
