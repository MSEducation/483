Life in Nsara (and all the Muslim nations) becomes increasingly difficult as they face the effects of defeat in the war. Since casualties were so massive, there is a great shortage of men over women and many men who survived the fighting returned as disabled veterans (Budur volunteers to help veterans blinded by gas at a hospital by reading to them). The Muslims were forced to pay reparations to the victorious countries and to make various humiliating concessions such as allowing Buddhist monasteries to open in their cities. There is a general depression and malaise in post-war Muslim society, made worse by the economic difficulties; hyperinflation, food shortages and strikes. In many counties this leads to governments being overthrown in coups of various kinds. In Nsara itself, order begins to break down as people are near starvation and the military attempts to overthrow the government and impose a police state. However many liberals, including Budur and Kirana start mass street protests against this reactionary dictatorship. Eventually the Hodenosaunee League (who have become very powerful after their victory in the war) intervene by sending a fleet (from their naval base at Orkney) to Nsara, insisting that the military relinquish power, which they do. After this, things slowly start to improve, but most of the Muslim states continue to suffer grave problems. Even in China, a victorious country, there is unrest which turns into a civil war.
Throughout this, Idelba has been secretly working on atomic physics and she and her fellow researchers have made some disturbing discoveries. They conclude that it would be possible to make a devastating weapon from nuclear chain reactions and fear that the military will try to create such bombs and restart the war. In order to prevent this, Idelba tries desperately to hide all evidence about her research and contacts concerned scientists in other parts of the world. The government learns of her work however and raids the Zawiyya to get hold of her papers, but Budur manages to hide them. Idelba eventually dies of radiation poisoning from the materials she was working with and leaves all her research to Budur, who keeps her secret and eventually manages to organize an international conference of scientists to discuss the nuclear issue. The meeting is held in Isfahan in Iran (one of the few Islamic nations which has prospered since the war) and scientists from all over the world attend. They agree that none of them will work on the creation of nuclear weapons for their respective countries, no matter what pressure they are put under by their governments and also start a new international scientific movement to break down barriers between cultures in a spirit of reconciliation and friendship (they even create a new scientific calendar to be used by the whole world, with its year zero set from the time of the conference).
Book Ten, The First Years, follows Bao Xinhua who moves to the west coast of Yingzou after witnessing the assassination of his friend, and revolutionary, Kung Jianguo. He marries and raises two children before accepting a diplomatic post in Bangladesh. In his later years he moves back to Fangzhang to teach history and the philosophy of history.

==Style, themes and genre==

The novel is divided into ten chapters which each act as a short story, linked by the use of a group of people who appear in each story. After spending time in bardo, the group (or jāti) are reincarnated into different times and places.[tpl]cite news |title=Grand opportunity to go reelin' in the 'Years' |newspaper=The San Diego Union-Tribune |location=San Diego, California |date=March 10, 2002 |first=Jim |last=Hopper |page=BOOKS-7[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Trio's Lives Intertwine — Again and Again |newspaper=South Florida Sun-Sentinel |location=Fort Lauderdale, Florida |date=March 31, 2002 |first= Chauncy |last=Mabe |page= 10D[/tpl] While characters in each story are unique, they share some characteristics with their previous incarnations and are linked, for convenience, by the first letter of their name. The characters whose names begin with the letter K are "combative, imprudent and prone to getting himself (or herself) killed"[tpl]cite news |title=Past Forward |newspaper=The Washington Post |location= Washington, D.C. |date=April 7, 2002 |first=Gregory |last=Feeley |page=[/tpl] and "striking blows against injustice that typically lead to more suffering".[tpl]cite news |title=Science Fiction |newspaper=The New York Times Book Review |location= New York |date=April 28, 2002 |first=Gerald |last=Jonas |page=20[/tpl] The B characters are "more comfortable in the world, meliorist and optimistic" and "survivors, nurturing friends and family through bad times and patiently waiting for something better". The I characters are "the ones who care, who follow the other two, and may be necessary if their works are to flourish, but who tend to the domestic and always find the world worth loving."[tpl]cite news |title=Islam and Buddhism clash in believable alternate history |newspaper=Edmonton Journal |location= Edmonton, Alberta |date=March 17, 2002 |first=Douglas |last=Barbour |page=D11[/tpl] The style of writing also changes every chapter to reflect the style of writing associated with the culture being depicted. For example, the first chapter is written similarly to Monkey's Journey to the West[tpl]cite news |title=Worlds of wonder |newspaper=The Scotsman |location= Edinburgh, Scotland |date=June 15, 2002 |first=Andrew |last=Wilson |page=10[/tpl] and a later chapter incorporates postmodernism.[tpl]cite interview |last=Robinson |first=Kim Stanley |subjectlink=Kim Stanley Robinson |interviewer=Neda Ulaby |title=Profile: Kim Stanley Robinson's Book "The Years Of Rice And Salt" |callsign = National Public Radio|city= |date=April 14, 2002 |program= Weekend Edition Sunday[/tpl] Also, later chapters take on metafictional elements, with characters discussing the nature of history, whether it is cyclical or linear, whether they believe in reincarnation, and feelings that some people are intrinsically linked.
Robinson incorporated utopian themes in his previous works but reviewers were divided on whether The Years of Rice and Salt qualified as a utopian story.[tpl]cite journal|title=The West Coast of Utopia: Kim Stanley Robinson and the science fiction of hope |first=John |last=Powers |journal= The American Prospect |date=June 2002 |page=45[/tpl] Those that did call the world described in the story as utopian cited the story's illustration of progress.[tpl]cite news |title=Warming Up —- Kim Stanley Robinson's latest is the first in a sci-fi trilogy about a catastrophic ice age |newspaper=The Sacramento Bee |location= Sacramento, California |date=July 14, 2004 |first=Allen |last=Pierleoni |page= E1[/tpl] However, those that wrote The Years of Rice and Salt was not a utopian story say that the world history presented is not necessarily better or worse than the real history, just different.[tpl]cite news |title=Intrigue envelops Russian poet, student Marvelous language fills "The Translator'. |newspaper=The Denver Post |location= Denver, Colorado |date=March 24, 2002 |first=Fred |last=Cleaver |page=EE-02[/tpl] Robinson calls himself a "utopian novelist" in that he claims "all science fiction has a utopian element, in that it tends to say that what we do now matters and will have consequences". Several other themes were identified by reviewers. Robinson had previously used the theme of memory (or identity) and incorporates it into this story with characters who are reincarnated versions of previous characters and who only recognize each other while in the bardo, but sometimes feel a connection between themselves while on earth. The reviewer in The Globe and Mail identified feminism and "struggles over the nature of Islam" as recurring themes.

===Alternate history===

The Years of Rice and Salt belongs to the alternate history sub-genre of speculative fiction. The novel starts at the point of divergence with Timur turning his army away from Europe where the Black Death killed 99% of Europe's population, instead of a third. Robinson explores world history from that point in AD 1405 (783 AH) to about AD 2045 (1423 AH) with Mughal Emperor Akbar being the last character with a real-world counterpart. Robinson's take on alternate history is that because it "is set in the same lawful universe as ours, its science must be the same and because its people have the same basic human needs, their societies resemble ours." Therefore, despite the difference in who specifically is there, "the great majority of humanity is doing their work, and that work would tend to forge along at a certain pace as people tried to solve the problems of making themselves more comfortable in this world." While most alternate histories use the Great Man theory of history, focusing on leaders, wars, and big events, Robinson writes more about social history, similar to the Annales School of history theory and Marxist historiography, focusing on the lives of ordinary people living in their time and place. This is reflected in the title of the novel, The Years of Rice and Salt, which refers to the everyday chores of raising a family, often performed by women, despite the politics and wars of men. Reviewers noted this allows for the "history be experienced by readers on a human scale" and "an implicit but thorough rebuke to the kind of war-gaming determinism that most alternate histories embody." The novel has characters that explore subjects like philosophy, theology, history, and scientific theory.[tpl]cite journal|title=The Years of Rice and Salt |first=George|last=Fisher|journal= New Internationalist |date=October 2002 |issue=350 |pages=31[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Salt' insight into alternate history |newspaper=The Flint Journal |location=Flint, Michigan |date=July 14, 2002 |first= Elizabeth |last=Shaw |page=F03[/tpl]

==Publication and reception==

Released in March 2002, the book was published in North America by Bantam Books and in the United Kingdom by HarperCollins. The paperback was released in 2003 along with a Spanish translation. In the subsequent years, other translated versions were published, in French, Polish, Chinese, and Hungarian. It won the 2003 Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel and was nominated for the Hugo Award, the Arthur C. Clarke Award, and the British Science Fiction Award.
The novel was well received by critics who variously called it "thoughtful", "realistic", and "rich". In Publishers Weekly, the reviewers called it a "highly realistic and credible alternate history", and in the School Library Journal, Christine Menefee called it "an addictive, surprising, and suspenseful novel".[tpl]cite journal|title=The Years of Rice and Salt |first=Christine |last=Menefee|journal= School Library Journal |date=August 2002 |volume=48 |issue=8 |pages=222[/tpl] The Library Journal "highly recommended" it, saying that its "superb storytelling and imaginative historic speculation make it a priority choice for all SF and general fiction collections".[tpl]cite journal|title=The Years of Rice and Salt |first=Jackie |last=Cassada |journal= Library Journal |volume=127 |issue=3 |date=February 15, 2002 |pages=180[/tpl] The critic at Kirkus Reviews found it "overlong, but blessed with moments of wry and gentle beauty".[tpl]cite journal|title=The Years of Rice and Salt |journal= Kirkus Reviews |volume=70 |issue=1 |date=January 2002 |pages=23[/tpl] Likewise, Roz Kaveney stated that "if there is a weakness in Robinson's work, it is perhaps this; his characters are so intelligent that they never shut up".[tpl]cite news |title=Tuesday Book: After the Black Death, 700 Years of New Life |newspaper=The Independent |location= London, England |date=March 5, 2002 |first=Roz |last=Kaveney |authorlink= Roz Kaveney |page=5[/tpl]  For The Globe and Mail, Sol Chrom lauded the epic scope, calling it a "magnificent achievement",[tpl]cite news |title=World without West |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |location= Toronto, Ontario |date=June 15, 2002 |first=Sol |last=Chrom |page=D30[/tpl] and for The Belfast News Letter, the reviewer called the novel "extraordinary, ambitious, poetic and powerful".[tpl]cite news |title=Book review: History as it might have been |newspaper=The News Letter |location= Belfast, Northern Ireland |date=March 11, 2002 |first=Daphne |last=Abernethy[/tpl] Science fiction critic Paul Kincaid concluded that it is "a huge, complex and highly enjoyable book".[tpl]cite journal|title=Big Death |first=Paul |last=Kincaid |authorlink= Paul Kincaid |journal= New Scientist |volume=173 |issue=2335 |date=March 25, 2002 |pages=50[/tpl]
