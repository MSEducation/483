Long Beach/I-105 is a Los Angeles County Metro Rail station on the Green Line.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.metro.net/around/rail/green-line/|title=Green Line station information[/tpl] It is located in the center median of Century Freeway at the interchange with Long Beach Boulevard in Lynwood, California.  It is not necessarily named for the city of Long Beach, California (served by the Blue Line) as Metro Rail usually names most of their stations after the nearest major cross streets.  In this case, the station, located in Lynwood, is named for Long Beach Boulevard which indeed travels down to Long Beach. The original name for this station was Long Beach/I-105 and it may still be used in some places.
