==Origin==

Although Rabuka was mainly responsible for his initiating the unit's existence, it is widely regarded that the unit's founding father, organizer and director was former British 22nd Regiment Special Air Service officer, Major Ilisoni Ligairi BEM, a retired SAS Permanent Staff instructor who, upon returning to Fiji for retirement after serving a 20 year stint with the 22 and 21 SAS regiments in Great Britain in 1984, was called up for service at the request of Sitiveni Rabuka to form the elite unit in 1987.Political crisis intensifies as Fiji's chiefs encourage racialist gunmen.

===Formation===

On 15 May 1987, Ligairi, given the temporary rank of captain at the time, began working on the selection of a tightly knit Close Protection Group (CPG) for tasks ranging from bodyguard and close protection mainly for Rabuka and visiting VIP personnel and intelligence gathering to specialist EOD and counter insurgency work. He modeled the new group and its concepts around the selection criteria and other elements on the SAS.
As more interested soldiers applied for the challenging selection course, the unit evolved steadily under Ligairi's supervision from C.P group to C.R.W (Counter Revolutionary Warfare Unit), trained with the latest techniques in Close Quarters Battle and Counter-terrorism, and tasked with being on 24-hour standby for any terrorist activity that posed a threat to the small island nation.
At one point, a review on the unit had recommended the dissolution of the CRW in 1995 as they acted like mercenaries instead of actually conducting their duties.Destruction of Democracy in Fiji. Retrieved on 19 September 2008.

==Operations==

Most of their operations were kept a closely guarded secret. As their responsibilities increased so did their roles. By 1997 the CRW's size had increased twofold and Ligairi introduced new troops into the squadron, Air and Boat. The unit also changed its name: First Meridian Squadron.  It was now a small fully fledged Special Forces group. Their training and exercises were conducted in joint with U. S. Navy SEALs and MI6 as well as operating as a member of the newly formed PASOC (Pacific Special Operations Command). After 12 years of nurturing the unit and introducing the concept of Special Warfare, Ligairi retired from the Fiji Military Forces in February 1999.

==Mutiny==

The unit continued to function in its primary roles, their secrecy and professionalism shrouded in an aura of mystique common in special forces worldwide until on 19 May 2000 they hit the local and world news headlines when a number of their members took the new ethnic Indian Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry and his Labour-led coalition government of Fiji hostage at the Parliament of Fiji complex led by failed business entrepreneur George Speight and Ilisoni Ligairi.Logbook of 19 May 2000 coup.
