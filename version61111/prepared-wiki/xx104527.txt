Martin's style of music has been dubbed "shoegazing", a word used originally in reference to the distorted electric guitar reminiscent of British bands in the late '80s and early '90s. Martin has also been a member of several side project bands, including Bon Voyage, The Pony Express, and The Brothers Martin. Martin is also credited as songwriter for fellow Tooth and Nail act Neon Horse.Neon Horse on ASCAP
Martin is a Christian and thanks "Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ" on all his albums. Despite this, very few of his songs have Christian overtones. His music is based more often than not on personal issues such as work, family, friends, and his spirituality.
Jason is the only member of Starflyer 59 who has played on every Starflyer 59 album. Earlier in his life he played with his brother, Ronnie Martin, in the synthpop based Dance House Children.http://www.cornerstonemag.com/pages/show_page.asp?38 Jason and Ronnie reunited in the studio in 2006 to record The Brothers Martin, combining both of the current styles from Starflyer 59 and Joy Electric. The CD was released January 23, 2007.
