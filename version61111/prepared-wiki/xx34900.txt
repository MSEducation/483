Kosciuszko National Park [tpl]IPAc-en|ˌ|k|ɒ|z|i|ˈ|ɒ|s|k|oʊ[/tpl][tpl]Youtube|g-SLVFinUEY|Kosciuszko: Reflections[/tpl] covers [tpl]Convert|6900|km2[/tpl] and contains mainland Australia's highest peak, Mount Kosciuszko, for which it is named, and Cabramurra the highest town in Australia. Its borders contain a mix of rugged mountains and wilderness, characterised by an alpine climate, which makes it popular with recreational skiers and bushwalkers.
The park is located in the southeastern corner of New South Wales, [tpl]Convert|354|km|abbr=on[/tpl] southwest of Sydney, and is contiguous with the Alpine National Park in Victoria to the south, and the Namadgi National Park in the Australian Capital Territory to the north east. The larger towns of Cooma, Tumut and Jindabyne lie just outside and service the park.
The waters of the Snowy River, the Murray River, and Gungarlin River all rise in this park. Other notable peaks in the park include Gungartan, Mount Jagungal, Bimberi Peak and Mount Townsend.
On 7 November 2008, the Park was added to the Australian National Heritage List as one of eleven areas constituting the Australian Alps National Parks and Reserves.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.environment.gov.au/heritage/places/national/australian-alps/index.html |title=Australian Alps National Parks information |accessdate=2010-06-10 |work=Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts [/tpl]

==History of the area==

The Snowy Mountains region is thought to have had Aboriginal occupation for some twenty thousand years, though harsh winter weather made habitation of the snow country impossible. Large-scale inter-tribal gatherings were held in the High Country during summer for collective feasting on the Bogong moth. This practice continued until around 1865.Kiandra Historical Society
The area was first explored by Europeans in 1835, and in 1840, Edmund Strzelecki ascended Mount Kosciuszko and named it after a Polish patriot. High-country stockmen followed, using the Snowy Mountains for grazing during the summer months. Banjo Paterson's famous poem The Man From Snowy River recalls this era. The cattle graziers have left a legacy of mountain huts scattered across the area.http://www.kosciuskohuts.org.au/ Kosciuszko Huts Association Today these huts are maintained by the National Parks and Wildlife Service or volunteer organisations like the Kosciuszko Huts Association.Kosciuszko Huts Association In the 19th century, gold was mined on the high plains near Kiandra. At its height, this community had a population of about 4,000 people, and ran 14 hotels. It was here that Skiing in Australia commenced around 1861. Since the last resident left in 1974, Kiandra has become a ghost town of ruins and abandoned diggings.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/NationalParks/parkHome.aspx?id=N0018|title=DECC Kosciuszko National Park|accessdate=2009-04-24|work=DECC National Parks website[/tpl] In the 20th century, the focus of Skiing in New South Wales shifted south closer to the Kosciuszko Main Range.
The Kosciuszko National Park came into existence as the National Chase Snowy Mountains on 5 December 1906. In April 1944, following the passage of the Kosciusko State Park Act, the Kosciuszko State Park was proclaimed.[tpl]cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17926115 |title=KOSCIUSKO STATE PARK. |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 - 1954) |location=NSW |date=1 November 1944 |accessdate=25 April 2014 |page=7 |publisher=National Library of Australia[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Kosciusko State Park Act 1944|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/num_act/kspa1944n14264.pdf|publisher=AustLII|accessdate=25 April 2014|pages=1|format=PDF[/tpl] It then became the Kosciuszko National Park in 1967.[tpl]cite web|title=Top of Australia hosts park's centenary|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2006-12-05/top-of-australia-hosts-parks-centenary/2145852|publisher=ABC News Australia|accessdate=25 April 2014|date=5 December 2006[/tpl] The name was misspelt as Kosciusko until 1997.[tpl]Cite book |title=Discover Australia's National Parks |last=Hema Maps |year=1997 |publisher=Random House Australia |location=Milsons Point, New South Wales |isbn=1-875992-47-2 |pages=112—115 [/tpl]
The construction of the Snowy Mountains Scheme between 1949-1974 saw much of the area explored, brought improvements to roads and resulted in the construction of several dams and tunnels across the Park in one of the world's largest engineering achievements

==Climate==

The higher regions of the park experience an alpine climate which is unusual on mainland Australia. However, only the peaks of the main range are subject to consistent heavy winter snow. The climate station at Charlotte Pass recorded
Australia's lowest temperature of [tpl]Convert|-23|C[/tpl] on 28 June 1994.[tpl]cite web |title=1301.0 - Year Book Australia, 2008 |publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics |date=7 February 2008 |accessdate=2008-04-30 |url=http://www.abs.gov.au/Ausstats/ABS@.nsf/bb8db737e2af84b8ca2571780015701e/77B606A652911396CA2573D200106C95?opendocument[/tpl]

==Glaciation==

During the last ice age, which peaked about 20,000 years ago in the Pleistocene epoch, the highest peaks of the main range near Mount Kosciuszko experienced a climate which favoured the formation of glaciers, evidence of which can still be seen today. Cirques moraines, tarn lakes, roche moutonnées and other glacial features can all be seen in the area. Lake Cootapatamba, which was formed by an ice spilling from Mount Kosciuszko's southern flank, is the highest lake on the Australian mainland. Lake Albina, Club Lake, Blue Lake, and Hedley Tarn also have glacial origins.West,D.,(1994) Kosciuszko Natural Heritage.
There is some disagreement as to exactly how widespread Pleistocene glaciation was on the main range, and little or no evidence from earlier glacial periods exists. The 'David Moraine', a one-kilometre-long ridge running across Spencers Creek valley seems to indicate a larger glacier existed in this area at some time, however the glacial origin of this feature is disputed.Galloway, RW (1963), Glaciation in the Snowy Mountains: A Re-appraisal
There is evidence of periglacial activity in the area. Solifluction appears to have created terraces on the northwest flank of Mount Northcote.  Frost heave is also a significant agent of soil erosion in the Kosciuszko Area.

==Ecology==

The Kosciuszko National Park covers a variety of climatic regions which support several distinct ecosystems.
That which is most closely identified with the park, the alpine area above the tree line, is one of the most fragile and covers the smallest area. This area is a patchwork of alpine heaths, herbfields, feldmarks, bogs and fens.  The windswept feldmark  ecotope is endemic to the alpine region, and covers a mere [tpl]Convert|300000|m2|abbr=on[/tpl].  It is most vulnerable to the wandering footsteps of unmindful tourists.

===Fauna===

Many rare or threatened plant and animal species occur within the boundaries of the park and nine separate wilderness areas have been identified in the latest management scheme.DECC | Kosciuszko National Park - plan of management The park is home to one of Australia's most threatened species: the Corroboree frog. The endangered Mountain Pygmy Possum and the more common Dusky Antechinus are located in the high country of the park.
By 2008, wild horse numbers reached 1,700, with that figure growing by 300 each year, resulting in park authorities' coordinating their culling and relocation.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/01/16/2139601.htm |title=Environmentalists call for aerial brumby cull |accessdate=2008-01-16 |work=ABC News [/tpl]

===Flora===

Much of the park is dominated by alpine woodlands, characterised by the Snow Gum. Montane and wet sclerophyll forest also occur across the ranges, supporting large stands of Alpine Ash and Mountain Gum. In the southern Byadbo wilderness area, dry sclerophyll and wattle forests predominate. Amongst the many different native trees in the park, the large Chinese Elm has become naturalised.
Much of the tree cover in the lower sections of the park was seriously burned in bushfires in 2003.  Fires are a natural feature of the park ecosystem, but it will take some time for the region to return to its pre 2003 condition.

==Recreational uses==

The mountains are typically covered by metre-deep snow for up to four months of the year. The ski resorts of Thredbo, Selwyn snowfields, Perisher and Charlotte Pass lie within the park. The electric rack railway, called the Skitube Alpine Railway, connects the Alpine Way to the Perisher Valley. Guided tours are conducted through several caves in the karst region of Yarrangobilly.
The Australian Alps Walking Track is perhaps the most famous of the walking paths crossing the area. Many thousands of people make the walk to Mount Kosciuszko during the summer. Canoeing and swimming in the rivers and lakes are popular in the warmer weather. The rivers and dams are stocked with trout from nearby hatcheries. Seasonal trout fishing is allowed after a permit is obtained. Other attractions include the whitewater rafting, trail riding, Yarrangobilly Caves, Cooleman Caves, Tin Mine Falls, Australia's highest waterfall and Valentine Falls.
Sawpit Creek has a major campground with facilities for caravans and cabins available for rent. Camping is permitted anywhere in the park except within sight of a road or near a watercourse. The lighting of fires is severely restricted in higher altitudes.

==The Snowy Mountains Hydroelectric Scheme==

The Snowy River originates in the park and flows south to Victoria.  Many tunnels, dams, generators and other parts of the Snowy Mountains Scheme hydro-electric system are located within the park, including the Tantangara Reservoir.
The Snowy Scheme, constructed between 1949 and 1974, is a hydroelectricity and irrigation complex consisting of sixteen major dams; seven power stations; a pumping station; and 225 kilometres of tunnels, pipelines and aqueducts. The Chief engineer was Sir William Hudson.  It is the largest engineering project undertaken in Australia.Australian Bureau of Statistics 1986 Special Article: The Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric SchemeThe Snowy Mountains Scheme[tpl]cite book | author=Wendy Lewis, Simon Balderstone and John Bowan | title=Events That Shaped Australia | pages=189–194 | publisher=New Holland | year=2006 | isbn=978-1-74110-492-9 [/tpl]
