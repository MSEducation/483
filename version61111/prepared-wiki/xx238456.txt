In July 1912 Alemannia merged with Phönix Karlsruhe to form Karlsruher Phönix-Alemannia. During World War II the club played as part of the combined wartime side Kriegspielgemeinschaft Phönix/Germania Karlsruhe alongside Germania Durlach in 1943–45.
Following the war these clubs went their separate ways with Alemannia going on to merge with VfB Mühlburg on 16 October 1952 to create Karlsruher Sport-Club.
