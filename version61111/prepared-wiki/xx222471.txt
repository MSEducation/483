The third USS ''Yuma'' (YTM-748) was a medium harbor tug that served in the United States Navy from 1964 to 1976.
Yuma was built at San Diego, California, by National Steel and Shipbuilding Company (NASSCO), for the United States Army, which took delivery of her in 1954, and designated her "large tug" LT-2078. The U.S. Navy acquired LT-2078 from the Army in September 1964. The Navy classified her as a medium harbor tug, designated her YTM-748, and commissioned her as USS Yuma.
Yuma was assigned to the 12th Naval District and served as a harbor tug at San Francisco, California, until placed out of service in August 1976. She was then assigned to the Pacific Reserve Fleet and berthed at Bremerton, Washington. She was sold for scrapping on 17 March 1987.
