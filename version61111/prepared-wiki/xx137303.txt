[[Tentoxin]]

CATEGORIES: Peptides

Tentoxin is a natural cyclic tetrapeptide produced by phytopathogenic fungus Alternaria alternata. It selectively induces chlorosis in several germinating seedling plants. Therefore, tentoxin may be used as a potential natural herbicide.
Tentoxin was first isolated from Alternaria alternata (syn. tenuis) and characterized by George Templeton et al. in 1967.Templeton, G. E., C. 1. Grable, N. D. Fulton, W. L. Meyer. 1967. Tentoxin from Alternaria tenuis: its isolation and characterization. Proceedings of the Mycotoxin Research Seminar, Washington, D. C., June 8â€“9, 1967. United States Department of Agriculture. pp. 27-29
Tentoxin has also been used in recent research to eliminate the polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity from seedlings of higher plants.Duke, S.O. & Vaughn, K.C. 1982. Lack of involvement of polyphenol oxidase in ortho-hydroxylation of phenolic compounds in mung bean seedlings. Physiol. Plant. 54: 381-385.
