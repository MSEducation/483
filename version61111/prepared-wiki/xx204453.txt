Retaliation, Revenge and Get Back is the solo debut studio album by rapper Daz Dillinger, released March 31, 1998 on Death Row Records.

==Background==

He was one of the last artists on Death Row after its collapse in 1996, after the death of 2Pac. Daz was the head of Death Row while Suge Knight was imprisoned for a fight he, 2Pac, and fellow Death Row members got into with Orlando Anderson in Las Vegas on Sept 7th. The album peaked at number 8 on the Billboard 200 on April 18 with a solid 84,000Gang Starr Bows At No. 6 : Rolling Stone of first week retails. Daz soon left after the failure of this album to form his own record company, D.P.G. Recordz. He later returned to Death Row with Big C-Style to form Dogg Pound Records with such artists as Soopafly, Mac Shawn, Crooked I, South Sentrell, and others.
The album was also the last Death Row album to feature any kind of G-Funk production, the style that Dr. Dre developed which initially made Death Row famous. Since Daz was one of the last of a dying breed, he largely moved on to different techniques after this album, this could be considered the last hallmark of the musical trend.
The album's cover artwork references the cover of Marvin Gaye's album, In Our Lifetime.
