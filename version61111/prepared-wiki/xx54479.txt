[[Radical of an ideal]]

CATEGORIES: Ideals

In commutative ring theory, a branch of mathematics, the radical of an ideal I is an ideal such that an element x is in the radical if some power of x is in I. A radical ideal (or semiprime ideal) is an ideal that is its own radical (this can be phrased as being a fixed point of an operation on ideals called 'radicalization'). The radical of a primary ideal is prime.
Radical ideals defined here are generalized to noncommutative rings in the Semiprime ring article.

==Definition==

Let a and b be in the radical of an ideal I. Then, for some positive integers m and n, an and  bm are in I. We will show that a + b is in the radical of I.  Use the binomial theorem to expand (a+b)n+m−1 (with commutativity assumed):
For each i, exactly one of the following conditions will hold:
This says that in each expression aibn+m− 1 − i, either the exponent of a will be large enough to make this power of a be in I, or the exponent of b will be large enough to make this power of b be in I. Since the product of an element in I with an element in R is in I (as I is an ideal), this product expression will be in I, and then (a+b)n+m−1 is in I, therefore a+b is in the radical of I. 
If an ideal I coincides with its own radical, then I is called a radical ideal or semiprime ideal.

==Examples==

Consider the ring Z of integers. 
The radical of a primary ideal is prime. If the radical of an ideal I is maximal, then I is primary.[tpl]harvnb|Atiyah–MacDonald|1969|loc=Proposition 4.2[/tpl]
