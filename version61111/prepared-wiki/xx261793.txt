==Plot==

When her husband tells her he wants a divorce, devastated Manhattan lawyer Diane heads upstate with her two teens to Woodstock to stay with her estranged hippie mother. In this charming village, Diane and her city kids get a new perspective on life: poetry-reading daughter Zoe becomes interested in a sensitive young butcher Cole, nerdy son Jake finds material for his first film project, and Diane herself grows close to a handsome carpenter/singer Jude. Most importantly, Diane finally gets the chance to end the ancient war with the mother she has not seen for decades.
