==History==

The village was founded on June 23, 1582 during the existence of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and Crimean Tatar slave-raiding.  A Suwałki County official issued a decree from the city of Rajgrod (northwest of Polkowo) granting peasants Mark (Markowie) and Elizabeth (Elzbiece) Konoza (Konozie) the right to settle on the hillock of Polikow (later referred to as the village of Polkowo) near the river Biebrza (current day Biebrza National Park).Drobniewski, Maciej "Mitch".

==Conflict==

In 1777 an armed conflict arose when a landlord of the royal estates chose to impose on the citizens of Polkowo demands for labor, additional payments and higher rents; these citizens initiated a lawsuit (litigants included Mateusz and Marianna Kawalkow Konoza) in the royal court which took several years to resolve; allegations were that the landlord conducted raids of the village, taking oxen, horses and personal possessions; they were also accused of assaults.
In 1778 the court sent a special commission to investigate, which found for the villagers and relieved them of additional requirements.  An appeal suspended the ruling.  
In 1781 a subsequent commission again held for the villagers, but their lease payments were increased to 200 Polish zloty; "Polkowianie" (the people of Polkowo) at that time consisted of 20 hamlets.  In the late eighteenth century the villages of Polkowo, Kopytkowo and Jasionowo, were collectively referred to as district of Bojary.idem
