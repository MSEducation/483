They were also the first elections held after the German occupation during World War I.
The election saw the beginning of conservative dominance of Luxembourgian politics, ending seventy years of liberal dominance that had begun to crumble after the death of Paul Eyschen.  With the constitutional reforms and the birth of the modern political order, the elections are considered the first in the modern political history of Luxembourg.

The election was an overwhelming victory for the Party of the Right, led by Émile Reuter, the sitting Prime Minister.  The 1919 general election was the only occasion in Luxembourgian history on which a party has held more than 50% of the seats (although it was repeated in the partial election of 1922).Thewes (2003), p. 78  Reuter would maintain a coalition with the Liberal League for another two years, before forming the first single-party cabinet on 15 April 1921.Thewes (2003), p. 77
[tpl]note label|reference_name_A|a|a[/tpl] The percentage of votes is not related to the number of votes in the table, as voters could cast more votes in some constituencies than others, and is instead calculated based on the proportion of votes received in each constituency.Nohlen & Stöver, p1254
