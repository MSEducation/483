The People's Monarchist Party (Partito Monarchico Popolare) was an Italian conservative party founded in 1954 by a split from the National Monarchist Party. It was led by Achille Lauro, long-time Mayor of Naples. 
In 1959, after the good result in the 1958 general election (2.6%, while the rival PNM scored only 2.2%), the party re-joined the National Monarchist Party to form the Italian Democratic Party, latterly named Italian Democratic Party of Monarchist Unity.
