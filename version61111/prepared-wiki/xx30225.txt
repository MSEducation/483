The Jetsons is an American animated sitcom produced by Hanna-Barbera, originally airing in primetime from 1962-1963, then later as part of the weekday/weekend morning programming block called The Funtastic World of Hanna-Barbera, until 1987. New episodes were produced from 1984-1987 as well. It was Hanna-Barbera’s Space Age counterpart to The Flintstones.CD liner notes: Saturday Morning: Cartoons' Greatest Hits, 1995 MCA Records Reruns can be seen frequently on Boomerang.
While the Flintstones live in a world with machines powered by birds and dinosaurs, the Jetsons live in the year 2062 in a futuristic utopia (100 years in the future at the time of the show's debut) of elaborate robotic contraptions, aliens, holograms, and whimsical inventions.[tpl]cite news|title= Jetsons: The Complete First Season|work= DVD Talk|date=|url= http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/10529/jetsons-the-complete-first-season/|accessdate=2010-08-27[/tpl] The original series comprised 24 episodes and aired on Sunday nights on ABC beginning September 23, 1962, with primetime reruns continuing through September 22, 1963. It debuted as the first program broadcast in color on ABC-TV. (Only a handful of ABC-TV stations were capable of broadcasting in color in the early 1960s.) 
In contrast, The Flintstones, while always produced in color, was broadcast in black-and-white for its first two seasons. Following its primetime run, the series aired on Saturday mornings for decades, starting on ABC for the 1963-64 season and then in future seasons on CBS and NBC.[tpl]cite book|author=Alex McNeil|title=Total Television|publisher= Penguin Books|year= 1980[/tpl] New further episodes were produced for syndication from 1985 to 1987 as one the original lineup of the weekday/weekend morning programming block known as The Funtastic World of Hanna-Barbera. The show was sponsored by General Mills. [tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl]

==Premise==

The Jetsons are a family residing in Orbit City.[tpl]cite web | url = http://scoop.diamondgalleries.com/scoop_article.asp?ai=2531&si=126 | title = The Jetsons: Did you Know...? | accessdate = 2007-03-12 | date = May 16, 2003 | publisher = Gemstone Publishing | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20030604232327/http://scoop.diamondgalleries.com/scoop_article.asp?ai=2531&si=126 | archivedate= June 4, 2003[/tpl] The city's architecture is rendered in the Googie style, and all homes and businesses are raised high above the ground on adjustable columns. George Jetson lives with his family in the Skypad Apartments: his wife Jane is a homemaker, their teenage daughter Judy attends Orbit High School, and their early-childhood son Elroy attends Little Dipper School.  Housekeeping is seen to by a robot maid, Rosie, which handles chores not otherwise rendered trivial by the home's numerous push-button Space Age-envisioned conveniences.  The family has a dog named Astro, which talks with an initial consonant mutation in which every word begins with an "R", as if speaking with a growl.
George Jetson's workweek is typical of his era: an hour a day, two days a week.Episode "The Vacation", original airdate November 7, 1985 His boss is Cosmo Spacely, the diminutive yet bombastic owner of Spacely Space Sprockets.  Spacely has a competitor, Mr.Cogswell, owner of the rival company Cogswell Cogs (sometimes known as Cogswell's Cosmic Cogs). Jetson commutes to work in an aerocar that resembles a flying saucer with a transparent bubble top. Daily life is leisurely, assisted by numerous labor-saving devices, which occasionally break down with humorous results. Despite this, everyone complains of exhausting hard labor and difficulties living with the remaining inconveniences.

===Recurring characters===

==Voice cast==

In later productions, Jeff Bergman has voiced George, Elroy, and Mr. Spacely. Bergman completed voice work as George and Spacely for Jetsons: The Movie (1990) after George O'Hanlon and Mel Blanc died during production. Controversially, Janet Waldo was replaced — after recording all of her dialogue — by then-popular singer Tiffany for Jetsons: The Movie. Lori Frazier has provided the voice of Jane Jetson in television commercials for Radio Shack.

==Episodes==

The show's original run consisted of 24 episodes that first aired on ABC from September 23, 1962 to March 17, 1963.  In 1984, Hanna-Barbera began producing new episodes specifically for syndication; by September 1985, the 24 episodes from the first season were combined with 41 new episodes and began airing in late afternoon time slots in 80 U.S. media markets, including the 30 largest.[tpl]cite news| title= Fresh Episodes Ending The Jetsons Suspended Animation | url= http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/25045295.html?dids=25045295:25045295&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Sep+10%2C+1985 | date= September 10, 1985| work=Chicago Tribune | publisher= ProQuest | accessdate=2010-11-21 | first1=Michael | last1=Yockel | archivedate = June 29, 2011 | deadurl =  no | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20110629050149/http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/25045295.html?dids=25045295:25045295&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Sep+10,+1985 [/tpl]  The 41 new episodes were produced at a cost of $300,000 each, and featured all of the voice actors from the 1962–1963 show.  During 1987, 10 additional "season 3" episodes were also made available for syndication.

==Theme song==

The series' theme song, by composer Hoyt Curtin, became a pop hit in 1986.[tpl]cite news|title= 'Jetsons' Revival Brings Limelight to Composer |work= Los Angeles Times|date=August 28, 1986|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1986-08-28/news/vw-13985_1|accessdate=2010-08-24|first=David|last=Wharton | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/6AePqT4od |archivedate= September 13, 2012 | deadurl = no[/tpl]

==Reception==

After the announcement of the fall 1962 network television schedule Time magazine characterized The Jetsons as one of several new situation comedies (along with The Beverly Hillbillies, I'm Dickens... He's Fenster, and Our Man Higgins) that was "stretching further than ever for their situations";[tpl]cite journal| title= Television: The Coming Season | date = July 27, 1962 | url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,827481,00.html | journal= Time | accessdate = 2010-11-21 | archivedate = February 19, 2011 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20110219012305/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,827481,00.html | quote = The producers of The Flintstones have a new family called The Jetsons, who live one century in the future.[/tpl] after all the season's new shows had premiered—a season "responding to Minow's exhortations"—the magazine called the series "silly and unpretentious, corny and clever, now and then quite funny."[tpl]cite journal| title= Television: The New Season | date=October 12, 1962| url= http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,829292,00.html | journal= Time | accessdate=2010-11-21 | archivedate = March 6, 2007 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070306180945/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,829292,00.html[/tpl]
Thirty years later, Time said: "In an age of working mothers, single parents and gay matrimony, George Jetson and his clan already seem quaint even to the baby boomers who grew up with them."[tpl]cite journal| title= The Nuclear Family Goes Boom! | date = October 15, 1992| url= http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,976754,00.html | journal= Time | accessdate=2010-11-21 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071030023504/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,976754,00.html |archivedate = October 30, 2007 | deadurl=no [/tpl] Conversely, Jeffrey Tucker of the Ludwig von Mises Institute has argued that "The whole scene — which anticipated so much of the technology we have today but, strangely, not email or texting — reflected the ethos of time: a love of progress and a vision of a future that stayed on course ...  The Jetsons' world is our world: explosive technological advances, entrenched bourgeois culture, a culture of enterprise that is very fond of the good life."[tpl]cite web| authorlink=Jeffrey Tucker|last=Tucker | first=Jeffrey | date =2011-03-29 | url = http://www.lewrockwell.com/tucker/tucker190.html |title = Pushing Buttons Like the Jetsons | publisher=LewRockwell.com[/tpl]

Paramount Pictures first tried to film a live-action version of The Jetsons in 1985, which was to be executive produced by Gary Nardino, but failed to do so.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD3XK2CCJKg In the late 1980s Universal Studios purchased the film rights for The Flintstones and The Jetsons from Hanna-Barbera Productions. The result was Jetsons: The Movie, which was released in 1990.
In May 2007, director Robert Rodriguez entered talks with Universal Studios and Warner Bros. to film a live action film adaptation of The Jetsons for a potential 2009 theatrical release, having at the time discussed directing a film adaptation of Land of the Lost with Universal. Rodriguez was uncertain which project he would pursue next, though the latest script draft for The Jetsons by assigned writer Adam F. Goldberg was further along in development.[tpl]cite news | author=Borys Kit | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i11ad0a8282fd52db145f3235c0a96b6a | publisher=The Hollywood Reporter | date=2007-05-09 | accessdate=2007-07-16 | archivedate = May 25, 2007 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070525055030/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i11ad0a8282fd52db145f3235c0a96b6a[/tpl]

On June 28, 1990, Hanna-Barbera released six episodes from the show on home video.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl] Warner Home Video released season 1 on DVD in Region 1 on May 11, 2004; upon its release, James Poniewozik wrote it's "as much about New Frontier 1962 as about the distant future. Its ditzy slapstick is like the peanut-butter-and-jelly mix Goober Grape—if you didn't love it as a kid, you're not going to acquire the taste as an adult—and the pop-culture gags ... have not aged well. But the animation is still a classic of gee-whiz atomic-age modernism."[tpl]cite news| title= Meet George Jetson—Again| work= Technology |author= James Poniewozik| date= May 17, 2004| url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,994200,00.html | publisher= Time | accessdate=2010-11-21[/tpl]
The review of the DVD release from Entertainment Weekly said the show  "trots through surprisingly dated sitcom plots about blustery bosses, bad lady drivers, and Elvis Presleyesque teen idols, all greeted with laugh tracks" but points out "it's the appeal of the retro-prescient gadgets (recliner massagers, big-screen TVs, two-way monitors) that still carries the show."[tpl]cite news| title= Jetsons & Jonny |author= Steve Daly | date= May 14, 2004| url= http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,634128,00.html | publisher= Entertainment Weekly | accessdate=2010-11-21[/tpl] Season 1 was released on DVD in Region 4 on July 5, 2006.[tpl]cite news| url= http://www.smh.com.au/news/dvd-reviews/the-jetsons-season-one/2006/07/05/1151779006086.html | title=The Jetsons, season one | author= Philippa Hawker | date= July 5, 2006 | publisher= The Sydney Morning Herald | accessdate=2010-11-21[/tpl] Season Two, Volume 1 was released on DVD almost three years later, on June 2, 2009 for Region 1.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Jetsons-Season-2-Volume-1/11266 |title=The Jetsons DVD news: Box Art & Extras for The Jetsons — Season 2, Volume 1 |publisher=TVShowsOnDVD.com |date=2007-05-25 |accessdate=2010-07-11[/tpl]
