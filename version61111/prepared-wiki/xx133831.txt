Emblicanins are a type of polyphenolic antioxidant found in Amla aka Indian gooseberry. Amla is known as Emblica Officinalis in botanical terms. Emblicanin is different from most other antioxidants as it is a pro-oxidation free cascading antioxidant.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2007[/tpl]
Many antioxidants intrinsically have a pro-oxidant action, especially in the presence of transition metals like iron and copper. Through a series of reactions with oxygen species known as Fenton reaction, iron causes generation of highly toxic hydroxyl radical with subsequent biomolecule damage. It means that the antioxidants which are meant to scavenge free radicals themselves create free radicals.
While most antioxidants go directly from an active to an inactive role, Emblicanin utilizes a multilevel cascade of antioxidant compounds resulting in a prolongation of its antioxidant capabilities.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2007[/tpl]
Emblicanin A (one of the key compounds in Emblicanin) aggressively seeks and attacks free radicals. After it neutralizes a free radical, emblicanin A is transformed into emblicanin B, another antioxidant. Emblicanin B in turn also attacks free radicals and is transformed into Emblicanin oligomers. This makes emblicanins one of the best free radical scavenging antioxidant.International Conference on Newer Developments in Drug Discovery From Natural Products and Traditional Medicines-An Overview.
