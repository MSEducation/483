==History==

Since the 8th century, Rein was the center of a court, that belonged to the cloister of Murbach in Alsace. It also included Rüfenach, Lauffohr, Remigen, Stilli, and Villigen.  Rüfenach is first mentioned around 1227-34 as Rufinach.
In the 13th century, the Habsburgs exerted their power in the region. King Rudolph I of Habsburg bought Rein in 1291. In 1345, Queen Agnes of Hungary gave Rein to the cloister of Wittichen im Kinzigtal in the Black Forest.
When the city of Bern conquered the area west of the Aare in 1460, the rights of the cloister were not affected. However, the arrival of the Reformation in 1528 did have a great effect. In 1544, the cloister sold Rein to Count Hartmann von Hallwyl. Between 1588 and 1599, the city of Brugg gained control of two thirds of the territory, and the city of Bern the other third.
In March 1798, conquered Switzerland and declared the Helvetic Republic. Rein became part of the new canton of Aargau. In 1799, the front line between the two coalitions in the Napoleonic Wars ran right down the center of the valley of the Aare. There were many French military camps in the region. The villagers suffered greatly from requisitions and plundering.
In 1803, Rein was dissolved, and the single villages were made independent municipalities. About a hundred years later, the canton actively promoted a policy of fusion, and Rein was combined with Rüfenach. The people of Rein resisted, but with no success. Although they took the case to the highest court, the two municipalities were united on January 1, 1898.
Until well into the 20th century, Rüfenach and Rein remained agricultural villages. In the 1960s, much construction was undertaken, and the population more than doubled.

==Architecture==

The church that was once the central point of the municipality dates from the 9th century and has romanesque and gothic elements. It had to be razed in 1863 because it was no longer safe. In its place, a new church was built in 1864 designed by the Zürich architect, Johann Kaspar Wolf.
In 1814 the textile industrialist Johann Heinrich Meyer founded an orphanage and poorhouse. The building, which is in classical style, became part of the cantonal psychiatric hospital in 1947.
