Black Morrow, also known as Black Murray, is the name given to a bandit whom according to tradition was killed by a MacLellan near Kirkcudbright in Galloway, Scotland. There are several different versions of the story, in which the slain bandit is variously described as a Gypsy, or a Moor.The Crest of the Lord Kirkcudbright The stories may be explanations for the Moor's head that appears on the crest of the Arms of Lord Kirkcudbright, and in consequence the modern crest badge used by Clan MacLellan.[tpl]cite web |url=http://myclan.com/clans/MacLellan_258/default.php |title=MacLellan |accessdate=2008-09-06 |work=MyClan (www.myclan.com) |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070319213430/www.myclan.com/clans/MacLellan_258/default.php |archivedate=2007-03-19[/tpl] The blazon for which is a naked arm supporting on the point of a sword, a moor's head.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.celticstudio.com/celticstudio/database/clans/095.htm |title=Mac Lellan|accessdate=22 August 2008|work=(www.celticstudio.com)[/tpl]

==Story==

According to one tradition he and his followers occupied Clan MacLellan lands. He was killed by Sir William Mclellan when discovered in a drunken sleep, allowing the MacLellans to regain control of their land. Another version states that a Â£50 reward was offered for his capture or death and that MacLellan bought the land with the reward.David Macritchie, Scottish Gypsies Under the Stewarts, Kessinger Publishing, 2003 reprint, p.24 In an elaborate version of the story MacLellan deliberately replaced spring-water in a well with spirits in order to get Black Morrow drunk. The location of the spring in woodland is now known as Black Morrow Wood.KirkudbrightThe Death of Black Morrow inTales of Galloway by Alan Temperley, London 1979

==Racial identity==

The name "Black Morrow" is assumed to derive from the term "Blackamoor" referring to the Moors of North Africa and Spain. As the date of the incident is not specified in the earliest surviving accounts it is not possible to know whether this implies that Black Morrow was an actual Moor or whether the name was intended to refer to his swarthy skin or barbarous reputation, perhaps analogous to "Black Douglas".Francis James Child, The English and Scottish Popular Ballads, Courier Dover Publications, 1898,2003 reprint, p. 189 Some accounts refer to him as "Irish" and others as a "gypsy". 
Some writers in the 19th century attempted to use the story as evidence of native racial diversity in Britain. David MacRitchie argued that Black Morrow was probably a gypsy, but claimed that the gypsies were not immigrants but ancient Britons from a primeval dark-skinned race.David MacRitchie, Ancient and Modern Britons: Volume One, Preston, 1893 (1993 reprint), p.81
