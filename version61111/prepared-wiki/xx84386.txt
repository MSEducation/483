Kendray is a village in the S70 postal district of Barnsley, South Yorkshire, England that lies between Sheffield Road and Doncaster Road, both of which lead out of/ into Barnsley town centre.
Kendray is one of the economically poorer areas of Barnsley, with problems similar to those of Grimethorpe.  Just under half of the old housing in Kendray has been demolished and replaced with fields, large recreational areas and modern housing.  An amphitheatre and playground has been built on one of the old sites, and new housing is being constructed on the other remaining sites. There are also plans to build a leisure centre nearby.
Recent regeneration has seen new housing replacing old and unusable housing, turning it into a more modern estate. Continued building is ongoing (2007/08). Current amenities and services available include a play area in the centre, local shopping, a post office, medical centre, schooling for juniors and a football ground with numerous artificial pitches available.
Lying within two miles of Barnsley town centre and with easy access to the Trans Pennine Trail and M1 motorway, Kendray is becoming a popular location for the average family.
