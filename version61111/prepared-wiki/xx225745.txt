Di varhayt (The Truth) was a Yiddish Communist newspaper published from Petrograd, Russia, published by the People's Commissariat for Jewish Affairs. The first issue was published on March 8, 1918. Di varhayt was the first Yiddish communist newspaper in the world. It was however closed down after a brief existence, as the People's Commissariat was shifted to the new capital Moscow and the lack of Yiddish journalists in Petrograd. The paper was later restarted as Der Emes.Estraikh, Gennady. The Yiddish-Language Communist Press, in Frankel, Jonathan (ed.), Studies in Contemporary Jewry. Vol. 20, Dark Times, Dire Decisions : Jews and Communism. New York: Oxford University Press, 2005. p. 63
