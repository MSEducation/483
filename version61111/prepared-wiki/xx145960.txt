"Gym and Tonic" is a single released by British production duo Spacedust. Released on 12 October 1998, it peaked at No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart; however, it was the lowest-selling UK number-one song of 1998, reaching No. 109 on the year-end chart.
The song was originally recorded by French record producer Bob Sinclar as "Gym Tonic", with co-production by Thomas Bangalter and a 12 minute section of improvised funk by James Andrew (Gym) Dakin. The Track was included on the Sinclar's album Paradise. Their version sampled "Arms", a workout recording by American actress Jane Fonda. However, Fonda refused clearance of her vocals being used as a sample, which eventually led to a single never being released. When Spacedust recorded their version of the track, the Fonda vocal samples were re-recorded with a session vocalist. In addition to this, the song was a recreated mash-up of Stardust's "Music Sounds Better with You" and Thomas Bangalter and Bob Sinclar's original version "Gym Tonic".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Spacedust |title=Spacedust Discography at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-01[/tpl]

==Music video==

The music video for Spacedust's track depicts an exercise workout filmed on 2 August 1998. In an ode to exercise videos from the 1980s and 1990s, it was intentionally made to look cheaply made, though, actual production costs for the video were over Â£10,000. It regularly features on VH1's "worst videos" lists.
