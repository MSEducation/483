Kratié is the capital of Kratié Province in eastern Cambodia.
The small town has a population of about 13,000 and lies on the banks of the Mekong River. The city is dominated by a central marketplace surrounded by old, French colonial buildings. Along the river red-flower trees grows in rows along the riverbank. The picturesque town contains big islands with white sand beaches out front that bends in the river.  The stretch of river north of the city is home to a group of rare Irrawaddy dolphins. The dolphins are the town's main tourist attraction.
A survey conducted in 2007 by Cambodian Mekong Dolphin Conservation Project (CMDCP), a collaborative project between WWF, World Conservation Society, Fisheries Administration and Cambodian Rural Development Team (CRDT), estimated that there are between 66 and 86 dolphins left in the upper Cambodian Mekong area.[tpl]cite web|author=Richard Zanre|url=http://www.panda.org/who_we_are/wwf_offices/cambodia/news_publications/?137661/Report-Abundance-of-Mekong-Dolphin-Population-2007|title=Report Abundance of Mekong Dolphin Population, 2007|accessdate=22 September 2009|publisher=WWF|date=20 June 2008[/tpl]
