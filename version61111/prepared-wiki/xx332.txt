Canada is a developed country whose economy includes the extraction and export of raw materials from its large area. Because of this, it has a transportation system which includes more than [tpl]convert|1400000|km[/tpl] of roads, 10 major international airports, 300 smaller airports, [tpl]convert|72093|km|abbr=on[/tpl] of functioning railway track, and more than 300 commercial ports and harbours that provide access to the Pacific, Atlantic and Arctic oceans as well as the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence Seaway.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www41.statcan.ca/2007/4006/ceb4006_000_e.htm |title= Transportation in Canada| publisher= Statistics Canada| accessdate=2008-03-26[/tpl] In 2005, the transportation sector made up 4.2% of Canada's GDP, compared to 3.7% for Canada's mining and oil and gas extraction industries.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.statcan.ca/english/research/11-621-MIE/11-621-MIE2006044.pdf |title= An Analysis of the Transportation Sector in 2005| publisher= Statistics Canada| accessdate=2008-03-27|format= PDF |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080409105655/http://www.statcan.ca/english/research/11-621-MIE/11-621-MIE2006044.pdf |archivedate = 2008-04-09[/tpl]
Transport Canada oversees and regulates most aspects of transportation within Canadian jurisdiction. Transport Canada is under the direction of the federal government's Minister of Transport. The Transportation Safety Board of Canada is responsible for maintaining transportation safety in Canada by investigating accidents and making safety recommendations.

==Roads==

There is a total of [tpl]convert|1042300|km|abbr=on[/tpl] of roads in Canada, of which [tpl]convert|415600|km|abbr=on[/tpl] are paved, including [tpl]convert|17000|km|abbr=on[/tpl] of expressways (the third-longest in the world, behind the Interstate Highway System of the United States and the China's National Trunk Highway System). As of 2008, [tpl]convert|626700|km|abbr=on[/tpl] were unpaved.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ca.html |title=CIA - The World Factbook |accessdate=2011-01-13 |work=The World Factbook |publisher=CIA[/tpl]
In 2009, there were 20,706,616 road vehicles registered in Canada, of which 96% were vehicles under [tpl]convert|4.5|t|lk=on[/tpl], 2.4% were vehicles between [tpl]convert|4.5|and|15|t|abbr=on[/tpl] tonnes and 1.6% were [tpl]convert|15|t|abbr=on[/tpl] or greater. These vehicles travelled a total of 333.29 billion kilometres, of which 303.6 billion was for vehicles under [tpl]convert|4.5|t|abbr=on[/tpl], 8.3 billion was for vehicles between [tpl]convert|4.5|and|15|t|abbr=on[/tpl] and 21.4 billion was for vehicles over [tpl]convert|15|t|abbr=on[/tpl]. For the [tpl]convert|4.5|to|15|t|abbr=on[/tpl] trucks, 88.9% of vehicle-kilometres were intra-province trips, 4.9% were inter-province, 2.8% were between Canada and the US and 3.4% made outside of Canada. For trucks over [tpl]convert|15|t|abbr=on[/tpl], 59.1% of vehicle-kilometres were intra-province trips, 20% inter-province trips, 13.8% Canada-US trips and 7.1% trips made outside of Canada.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/53-223-x/53-223-x2009000-eng.pdf |title=Canadian Vehicle Survey: Annual |publisher=Statistics Canada |year=2009 |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-01-13[/tpl]
Canada's vehicles consumed a total of [tpl]convert|31.4|e6m3|Moilbbl|lk=out[/tpl] of gasoline and [tpl]convert|9.91|e6m3|Moilbbl[/tpl] of diesel. Trucking generated 35% of the total GDP from transport, compared to 25% for rail, water and air combined (the remainder being generated by the industry's transit, pipeline, scenic and support activities). Hence roads are the dominant means of passenger and freight transport in Canada.
Roads and highways were managed by provincial and municipal authorities until construction of the Northwest Highway System (the Alaska Highway) and the Trans-Canada Highway project initiation. The Alaska Highway of 1942 was constructed during World War II for military purposes connecting Fort St. John, British Columbia with Fairbanks, Alaska. The transcontinental highway, a joint national and provincial expenditure, was begun in 1949 under the initiation of the Trans Canada Highway Act on December 10, 1949. The [tpl]convert|7821|km|abbr=on[/tpl] highway was completed in 1962 at a total expenditure of $1.4 billion.[ref][tpl]Cite journal | last = Coneghan | first =Daria | title =Trans-Canada Highway | work =The Encyclopedia of Saskatchewan | publisher =Canadian Plains Research Center, University of Regina | year =2006 | url =http://esask.uregina.ca/entry/trans-canada_highway.html | accessdate =2007-12-29 | postscript = [/tpl]

Internationally, Canada has road links with both the lower 48 US states and Alaska. The Ministry of Transportation maintains the road network in Ontario and also employs Ministry of Transport Enforcement Officers for the purpose of administering the Canada Transportation Act and related regulations.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cta-otc.gc.ca/contact/regional_e.html |title=Regional Enforcement Officers |accessdate=2007-10-01 |author=Canadian Transportation Agency |publisher=Canadian Transportation Agency[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://ogov.newswire.ca/ontario/GPOE/2004/09/21/c2149.html?lmatch=&lang=_e.html |title=Enforcement blitz improves road safety |accessdate=2007-10-01 |author=Ministry of Transportation |publisher=Canada NewsWire[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] The Department of Transportation in New Brunswick performs a similar task in that province as well.
Regulations enacted in regards to Canada highways are the 1971 Motor Vehicle Safety Act[tpl]cite web | title = Motor Vehicle Safety Act | url =http://www.tc.gc.ca/acts-regulations/GENERAL/M/mvsa/menu.htm | accessdate = 2008-01-18 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071228100533/http://www.tc.gc.ca/acts-regulations/GENERAL/M/mvsa/menu.htm  |archivedate = 2007-12-28[/tpl] and the 1990 Highway Traffic Act[tpl]cite web | title = Highway Traffic Act | url =http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_90h08_e.htm | accessdate = 2008-01-18[/tpl]
The safety of Canada's roads is moderately good by international standards, and is improving both in terms of accidents per head of population and per billion vehicle kilometers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iraptranstats.net/ca |title=Transport in Canada |accessdate=2008-10-06 |work=International Transport Statistics Database |publisher=iRAP[/tpl]

==Air transport==

Air transportation made up 9% of the transport sector's GDP generation in 2005. Canada's largest air carrier and its flag carrier is Air Canada, which had 34 million customers in 2006 and, as of April 2010, operates 363 aircraft (including Air Canada Jazz).Transport Canada listing of aircraft owned by Air Canada and Air Canada Jazz (enter Air Canada (226 aircraft), Jazz Air LP (137 aircraft), Canadian Helicopters or Westjet in the box titled "Owner Name") CHC Helicopter, the largest commercial helicopter operator in the world, is second with 142 aircraft and WestJet, a low-cost carrier formed in 1996, is third with 100 aircraft. Canada's airline industry saw significant change following the signing of the US-Canada open skies agreement in 1995, when the marketplace became less regulated and more competitive.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.statcan.ca/english/preview/87-003-XIE/P0039987-003-XIE.pdf |title=Travelog - Volume 18, Number 3|accessdate=2008-03-27 |publisher=Statistics Canada |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080409105657/http://www.statcan.ca/english/preview/87-003-XIE/P0039987-003-XIE.pdf |archivedate = 2008-04-09[/tpl]
The Canadian Transportation Agency employs transportation enforcement officers to maintain aircraft safety standards, and conduct periodic aircraft inspections, of all air carriers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cta-otc.gc.ca/air-aerien/enforce/index_e.html |title=Enforcement |accessdate=2007-10-01 |author=Canadian Transportation Agency |publisher=Canadian Transportation Agency[/tpl] The Canadian Air Transport Security Authority is charged with the responsibility for the security of air traffic within Canada. In 1994 the National Airports Policy was enacted[tpl]cite web| title = National Airports Policy| url = http://www.tc.gc.ca/programs/Airports/policy/menu.htm| accessdate = 2008-01-18[/tpl]

===Principal airports===

Of over 1,800 registered Canadian aerodromes, certified airports, heliports, and floatplane bases,[tpl]CFS[/tpl] 26 are specially designated under Canada's National Airports System[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tc.gc.ca/programs/airports/status/menu.htm |title=Airport Divestiture Status Report |publisher=Tc.gc.ca |date=2011-01-12 |accessdate=2011-02-19[/tpl] (NAS): these include all airports that handle 200,000 or more passengers each year, as well as the principal airport serving each federal, provincial, and territorial capital. However, since the introduction of the policy only one, Iqaluit Airport, has been added and no airports have been removed despite dropping below 200,000 passengers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/programs/airports-policy-nationallist-303.htm |title=Airports in the national airports category (Appendix A) |publisher=Tc.gc.ca |date=2010-12-16 |accessdate=2011-02-19[/tpl] The Government of Canada, with the exception of the three territorial capitals, retains ownership of these airports and leases them to local authorities. The next tier consists of 64 regional/local airports formerly owned by the federal government, most of which have now been transferred to other owners (most often to municipalities).

==Rail==

In 2007, Canada had a total of [tpl]convert|72212|km|abbr=on[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/trad47a.htm |title=Rail transportation, length of track operated for freight and passenger transportation, by province and territory |accessdate=2009-03-13 |author=Statistics Canada |work=statcan.ca |publisher=Statistics Canada[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] of freight and passenger railway, of which [tpl]convert|31|km|abbr=on[/tpl] is electrified.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2009[/tpl] While intercity passenger transportation by rail is now very limited, freight transport by rail remains common. Total revenues of rail services in 2006 was $10.4 billion, of which only 2.8% was from passenger services. The Canadian National and Canadian Pacific Railway are Canada's two major freight railway companies, each having operations throughout North America. In 2007, 357 billion tonne-kilometres of freight were transported by rail, and 4.33 million passengers travelled 1.44 billion passenger-kilometres (an almost negligible amount compared to the 491 billion passenger-kilometres made in light road vehicles). 34,281 people were employed by the rail industry in the same year.[tpl]cite web | title = Railway carriers, operating statistics | publisher = Statistics Canada | url = http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/trad46a.htm | accessdate = 2008-03-26 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080223200711/http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/trad46a.htm |archivedate = 2008-02-23[/tpl]
Nation-wide passenger services are provided by the federal crown corporation Via Rail. Three Canadian cities have commuter rail services: in the Montreal area by AMT, in the Toronto area by GO Transit, and in the Vancouver area by West Coast Express. Smaller railways such as Ontario Northland, Rocky Mountaineer, and Algoma Central also run passenger trains to remote rural areas.
In Canada railways are served by standard gauge, [tpl]RailGauge|ussg[/tpl], rails. See also track gauge in Canada.
Canada has rail links with the lower 48 US States, but no connection with Alaska other than a train ferry service from Prince Rupert, British Columbia, although a line has been proposed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.alaskacanadarail.org |title=AlaskaCanadaRail.org |publisher=AlaskaCanadaRail.org |date=2005-07-01 |accessdate=2011-02-19[/tpl] There are no other international rail connections.

==Waterways==

In 2005, 139.2 million tonnes of cargo was loaded and unloaded at Canadian ports.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/trad51a.htm |title=Domestic and international cargo, tonnage loaded and unloaded by water transport, by province and territory. |accessdate=2008-04-04 |publisher=Statistics Canada |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080329204334/http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/trad51a.htm |archivedate = 2008-03-29[/tpl] The Port of Vancouver is the busiest port in Canada, moving 68 million tonnes or 15% of Canada's total in domestic and international shipping in 2003.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www41.statcan.ca/2006/4006/ceb4006_001_e.htm |title=Vancouver: Canada's busiest port |accessdate=2008-04-09|author=Statistics Canada|publisher=Statistics Canada[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

===Ferry services===

===Canals===

The St. Lawrence waterway was at one time the world's greatest inland water navigation system. The main route canals of Canada are those of the St. Lawrence River and the Great Lakes. The others are subsidiary canals.

===Ports and harbours===

The National Harbours Board administered Halifax, Saint John, Chicoutimi, Trois-Rivières, Churchill, and Vancouver until 1983. Over 300 harbours across Canada were supervised by the Department of Transport.  After divestiture Transport Canada oversees only 17 Canada Port Authorities for the 17 largest shipping ports.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tc.gc.ca/programs/ports/index.htm|title=Porst|publisher=Transport Canada|accessdate=2010-02-02[/tpl]

===Merchant marine===

Canada's merchant marine comprised a total of 173 ships ([tpl]GRT|1000|metric|first=yes[/tpl] or over) [tpl]GRT|2,129,243|metric[/tpl] or [tpl]DWT|716,340|metric|first=yes[/tpl] at the end of 2007.

==Pipelines==

Pipelines are part of the energy extraction and transportation network of Canada and are used to transport natural gas, natural gas liquids, crude oil, synthetic crude and other petroleum based products. Canada has [tpl]convert|23564|km|abbr=on[/tpl] of pipeline for transportation of crude and refined oil, and [tpl]convert|74980|km|abbr=on[/tpl] for liquefied petroleum gas.

==Urban transport==

Most Canadian cities have public transportation, if only a bus system. Six Canadian cities have rapid transit systems and three have commuter rail systems (see below). In 2006, 11% of Canadians used public transportation to get to work. This compares to 80.0% that got to work using a car (72.3% by driving, 7.7% as a passenger), 6.4% that walked and 1.3% that rode a bike.[tpl]cite web|url=http://livework.kingstoncanada.com/en/lifestyle/resources/CommutingPatternsandPlacesofWorkofCanadians-2006-StatsCanada.pdf |title=Commuting Patterns and Places of Work of Canadians, 2006 Census |publisher= Statistics Canada |accessdate=2011-11-04[/tpl]

===Rapid transit systems===

There are six urban rapid transit systems operating in Canada: The Montreal Metro, the Toronto Subway, the Vancouver SkyTrain, the Calgary C-Train, the Edmonton Light Rail Transit and the O-Train in Ottawa.
There is also an Airport Circulator, the LINK Train at Toronto Pearson International Airport. It operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and is wheelchair-accessible. It is free of cost.

===Commuter train systems===

Commuter trains exist in Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver:

==History==

===European contact===

Aboriginal peoples in Canada, relied on canoes, kayaks, umiaks and Bull Boats, in addition to the snowshoe, toboggan and sled in winter for transportation prior to European contact. Europeans adopted these technologies as they pushed deeper into the continent's interior, and were thus able to travel via the waterways that fed from the St. Lawrence River and Hudson Bay.Virtual Vault, an online exhibition of Canadian historical art at Library and Archives Canada
In the 19th century and early 20th century transportation relied on harnessing oxen to Red River ox carts or horse to waggon. Maritime transportation was via manual labour such as canoe or wind on sail. Water or land travel speeds was approximately [tpl]convert|8|to|15|km/h|0|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]cite web | last =Rodrigue | first = Dr. Jean-Paul | title = Historical Geography of Transportation - Part I | work = Dept. of Economics & Geography | publisher = Hofstra University | date = 1998–2008 | url =http://people.hofstra.edu/geotrans/eng/ch1en/conc1en/ch1c3_1en.html | accessdate = 2008-01-18 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080112113050/http://people.hofstra.edu/geotrans/eng/ch1en/conc1en/ch1c3_1en.html  |archivedate = 2008-01-12[/tpl]
Settlement was along river routes. Agricultural commodities were perishable, and trade centres were within [tpl]convert|50|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. Rural areas centred around villages, and they were approximately [tpl]convert|10|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] apart. The advent of steam railways and steamships connected resources and markets of vast distances in the late 19th century. Railways also connected city centres, in such a way that the traveller went by sleeper, railway hotel, to the cities. Crossing the country by train took four or five days, as it still does by car. People generally lived within [tpl]convert|5|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] of the downtown core thus the train could be used for inter-city travel and the tram for commuting.
The advent of the interstate or Trans-Canada Highway in Canada in 1963 established ribbon development, truck stops, and industrial corridors along throughways.

The Federal Department of Transport established November 2, 1936, supervised railways, canals, harbours, marine and shipping, civil aviation, radio and meteorology. The Transportation Act of 1938 and the amended Railway Act, placed control and regulation of carriers in the hands of the Board of Transport commissioners for Canada. The Royal Commission on Transportation was formed December 29, 1948, to examine transportation services to all areas of Canada to eliminate economic or geographic disadvantages. The Commission also reviewed the Railway Act to provide uniform yet competitive freight-rates.
