==History==

In the 18th century, Neubau was the location of the city's silk factories. At this time, the area became densely populated. Today, it is an important shopping district, especially in the Mariahilfer Straße and Neubaugasse. Many pubs, popular among the district's large student population, are located in the Spittelberg neighborhood. The Volkstheater Wien, one of Vienna's large mainstream theatres, and the Austrian Ministry of Justice are located in Neubau, as well as the Museumsquartier, a centre dedicated to modern art, housing for example the Leopold Collection.
In the 2001 communal elections, Neubau became the first district in Austria with a Green Party plurality (32.6% of the votes).
In the 2004 European Elections the Green Party received 41% of all votes, which is more than Social Democratic Party and Austrian People's Party together.
Like Mariahilf, Neubau is known as one of Vienna's districts with the youngest, most liberal, and urban population.

==Politics==

While the ÖVP, after the Second World War until 1991, had the largest party vote, it was that year replaced by the SPÖ. The SPÖ lost its majority again 2001, but the district head of however was not from the ÖVP anymore but from the Greens.
At the elections 2010 the Greens could increase their votes compared to the Vienna wide achievement. 
In opposition to most districts the Liberal Forum stagnated with 1.1% in Neubau, whereas the BZÖ increased from 0.8% to 1.1% in comparison with 2005.
This district was the first in 2001 and until the 2004 (European Elections 2004) the only district in Austria where the Greens had a relative majority.
