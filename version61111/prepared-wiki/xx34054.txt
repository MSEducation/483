Dexter's Laboratory (commonly abbreviated as Dexter's Lab) is an American comic science fiction animated children's television series created by Genndy Tartakovsky for Cartoon Network. The series follows Dexter, a boy-genius with a secret laboratory filled with his inventions. He constantly battles his sister Dee Dee, who always gains access despite his best efforts to keep her out, as well as his arch-rival and neighbor, Mandark. The series' first two seasons contain additional segments: Dial M for Monkey, which focuses on Dexter's pet lab-monkey-turned-superhero, and The Justice Friends, about a trio of superheroes who share an apartment.
Tartakovsky first pitched the series to Hanna-Barbera's animated shorts showcase World Premiere Toons, basing it on student films he produced while attending the California Institute of the Arts. A pilot aired on Cartoon Network in February 1995, and in August viewer approval ratings convinced the network to order a half-hour series, which premiered on April 27, 1996. By 1999, 52 episodes and a television movie had been produced, and Tartakovsky then left the series to begin work on his other projects, Samurai Jack and Star Wars: Clone Wars. In 2001, the network revived the series under a different production team at Cartoon Network Studios, and after 26 more episodes, the series ended on November 20, 2003.
Dexter's Laboratory received high ratings and became one of Cartoon Network's most popular and successful original series. During its run, the series was nominated for 4 Primetime Emmy Awards, 4 Golden Reel Awards, and 9 Annie Awards, winning 3 additional Annie Awards. The series is notable for helping launch the careers of several cartoonists, such as Craig McCracken (The Powerpuff Girls, Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends and Wander Over Yonder), Seth MacFarlane (Family Guy, American Dad! and The Cleveland Show), Butch Hartman (The Fairly OddParents, Danny Phantom and T.U.F.F. Puppy), and Rob Renzetti (My Life as a Teenage Robot). Spin-off media include comic books, DVD and VHS releases, music albums, collectible toys, and video games.

==Series overview==

The series revolves around Dexter (voiced by Christine Cavanaugh in Seasons 1 & 2, and later Candi Milo in Seasons 3 & 4), a boy-genius with a secret laboratory filled with highly advanced equipment hidden behind a bookcase in his bedroom. Access to the laboratory is achieved by speaking various passwords or by activating hidden switches on his bookshelf (e.g. pulling out a specific book). Though highly intelligent, Dexter often fails at what he has set out to do when he becomes overexcited and makes careless choices. He manages to keep the lab a secret from his clueless, cheerful parents (voiced by Jeff Bennett and Kath Soucie), who never notice any evidence of the laboratory. Although he comes from a typical all-American family, Dexter speaks with a thick accent of indeterminate origin. Cavanaugh described it as "an affectation, some kind of accent, we're not quite sure. A small Peter Lorre, but not. Perhaps he's Latino, perhaps he's French. He's a scientist; he knows he needs some kind of accent."[tpl]cite news|title=Out of the Mouth of 'Babe'|first=Scott|last=Moore|date=July 21, 1996|work=The Washington Post|section=TV Week|page=Y06[/tpl] Genndy Tartakovsky explained, "He considers himself a very serious scientist, and all well-known scientists have accents."[tpl]cite news|title=The Way We Live Now: Questions for Genndy Tartakovsky; The Big Draw|last=Adams|first=Thelma|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/19/magazine/the-way-we-live-now-questions-for-genndy-tartakovsky-the-big-draw.html|date=August 19, 2001|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=2011-05-31[/tpl]
Dexter is frequently in conflict with his hyperactive older sister, Dee Dee (voiced by Allison Moore in Seasons 1 & 3, and later by Kathryn Cressida in Seasons 2 & 4), as well as a rival boy-genius from his school named Susan "Mandark" Astronomonov[tpl]cite episode|title=Dexter's Rival|series=Dexter's Laboratory|network=Cartoon Network|date=May 12, 1996|season=1|number=3a[/tpl][tpl]cite episode|title=A Boy Named Sue|series=Dexter's Laboratory|network=Cartoon Network|date=March 29, 2002|season=3|number=6a[/tpl] (voiced by Eddie Deezen). In spite of Dexter's advanced technology, Dee Dee eludes all manner of security and, once inside, delights in playing in his laboratory, often wreaking havoc with his inventions. Though usually destructive, Dee Dee occasionally outsmarts her brother and even gives him helpful advice. For his part, Dexter, though annoyed by his intrusive sibling, feels a reluctant affection for her and will come to her defense if she is imperiled. Mandark, Dexter's nemesis, also has his own laboratory, but his schemes are generally evil and designed to gain power while downplaying or destroying Dexter's accomplishments. As the series progresses, Mandark becomes significantly more evil, with his laboratory darker-looking, industrial, and angular in contrast to his original brightly lit lab with rounded features. Because Dexter's inventions are often better than his, Mandark tries to make up for this by stealing Dexter's plans. Mandark's weakness is his love for Dee Dee, though she ignores him and never returns his affections.

===Recurring segments===

Most episodes of Dexter's Laboratory are divided into three different stories or segments, each one being approximately 8 minutes in length. Occasionally, the middle segment centered around characters from the Dexter's Laboratory universe other than Dexter and his family. Two of these segments were shown, primarily during the first season: Dial M for Monkey and The Justice Friends.[tpl]cite news|title=Cartoon Network Zany Relief|first=Hal|last=Boedecker|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=j4c1AAAAIBAJ&sjid=dqYFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1308,7322907|date=July 14, 1997|work=Orlando Sentinel|publisher=Tribune Company|accessdate=2013-01-22[/tpl] Dial M for Monkey was the middle segment for the first six episodes of season one, and The Justice Friends took its place for the rest of the season.
The Dial M for Monkey shorts feature Dexter's pet laboratory monkey, Monkey (vocal effects by Frank Welker), whom Dexter believes is an ordinary monkey and nothing more. In contrast, Monkey secretly has superpowers and fights evil as the superhero Monkey. Monkey is joined by his partner Agent Honeydew (voiced by Kath Soucie), the Commander General (voiced by originally by Robert Ridgely and later Earl Boen), and a team of assembled superheroes. Dial M for Monkey was created by Genndy Tartakovsky, Craig McCracken, and Paul Rudish.[tpl]cite news|title=Emmy-nominated "Dexter's Laboratory" to Be Expanded into Series Airing on Turner Entertainment Networks in April 1996|date=August 29, 1995|publisher=Business Wire[/tpl]
The Justice Friends consists of Major Glory (voiced by Rob Paulsen), Valhallen (voiced by Tom Kenny), and the Infraggable Krunk (voiced by Frank Welker), a team of superheroes who are all roommates living in an apartment complex called Muscular Arms. Most of the adventures of the trio deal less with their lives as superheroes and more with their inability to get along as roommates; it is presented as a sitcom, including a laugh track. Genndy Tartakovsky's inspiration for The Justice Friends came from reading Marvel Comics when he was learning how to speak English. Tartakovsky stated in an interview with IGN that he was somewhat disappointed with how The Justice Friends turned out, saying, "it could have been funnier and the characters could have been fleshed out more."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/11/28/10-questions-genndy-tartakovsky|title=10 Questions: Genndy Tartakovsky|last=Plume|first=Kenneth|date=November 28, 2001|work=IGN|publisher=News Corporation|accessdate=2011-05-31[/tpl]
Between the three main segments in seasons one and two are brief mini-segments, many of which feature only Dexter and Dee Dee. Other characters from the series may star in them also, such as "The Puppet Pals", two live-action puppets named Puppet Pal Mitch (voiced by Rob Paulsen) and Puppet Pal Clem (voiced by Tom Kenny).

===Influences and design===

Dexter's Laboratory was inspired by one of Genndy Tartakovsky's drawings of a ballerina.[tpl]cite news|title=Moody Toons; The King of the Cartoon Network|last=Wilkinson|first=Alec|url=http://business.highbeam.com/410951/article-1G1-94158110/moody-toons|date=May 27, 2002|work=The New Yorker|publisher=Condé Nast Publications|accessdate=2011-05-14[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1462221.html|title='Dexter' Creator Draws on His Youth|last=Davenport|first=Misha|date=November 24, 2002|work=Chicago Sun-Times|publisher=Wrapports|accessdate=2011-05-14[/tpl] After drawing Dee Dee's tall, thin shape, he decided to pair her with a short and blocky opposite, Dexter, inspired by Tartakovsky's older brother Alex.[tpl]cite book|last=Lenburg|first=Jeff|title=Who's Who in Animated Cartoons: An International Guide to Film & Television's Award-winning and Legendary Animators|publisher=Applause Theatre & Cinema Books|location=New York|isbn=9781557836717|pages=332–333|url=http://books.google.com/?id=FVShFCjVzvIC&lpg=PA332&dq=tartakovsky%20calarts&pg=PA332#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=2011-05-31|chapter=Genndy Tartakovsky|date=June 15, 2006[/tpl] The series was animated in a stylized way, which Tartakovsky says was influenced by the Merrie Melodies cartoon The Dover Boys at Pimento University.Simmensky 2011, p. 287. Dexter's Laboratory, however, was staged in a cinematic way, rather than flat and close to the screen, to leave space and depth for the action and gags. Tartakovsky was also influenced by other Warner Bros. cartoons, Hanna-Barbera, Japanese mecha anime, and the UPA shorts. Tartakovsky has said the character Dexter was designed "as an icon"—his body is short and squat and his design is simple, with a black outline and relatively little detail. Since he knew that he was designing the show for television, he purposely limited the design to a certain degree, designing the nose and mouth, for instance, in a Hanna-Barbera style to animate easily.Simmensky 2011, pp. 286–287.

===Production===

Dexter's Laboratory, along with Cow and Chicken, Johnny Bravo, The Powerpuff Girls, and Courage the Cowardly Dog, became responsible for pushing Cartoon Network in a new direction focusing on original programming and "character-driven" cartoons.Simmensky 2011, p. 283. After enrolling at the California Institute of the Arts in 1990 to study animation, Tartakovsky wrote, directed, animated, and produced two short films that would become the basis for the series.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/tv_shows/ap/gtartakovsky.html|title=Animator Profile: Genndy Tartakovsky|work=CartoonNetwork.com|publisher=Turner Broadcasting Systems|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090619095331/http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/tv_shows/ap/gtartakovsky.html|archivedate=2009-06-19|accessdate=2011-05-31[/tpl] Dexter's Laboratory was then made into a seven-minute pilot as a part of Cartoon Network's What a Cartoon! project, promoted as World Premiere Toons, which debuted on February 26, 1995.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-822808.html|title=Creative 'World Premiere Toons'|last=Moore|first=Scott|date=February 26, 1995|work=The Washington Post|publisher=The Washington Post Company|accessdate=2011-05-14[/tpl] Viewers worldwide voted through phone lines, the Internet, focus groups, and consumer promotions for their favorite short cartoons; the first of 16 animated shorts to earn that vote of approval was Dexter's Laboratory. In August 1995, Turner ordered six half-hours of the series, which would include two cartoons around one spin-off segment titled Dial M for Monkey. The show premiered as a half-hour series on TNT on April 27, 1996, and on April 28 on Cartoon Network and TBS Superstation.[tpl]cite news|title=TV Review; 'Dexter's Laboratory'|first=Miles|last=Beller|date=April 25, 1996|work=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=BPI Entertainment News Wire[/tpl] Mike Lazzo, then-head of programming for the network, said that Dexter's Laboratory was his favorite of the 48 shorts, commenting "We all loved the humor in brother-versus-sister relationship".[tpl]cite news|title=TV Notes;A Cartoon Winner|last=Mifflin|first=Lawrie|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/24/arts/tv-notes-a-cartoon-winner.html|date=April 24, 1996|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=2011-05-31[/tpl]
A second season premiered on Cartoon Network on July 16, 1997. Allison Moore, the voice of Dee Dee and a college friend of Genndy Tartakovsky, left the show after the first season because she was no longer interested in voice acting. The role was subsequently recast with Kathryn Cressida.http://techjives.net/onvoxshow/?p=190 Dexter's Laboratory ended its initial run in 1998 after two seasons, with the second season lasting 39 episodes, a notable record for a single TV production season on Cartoon Network.[tpl]cite book|last=Brooks|first=Tim|title=The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows, 1946-Present|publisher=Ballantine Books|location=New York|isbn=9780345497734|pages=350–351|url=http://books.google.com/?id=BbOsChMSlpoC&pg=PA350&dq=dexter%27s+laboratory#v=onepage&q=dexter%27s%20laboratory&f=false|edition=9th ed., completely rev. and updated, Ballantine Books trade pbk.|coauthors=Marsh, Earle|accessdate=2012-05-27|date=October 16, 2007[/tpl] The initial series finale was "Last But Not Beast", which differed from the format of the other episodes in that it was not a collection of cartoon shorts, but was a single 25-minute episode. In 1999, Tartakovsky returned to direct Dexter's Laboratory: Ego Trip, an hour-long television movie.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20268361,00.html|title=Dexter's Laboratory: Ego Trip Review|first=Marc|last=Bernardin|date=November 24, 2000|work=Entertainment Weekly|publisher=Time Inc.|accessdate=2013-01-22[/tpl] This was the last Dexter's Laboratory production that Tartakovsky was involved with and was originally intended to be the final conclusion to the series. The special was hand-animated, though the character and setting designs were subtly altered. The plot follows Dexter on a quest through time as he finds out his future triumphs. Christine Cavanaugh won an Annie Award for her voice performance as Dexter in Ego Trip for "Outstanding Individual Achievement for Voice Acting By a Female Performer in an Animated Television Production".[tpl]cite web|url=http://annieawards.org/28th-annie-awards|title=28th Annual Annie Award Nominees and Winners (2000)|work=AnnieAwards.org|publisher=ASIFA-Hollywood|accessdate=2011-05-31[/tpl]

===Controversial episodes===

===="Dial M for Monkey: Barbequor"====

The segment "Dial M for Monkey: Barbequor" aired as part of the fourth episode of the first season, but was removed from rotation after a few years of being broadcast in the United States. The short features a character named the Silver Spooner (a spoof of the Silver Surfer), which was perceived by Cartoon Network as a stereotype of gay men.[tpl]cite web|url=http://gawker.com/5612599/dial-m-for-monkey-+-the-banned-episode|title=Dial M for Monkey - The Banned Episode|date=August 14, 2010|last=Anderson|first=Evans|publisher=Gawker|accessdate=2013-08-10[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.queerty.com/banned-anti-gay-toon-exhumed-20080612/|title=Banned "Anti-Gay" Toon Exhumed!|date=Jun 12, 2008|last=Belonksy|first=Andrew|publisher=Queerty|accessdate=2013-08-10[/tpl] In later broadcasts and on the Season One DVD (Region 1), the banned segment has been replaced with "Dexter's Lab: A Story", an episode from season two.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/reviews/Dexters-Laboratory-Season-1/10187|title=Dexter's Laboratory — Season 1 Review|first=Gord|last=Lacey|date=October 29, 2010|work=TVShowsOnDVD.com|accessdate=2013-01-20[/tpl]

===="Rude Removal"====

During the initial run of Dexter's Lab, a segment titled "Rude Removal" was produced. The short involves Dexter creating a "rude removal system" to diminish Dee Dee's rudeness; however, it instead creates highly rude clones of both siblings. The episode was only shown during certain animation festivals and was never aired on Cartoon Network due to the characters swearing, even though the swear words were censored.[tpl]cite news|title=Lost Cartoon?|last=Pierce|first=Scott D.|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/643555/Conan-cant-shake-off-rocky-start-as-host.html|work=Deseret News|date=July 27, 1998|accessdate=2011-05-31[/tpl] Tartakovsky commented that "standards didn't like it." Linda Simensky, then-vice president of original programming for Cartoon Network, said "I still think it's very funny. It probably would air better late at night." Fred Seibert, president of Hanna-Barbera Cartoons from 1992 to 1996, has attested to the existence of the short.[tpl]cite web|url=http://archives.frederatorblogs.com/frederator_studios/2010/10/26/banned-dexter/|title=Bad Dexter!|last=Seibert|first=Fred|date=October 26, 2010|work=Frederator Blogs|publisher=Frederator Studios|accessdate=2011-05-31[/tpl]
