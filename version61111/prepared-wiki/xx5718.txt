Koninklijke Luchtvaart Maatschappij N.V. (Royal Dutch Airlines), known by its initials KLM, is the flag carrier airline of the Netherlands. KLM's headquarters is in Amstelveen near its hub at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. KLM operates scheduled passenger and cargo services to more than 90 destinations worldwide. It is the oldest airline in the world still operating under its original name. [tpl]As of|2010|3|31[/tpl] it had 31,787 employees.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.klm.com/corporate/en/about-klm/facts-and-figures/index.html|title= About KLM[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]Facts & Figures|publisher= KLM|accessdate=26 May 2011[/tpl]
The merger of KLM with Air France in May 2004 formed the Air France-KLM Group, which is incorporated under French law with headquarters at Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport. Both Air France and KLM continue to fly under their distinct brand names as subsidiaries of the group. Air France and KLM are part of the SkyTeam alliance, the second largest in the world behind only Star Alliance.

==History==

===Formation and early years===

In 1919, a young aviator lieutenant named Albert Plesman sponsored the ELTA aviation exhibition in Amsterdam. This aviation exhibition was a great success, and, after closure, several Dutch commercial interests had the intention to establish a Dutch airline. Plesman was nominated to head this new airline.[tpl]cite journal|journal=International Directory of Company Histories|year=1999|volume=28|title=Koninklijke Luchtvaart Maatschappij, N.V. History| url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/koninklijke-luchtvaart-maatschappij-n-v-history/|accessdate=30 July 2013[/tpl] In September 1919, Queen Wilhelmina awarded the yet to be founded KLM its "Royal" ("Koninklijke") predicate.[tpl]cite web|title=History|url=http://www.klm.com/corporate/en/about-klm/history/index.html|work=KLM Corporate|publisher=KLM|accessdate=30 July 2013[/tpl] On October 7, 1919, the "Koninklijke Luchtvaart Maatschappij" (KLM) was founded by Albert Plesman in The Hague as one of the world's first commercial airline companies.
The first KLM flight took place on 17 May 1920. KLM's first pilot, Jerry Shaw, flew from Croydon Airport, London to Amsterdam. The flight was flown using a leased Aircraft Transport and Travel De Haviland DH-16, registration G-EALU, and was carrying two British journalists and a number of newspapers. In 1920, KLM carried 440 passengers and 22 tons of freight. In April 1921, after a winter hiatus, KLM resumed its services using its own pilots and aircraft: Fokker F.II and Fokker F.III. In 1921, KLM started scheduled services.
KLM's first intercontinental flight was initiated on the 1st of October 1924. This flight had Batavia (Colonial Jakarta) on the island Java in the Dutch East Indies as the final destination and was flown by a Fokker F.VII with registration H-NACC and was piloted by Van Der Hoop. In September 1929, regular scheduled services between Amsterdam and Batavia commenced. Until the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, this was the world's longest-distance scheduled service by airplane.
By 1926, it was offering flights to Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Brussels, Paris, London, Bremen, Copenhagen, and Malmö, using primarily Fokker F2 & Fokker F.III.(Dutch) Albert Heijn, ed (1969) KL-50 – logboek van vijftig jaar vliegen. Meijer, Amsterdam.
In 1930, KLM carried 15,143 passengers. The Douglas DC-2 was introduced on the Batavia service in 1934.
The first transatlantic KLM flight was between Amsterdam and Curaçao in December 1934 using the Fokker F-XVIII "Snip". The first of the airline's Douglas DC-3 aircraft were delivered in 1936, and these replaced the DC-2s on the service via Batavia to Sydney. KLM was the first airline to serve Manchester's new Ringway airport, starting June 1938. KLM was the only civilian airline to operate the Douglas DC-5, using four of them in the Dutch East and West Indies between May 1940 and late 1941.

====Second World War====

When German military forces invaded the Netherlands on 10 May 1940, a number of KLM aircraft (mostly DC-3s and a few DC-2s) were en route to or from the Far East or operating services in Europe. Five DC-3s and one DC-2 managed to escape to England. During the war, these KLM planes and crew members would fly the infamous Bristol-Lisbon scheduled passenger flights under BOAC registration.
The Douglas DC-3 PH-ALI 'Ibis', then registered as G-AGBB, was attacked three times by the Luftwaffe: on 15 November 1942, 19 April 1943, and finally on 1 June 1943 (fatal to passengers and crew, see BOAC Flight 777). Some KLM aircraft with their crews ended up in the Australia-Indonesia region, where they aided in transporting people who were escaping the Japanese aggression in that area.

====Post-World War II====

After the ending of the Second World War in the fall of 1945, KLM immediately started to rebuild its network. Since the Dutch East Indies were in a state of revolt, Plesman's first priority was to reestablish KLM's route to Batavia. This service was reinstated by the end of 1945. Domestic and European flights resumed in September 1945, initially with a fleet of Douglas DC-3s and Douglas DC-4s. On 21 May 1946, KLM was the first continental European airline to start transatlantic scheduled flights between Amsterdam and New York City using Douglas DC-4 aircraft. By 1948, KLM had reconstructed its network and service resumed to Africa, North and South America, and the Caribbean. Long range pressurized Lockheed Constellations and Douglas DC-6s joined KLM's fleet in the late 1940s; the Convair 240 short range pressurized twin engined airliner began European flights for the company in late 1948.
During the immediate postwar period, the Dutch government expressed interest in gaining a majority stake in the airline and thus nationalizing KLM. Plesman, however, wanted KLM to remain a private company under private control and thus only allowed the Dutch government a minority stake in KLM.
In 1950, KLM carried 356,069 passengers. The expansion of the network continued in the 1950s with the addition of several destinations in western North America. KLM's fleet expanded as well with the addition of new versions of the Lockheed Constellation and Lockheed Electra, of which KLM was the first European airline to fly.
On 31 December 1953, the founder and president of KLM, Albert Plesman, died at the age of 64.[tpl]cite journal|title=The Flying Dutchman is Forty|journal=FLIGHT International|date=2 October 1959 |volume=76 |issue=2638 |page=321 |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1959/1959%20-%202512.html |accessdate=17 February 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|title=The Netherlands' Aviation Industry – KLM Royal Dutch Airlines|journal=FLIGHT International|date=13 May 1971 |volume=99 |issue=3244|page=686 |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1971/1971%20-%200777.html |accessdate=17 February 2013[/tpl] Fons Aler succeeded Albert Plesman as KLM's president.[tpl]cite journal|title=Civil Aviation – To Succeed Dr. Plesman|journal=FLIGHT International|date=19 March 1954 |volume=65 |issue=2356 |page=347 |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1954/1954%20-%200767.html |accessdate=17 February 2013[/tpl] After the death of Plesman, the company and other airlines entered a difficult economic period. The conversion to jet airplanes placed a further financial burden on KLM. Besides all this, the Dutch government increased its ownership of the company to two-thirds, and thus hereby nationalized the airline. The board of directors, however, remained under the control of the private shareholders.
On 25 July 1957, the airline introduced its flight simulator for the Douglas DC-7C – the last KLM aircraft with piston engines – which opened the transpolar route from Amsterdam via Anchorage to Tokyo on 1 November 1958. Each crew flying the transpolar route over the Arctic was equipped with a winter survival kit, including a 7.62 mm selective-fire AR-10 carbine for use against polar bears, in the event the plane was forced down onto the polar ice.Pikula, Sam (Major), The ArmaLite AR-10, Regnum Publications (1998), p. 73

===Jet age===

Beginning in September 1959, the airline introduced the four-engine turboprop Lockheed Electra onto some of its European and Middle Eastern routes. In March 1960, KLM introduced the first Douglas DC-8 jet into its fleet. In 1961, KLM reported its first year of losses. In 1961, the president of KLM, Fons Aler, was succeeded by Ernst van der Beugel. This change of leadership, however, did not lead to a reversion of KLM's financial difficulties. Van der Beugel resigned as president in 1963 due to health reasons.[tpl]cite journal|title=KLM Directors Resign|journal=FLIGHT International|date=10 January 1963 |volume=83 |issue=2809 |page=45 |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1963/1963%20-%200045.html |accessdate=17 February 2013[/tpl] Horatius Albarda was appointed to succeed Ernst van der Beugel as president of KLM in 1963.[tpl]cite journal|title=KLM's New President|journal=FLIGHT International|date=27 June 1963 |volume=83 |issue=2833 |page=1010 |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1963/1963%20-%201041.html |accessdate=17 February 2013[/tpl] Alberda initiated a reorganization of the company, which led to the reduction of staff and air services. In 1965, Alberda died in an air crash. Dr. Gerrit van der Wal succeeded Alberda as president of KLM.[tpl]cite journal|title=Death of KLM President|journal=FLIGHT International|date= 27 May 1965 |volume=87 |issue=2933|page=820 |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1965/1965%20-%201472.html |accessdate=17 February 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|title=New KLM President|journal=FLIGHT International|date= 24 June 1965 |volume=87 |issue=2937|page=1010|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1965/1965%20-%201900.html |accessdate=17 February 2013[/tpl] Van der Wal forged an agreement with the Dutch government that KLM would be run once again as a private company without interference of the government. By 1966, the stake of the Dutch government in KLM was reduced to a minority stake of 49.5%. In 1966, KLM introduced the Douglas DC-9 on European and Middle East routes.
The new terminal buildings at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol opened in April 1967 and in 1968, the stretched Douglas DC-8-63 entered service. With 244 seats, it was the largest airliner at the time. KLM was the first airline to put the higher gross-weight Boeing 747-200B into service, starting in February 1971, powered by Pratt & Whitney JT9D engines, thus beginning the airline's era of widebody jets. [tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl] In March 1971, KLM opened its current headquarters in Amstelveen. In 1972, KLM purchased the first of several Douglas DC-10 aircraft. This jet was McDonnell Douglas's response to Boeing's 747.
In 1973, Sergio Orlandini was appointed to succeed Gerrit van der Wal as president of KLM.[tpl]cite web |last=Vischer |first=Freddy |title=The years 1969 – 1978 |url=http://www.tca.viscal.net/klm/history/histo-1969-1978.htm |publisher=Tradewind Caribbean Airlines |accessdate=17 February 2013[/tpl] At the time, KLM, as well as other airlines, had to deal with overcapacity. Orlandini proposed to convert KLM 747s to "combis" that could carry a combination of passengers and freight. In November 1975, the first of these  Boeing 747-300B Combi aircraft were added to the KLM fleet.
The oil crisis of 1973, which caused difficult economic conditions, led KLM to seek government assistance in arranging debt refinancing. KLM issued additional shares of stock to the government, in return for its money. In the late 1970s, the government's stake had again increased to a majority stake of 78%. KLM thus, again, was nationalized. The company management, however, remained under control of the private stakeholders.

===1980s and 1990s===

In 1980, KLM carried 9,715,069 passengers. In 1983, it reached an agreement with Boeing to convert some of its Boeing 747-200s to stretched upper deck configuration. The work started in 1984 at the Boeing factory in Everett, Washington and finished in 1986. The converted aircraft were called Boeing 747-200SUD, which the airline operated in addition to Boeing 747-300s. In 1983 as well, KLM took delivery of its first (of ten) Airbus A310 passenger jets. Sergio Orlandini retired in 1987 and was succeeded by Jan de Soet as president of KLM.[tpl]cite journal|title= News Scan – KLM Royal Dutch Airlines |journal=FLIGHT International|date= 8 November 1986 |volume=130 |issue=4036 |page=8 |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1986/1986%20-%202950.html? |accessdate=17 February 2013[/tpl] In 1986, the share of the Dutch government in KLM was reduced to 54.8 percent. It was expected that this share would be reduced further during the decade. The Boeing 747-400 was introduced into KLM's fleet in June 1989.
With the liberalization of the European market, KLM started with the development of its hub at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol by feeding its network with traffic from affiliated airlines. A major step in the development of a worldwide network was the acquisition of a 20% stake in Northwest Airlines in July 1989.
In 1990, KLM carried 16,000,000 passengers. KLM president Jan de Soet retired at the end of 1990 and was succeeded in 1991 by Pieter Bouw.[tpl]cite journal|title= KLM Names New MD |journal=FLIGHT International|date= 28 February 1990 |volume=137 |issue=4205 |page=36 |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1990/1990%20-%200572.html |accessdate=17 February 2013[/tpl] In December 1991, KLM was the first European airline to introduce a frequent flyer loyalty program, which was called Flying Dutchman.

===Joint-venture===

In January 1993, the US Department of Transportation granted KLM and Northwest Airlines antitrust immunity, which allowed the two airlines to intensify their partnership. As of September 1993, the partners operated all their flights between the US and Europe as part of a joint venture. In March 1994, KLM and Northwest Airlines introduced World Business Class on intercontinental routes. KLM's stake in Northwest Airlines was increased to 25% in 1994.
KLM introduced the Boeing 767-300ER in July 1995. In January 1996, KLM acquired a 26% share in the flag carrier of Kenya, Kenya Airways. In 1997, Pieter Bouw resigned as president of KLM; he was succeeded by Leo van Wijk.[tpl]cite journal|title= People – KLM |journal=FLIGHT International|date= 4 June 1997 |volume=151 |issue=4577 |page=52 |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1997/1997%20-%201500.html |accessdate=17 February 2013[/tpl] In August 1998, KLM repurchased all regular shares from the Dutch government to make KLM, once again, a private company. On November 1, 1999, KLM founded AirCares, a communication and fundraising platform supporting worthy causes and focusing on underprivileged children around the world.
In March and June 2002, KLM announced that it would renew its intercontinental fleets by replacing the Boeing 767s, Boeing 747-300s, and eventually the McDonnell Douglas MD-11 with Boeing 777-200ERs and Airbus A330-200s. Some 747s would be first to retire. The MD-11s will remain in service until 2014. The first Boeing 777 was received on 25 October 2003, entering commercial service on the Amsterdam–Toronto route, while the first Airbus A330-200 was introduced on 25 August 2005 and entered commercial service on the Amsterdam–Washington Dulles route.

===Air France–KLM merger===

On 30 September 2003, Air France and KLM announced and agreed to a merger plan in which Air France and KLM would become subsidiaries of a holding company called Air France-KLM. Both airlines would retain their own brands and both Paris Charles de Gaulle and Amsterdam Airport Schiphol would become the key hubs.[tpl]cite web|title=Air France and KLM get close |url=http://www.economist.com/node/2098740 |work=The Economist|accessdate=17 February 2013|date=6 October 2003[/tpl] In February 2004, the European Commission and US Department of Justice approved the proposed merger of Air France and KLM.[tpl]cite press release|title=Commission clears merger between Air France and KLM subject to conditions |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-04-194_en.htm |publisher=European Commission|date=11 February 2004|accessdate=18 February 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=History – 2004|url=http://www.skyteam.com/en/About-us/Organization/History/2004/|work=SkyTeam|accessdate=18 February 2013[/tpl] In April 2004, an exchange offer took place in which KLM shareholders exchanged their KLM shares for Air France shares.[tpl]cite press release|title=Air France exchange offer for all common shares of KLM |url=http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/56316/000115697304000389/u47326e425.htm |publisher=Air France |date=2 April 2004|accessdate=18 February 2013[/tpl] The merger of Air France and KLM was approved by the shareholders in April 2004.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.airfranceklm-finance.com/en/content/download/5076/32313/file/Reference-Document_2004-05_EN.pdf |title=2004–05 Reference Document |date=12 July 2005 |work=Air France – KLM Finance |publisher=Air France – KLM |accessdate=18 February 2013|page=6 |format=PDF[/tpl] By exchanging the KLM shares for Air France shares, the merger was therefore fulfilled On 4 May 2004, the exchange offer was called successful.[tpl]cite press release|title=Successful Exchange Offer for KLM common shares by Air France |url=http://www.klmcargo.com/tds/images/310_45984.pdf |publisher=Air France / KLM |date=4 May 2004|accessdate=18 February 2013[/tpl] As of 5 May 2004, the merger of Air France and KLM was a done deal.[tpl]cite press release|title=Air France – KLM, A Global Airline Market Leader |url=http://corporate.airfrance.com/uploads/media/airfrance_klm_a_global_airline_market_leader_01.pdf |publisher=Air France / KLM|date=5 May 2004|accessdate=18 February 2013[/tpl] Since 5 May 2004, Air France – KLM has been listed on the Euronext exchanges in Paris, Amsterdam and New York. In September 2004, the merger was completed by creation of the Air France-KLM holding company. The merger of Air France and KLM resulted in the world's largest airline group. The merger should lead to an annual total cost-saving of between 400 and 500 million euros.
It did not appear that KLM's longstanding joint venture with Northwest Airlines (since merged with Delta Air Lines in 2008) was affected by the merger with Air France. Both KLM and Northwest joined the SkyTeam alliance in September 2004.
In March 2007, KLM started to use the Amadeus reservation system, along with partner Kenya Airways. Furthermore, after 10 years, Leo van Wijk resigned from his position as president of KLM, being succeeded by Peter Hartman.[tpl]cite web|title=People: 5 December 2006|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/people-5-december-2006-210896/|work=Flight International|accessdate=17 February 2013|date=5 December 2006[/tpl]

===Recent developments===

In January 2010, Northwest Airlines was merged to Delta Air Lines, ending their 21-year long alliance with KLM. In September 2010, KLM announced that the passenger division of Martinair would be integrated within KLM. All personnel and routes will be transferred to KLM. By November 2011, Martinair only consisted of the cargo and maintenance division.
In March 2011, KLM and InselAir reached an agreement for mutual interline cooperation on InselAir destinations, thus expanding its services to its passengers. Beginning 27 March 2011, KLM passengers could also fly to all InselAir destinations, through InselAir's hubs in Curacao and Sint Maarten.
On 20 February 2013, KLM announced that Peter Hartman would resign as president and CEO of KLM on 1 July 2013. He was succeeded by Camiel Eurlings. Peter Hartman will remain employed by KLM until he retires on 1 January 2014.
KLM received the award for "Best Airline Staff Service" in Europe at the World Airline Awards 2013. This award represents the rating for an airline's performance across both Airport Staff and Cabin Staff combined, and were first introduced in 2010.[tpl]cite web|title=The Best Airline Staff Service in Europe |url=http://www.worldairlineawards.com/Awards_2013/svcexceurope.htm |work=World Airline Awards |publisher=Skytrax |accessdate=22 June 2013[/tpl] It is the second consecutive year that KLM won this award; in 2012 it was awarded with this title as well.[tpl]cite web|title=KLM Royal Dutch Airlines wins award for the 2012 Best Airline Staff Service in Europe |url=http://www.worldairlineawards.com/Awards_2012/svcexceurope.htm |work=World Airline Awards |publisher=Skytrax |accessdate=22 June 2013[/tpl]

====KLM Asia====

KLM Asia ([tpl]zh|t=荷蘭亞洲航空公司|p=Hélán Yàzhōu Hángkōng Gōngsī[/tpl]) is a wholly KLM owned subsidiary registered in Taiwan. The airline was established in 1995 in order to operate flights to Taipei, Taiwan, without compromising the traffic rights held by KLM for destinations in the People's Republic of China.[tpl]cite web|title=KLM History|url=http://www.theklmsource.com/history.html|work=The KLM Source|accessdate=20 February 2013[/tpl] KLM Asia was one of a number of airline subsidiaries flying under the "Asia" name with the same purpose of flying to Taiwan. These included Japan Asia Airways (a Japan Airlines subsidiary), Air France Asie, Asiana Airlines, British Asia Airways, Swissair Asia, and Australia Asia Airlines (a Qantas subsidiary).
The livery of KLM Asia does not feature Dutch national symbols, such as the flag of the Netherlands, nor does it use KLM's stylised Dutch Crown logo. Instead, it features a special KLM Asia logo. KLM Asia has 5 Boeing 747-400 Combi aircraft (included in the KLM fleet as 747-400M), 7 Boeing 777-200ER, and 2 Boeing 777-300ER all included in the KLM fleet. KLM Asia initially operated the Amsterdam-Bangkok-Taipei route with a B747-400 Combi or a B747-400 non-combi aircraft. Since March 2012, KLM Asia has operated the revised Amsterdam-Taipei-Manila route with Boeing 777-200ER/-300ER aircraft.

===Branding===

At its establishment in 1919, Dirk Roosenburg designed the iconic KLM logo. In this logo, Roosenburg intertwined the letter K, L, and M and gave them wings and a crown. The crown was depicted to denote KLM's royal status, which was granted at KLM's establishment.[tpl]cite web|title=KLM keeps predicate 'Royal' |url=https://www.klm.com/travel/nl_en/about/news_press/travel_news/KLM_keeps_predicate_Royal.htm|publisher=KLM|accessdate=2 February 2013[/tpl] The logo became known as the "vinklogo" (referring to the Chaffinch bird breed).[tpl]cite book|last=van Hoogstraten|first=Dorine|title=Dirk Roosenburg, architect 1887–1962|year=2005|trans_title=Dirk Roosenburg, architect 1887–1962|publisher=010 Publishers |location=Rotterdam |isbn=9064505322 |url=http://books.google.com/books?isbn=9064505322|accessdate=2 February 2013|page=137|language=Dutch|trans_chapter=Buildings for aviation|chapter=Gebouwen voor de luchtvaart[/tpl] In 1925, the original KLM logo was revised so that it looked more dynamic compared to the original logo.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl] The biggest revision of the KLM logo so far took place in 1961. In this year, F.H.K. Henrion designed the current KLM logo. The crown remained in the logo, formed by the line, the four blue circles, and the cross on top of the logo. In 1991, the logo was further revised by Chris Ludlow of Henrion, Ludlow & Schmidt.[tpl]cite web|title=KLM Logo |url=http://www.famouslogos.net/klm-logo |work=FamousLogos.net |accessdate=2 February 2013[/tpl] In addition to its main logo, KLM has shown its alliance status in its branding, including "Worldwide Reliability" with Northwest Airlines (1993–2002) and the SkyTeam alliance (2004–present).[tpl]cite web|title=KLM Royal Dutch Airlines| url=http://www.evolutionofbrands.com/nl/klm-royal-dutch-airlines/ |work=Evolution of Brands|accessdate=2 February 2013[/tpl]

The former KLM livery featured a bright blue fuselage, with a wide white and dark blue strip above the grey belly of the aircraft. The KLM logo was placed on the white tail. The KLM logo was placed centrally at the tail and place at the front part of the fuselage. In December 2002, KLM introduced its current livery. In this change, the white strip was dropped while the dark blue strip was transformed into a cheatline. The bright blue color was retained and now covers most of the fuselage. The KLM logo was placed more centrally on the fuselage, while the position of the logo on the tail and the tail design remained the same.[tpl]cite press release|title=New Livery For KLM Fleet |url=http://www.presslink.nl/klm/|publisher=KLM|date=20 December 2002|accessdate=9 February 2013 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20021222090350/http://www.presslink.nl/klm/|archivedate=22 December 2002[/tpl] 
In April 2010, KLM introduced new uniforms for its female cabin attendants, ground attendants, and pilots at KLM and KLM Cityhopper. The complete new uniform is designed by Dutch couturier Mart Visser. The uniform has the same KLM blue color which was introduced in 1971. KLM added a touch of orange, the national color of the Netherlands, to the KLM blue.[tpl]cite press release|title=KLM introduces new ladies uniform|url=http://nieuws.klm.com/klm-introduceert-nieuw-damesuniform-en/|publisher=KLM|date=14 April 2010|accessdate=9 February 2013[/tpl]

====Marketing slogans====

KLM has used different slogans throughout its operational history. Several slogans that KLM used are:

===Social media===

KLM has an extensive presence on various social media platforms, like Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram, LinkedIn, Google+, and YouTube. KLM additionally runs a blog.[tpl]cite web |title=Where to find KLM on social media sites |url=http://www.klm.com/travel/nl_en/plan_and_book/klm_on_social_media/where_to_find_us/index.htm |publisher=KLM |accessdate=31 March 2013[/tpl] Customers can ask KLM questions through these channels. Also, these channels are used by KLM to keep their followers up-to-date on the latest KLM news, marketing campaigns, and promotions.
The usage of social media platforms to reach customers experienced an extreme uptake when the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajökull erupted in April 2010, which caused extreme disruptions to air traffic. Customers used the social channels to reach KLM. In turn KLM decided to utilize these social networks to reach out to customers and provide them with information about the situation.[tpl]cite web |last=van Drimmelen |first=Jochem |title=KLM's social media strategy – Part 1 |url=http://blog.klm.com/klm%E2%80%99s-social-media-strategy-part-1/4670/ |publisher=KLM Blog |accessdate=31 March 2013[/tpl] Following the increased use of social media, KLM decided to create a centralized social media site for the public in October 2010, establishing the Social Media Hub.[tpl]cite web |last=van Drimmelen |first=Jochem |title=KLM's social media strategy – Part 2 |url=http://blog.klm.com/klm%E2%80%99s-social-media-strategy-part-2/4700/ |publisher=KLM Blog |accessdate=31 March 2013[/tpl]
KLM developed several services based on these social platforms, including:
In June 2013, KLM launched its own 3D strategy game 'Aviation Empire' for both iOS and Android platforms. The game lets users experience what it is like to manage an airline via a game. Players manage KLM from its establishment until now by investing in a fleet, building a network with international destinations, and developing airports. The game combines the digital world with the real world by enabling the unlocking of airports by GPS check-ins.[tpl]cite press release |title=KLM Launches 3D Stategy Game 'Aviation Empire' |url=http://nieuws.klm.com/klm-lanceert-3d-strategy-game-aviation-empire-en/ |publisher=KLM |date=27 June 2013 |accessdate=10 July 2013[/tpl]

These World Business Class seats are arranged in a pod-style layout that recline up to 175 degree angled flat bed.
KLM introduced the newest World Business Class seat to be added to the complete long haul fleet in June 2013. Dutch designer Hella Jongerius designed the new cabin as well as the new flat-bed seat,[tpl]cite press release |title=KLM revitalises its World Business Class cabin interior |url=http://nieuws.klm.com/klm-vernieuwt-het-interieur-van-de-world-business-class-en/ |publisher=KLM |date=23 November 2012 |accessdate=29 November 2012[/tpl] which will replace both versions of the angled flat seat that are currently offered in World Business Class. The seat is a B/E Aerospace Diamond and the retrofit has been completed on 20 of 22 Boeing 747-400 aircraft, and will be completed in June 2014. The new seats are fully flat, and offer [tpl]convert|17|in|cm|adj = on[/tpl] high definition personal entertainment systems. When fully flat, the bed is about [tpl]convert|2|m|ft[/tpl] long. The cabin features a world's first, a carpet made from old uniforms woven in an intricate pattern, combining with new pillows and curtains following a similar intricate design language. The next aircraft to receive the seats would be the Boeing 777, followed by the Airbus A330. The MD-11 aircraft would not receive the new seat, as it would be leaving the fleet later this year.
Dutch design group Viktor & Rolf has designed and provides amenity kits to World Business Class passengers. Each year a new design will be introduced, and the color of the amenity kits will change every six months.http://www.flyingblue.com/news/1479/be-inspired-by-klms-new-world-business-class.html} The kit contains socks, eye mask, toothbrush & toothpaste, earplugs, and Viktor & Rolf lip balm.

===Delft Blue houses===

Since the 1950s, KLM presents all of its World Business Class passengers with a unique gift: a Delft blue miniature traditional Dutch house. These miniatures are reproductions of real Dutch houses and are filled with Dutch gin, genever.[tpl]cite web |title=KLM Delft Blue houses |url=http://www.klm.com/travel/nl_en/prepare_for_travel/on_board/travel_classes/miniatures.htm|work=KLM |publisher=KLM |accessdate=25 July 2013[/tpl] The houses, however, have not always been filled with genever: initially the houses were filled with Bols liqueur, while in 1986 the switch was made to Bols young genever.[tpl]cite web|title=House of Bols|url=http://www.bols.com/2011/11/17/in-pellentesque/|work=Bols|publisher=Bols|accessdate=25 July 2013[/tpl]
KLM started to hand out the houses in 1952 to its First Class passengers. However, with the elimination of First Class in 1993, the houses were instead handed out to all Business Class passengers.[tpl]cite news|last=Michaels|first=Daniel|title=The Ultimate Dutch Status Symbol: House-Shaped Booze Bottles; Jet-Setters Hoard, but Avoid Drinking, KLM's Freebies; The $1,000 Cheese Building|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121217604543933443.html|accessdate=25 July 2013|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=31 May 2008[/tpl] The impetus for these houses was a rule aimed at curtailing a previously widespread practice of offering significant incentives to passengers by limiting the value of gifts given by airlines to .75 US cents. KLM did not bill the Delft Blue Houses as a gift, but rather as a last drink on the house, which was served in the house.[tpl]cite web |title=Discover all our houses; About KLM Houses |url=http://www.klm.com/travel/nl_en/prepare_for_travel/on_board/travel_classes/klmhouses.htm |work=KLM |publisher=KLM |accessdate=25 July 2013[/tpl]
Every year, a new house is presented on 7 October, the anniversary of KLM's founding in 1919. The number on the last presented house thus represents the number of years KLM has been in operation. There are various special edition houses which are offered to special guests (like VIPs or honeymoon couples). These special edition houses are the Dutch Royal Palace and the 17th century Cheese Weighing House De Waag in Gouda.

===Ground services===

KLM offers various check-in methods to their passengers. Passengers are able to check in for their flights at the self-service check-in kiosks at the airport, via the Internet, and via a mobile phone or tablet. Check-in by an airline representative at the counter is provided at destinations where the above mentioned facilities are not available. Electronic boarding passes can be received at a mobile phone or tablet while boarding passes can be printed at the airport through the kiosks.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.klm.com/travel/nl_en/prepare_for_travel/checkin_options/all_about/index.htm |title=All about checking in|publisher=KLM|accessdate=19 January 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url= https://www.klm.com/travel/nl_en/plan_and_book/mobile_services/app_iphone_blackberry/index.htm |title=KLM App|publisher=KLM|accessdate=19 January 2013[/tpl]
Since 4 July 2008 KLM, in cooperation with Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, has been a pioneer by offering self-service baggage drop-off to their passengers. The project started with a pilot which included just one drop-off point.[tpl]cite press release|title=Amsterdam airport Schiphol and KLM launch innovative self-service baggage drop-off trial |url= http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:27MnfO_ElIoJ:www.klm.com/corporate/en/newsroom/press-release-archive/archive-2008/amsterdam-airport-schiphol-and-klm-launch-innovative-self-service-baggage-drop-off-trial.html+&cd=2&hl=nl&ct=clnk&gl=nl |publisher=KLM|date=4 July 2008|accessdate=19 January 2013[/tpl] However, the number of self-service baggage drop-off points has gradually increased and [tpl]as of|2012|2|8|lc=y[/tpl] there are 12 self-service baggage drop-off points.[tpl]cite press release|title=Amsterdam Airport Schiphol: Six new Self-Service Baggage Drop-Off units now in use at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol |url=http://www.schiphol.nl/SchipholGroup/NewsMedia/PressreleaseItem/AmsterdamAirportSchipholSixNewSelfServiceBaggageDropOffUnitsNowInUseAtAmsterdamAirportSchiphol1.htm |publisher=Schiphol Group|date=8 February 2012|accessdate=19 January 2013[/tpl] Together with the self-service check-in kiosks, KLM passengers are now able to check in without any contact with a KLM employee.
In November 2012, KLM started a pilot at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol to test self-service boarding. The passengers board the aircraft without interference of a gate agent by scanning their boarding pass, which will open a gate. Partner Air France ran the same pilot at its hub at Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport. The pilot ran until March 2013, which was followed by an evaluation.[tpl]cite web|title=KLM test 'self service boarding' op Schiphol en Parijs CDG |url=http://www.luchtvaartnieuws.nl/nl-NL/Article.cms/Airlines/KLM_test_self_service_boarding_op_Schiphol_en_Parijs_CDG |work=Luchtvaartnieuws |publisher=Reismedia |language=Dutch |trans_title=KLM tests 'self service boarding' at Schiphol and Paris CDG |accessdate=28 February 2013[/tpl]

When a passenger misses a connecting flight, details about alternative flights can be viewed on the kiosk and a new boarding pass can be printed. Furthermore, coupons for a beverage, meal, the use of a telephone, or travel discount can be printed from the kiosk when a passenger is entitled to such coupons.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.klm.com/travel/nl_en/prepare_for_travel/at_the_airport/connections/index.htm#3 |title=Transfer to another flight |publisher=KLM|accessdate=19 January 2013[/tpl]

===Flying Blue===

Air France-KLM's frequent flyer programme, Flying Blue, awards members miles based on the distance travelled, ticket fare and class of service.

Membership in the Flying Blue programme is free.
Two types of miles can be earned within the Flying Blue frequent flyer programme: Award Miles and Level Miles. Award Miles can be exchanged for rewards and expire after 20 months without flying. Level Miles, on the other hand, are used to determine membership level and remain valid until 31 December of each year.[tpl]cite web|title=Earn Miles |url=http://www.klm.com/travel/nl_en/flying_blue/earn_and_spend_miles/earn_miles/index.htm |publisher=KLM|accessdate=28 January 2013[/tpl]
