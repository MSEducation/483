[[Axiom of infinity]]

CATEGORIES: Axioms of set theory

In axiomatic set theory and the branches of logic, mathematics, philosophy, and computer science that use it, the axiom of infinity is one of the axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory.  It guarantees the existence of at least one infinite set, namely a set containing the natural numbers.

==Formal statement==

In the formal language of the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms, the axiom reads:
In words, there is a set I (the set which is postulated to be infinite), such that the empty set is in I and such that whenever any x is a member of I, the set formed by taking the union of x with its singleton {x} is also a member of I. Such a set is sometimes called an inductive set.

==Interpretation and consequences==

This axiom is closely related to the standard construction of the naturals in set theory, in which the successor of x is defined as x ∪ {x}. If x is a set, then it follows from the other axioms of set theory that this successor is also a uniquely defined set. Successors are used to define the usual set-theoretic encoding of the natural numbers.  In this encoding, zero is the empty set:
The number 1 is the successor of 0:
Likewise, 2 is the successor of 1:
and so on. A consequence of this definition is that every natural number is equal to the set of all preceding natural numbers.
This construction forms the natural numbers. However, the other axioms are insufficient to prove the existence of the set of all natural numbers. Therefore its existence is taken as an axiom—the axiom of infinity. This axiom asserts that there is a set I that contains 0 and is closed under the operation of taking the successor; that is, for each element of I, the successor of that element is also in I.
Thus the essence of the axiom is:
The axiom of infinity is also one of the von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel axioms.

==Extracting the natural numbers from the infinite set==

The infinite set I is a superset of the natural numbers. To show that the natural numbers themselves constitute a set, the axiom schema of specification can be applied to remove unwanted elements, leaving the set N of all natural numbers. This set is unique by the axiom of extensionality.
To extract the natural numbers, we need a definition of which sets are natural numbers. The natural numbers can be defined in a way which does not assume any axioms except the axiom of extensionality and the axiom of induction—a natural number is either zero or a successor and each of its elements is either zero or a successor of another of its elements. In formal language, the definition says:
Or, even more formally:

===Alternative method===

==Independence==

The axiom of infinity cannot be derived from the rest of the axioms of ZFC, if these other axioms are consistent. Nor can it be refuted, if all of ZFC is consistent.
