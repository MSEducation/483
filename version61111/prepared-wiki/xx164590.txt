==History==

In 1887, Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway built a branch line from Neva (3 miles west of Strong City) through Kackley to Superior, Nebraska.  In 1996, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway merged with Burlington Northern Railroad and renamed to the current BNSF Railway.  Most locals still refer to this railroad as the "Santa Fe".
The town was once a trade center and was considered a "booming" town in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  At its peak, the population was 200 but as of 2007 has dwindled to 13 residents.  It was named for Joe Kackley, the original land owner.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kackley.org/history.htm|title=Column with Contents|publisher=Kackley.org website (link expired)[/tpl]
