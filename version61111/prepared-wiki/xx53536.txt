==History==

===Early Years===

The city of Oakland looked into the construction of an airport starting in 1925. In 1927 the announcement of the Dole prize for a flight from California to Hawaii provided the incentive to purchase 680 acres in April 1927 for the airport.[tpl]cite book |title=Oakland Aviation|first1=Ronald T.|last1=Reuther|first2=William T.|last2=Larkins|page=17[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=Oakland Airport|url=http://www.aiaa.org/Participate/Uploads/02-0694%20HAS%20Oakland%20brochur.pdf|accessdate=November 3, 2011[/tpl] The 7,020 foot long runway was the longest in the world at the time, and built in just 21 days to meet the Dole race start. The airport was dedicated by Charles Lindbergh September 17. In its early days, because of its long runway enabling safe takeoff rolls for fuel-heavy aircraft, Oakland was the departing point of several historic flights, including Charles Kingsford Smith's historic US-Australia flight in 1928, and Amelia Earhart's final flight in 1937.  Earhart departed from this airport when she made her final ill-fated voyage, intending to return there after circumnavigating the globe.[tpl]cite web |title=A History of Aviation Excellence and Importance to the Community|url=http://www.oaklandairport.com/media_backgrounder.shtml| publisher=Port of Oakland |accessdate=July 16, 2012[/tpl]
Boeing Air Transport (a predecessor of United Airlines) began scheduled flights to Oakland in December 1927. It was joined by Trans World Airlines (TWA) in 1932. In 1929 Boeing opened the Boeing School of Aeronautics on the field, which expanded rapidly in 1939 as part of the Civilian Pilot Training Program. Thousands of pilots and mechanics were trained before the facility was changed into the United Air Lines training center in 1945.[tpl]cite book|title=Aerospace Engineering Education During The First Century Of Flight|author=Barnes Warnock McCormick, Conrad F. Newberry, Eric Jumper|page=858[/tpl]
In 1943, the U.S. Armed Forces temporarily took over Oakland Airport and opened Naval Air Station Oakland. It was transformed it into an airlift base for military flights to the Pacific islands, ordering all scheduled service to move to San Francisco International Airport. After the war, airlines slowly returned to Oakland: Western Airlines began flights in 1946, and was followed by American Airlines, TWA, United, Transocean Airlines and Pacific Southwest Airlines (PSA).
The airport's first Jet Age airline terminal (now Terminal 1) designed by John Carl Warnecke & Associates was opened in 1962, part of a $20 million expansion on bay fill that included 10000-ft runway 11/29.[tpl]cite web |title=Oakland International Airport, Terminal 1|url=http://www.docomomo-noca.org/building-detail.php?id=53|work=Northern California Chapter, Documentation and Conservation of Buildings|accessdate=July 16, 2012[/tpl] The May 1963 OAG showed 15 airline flights arriving Oakland each day, including nine from San Francisco; in June 1963 TWA flew Oakland's first scheduled jet, a Convair 880 to Chicago.
During the Vietnam War, World Airways shuttled thousands of military passengers through Oakland to their bases in Southeast Asia, and an International Arrivals facility was built, allowing the airport to handle international flights for the first time. By the late 1960s World Airways had broken ground on the World Airways Maintenance Center at Oakland International Airport. The Maintenance Hangar could store four Boeing 747s.
After the war Oakland's traffic slumped, but airline deregulation prompted several low-fare carriers to begin flights. This increase prompted the airport to build a $16.3 million second terminal, Lionel J. Wilson Terminal 2, with seven gates for PSA and AirCal service.
FedEx Express opened a cargo base in Oakland in 1988, which is now one of the busiest air freight terminals in the United States. In 1987 an Air France Concorde visited Oakland. In the 1990s Southwest Airlines opened a crew base in Oakland, and expanded its flights to become the airport's dominant passenger carrier. The airport has international arrival facilities, including U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials.  Mexicana Airlines flew between Oakland and cities in Mexico for many years.  In the past Corsairfly flew Orly Airport to OAK to Papeete, Tahiti, Martinair flew to Schiphol Airport and CityBird flew to Brussels Airport in Brussels.

===2000s===

United Airlines vacated its [tpl]convert|300000|sqft|-4|abbr=on[/tpl] Oakland Maintenance Center in May 2003 and transferred work to its base at San Francisco International Airport.
Oakland International Airport began a $300 million expansion and renovation project in 2004, including adding five gates in Terminal 2. The new concourse partially opened in fall 2006, with full opening by spring 2007, and a new baggage claim in Terminal 2 opened in summer 2006. The former Terminal 2 baggage claim has been replaced by a renovated and expanded security screening area. As part of this program, airport roadways, curbsides and parking lots were renovated by the end of 2008.
In 2008 Oakland suffered a series of service cutbacks due to high fuel costs and airline bankruptcies, more than other Bay Area airports. In just a few days Oakland's numerous non-stops to Hawaii were eliminated following the liquidation of ATA Airlines and Aloha Airlines, although Hawaiian Airlines started a daily flight to Honolulu a month later. Skybus Airlines stopped flying to Columbus, OH when it ended operations on April 5. American Airlines and Continental Airlines both dropped Oakland on September 3, United Airlines ended service to Los Angeles on November 2, and TACA ended service to San Salvador on September 1.
A groundbreaking ceremony for a new control tower took place October 15, 2010.  A grant awarded to the Federal Aviation Administration from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) helped fund the project.  The new, environmentally "green" tower was opened in 2013 and replaced the previous north and south field towers.  The new tower was formally dedicated in a ceremony on November 22, 2013.[tpl]cite press release |title=FAA Dedicates New Control Tower at Oakland International Airport|url=http://www.faa.gov/news/press_releases/news_story.cfm?newsId=15455&omniRss=press_releasesAoc&cid=102_P_R|publisher=Federal Aviation Administration |date=November 22, 2013|accessdate=January 27, 2014[/tpl]
The Port of Oakland and Coulomb Technologies has announced that electric vehicle (EV) driver services have arrived at Oakland International Airport (OAK) with the installation of eight ChargePoint Network charging stations for EVs in the Premier Parking Lot.
Oakland International is the first Northern California airport to offer EV charging services as part of the ChargePoint Network, providing drivers EV services including real-time charging station status and reservations.
For more than 30 years, OAK has worked with its stakeholders to develop programs that minimize the effect of aircraft noise, to the extent possible, on surrounding communities, while maintaining a safe and efficient air transportation center. Through regularly scheduled stakeholder meetings, a sophisticated noise-monitoring system, proactive communications with neighboring communities and pilot education, OAK has successfully lessened the impact of airport operations on neighboring communities, in order to improve their quality of life.
For nearly a century Oakland International Airport (OAK) has served the shipping and travel needs of the San Francisco Bay Area. The original airfield was built in 1927 and is still used by air cargo and corporate and general aviation operators. In 1962 a new terminal (Terminal 1), 10,000-foot runway and 10-story air traffic control tower was built to usher in the jet-age. Terminal 2 was opened in 1985 and is now used just by Southwest Airlines.
In 2008 OAK completed its $300 million Terminal Improvement Program, with projects that added a new concourse with five more gates and waiting areas expanded ticketing, security and baggage claim facilities added new utilities and improved terminal access and eased congestion in front of the terminals through a new roadway and curbside system. These projects are one part of the on-going Airport Development Program (ADP).
Even at the completion of these projects, there is already demand driving the need for additional infrastructure improvements. The main planning tool to provide guidance on near-term and long-term Airport land-use is a Master Plan. The airport's 20-year Master Plan was completed in 2006, with input from the OAK Aviation Stakeholder Advisory Committee.
Oakland International Airport, a revenue division of the Port of Oakland, takes a leadership role in promoting a sustainable operating environment—whether that's looking at current day-to-day operations or forecasting future needs and requirements.
The Port of Oakland is an independent department of the city of Oakland and is required to do its part to be a good neighbor, an environmental steward, and a responsible business operator in its efforts to support the city's sustainability goals. Through its efforts, the Port of Oakland contributed to the recent recognition of the city of Oakland as one of the best examples of urban sustainability at the 2005 United Nations World Environment Day conference in San Francisco.
The Port of Oakland has adopted a sustainability policy, also known as the "Three E's," that is based on the values of environmental responsibility, economic vitality and social equity.

A number of general aviation FBOs are at the North Field:

==Terminals, airlines and destinations==

There are two terminals at Oakland International Airport:

===Top destinations===

===Charter airlines===

===Cargo airlines===

==Transportation==

===Public===

Oakland International is not yet directly connected to the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system by rail, but AirBART shuttle buses and AC Transit's Lines 73 and 805 buses take passengers between the terminal and the Coliseum/Oakland Airport station. AC Transit line 21's route from the Airport to Oakland's Dimond district, has a few in-between stops within the nearby island city of Alameda. The Fruitvale BART station is included as a stop for this line. Since the airport's renovation, AirBART now has a single stop located halfway between terminals 1 and 2 on the third curb. The bus has a layover of 5–10 minutes depending on the passenger load. AC Transit stops at the fourth curb between the terminals.  Unless early, it departs immediately upon the completion of passenger boarding, to fit a set schedule.  AirBART generally comes more often than AC Transit buses after 9:30 pm daily. AirBART and Line 73 run during regular hours from about 5 am to midnight, whereas Line 805 is a night bus that runs from midnight to 5 am.

===Road===

Oakland International is accessible from Interstate 880 (Nimitz Freeway) which is [tpl]convert|2|mi|0[/tpl] away. The airport can be reached by exiting Hegenberger Road or 98th Avenue heading west; both streets converge into Airport Road before looping around in front of the terminals.

===Underway: Oakland Airport Connector===

The Oakland Airport Connector (OAC) is an automated people mover, currently under construction, that will directly connect BART Coliseum Station to the terminal buildings at Oakland International Airport. Unlike the AirBART connector bus currently operating between the station and the airport terminals, the Oakland Airport Connector will be operated by BART and integrated into the BART fare system.
When built, the Oakland Airport Connector will replace AirBART buses. The connector’s automated people movers (APMs) will be electrically powered and operate on a fixed, elevated guideway. The APMs will arrive at the BART Coliseum Station every four-and-one-half minutes and are designed to transport travelers to the airport in about eight minutes with an on-time performance of more than 99 percent.
In early 2010, the project lost $70 million of federal stimulus funding because the Metropolitan Transportation Commission had "equity concerns" related to the planned high fares on the connector.[tpl]cite web |title=$70 Million for Airport Connector Project to Be Diverted to Regional Transit Agencies|first=Ayako|last=Mie|url=http://oaklandnorth.net/2010/02/21/70-million-for-airport-connector-project-to-be-diverted-to-regional-transit-agencies/|work=Oakland North|date=February 21, 2010|accessdate=April 19, 2012[/tpl]

===Military aircraft mistake===

On September 27, 2007, Oakland airport authorities ordered North American Airlines Flight 1777, carrying 200 U.S. Marines home from duty in Iraq, to park [tpl]convert|400|yd|-1[/tpl] away from the airport terminal and refused to allow the troops to enter the terminal, although they were allowed off the aircraft to stretch their legs and use restrooms.[tpl]cite news |title=Oakland Airport Keeps Marines Out of Terminal in Oakland Stopover |first=Henry K. |last=Lee|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/10/03/BAIUSILJ6.DTL|newspaper=The San Francisco Chronicle |date=October 3, 2007|accessdate=July 17, 2012[/tpl] The airliner had stopped in Oakland to refuel and provision. Oakland authorities stated that their decision was based on the fact that, "The airport received information that the passengers were not screened by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) at their originating airport and that weapons were on-board the aircraft." The airplane's passengers, however, had been screened by TSA at John F. Kennedy International Airport and no further screening was necessary. Oakland Airport officials apologized for the mistake – "There was no disrespect that was intended," said Omar Benjamin, executive director of the Port of Oakland, which runs the airport. "There was confusion. There were mistakes that were made." However, U.S. Representative John Mica stated that, "We believe this is not an isolated incident" and asked the United States Department of Transportation (DoT) to investigate.[tpl]cite news |title=California Airport Isolates Troops|first=Audrey|last=Hudson |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/article/20071003/NATION/110030059/1002|newspaper=The Washington Times |date=October 3, 2007|accessdate=October 4, 2007[/tpl]
The DoT released the report of its investigation on January 30, 2008. The investigation concluded that the airport did not break any laws or regulations in the incident. The investigation found that the contract under which military chartered transport aircraft are serviced at the airport does not require access to the terminal facilities for military passengers. The report stated that airport management was concerned that they could not provide "an adequate level of escort and control of such a large group of military personnel in or around the terminal area". The airport personnel were also concerned over the proper safeguarding and securing of the weapons carried on the military transport. The report further stated that a contributing factor was a lack of communication and coordination between the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security, especially with regard to security screenings of military personnel on the chartered flights. The report recommended that a task force be established with representatives from Homeland, Defense, and Transportation departments and airlines and airports to develop a uniform process for handling military personnel on all military chartered flights at U.S. airports. Commenting on the report, Mica stated, "The shocking thing is that there is no protocol for handling our returning troops, and at Oakland they got a very rude welcome. We just need to get some regular order of the process so we don't have a recurrence of what we saw happen here."[tpl]cite news |title=Airport Found Legitimate in Troop Treatment |first=Audrey|last=Hudson|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080131/NATION/981079835/-1/RSS_FP|newspaper=The Washington Times |date=January 31, 2008|accessdate=July 17, 2012[/tpl]
