The focus of the Neustadt/Weinstrasse Railway Museum is vehicles of the former state railways in southern Germany. For example, the two remaining examples of steam locomotives from the time of the Palatine Railways are preserved here still in their original state: the T 1 Schaidt and a Palatine T 5. In addition a replica of an express train locomotive from the early railway period, (Die Pfalz), a Crampton engine, is on display. Vehicles from the Deutsche Reichsbahn era are the E 17 and ET 11. In addition the museum still has a range of passenger train coaches and goods wagons of the former Baden and Royal Württemberg State Railways, as well as the later standard DRG wagons. There is also a 1942 steam-powered rotary snow plough in the fleet.
