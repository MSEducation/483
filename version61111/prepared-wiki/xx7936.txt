Montoneros ([tpl]lang-es|link=no|Movimiento Peronista Montonero-MPM[/tpl]) was an Argentine leftist urban guerrilla and subversive group, active during the 1960s and 1970s. The name is an allusion to the 19th century cavalry militias who fought for the Partido Federal during the Argentine Civil Wars.  
After Juan Perón's return from 18 years of exile and the 1973 Ezeiza massacre, which marked the definitive split between left and right-wing Peronism, the president expelled the Montoneros from the Justicialist party in May 1974. The group was almost completely destroyed by government suppression by 1975, before the beginning of the Dirty War.

==Ideology==

As other similar left-wing guerrillas who operated in Latin America during the 1970s, the Montoneros maintained that democracies were a complex masquerade that concealed fascist governments and delayed class struggle.Giussani, p. 25 Their attacks sought to force the governments to give up such masquerades and operate as fascist governments; expecting that in such a scenario the people would support the guerrillas.Giussani, p. 26 This doctrine did not work as intended: the people despised the military dictatorships, but did not see the guerrillas as the enemies of the dictatorships, but as a contributing cause to the government's repression.Giussani, p. 29 The projected class struggle never took place.Giussani, p. 30 
Montoneros did not think about their armed violence as a response to a threat to society, but as the key of their identity. Once democracy was restored, they declined the chance to achieve their goals by peaceful means.Giussani, p. 52 In 1973 they killed the unionist José Ignacio Rucci and declared war on Isabel Perón when, as vice president, she succeeded to the presidency in 1974 after her husband's death.Giussani, p. 60 The military style was the basis of the actions, structure and hierarchy of the Montoneros. They used salutes, uniforms and military slang, even in circumstances where these were inappropriate, such as the state funeral of Juan Perón.Giussani, p. 72 The internal structure of the Montoneros was completely top-down, with the strategies outlined by its leaders and ordered to the others.Giussani, pp.78-87 
Although Juan Perón encouraged the actions of José López Rega, supported the right-wing unionists and denied preferential promotions to the Montoneros, they thought that his actions were simply a strategic masquerade. Some believed that Perón supported the Montoneros' projects.Giussani, p. 18 Perón expelled the group from Plaza de Mayo and outlined the government's counter-insurgency that decimated the guerrillas. Some surviving Montoneros still acknowledge Perón as their leader.Giussani, p. 19

==From 1970 to Videla's military junta==

The Montoneros formed around 1970 out of a confluence of Roman Catholic groups, university students in social sciences, and leftist supporters of Juan Domingo Perón. "The Montoneros took their name from the pejorative term used by the 19th-century elite to discredit the mounted followers of the popular caudillos." Montonera referred to the raiding parties composed by indigenous peoples in Argentina, and the spear in the Montoneros seal refers to this inspiration.Brown, 2010: 234–235 Their best-known leader was Mario Firmenich. The Montoneros hoped that Perón would return from exile in Francoist Spain and transform Argentina into a "Socialist Fatherland". 
The Montoneros initiated a campaign to destabilize by force what they deemed a pro-American regime. In 1970, claiming to act in retribution for the June 1956 León Suárez massacre and Juan José Valle's execution, the Montoneros kidnapped and executed former dictator Pedro Eugenio Aramburu (1955–1958) and other collaborators. These included unionists, politicians, diplomats, and businessmen. In November 1971, in solidarity with militant car workers, Montoneros took over a car manufacturing plant in Caseros sprayed 38 Fiats with petrol, and set them afire.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Y0_u5aLUT8YC&pg=PA382&lpg=PA382&dq=plaza+san+isidro+montoneros+argentina&source=bl&ots=KnPpRlImR7&sig=9JyajPMExj8EDawDeE1Wf5rI2t4&hl=en&ei=LJ68SYTiKZmQsQP5uPBD&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result |title=The Argentina Reader: History, Culture, Politics, Gabriela Nouzeilles & Graciela R.

In July 1972, they set off explosives in the Plaza de San Isidro in Buenos Aires, which injured three policemen, blinded one fireman, and killed another.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Y0_u5aLUT8YC&pg=PA382&lpg=PA382&dq=plaza+san+isidro+montoneros+argentina&source=bl&ots=KnPpRlImR7&sig=9JyajPMExj8EDawDeE1Wf5rI2t4&hl=en&ei=LJ68SYTiKZmQsQP5uPBD&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result |title=Ibid,p.43 |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=12 November 2011[/tpl] In April 1973, Colonel Héctor Irabarren, head of the 3rd Army Corps' Intelligence Service, was killed when resisting a kidnap attempt by the Mariano Pojadas and Susana Lesgart platoons of the Montoneros. 
On 17 October 1972, a powerful bomb detonated inside the Sheraton Hotel in Buenos Aires, to the horror of nearly 700 guests, killing a Canadian woman and gravely wounding her husband.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Z94QAAAAIBAJ&sjid=yosDAAAAIBAJ&pg=7258,1915009&dq |title=The Free-Lance Star – 17 October 1972 |publisher=Google  |date=17 October 1972 |accessdate=12 November 2011[/tpl] The Montoneros and the Revolutionary Armed Forces later claimed responsibility for the attack.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3nBjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ankNAAAAIBAJ&pg=3887,4194224&dq= |title=The Phoenix, October 18, 1972 |publisher=Google  |accessdate=12 November 2011[/tpl] The Montoneros financed their operations by kidnapping and collecting ransoms for businessmen or executives, making as much as $14.2 million in 1974 in an abduction of an Exxon executive. 
On 11 March 1973, Argentina held general elections for the first time in ten years. Perón loyalist Héctor Cámpora became president and Perón returned from Spain. Cámpora resigned in July to allow Perón to win the new elections held in October. However, a feud developed between right-wing Peronists and the Montoneros. The right wing of the Peronist party, the unions, and the Radical Party led by Ricardo Balbín favored a social pact between trade unions and employers, rather than a violent socialist revolution. 
Right-wingers and Montoneros clashed at Perón's homecoming ceremony, leading to the 20 June 1973 Ezeiza massacre, which resulted in 13 dead and more than 300 wounded. Perón supported the unions, the radicals led by Balbín, and the right-wing Peronists. Among the latter was a former federal police corporal, José López Rega, who was the founder of the Alianza Anticomunista Argentina ("Triple A"), paramilitary death squads, which had organized the massacre. 
On 25 September 1973, the Montoneros assassinated José Ignacio Rucci, general secretary of the CGT (General Confederation of Labour) and took other military actions in retaliation.

===1974===

On 21 February 1974, the Montoneros killed Teodoro Ponce, a right-wing Peronist labor leader in Rosario.Facts on File, 1974 He had sought refuge in a local business after being shot at while driving by a car load of masked gunmen. One of the gunmen who got out of the car shot him dead while he lay on the floor and also shot a woman, who screamed out, "Murderer."
In May 1974, Perón expelled the Montoneros from the Justicialist movement. The Montoneros waited until after the death of Perón in July 1974 to react.  They claimed to have the "social revolutionary vision of authentic Peronism" and started guerrilla operations against the government. The more radically right-wing factions quickly took control of the government; Isabel Perón, President since Juan Perón's death, was essentially a figurehead under the influence of Rega.
On 15 July 1974, Montoneros assassinated Arturo Mor Roig, a former foreign minister. On 17 July, they murdered David Kraiselburd, journalist and editor-in-chief of El Día newspaper, in the Manuel B. Gonnet suburb of Buenos Aires after an exchange of fire with police. 
In September, in order to finance their operations, they kidnapped the two brothers of the Bunge and Born family business. Some 20 urban guerrillas dressed as policemen shot dead a bodyguard and chauffeur and diverted traffic in this well-orchestrated ambush. Some 30 militants and sympathizers among the civilian population provided safe houses to the guerrillas and a means to escape.Terrorism in an Unstable World, by Richard L. Clutterbuck, p. 173, Routledge, 1994 They demanded and received a ransom of $60 million in cash, as well as $1.2 million worth of food and clothing to be given to the poor. According to the Guinness Book of Records, this ransom is the highest ever paid.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl]
Under López Rega's orders, the Triple A began kidnapping, and killing members of Montoneros and the People's Revolutionary Army (ERP), as well as other leftist militant groups. They expanded their attacks to anyone considered a leftist subversive or sympathizer, such as these group's deputies or lawyers. 
The Montoneros and the ERP in turn attacked business and political figures throughout Argentina, and raided military bases for weapons and explosives. The Montoneros killed executives from General Motors, Ford and Chrysler. On 16 September 1974, about 40 Montoneros bombs exploded throughout Argentina.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rand.org/pubs/reports/2005/R1909-1.pdf |title=International Terrorism: A Chronology (1974 Supplement) author= Brian M.

The Montoneros discouraged foreign investment more directly by blowing up the homes of their executives. For example, in 1975 the homes of five executives of Lazar Laboratories were bombed in the suburb of La Plata in Buenos Aires. The violence was widespread.

===1975===

On 22 February 1975, in an ambush in the Lomas de Zamora suburb of Buenos Aires, three policemen (First Sergeant Nicolás Cardozo, Corporal Roberto Roque Fredes and Constables Eugenio Rodriguez and Abel Pascuzzi) were killed after their patrol car came under fire from Montoneros guerrillas. 
On 26 February 1975, the Montoneros kidnapped 62-year-old John Patrick Egan, a  U.S. Consular Agent in the city of Córdoba, in the country's northern interior. They executed him two days later. That same day, they killed three policemen in another ambush by urban guerrillas in Buenos Aires, and an army conscript in Tucumán province.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PesgAAAAIBAJ&sjid=7XEFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3532,33484&dq= |title=The Day, March 1, 1975 |publisher=Google  |accessdate=12 November 2011[/tpl] On 5 March 1975, a Montoneros bomb detonated in the underground parking at Plaza Colón of the Argentine Army High Command; a garbage truck driver was killed and 28 others were wounded,"Powerful bomb", Ellensburg Daily Record, 15 March 1976 including four colonels and 18 other ranks."Argentine Blast Kills 1", Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, 16 March 1976] In early June 1975, Montoneros guerrillas murdered executives David Bargut and  Raul Amelong of the Acindar steel firm in Rosario, in reprisal for alleged repression against striking employees.Latin America, 1975, al Kosut, Chris Hunt, Grace M.

On 12 June 1975, in an ambush in the capital of the Córdoba province, three policemen (Pedro Ramón Enrico, Carlos Alberto Galíndez y corporal Luis Francisco Rodríguez) were killed by guerrillas. On 25 July 1975 four policemen were wounded in guerrilla attacks using bazookas and firebombs. On 26 August 1975, 26-year-old Fernando Haymal was killed by fellow Montoneros for allegedly cooperating with government forces.Soldiers of Perón: Argentina's Montoneros, Richard Gillespie, p. 217, Clarendon Press, 1982.

On 28 August 1975 the Montoneros planted a bomb in a culvert at the Tucumán air base airstrip. The blast destroyed an Air Force C-130 transport carrying 116 anti-guerrilla commandos of the Gendarmerie, killing five and wounding 40, one of whom later died of his injuries.Burzaco, pp. 108–109 
The network of Montoneros militants had been largely uprooted by the government in the capital of Tucumán province. In August 1975, several hundred ERP militants took the streets in Córdoba, to divert attention from the military operations being waged in the mountains of Tucumán. They shot and killed five policemen after attacking their headquarters and bombed the police radio communications center."5 Policemen Dead In Argentina Violence". Times-Union, 21 August 1975 As a result, the elite 4th Airborne Infantry Brigade, which had been ordered to assist operations in Tucumán province, was kept in Córdoba for the rest of the year. On 5 October 1975, the Montoneros carried out a complex operation against the 5th Brigade.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=9nFyZaZGthgC&pg=PA236&lpg=PA236&dq=perhaps+several+hundred+montoneros&source=bl&ots=nS1oUdmih1&sig=2JQIlP0Jvget7uNo6lU4amIp-kE&hl=en&ei=-Bi7SfnKDJSgM6yfsZMI&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result |title=Terrorism in Context |author=Martha Crenshaw, |pages= 236| publisher= Penn State Press, date= 1995  |accessdate=12 November 2011[/tpl] 
During Operation Primicia ("Operation Scoop") a Montoneros force numbering an estimated several hundred guerrillas assaulted an army barracks in Formosa province. On October 5, 1975, Montoneros members hijacked a civilian airliner bound for Corrientes from Buenos Aires. The guerrillas redirected the plane to Formosa, and took over the provincial airport. With tactical support from a local militant group, the invaders attacked the barracks of the 29th Infantry Regiment with gunfire and hand grenades. They shot several soldiers who had been resting in their quarters.[tpl]cite web|author=Heriberto J E Roman |url=http://argentinahechoshistoricos.blogspot.com/2008/08/ataque-al-regimiento-de-infanteria-de.html#prof |title=Montoneros ataca a un Regimiento del Ejército Argentino |publisher=Argentinahechoshistoricos.blogspot.com |date=27 February 2004 |accessdate=12 November 2011[/tpl] 
After the soldiers and NCOs got over their surprise, they mounted stiff resistance to the Montoneros. In total, a second lieutenant, sergeant and ten soldiers were killed and several wounded; the Montoneros lost 16 men in total.

The sophistication of the operation, and the getaway cars and hideouts they used to escape the military crackdown, suggest the involvement several hundred guerrillas and militants. Under the presidency of Nestor Kirchner, the families of all the Montoneros killed in the attack were later compensated with the payment of around US$200,000 each. During February 1976, the Montoneros sent assistance to the hard-pressed Compañía de Monte Ramón Rosa Jiménez fighting in Tucumán province, in the form of a company of their elite "Jungle Troops", while the ERP backed them up with a company of their guerrillas from Cordoba.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=NtZ3EvNYxjYC&pg=PA107&dq=general+vila%27s+forces+numbered#PPA126,M1 |title=Guerrillas and Generals: The Dirty War in Argentina |author= Paul H.

The Baltimore Sun reported at the time, "In the jungle-covered mountains of Tucuman, long known as "Argentina's garden," Argentines are fighting Argentines in a Vietnam-style civil war. So far, the outcome is in doubt.

====Seaborne attacks====

Montoneros were inspired by the British and Italian wartime commando raids on warships, and on 1 November 1974 Montoneros successfully blew up General Commissioner Alberto Villar, the chief of the Argentine federal police in his yacht. His wife was also killed on the spot.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8mFdMbhkiWEC&pg=PA62&lpg=PA62&dq=yacht+montoneros&source=bl&ots=B7HrZ92CW1&sig=LcGtKSieQU5vL5dqqzsMlN6_-X0&hl=en&ei=1JO8Sa38NYHwsAPqksE5&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result#PPA63,M1 |title=Lloyd's MIU Handbook of Maritime Security, Julio Espin-Digon, Rupert Herbert-Burns, Sam Bateman & Peter Lehr, p. 63, CRC Press, 2008 |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=12 November 2011[/tpl] On 24 August 1975 their frogmen planted a mine on the river's bed below the hull of a navy destroyer, the ARA Santísima Trinidad , as she remained docked at Rio Santiago before her commissioning. The explosion caused considerable damage to the ship's computer and electronic equipment. On 14 December 1975, using the same techniques, Montoneros frogmen placed explosives on the yacht Itati in an attempt to kill the Commander-in-Chief of the Argentine Navy, Admiral Emilio Massera.Soldiers of Perón: Argentina's Montoneros, Richard Gillespie, Page197, Clarendon Press, 1982.

In January 1976, the son of retired Lieutenant-General Julio Alsogoray, Juan Alsogaray (El Hippie), copied from his father's safe a draft of "Battle Order 24 March" and passed it to the head of the Montoneros intelligence, Rodolfo Walsh, who informed the guerrilla leadership of the planned military coup.Political violence and trauma in Argentina, By Antonius C.
