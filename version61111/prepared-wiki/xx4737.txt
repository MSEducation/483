[[Economy of Italy]]

CATEGORIES: Economy of Italy, European Union member economies, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development member economies, Economic history of Italy

Italy has a diversified industrial economy with high gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and developed infrastructure. According to the International Monetary Fund in 2014 (see  List of countries by past and future GDP (nominal) ) Italy is the 8th-largesteconomy in the world, the fourth-largest in Europe and in EU and the third-largest in the Eurozone in terms of nominal GDP,http://siteresources.worldbank.org/DATASTATISTICS/Resources/GDP.pdf and the eleventh-largest economy in the world and fifth-largest in Europe in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP) GDP.http://siteresources.worldbank.org/DATASTATISTICS/Resources/GDP_PPP.pdf
Italy is a member of the G7 and the Group of Eight (G8) industrialized nations, the European Union and the OECD. It is predicted that Italian GDP will grow 0.6% in 2014, 1.15% in 2015 and 1.25% in 2016.

==History==

The Unification of Italy in 1861 broke down the feudal land system that had survived in the South since Middle Ages, especially where land had been the inalienable property of aristocrats, religious bodies, or the king. The redistribution of land did not necessarily lead to small farmers in the South winding up with land of their own or land they could work and profit from. Many remained landless, and plots grew smaller and smaller and thus more and more unproductive as land was subdivided among heirs.[tpl]cite journal | last = McDonald | first = J.S. | title = Some Socio-Economic Emigration Differentials in Rural Italy, 1902–1913 | journal = Economic Development and Cultural Change  | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 55–72 |date=October 1958 | id= ISSN 00130079 | doi = 10.1086/449779[/tpl]
At the same time, the early industrialization process that characterized the northern and central parts of the country starting from the 1880s, completely excluded large areas in the North-East. The resulting Italian diaspora concerned nearly 25 million Italians, the most part immigrated in the period 1880–1914, and it is considered the biggest mass migration of contemporary times.[tpl]cite journal | last = McDonald | first = J.S. | title = Some Socio-Economic Emigration Differentials in Rural Italy, 1902–1913 | journal = Economic Development and Cultural Change | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 55–72 |date=October 1958 | doi = 10.1086/449779 | issn = 00130079[/tpl]Favero, Luigi e Tassello, Graziano. Cent'anni di emigrazione italiana (1861–1961) Introduction
During the Great War, the Italian Royal Army increased in size from 15,000 men in 1914 to 160,000 men in 1918, with 5 million recruits in total entering service during the war.Clark, Martin. "Modern Italy: 1871–1982.” Longman History of Italy. London and New York: Longman. Pp. 186 This came at a terrible cost: by the end of the war, Italy had lost 700,000 soldiers and had a budget deficit of billions of lira.

===Fascist era===

Italy emerged from World War I in a poor and weakened condition. The National Fascist Party of Benito Mussolini came to power in 1922, at the end of a period of social unrest. During the first years of the new regime, the Fascist pursued a laissez-faire economic policy: they initially reduced taxes, regulations and trade restrictions on the whole.Sheldon Richman, "Fascism". However, once Mussolini acquired a firmer hold of power, laissez-faire and free trade were progressively abandoned in favour of government intervention and protectionism.Patricia Knight, Mussolini and Fascism, Routledge 2003 page 64
In 1929, Italy was hit hard by the Great Depression.William G. Welk, "Fascist economy policy; an analysis of Italy's economic experiment", Harvard University Press, 1938. pp. 166 Trying to handle the crisis, the Fascist government nationalized the holdings of large banks which had accrued significant industrial securities, establishing the Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale.Gaetano Salvemini, "Italian Fascism". London: Victor Gollancz Ltd., 1938. A number of mixed entities were formed, whose purpose it was to bring together representatives of the government and of the major businesses. These representatives discussed economic policy and manipulated prices and wages so as to satisfy both the wishes of the government and the wishes of business.Patricia Knight, Mussolini and Fascism, Routledge (UK), ISBN 978-0-415-27921-5, p. 65
This economic model based on a partnership between government and business was soon extended to the political sphere, in what came to be known as corporatism. At the same time, the aggressive foreign policy of Mussolini led to an increasing military expenditure. After the invasion of Ethiopia, Italy intervened to support Francisco Franco's nationalists in the Spanish Civil War. By 1939, Italy had the highest percentage of state-owned enterprises after the Soviet Union.
Italy's involvement in World War II as a member of the Axis powers required the establishment of a war economy. The Allied invasion of Italy in 1943 eventually caused the Italian political structure – and the economy – to rapidly collapse. The Allies, on the one hand, and the Germans on the other, took over the administration of the areas of Italy under their control. By the end of the war, Italian per capita income was at its lowest point since the beginning of the 20th century.Adrian Lyttelton (editor), "Liberal and fascist Italy, 1900–1945", Oxford University Press, 2002. pp. 13

===Post-war economic miracle===

After the end of World War II, Italy was in rubble and occupied by foreign armies, like Germany and other Axis powers, a condition that worsened the chronic development gap towards the more advanced European economies. However, the new geopolitical logic of the Cold War made possible that the former enemy Italy, a hinge-country between Western Europe and the Mediterranean, and now a new, fragile democracy threatened by the proximity of the Iron Curtain and the presence of a strong Communist party,[tpl]Cite book| author = Michael J.

The end of aid through the Plan could have stopped the recovery but its end coincided with a crucial point in the Korea War whose demand for metal and manufactured products was a further stimulus of Italian industrial production. In addition, the creation in 1957 of the European Common Market, with Italy as a founding member, provided more investment and eased exports.[tpl]Cite book| author = Nicholas Crafts, Gianni Toniolo| title = Economic growth in Europe since 1945| publisher = Cambridge University Press| year=  1996| location = | page = 428| isbn = 0-521-49627-6[/tpl]
These favorable developments, combined with the presence of a large and cheap labour force, laid the foundation for spectacular economic growth that lasted almost uninterrupted until the "Hot Autumn's" massive strikes and social unrest of 1969–70, which then combined with the later 1973 oil crisis and put an abrupt end to the prolonged boom. It has been calculated that the Italian economy experienced an average rate of growth of GDP of 5.8% per year between 1951–63, and 5.0% per year between 1964–73. Italian rates of growth were second only, but very close, to the German rates, in Europe, and among the OEEC countries only Japan had been doing better.[tpl]Cite book| author = Ennio Di Nolfo| title = Power in Europe?

===From stagflation to stagnation===

The 1970s were a period of economic, political turmoil and social unrest in Italy. Unemployment rose sharply, especially among the young. By 1977 there were one million unemployed people under age 24. Inflation continued, aggravated by the increases in the price of oil in 1973 and 1979. The budget deficit became permanent and intractable, averaging about 10 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP), higher than any other industrial country. The lira fell steadily, from 560 lira to the U.S. dollar in 1973 to 1,400 lira in 1982.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/297474/Italy/214431/Italy-since-1945 |title=Italy since 1945|publisher=Britannica Online Encyclopedia |accessdate=16 July 2011[/tpl]
The economic recession went on into the mid-1980s until a reduce of public costs and spendings, tighter budgets and deficits, a steady economic growth, and a lowered inflation rate meant that by the recovery plan of 1983, Italy left recession.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Africa/Morocco-ECONOMIC-DEVELOPMENT.html |title=Economic development – Morocco – product, growth, area, annual, economic growth, infrastructure, policy, sector |publisher=Nationsencyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=10 November 2011[/tpl] This plan led to an increasing GDP growth, lower inflation, and increased industrial/agricultural/commercial produce, exports and output, yet made the unemployment rate rise. A decrease in energy prices and lowered value of the dollar led to foreign exchange being liberalised and the economy to re-grow rapidly.
As a matter of fact, in 1987, Italy had a period when it surpassed the British economy (an event known as il sorpasso), becoming the fifth in the world. On 15 May 1991 Italy became for a while the fourth worldwide economic power, overcoming France,[tpl]cite web|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1991/05/16/abbiamo-superato-anche-la-francia-secondo-business.html/ |title=Abbiamo Superato Anche La Francia Secondo Business International |publisher=Ricerca.repubblica.it |date= |accessdate=10 November 2011[/tpl] with a GDP of US$1.268 trillion, compared to France's GDP of US$1.209 trillion and Britain's of US$1.087 trillion.

===Late 2000s recession===

Italy was hit hard by the economic crisis of 2007–11. The national economy shrunk by 6.76% during the whole period, totalizing seven-quarters of recession.http://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?queryid=350 Quarterly National Accounts: Quarterly Growth Rates of real GDP, OECD. Accessed on 4 September 2010. According to the EU's statistics body Eurostat, Italian public debt stood at 116% of GDP in 2010, ranking as the second biggest debt ratio after Greece (with 126.8%).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.europolitics.info/economy-monetary-affairs/deficits-increase-in-eurozone-and-eu-artb287086-50.html |title=Europolitics |publisher=Europolitics.info |date= |accessdate=26 January 2011[/tpl] However, the biggest chunk of Italian public debt is owned by national subjects,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cnbc.com/id/37207942/Could_Italy_Be_Better_Off_than_its_Peers |title=Could Italy Be Better Off than its Peers?  |publisher=CNBC |date=18 May 2010 |accessdate=30 May 2011[/tpl] and relatively high levels of private savings and low levels of private indebtedness are seen as making it the safest among Europe's struggling economies.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/7756acd4-1cdf-11e0-8c86-00144feab49a.html#axzz1SIwD9iir |title=Italian deficit narrows in third quarter| publisher=Financial Times |date=10 January 2011 |accessdate=16 July 2011[/tpl]
As a result of austerity measures passed in December 2010, Italy is targeting a public budget deficit of 3.9% in 2011 and 2.7% in 2012, both among the lowest in the European Union. In Autumn 2011, Standard & Poor's and Moody's downgraded Italian sovereign debt rating because of "Italy's weakening economic growth prospects." Italy also has a weak coalition government which would "limit the government's ability to respond decisively" to events.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dawn.com/2011/09/20/standard-and-poor%e2%80%99s-downgrades-italy-debt-rating.html |title=Standard and Poor's downgrades Italy debt rating |date=20 September 2011[/tpl] Both rating agencies give a negative outlook on the debt, meaning further downgrades are possible.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.focus-fen.net/?id=n260921 |title=Euro falls after Moody's downgrades Italy |date=5 October 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/c5e5de2a-eed4-11e0-959a-00144feab49a.html#axzz1ZsqN5zEM |title=Moody's cuts Italy's rating three notches |date=4 October 2011[/tpl]

As a result of austerity measures passed in 2011, Italy is targeting a public budget deficit of 1.5% in 2013.

==Overview==

In the post-war period, Italy was transformed from an agricultural based economy which had been severely affected by the consequences of World War II, into one of the world's most industrialized nations,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.careersineurope.hobsons.com/country_italy.aspx |title=Hobsons Careers in Europe | Country profiles |publisher=Careersineurope.hobsons.com |accessdate=2 August 2010[/tpl] and a leading country in world trade and exports. According to the Human Development Index, the country enjoys a very high standard of living, and, according to The Economist, has the world's 8th highest quality of life.The Economist Intelligence Unit’s quality-of-life index, Economist, 2005
From the last Eurostat data, Italian per capita GDP at purchasing power parity remains approximately equal to the EU average,[tpl]cite web|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/2-25062009-BP/EN/2-25062009-BP-EN.PDF|title=GDP per capita in PPS|publisher=Eurostat|accessdate=25 June 2009[/tpl] while the unemployment rate (8.5%) stands as one of the EU's lowest.http://tg24.sky.it/tg24/economia/2010/06/14/ocse_tasso_disoccupazione_invariato_1.html Ocse, tasso di disoccupazione stabile nell'eurozona Italy owns the world's third-largest gold reserve.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gold.org/deliver.php?file=/value/stats/statistics/archive/pdf/World_Official_Gold_Holdings_Dec_2009.pdf |title=Please login to download – World Gold Council, the information resource for gold, investment, jewellery, science and technology, historical and culture|publisher=Gold.org |accessdate=27 January 2010[/tpl] The country is also well known for its influential and innovative business economic sector,[tpl]cite web|url=http://dev.prenhall.com/divisions/hss/worldreference/IT/economics.html |title=Italy – Economics |publisher=Dev.prenhall.com |accessdate=2 August 2010[/tpl] an industrious and competitive agricultural sector (Italy is the world's largest wine producer[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7827713.stm|title=UK tops world wine imports table|date=14 January 2009|publisher=BBC[/tpl]), and for its creative and high-quality automobile, industrial, appliance and fashion design.
Despite these important achievements, the country's economy today suffers from many and relevant problems. After a strong GDP growth in 1945–1990, the last two decades's average annual growth rates lagged well below the EU average; moreover, Italy was hit particularly hard by the late-2000s recession. The stagnation in economic growth, and the political efforts to revive it with massive government spending from the 1980s onwards, eventually produced a severe rise in public debt. In addition, Italian living standards have a considerable north–south divide: the average GDP per capita in Northern and Central Italy significantly exceeds the EU average, whilst some regions and provinces in Southern Italy are dramatically below.[tpl]cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=STAT/09/23&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en |title=EUROPA – Press Releases – Regional GDP per inhabitant in the EU27, GDP per inhabitant in 2006 ranged from 25% of the EU27 average in Nord-Est in Romania to 336% in Inner London |publisher=Europa |date=19 February 2009 |accessdate=30 October 2010[/tpl] Between 2000 and 2006, Italy received €27.4 billion from the European Development Fund for investments in depressed areas of the South.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/sources/docgener/informat/country2009/it_en.pdf |title=European Cohesion Policy in Italy |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=30 October 2010[/tpl]

More specifically, Italian economy is weakened by the lack of infrastructure development, market reforms and research investment, and also high public deficit. In the Index of Economic Freedom 2011, the country ranked only 87th in the world, in particular due to the high rate of corruption, an excessive state interventionism, and a strong labor law.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/Index/Country/Italy|title=Index of Economic Freedom |publisher=The Heritage Foundation |accessdate=23 July 2011[/tpl] In addition, the most recent data show that Italy's spending in R&D in 2011 was equal to 1.1% of GDP (12th in the world by expenditures), below the European average of 1.7% and the Lisbon Strategy target of devoting 3% of GDP to research and development activities.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.battelle.org/aboutus/rd/2011.pdf|title=2011 Global R&D Funding Forecast|author=Battelle Memorial Institute|accessdate=23 July 2011[/tpl]
Italy has a smaller number of global multinational corporations than other economies of comparable size, but there is a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises, as in the Northern "industrial triangle" (Milan-Turin-Genoa), where there is an area of intense industrial and machinery production, notably in their several industrial districts, which are the backbone of the Italian industry. This has produced a manufacturing sector often focused on the export of niche market and luxury products, that on one side is less capable of competing on quantity, but on the other side is more capable of facing the competition from emerging economies based on lower labor costs, with higher quality products.[tpl]cite news|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/ECAEXT/0,,contentMDK:21808326~menuPK:258604~pagePK:2865106~piPK:2865128~theSitePK:258599,00.html|title=Knowledge Economy Forum 2008: Innovative Small And Medium Enterprises Are Key To Europe & Central Asian Growth|publisher=The World Bank|date=19 May 2005|accessdate = 17 June 2008[/tpl]

Italy's closest trade ties are with the other countries of the European Union, with whom it conducts about 59% of its total trade. Its largest EU trade partners, in order of market share, are Germany (12.9%), France (11.4%), and Spain (7.4%).[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/it.html |title=CIA – The World Factbook |publisher=CIA |date= |accessdate=26 January 2011[/tpl]

===North–South divide===

Starting with the unification of Italy in 1861, a wide and increasing economic divide has been noticeably growing between the northern provinces and the southern half of the Italian state.[tpl]cite book|last=Mignone|first=Mario B.|title=Italy today: Facing the Challenges of the New Millennium|year=2008|publisher=Lang Publishing|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4331-0187-8|page=181[/tpl] In the early decades of the new kingdom, the lack of an effective land reform, heavy taxes and other economic measures imposed on the South, together with the removal of protectionist tariffs on agricultural goods, made the situation virtually impossible for many tenant farmers and land owners. Multitudes chose to emigrate rather than try to eke out a meager living, especially from 1892 to 1921.Dennis Mack Smith (1997). Modern Italy; A Political History. Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan Press. ISBN 978-0-472-10895-4, pp. 209–210.
In addition, the surge of brigandage and the mafia provoked widespread violence, corruption and illegality. After the rise of Benito Mussolini, the "Iron Prefect" Cesare Mori tried to defeat the already powerful criminal organizations flourishing in the South with some degree of success. Fascist policy aimed at the creation of an Italian empire and Southern Italian ports were strategic for all commerce towards the colonies. Naples enjoyed a demographic and economic rebirth, mainly thanks to the interest of King Victor Emmanuel III who was born there.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/627580/Victor-Emmanuel-III |title=Victor Emmanuel III (king of Italy)  |publisher=Britannica Online Encyclopedia|date= |accessdate=10 November 2011[/tpl] With the invasion of Southern Italy, the Allies restored the lost authority of the mafia families during the Fascist period and used their influence to maintain public order.[tpl]cite book|last=Newark|first=Tim|title=Mafia Allies: The True Story of America's Secret Alliance with the Mob in World War II|year=2007|publisher=MBI Publishing Company|location=London|isbn=978-0-7603-2457-8|pages=123–135[/tpl]
In the 1950s the Cassa per il Mezzogiorno was set up as a huge public master plan to help industrializing the South, aiming to do this in two ways: through land reforms creating 120,000 new smallholdings, and through the "Growth Pole Strategy" whereby 60% of all government investment would go to the South, thus boosting the Southern economy by attracting new capital, stimulating local firms, and providing employment. However, the objectives were largely missed, and as a result the South became increasingly subsidized and state dependent, incapable of generating private growth itself.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/402883/Naples/16117/The-economy |title=Naples (Italy) :: The economy|publisher=Britannica Online Encyclopedia|date= |accessdate=10 November 2011[/tpl]
Even at present, huge regional disparities persist. Problems in Southern Italy still include widespread political corruption, pervading organized crime and very high unemployment rates.T.

===Regional economic differences===

==Economic sectors==

===Agriculture===

The northern part of Italy produces primarily maize corn, rice, sugar beets, soybeans, meat, fruits and dairy products, while the South specializes in wheat and citrus fruits. Italy is the first or the second largest producer of wine in the world,[tpl]cite web|url=http://faostat.fao.org/site/567/DesktopDefault.aspx?PageID=567 |title=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations data |publisher=Faostat.fao.org |date=17 May 2011 |accessdate=10 November 2011[/tpl] and one of the leading in olive oil, fruits (apples, olives, oranges, lemons, pears, apricots, peaches, cherries, strawberries and kiwi), flowers and vegetables.
According to the agriculture census, there were 2.6 million farms in 2000 (down from 3 million in 1990,) covering 19.6 million hectares. The vast majority (94.7%) are family-operated and small, averaging only 5 hectares in size. Of the total surface area in agricultural use (forestry excluded,) grain fields take up 31%, olive tree orchards 8.2%, vineyards 5.4%, citrus orchards 1%, other orchards 3.8%, sugarbeets 1.7%, and horticulture 2.4%. The remainder is primarily dedicated to pastures (25.9%) and feed grains (11.6%.) Livestock includes 6 million head of cattle, 8.6 million head of swine, 6.8 million head of sheep, and 0.9 million head of goats.
The most famous Italian wines are probably the Tuscan Chianti and Pinot grigio. Other famous wines are Barbaresco, Barolo and Barbera (Piedmont), Brunello di Montalcino (Tuscany), Montepulciano d'Abruzzo (Abruzzo) and Nero d'Avola (Sicily). Quality goods in which Italy specialises are often DOC or 'of controlled origin'. This DOC certificate, which is attributed by the European Union, ensures that the origins and work that goes into a product are recognised. This certification is considered important by producers and consumers alike, in order to avoid confusion with low-quality mass-produced ersatz products.

===Energy and natural resources===

Italy has few natural resources. There are no substantial deposits of iron, coal, or oil. Proven natural gas reserves, mainly in the Po Valley and offshore Adriatic, have grown in recent years and constitute the country's most important mineral resource. Most raw materials needed for manufacturing and more than 80% of the country's energy sources are imported. The energy sector is highly dependent on imports from abroad: in 2006 the country imported more than 86% of its total energy consumption (99.7% of the solid fuels demand, 92.5% of oil, 91.2% of natural gas and 15% of electricity).[tpl]cite news|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-DK-08-001/EN/KS-DK-08-001-EN.PDF|title=Energy, transport and environment indicators|author=Eurostat|accessdate=10 May 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-GH-09-001/EN/KS-GH-09-001-EN.PDF|title=Panorama of energy|author=Eurostat|accessdate = 10 May 2009[/tpl]

Italy has managed four nuclear reactors until the 1980s, but in 1987, after the Chernobyl disaster, a large majority of Italians passed a referendum opting for phasing out nuclear power. The government responded by closing existing nuclear power plants and stopping work on projects underway, completely putting a halt to the national nuclear program. Currently, the majority of Italian electricity is produced gas, oil, coal, and hydro. Italy also imports about 16% of its electricity need from France for 6.5 GWe, which makes it the world's biggest importer of electricity. Due to its reliance on expensive fossil fuels and imports, Italians pay approximately 45% more than the EU average for electricity."Emerging Nuclear Energy Countries." Australian Uranium Association. April 2008
In 2004, a new Energy Law brought the possibility of joint ventures with foreign companies to build nuclear power plants and import electricity. Public opinion on nuclear power was positive, as Italy's younger generations embraced nuclear energy[tpl]dubious|date=October 2012[/tpl]. In 2005, Italy's power company, ENEL made an agreement with Electricite de France for 200 MWe from a nuclear reactor in France and potentially an additional 1,000 MWe from new construction. As part of the agreement, ENEL received a 12.5% stake in the project and direct involvement in design, construction, and operation of the plants. In another move, ENEL also bought 66% of the Slovak Electric utility that operates six nuclear reactors. As part of this agreement, ENEL will pay the Slovak government EUR 1.6 billion to complete a nuclear power plant in Mochovce, which has a gross output of 942 MWe. With these agreements, Italy has managed to access nuclear power without placing reactors on Italian territory.

===Transport===

In 2004 the transport sector in Italy generated a turnover of about 119.4 billion euros, employing 935,700 persons in 153,700 enterprises. Regarding to the national road network, in 2002 there were 668,721 km (415,612 mi) of serviceable roads in Italy, including 6,487 km (4,031 mi) of motorways, state-owned but privately operated mainly by Atlantia company. In 2005, about 34,667,000 passenger cars (equal to 590 cars per 1,000 people) and 4,015,000 road good vehicles circulated on the national road network.
The railway network in Italy totalled 16,862 kilometres (2008) of which 69% are electrified and on which 4,937 locomotives and railcars circulate. It is the 15th largest in the world, and is operated by Ferrovie dello Stato. High speed trains include ETR-class trains, with the ETR 500 reaching 300 km/h (190 mph). The rail tracks and infrastructure are managed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.rfi.it| title=Ferrovie dello Stato| language=Italian| accessdate=20 August 2008[/tpl]
In 1991 Treno Alta Velocità SpA was created for the planning and construction of high-speed rail lines along Italy's most important and saturated transport routes. One of the focuses of the project is to turn the rail network of Italy into a modern high-tech passenger rail system in accordance with updated European rail standards. A secondary purpose is to introduce high-speed rail to the country's high-priority corridors, namely the Milan-Naples and Turin-Milan-Venice lines.
When demand on regular lines is lessened with the opening of dedicated high-speed lines, those regular lines will be used primarily for low-speed regional rail service and freight trains. With these plans realised, the Italian rail network would be integrated with other European rail networks, particularly the French TGV, German ICE, and Spanish AVE systems.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2007[/tpl]In 2005, about 34,667,000 passenger cars (equal to 590 cars per 1,000 people) and 4,015,000 road good vehicles circulated on the national road network.
The national inland waterway network comprised 1,477 km (918 mi) of navigable rivers and channels in 2002. In 2004 there were approximately 30 main airports (including the two hubs of Malpensa International in Milan and Leonardo Da Vinci International in Rome) and 43 major seaports including the seaport of Genoa, the country's largest and the second largest in the Mediterranean Sea after Marseille. In 2005 Italy maintained a civilian air fleet of about 389,000 units and a merchant fleet of 581 ships.[tpl]cite web|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-DA-07-001/EN/KS-DA-07-001-EN.PDF|title=Panorama of Transport|format=PDF|author=European Commission|accessdate=3 May 2009[/tpl]

==Labor==

Following the 2003 "Biagi law", a controversial labour reform, unemployment has been steadily decreasing, reaching 6.2% in 2007, the lowest rate since the 1970s.[tpl]cite web | title=World Economic Outlook Database; Unemployment rate | url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2008/02/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=21&pr.y=14&sy=1980&ey=2009&scsm=1&ssd=1&sort=country&ds=.&br=1&c=136&s=LUR&grp=0&a= | work= | publisher=International Monetary Fund | date=October 2008 | accessdate=26 March 2009[/tpl] In the south the average unemployment rate is far higher than the national average, but, in recent years, progress was made nonetheless, with the unemployment rate falling from 23.7% in 1999 to 11.2% in 2007 for Campania, and from 24.5% to 13% for Sicily.[tpl]cite web | title=Unemployment rate, by NUTS 2 regions | url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/table.do?tab=table&init=1&plugin=1&language=en&pcode=tgs00010 | work= | publisher=Eurostat | date= | accessdate=26 March 2009[/tpl] There is a significant underground economy, especially in the south where it partially offsets the high official unemployment rate, absorbing substantial numbers of people, working for low wages and without standard social benefits and protections.

Unions claim to represent 40% of the work force.  Most Italian unions are grouped in three major confederations: the CGIL, the CISL, and the UIL, which together claim 35% of the work force.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2009[/tpl] These confederations formerly were associated with important political parties (respectively the Italian Communist Party, the Christian Democracy and the Italian Socialist Party), but they have formally terminated such ties. Nowadays, the three often coordinate their positions before confronting management or lobbying the government. The three major confederations have an important consultative role on national social and economic issues.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2009[/tpl]
Among their major agreements are a 4-year wage moderation agreement signed in 1993, a reform of the pension system in 1995, and an employment pact, introducing steps for labor market flexibility in economically depressed areas, in 1996. The CGIL, CISL, and UIL are affiliates of the International Trade Union Confederation. Of the three unions, CGIL is the strongest in numbers.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2009[/tpl] CGIL once single-handedly organized a three-million people rally in Rome.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2009[/tpl] Italy's employers are represented by Confindustria, the Italian Employers' Federation.
The average standard of living in Italy is very high. As noted by Mario B. Mignone:
“In the official economy, the Italian worker is well rewarded with high wages, good benefits, and many paid holidays, but he or she cannot escape from the heavy burden of taxes.”http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Tv2R8FfFpREC&pg=PA165&lpg=PA165&dq=Italy+high-wage+economy+1980&source=bl&ots=5BPZW9pzF9&sig=bP_RMe9194vRwHUhu0RiMryxprE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=9jgcUP2SLvKY0QWzpoDIAQ&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Italy%20high-wage%20economy%201980&f=false
