[[Lexical field theory]]

CATEGORIES: Lexicology, Semantics

Lexical field theory, or word-field theory, was introduced on March 12, 1931 by the German linguist Jost Trier. Trier argued that words acquired their meaning through their relationships to other words within the same word-field. An extension of the sense of one word narrows the meaning of neighbouring words, with the words in a field fitting neatly together like a mosaic. If a single word undergoes a semantic change, then the whole structure of the lexical field changes.
Trier's theory assumes that lexical fields are easily definable closed sets,David Kronenfeld and Gabriella Rundblad in Regine Eckardt, Klaus von Heusinger, Christoph Schwarze, Words in Time, Walter de Gruyter, 2003, p68.
