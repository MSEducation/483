Ronald Wilson Reagan ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɒ|n|əl|d|_|ˈ|w|ɪ|l|s|ən|_|ˈ|r|eɪ|ɡ|ən[/tpl]; February 6, 1911 – June 5, 2004) was the 40th President of the United States (1981–1989). Prior to his presidency, he served as the 33rd Governor of California (1967–1975), and was a radio, film and television actor.
Born in Tampico, Illinois, and raised in Dixon, Reagan was educated at Eureka College, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics and sociology. After graduating, Reagan moved first to Iowa to work as a radio broadcaster and then, in 1937, to Los Angeles where he began a career as an actor, first in films and later television. Some of his most notable films include Knute Rockne, All American (1940), Kings Row (1942), and Bedtime for Bonzo (1951). Reagan served as President of the Screen Actors Guild and later as a spokesman for General Electric (GE); his start in politics occurred during his work for GE. Originally he was a member of the Democratic Party, but his positions began shifting rightward in the 1950s, and he switched to the Republican Party in 1962.Ronald Reagan: The Heritage Foundation Remembers[tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl]. Reagansheritage.org. Retrieved July 15, 2013.
After delivering a rousing speech in support of Barry Goldwater's presidential candidacy in 1964, he was persuaded to seek the California governorship, winning two years later and again in 1970. He was defeated in his run for the Republican presidential nomination in 1968 and in 1976, but won both the nomination and general election in 1980, defeating incumbent Jimmy Carter.
As president, Reagan implemented sweeping new political and economic initiatives. His supply-side economic policies, dubbed "Reaganomics", advocated reducing tax rates to spur economic growth, controlling the money supply to reduce inflation, deregulation of the economy, and reducing government spending. In his first term he survived an assassination attempt, took a hard line against labor unions, announced a new War on Drugs, and ordered an invasion of Grenada. He was re-elected in a landslide in 1984, proclaiming that it was "Morning in America". His second term was primarily marked by foreign matters, such as the ending of the Cold War, the 1986 bombing of Libya, and the revelation of the Iran–Contra affair. Publicly describing the Soviet Union as an "evil empire",[tpl]cite web|author=Gingrich, Newt|authorlink=Newt Gingrich|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/content/evil-empire|title=The Evil Empire|publisher=American Heritage|date=Spring–Summer 2008|volume=58|issue=4|accessdate=July 22, 2010[/tpl] he supported anti-communist movements worldwide and spent his first term forgoing the strategy of détente by ordering a massive military buildup in an arms race with the USSR. Reagan negotiated with Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev, culminating in the INF Treaty and the decrease of both countries' nuclear arsenals.
Reagan left office in 1989. In 1994, the former president disclosed that he had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease earlier in the year; he died ten years later at the age of 93. A conservative icon, he ranks highly in public opinion polls of U.S. Presidents and is credited for generating an ideological renaissance on the American political right.

==Early life==

Ronald Wilson Reagan was born in an apartment on the second floor of a commercial building in Tampico, Illinois on February 6, 1911, to Jack Reagan and Nelle (Wilson) Reagan. Reagan's father was a salesman and a storyteller, the grandson of Irish Catholic immigrants from County Tipperary,Terry Golway, Ronald Reagan's America (2008) p. 1 while his mother had Scots and English ancestors.Kengor, p. 4 Reagan had one sibling, his older brother, Neil
(1908–1996), who became an advertising executive.[tpl]Cite news|title=Neil Reagan, 88, Ad Executive And Jovial Brother of President|author=Lynette Holloway|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/13/us/neil-reagan-88-ad-executive-and-jovial-brother-of-president.html|work=The New York Times|date=December 13, 1996|accessdate=March 22, 2009[/tpl] As a boy, Reagan's father nicknamed his son "Dutch", due to his "fat little Dutchman"-like appearance, and his "Dutchboy" haircut;[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/reference/facts.html|title=Ronald Reagan Facts|accessdate=June 9, 2007|publisher=Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation[/tpl] the nickname stuck with him throughout his youth.

According to Paul Kengor, author of God and Ronald Reagan, Reagan had a particularly strong faith in the goodness of people, which stemmed from the optimistic faith of his mother, Nelle,Kengor, p. 16 and the Disciples of Christ faith, which he was baptized into in 1922.[tpl]cite book|editors=Lewis, Warren and Rollmann, Hans|title=Restoring the First-century Church in the Twenty-first Century|publisher=Wipf and Stock|year=2005|isbn=1-59752-416-6|pages=181–192[/tpl] For the time, Reagan was unusual in his opposition to racial discrimination, and recalled a time in Dixon when the local inn would not allow black people to stay there. Reagan brought them back to his house, where his mother invited them to stay the night and have breakfast the next morning.Kengor, p. 15
Following the closure of the Pitney Store in late 1920, the Reagans moved to Dixon;Cannon (2001), p. 2 the midwestern "small universe" had a lasting impression on Reagan.Reagan (1990), p. 27 He attended Dixon High School,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2007/spring/schoolhouse.html|title=School House to White House: The Education of the Presidents|accessdate=December 30, 2007|publisher=National Archives and Records Administration[/tpl] where he developed interests in acting, sports, and storytelling. His first job was as a lifeguard at the Rock River in Lowell Park, near Dixon, in 1927. Over a six-year period, Reagan reportedly performed 77 rescues as a lifeguard, notching a mark on a wooden log for each one."Ronald Reagan (1911–2004): Small town to tinseltown". CNN, 2004. Retrieved August 15, 2007.

He developed a reputation as a jack of all trades, excelling in campus politics, sports and theater. He was a member of the football team,  captain of the swim team and was elected student body president. As student president, Reagan led a student revolt against the college president after he tried to cut back the faculty.Cannon (2003), p. 25; Reagan (1990) p. 48

==Entertainment career==

===Radio and film===

After graduating from Eureka in 1932, Reagan drove himself to Iowa, where he auditioned for a job at many small-town radio stations. The University of Iowa hired him to broadcast home football games for the Hawkeyes. He was paid $10 per game. Soon after, a staff announcer's job opened at radio station WOC in Davenport, and Reagan was hired, now earning $100 per month. Aided by his persuasive voice, he moved to WHO radio in Des Moines as an announcer for Chicago Cubs baseball games.Wills, pp. 109–110 His specialty was creating play-by-play accounts of games using as his source only basic descriptions that the station received by wire as the games were in progress.
While traveling with the Cubs in California, Reagan took a screen test in 1937 that led to a seven-year contract with Warner Brothers studios.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.reaganfoundation.org/reagan/biography/a_hero.asp|title=Biography > A Hero from the Heartland|accessdate=December 30, 2007|publisher=Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031092212/http://www.reaganfoundation.org/reagan/biography/a_hero.asp|archivedate=October 31, 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl] He spent the first few years of his Hollywood career in the "B film" unit, where, Reagan joked, the producers "didn't want them good, they wanted them Thursday". While sometimes overshadowed by other actors, Reagan's screen performances did receive many good reviews.
His first screen credit was the starring role in the 1937 movie Love Is on the Air, and by the end of 1939 he had already appeared in 19 films,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.reaganfoundation.org/reagan/biography/hollywood_years.asp|title=Ronald Reagan > Hollywood Years|publisher=Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation|accessdate=March 28, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312120428/http://www.reaganfoundation.org/reagan/biography/hollywood_years.asp|archivedate=March 12, 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl] including Dark Victory with Bette Davis and Humphrey Bogart. Before the film Santa Fe Trail with Errol Flynn in 1940, he played the role of George "The Gipper" Gipp in the film Knute Rockne, All American; from it, he acquired the lifelong nickname "the Gipper".Cannon (2001), p. 15 In 1941 exhibitors voted him the fifth most popular star from the younger generation in Hollywood.[tpl]cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article8208562|title=CUPID'S INFLUENCE ON THE FILM BOX-OFFICE.|newspaper=The Argus (Melbourne, Vic. : 1848 - 1956)|location=Melbourne, Vic.|date=October 4, 1941|accessdate=April 24, 2012|page=7 Supplement: The Argus Week-end Magazine|publisher=National Library of Australia[/tpl]

In the post-war era, after being separated from almost four years of World War II stateside service with the 1st Motion Picture Unit in December 1945, Reagan co-starred in such films as, The Voice of the Turtle, John Loves Mary, The Hasty Heart, Bedtime for Bonzo, Cattle Queen of Montana, Tennessee's Partner, Hellcats of the Navy and The Killers (his final film and the only one in which he played a villain) in a 1964 remake.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001654/|title=Ronald Reagan|accessdate=December 30, 2007|publisher=Internet Movie Database[/tpl] Throughout his film career, his mother often answered much of his fan mail.Skinner, et al. (2003), p. 836

===Military service===

After completing fourteen home-study Army Extension Courses, Reagan enlisted in the Army Enlisted Reserve on April 29, 1937, as a private assigned to Troop B, 322nd Cavalry at Des Moines, Iowa. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Officers Reserve Corps of the cavalry on May 25, 1937.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.irwin.army.mil/Units/11TH+Armored+Cavalry+Regiment/11thACR/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701172746/http://www.irwin.army.mil/Units/11TH+Armored+Cavalry+Regiment/11thACR/|archivedate=July 1, 2007|publisher=11th Armored Cavalry Regiment|title=History of the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment|accessdate=November 10, 2008[/tpl]
Reagan was ordered to active duty for the first time on April 18, 1942. Due to his nearsightedness, he was classified for limited service only, which excluded him from serving overseas.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.reagan.navy.mil/about_reagan.html|title=USS Ronald Reagan: Ronald Reagan|publisher=United States Navy|accessdate=March 7, 2007|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20071030073032/http://www.reagan.navy.mil/about_reagan.html|archivedate =October 30, 2007[/tpl] His first assignment was at the San Francisco Port of Embarkation at Fort Mason, California, as a liaison officer of the Port and Transportation Office. Upon the approval of the Army Air Force (AAF), he applied for a transfer from the cavalry to the AAF on May 15, 1942, and was assigned to AAF Public Relations and subsequently to the First Motion Picture Unit (officially, the "18th Army Air Force Base Unit") in Culver City, California.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=1660|title=President Ronald Reagan|accessdate=December 30, 2007|publisher=National Museum of the United States Air Force[/tpl] On January 14, 1943, he was promoted to first lieutenant and was sent to the Provisional Task Force Show Unit of This Is The Army at Burbank, California. He returned to the First Motion Picture Unit after completing this duty and was promoted to captain on July 22, 1943.
In January 1944, Reagan was ordered to temporary duty in New York City to participate in the opening of the Sixth War Loan Drive. He was re-assigned to the First Motion Picture Unit on November 14, 1944, where he remained until the end of World War II. He was recommended for promotion to major on February 2, 1945, but this recommendation was disapproved on July 17 of that year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tampicohistoricalsociety.citymax.com/Ronald_Reagan_History_Tampico.html|title=Ronald Reagan 1911–2004|publisher=Tampico, Illinois Historical Society|accessdate=December 30, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060516085221/http://www.tampicohistoricalsociety.citymax.com/Ronald_Reagan_History_Tampico.html|archivedate=May 16, 2006[/tpl] While with the First Motion Picture Unit in 1945, he was indirectly involved in discovering actress Marilyn Monroe.[tpl]cite news|author=Hurlburt, Roger |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1991-01-06/news/9101010832_1_marilyn-monroe-david-conover-early-photographs |title=Monroe An Exhibit Of The Early Days Of Marilyn Monroe - Before She Became A Legend - Brings The Star's History In Focus. |work= Sun-Sentinel |location=Fort Lauderdale, FL|date=January 6, 1991 |accessdate=November 19, 2012[/tpl] He returned to Fort MacArthur, California, where he was separated from active duty on December 9, 1945.

Reagan never left the United States during the war, though he kept a film reel, obtained while in the service, depicting the liberation of Auschwitz, as he believed that someday doubts would arise as to whether the Holocaust had occurred.Cannon, Lou (1991), pp.486–90 It has been alleged that he was overheard telling Israeli foreign minister Yitzhak Shamir in 1983 that he had filmed that footage himself and helped liberate Auschwitz,Schaller, M., Reckoning with Reagan, New York: Oxford University Press, 1992, p.9 though this purported conversation was disputed by Secretary of State George Shultz.Shultz, George (1993), p. 550

===SAG president===

Reagan was first elected to the Board of Directors of the Screen Actors Guild in 1941, serving as an alternate. Following World War II, he resumed service and became 3rd vice-president in 1946.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sag.org/history/presidents/reagan.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228063556/http://www.sag.org/history/presidents/reagan.html|archivedate=December 28, 2007|title=Screen Actors Guild Presidents: Ronald Reagan|publisher=Screen Actors Guild|accessdate=November 10, 2008[/tpl] The adoption of conflict-of-interest bylaws in 1947 led the SAG president and six board members to resign; Reagan was nominated in a special election for the position of president and subsequently elected. He was subsequently chosen by the membership to serve seven additional one-year terms, from 1947 to 1952 and in 1959. Reagan led SAG through eventful years that were marked by labor-management disputes, the Taft-Hartley Act, House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) hearings and the Hollywood blacklist era.

====Secret FBI informant in Hollywood====

During the late 1940s, Reagan and his wife provided the FBI with names of actors  within the motion picture industry whom they believed to be communist sympathizers, though he expressed reservations; he said "Do they expect us to constitute ourselves as a little FBI of our own and determine just who is a Commie and who isn't?".[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,142352,00.html|title=American Notes Hollywood|work=Time|accessdate=April 21, 2009|date=September 9, 1985[/tpl]
Reagan testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee on the subject as well.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.twcnet.edu/cschutz/history-page/Consensus/Reagan-huac-testimony.html|accessdate=December 30, 2007|title=House Un-American Activities Committee Testimony: Ronald Reagan|publisher=Tennessee Wesleyan College|date=October 23, 1947|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215050331/http://www.twcnet.edu/cschutz/history-page/Consensus/Reagan-huac-testimony.html |archivedate=December 15, 2007[/tpl] A fervent anti-communist, he reaffirmed his commitment to democratic principles, stating, "I never as a citizen want to see our country become urged, by either fear or resentment of this group, that we ever compromise with any of our democratic principles through that fear or resentment."

===Television===

Though an early critic of television, Reagan landed fewer film roles in the late 1950s and decided to join the medium. He was hired as the host of General Electric Theater, a series of weekly dramas that became very popular. His contract required him to tour GE plants sixteen weeks out of the year, often demanding of him fourteen speeches per day. He earned approximately $125,000 per year (about $1.07 million in 2010 dollars) in this role. His final work as a professional actor was as host and performer from 1964 to 1965 on the television series Death Valley Days.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/death-valley-days/cast/200859 |title=Death Valley Days |publisher= CBS Interactive Inc. |accessdate=August 25, 2013[/tpl] Reagan and Nancy Davis appeared together several times, including an episode of General Electric Theater in 1958 called "A Turkey for the President".Reagan, American Icon.

She had been mistaken for another Nancy Davis. She described their meeting by saying, "I don't know if it was exactly love at first sight, but it was pretty close." They were engaged at Chasen's restaurant in Los Angeles and were married on March 4, 1952, at the Little Brown Church in the San Fernando Valley.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/history/firstladies/nr40.html|title=Nancy Davis Reagan|accessdate=January 13, 2008|publisher=The White House[/tpl] Actor William Holden served as best man at the ceremony.

Observers described the Reagans' relationship as close, authentic and intimate.Beschloss, p. 296 During his presidency they were reported to frequently display their affection for one another; one press secretary said, "They never took each other for granted. They never stopped courting."

Reagan began his political career as a Democrat and, in December 1945, was prevented from leading an anti-nuclear rally in Holly­wood by pressure from the Warner Bros. studio. He would later make nuclear weapons a key point of his presidency, specifically his opposition to mutually assured destruction, building on previous efforts to limit the spread of nuclear weapons to a new focus to reduce the numbers and types of them.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/research/lecture/president-reagans-legacy-and-us-nuclear-weapons-policy |title=President Reagan's Legacy and U.S. Nuclear Weapons Policy. |publisher=Heritage.org |date=2006-07-20 |accessdate=2014-04-14[/tpl] In the 1948 election, Reagan strongly supported Harry S. Truman, appearing on stage with him during a campaign speech in Los Angeles.McCullough, David. Truman. Simon & Schuster, 1992, p. 665. ISBN 0671456547.

Boulware, known for his tough stance against unions and his innovative strategies to win over workers, championed the core tenets of modern American conservatism: free markets, anticommunism, lower taxes, and limited government.Thomas W. Evans, The Education of Ronald Reagan: The General Electric Years and the Untold Story of His Conversion to Conservatism (2008). Eventually, the ratings for Reagan's show fell off and GE dropped Reagan in 1962.Cannon (2003), p. 113. In August of that year, Reagan formally switched to the Republican Party, stating, "I didn't leave the Democratic Party. The party left me".Hayward, p. 635.
In the early 1960s Reagan opposed certain civil rights legislation, saying that "if an individual wants to discriminate against Negroes or others in selling or renting his house, it is his right to do so."Longley, Kyle. Deconstructing Reagan: conservative mythology and America's fortieth president, M.E. Sharpe, 2007 ISBN 0-7656-1590-8 p. 76. In his rationale, he cited his opposition to government intrusion into personal freedoms, as opposed to racism; he strongly denied having racist motives and later reversed his opposition to voting rights and fair housing laws.News Hour with Jim Lehrer: Historians reflect on former President Ronald Reagan's legacy in U.S. politics, News Hour with Jim Lehrer: Historians reflect on former President Ronald Reagan's legacy, June 7, 2004 – Roger Wilkins commented on Reagan's Jefferson Davis remark. Wilkins also said the following: "I had one extraordinary conversation with him in which he called me to tell me he wasn't a racist because I had attacked his South Africa policy in a newspaper column and he was very disturbed by the implication that this had any... he spent 30 minutes on the telephone trying to convince me about it, and talked about how he had played football with black guys in high school and college in order to try to make that point." When legislation that would become Medicare was introduced in 1961, Reagan created a recording for the American Medical Association warning that such legislation would mean the end of freedom in America. Reagan said that if his listeners did not write letters to prevent it, "we will awake to find that we have socialism. And if you don't do this, and if I don't do it, one of these days, you and I are going to spend our sunset years telling our children, and our children's children, what it once was like in America when men were free."[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRdLpem-AAs|title=Ronald Reagan Speaks Out Against Socialized Medicine|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=March 8, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=JohnL|url=http://texasbestgrok.mu.nu/archives/038360.php|title=Operation Coffee Cup|publisher=TexasBestGrok|date=July 23, 2004|accessdate=March 8, 2010[/tpl]Richard Rapaport, June 21, 2009, How AMA 'Coffeecup' gave Reagan a boost.

Reagan endorsed the campaign of conservative presidential contender Barry Goldwater in 1964. Speaking for Goldwater, Reagan stressed his belief in the importance of smaller government. He revealed his ideological motivation in a famed speech delivered on October 27, 1964: "The Founding Fathers knew a government can't control the economy without controlling people. And they knew when a government sets out to do that, it must use force and coercion to achieve its purpose. So we have come to a time for choosing."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/presidents/40_reagan/psources/ps_choose64.html|title=A Time for Choosing|publisher=PBS|accessdate=April 17, 2007[/tpl] He also said, "You and I are told we must choose between a left or right, but I suggest there is no such thing as a left or right. There is only an up or down. Up to man's age-old dream – the maximum of individual freedom consistent with order – or down to the ant heap of totalitarianism."Richard A. Harris, Daniel J. Tichenor. A History of the U.S. Political System: Ideas, Interests, and Institutions, Volume 1. Santa Barbara, California, USA: ABC-CLIO, 2009. Pp. 384. This "A Time for Choosing" speech, which later became known as "The Speech", raised $1 million for Goldwater's campaign and is considered the event that launched Reagan's political career.Cannon (2001), p. 36.

==Governor of California, 1967–1975==

California Republicans were impressed with Reagan's political views and charisma after his "Time for Choosing" speech,[tpl]cite web|url=http://governors.library.ca.gov/33-Reagan.html|title=The Governors' Gallery – Ronald Reagan|publisher=California State Library|accessdate=March 21, 2007[/tpl] he announced in late 1965, his campaign for Governor of California in 1966. He defeated former San Francisco mayor George Christopher in the GOP primary. In Reagan's campaign, he emphasized two main themes: "to send the welfare bums back to work", and, in reference to burgeoning anti-war and anti-establishment student protests at the University of California at Berkeley, "to clean up the mess at Berkeley".[tpl]cite news|author=Kahn, Jeffery|publisher=UC Berkeley News|date=June 8, 2004|title=Ronald Reagan launched political career using the Berkeley campus as a target|accessdate=March 30, 2007|url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2004/06/08_reagan.shtml[/tpl] Ronald Reagan accomplished in 1966, what US Senator William F. Knowland in 1958 and former Vice-President Richard M. Nixon in 1962 had tried; He was elected, defeating two-term governor Edmund G. "Pat" Brown, and was sworn in on January 2, 1967. In his first term, he froze government hiring and approved tax hikes to balance the budget.Cannon (2001), p. 47.
Shortly after the beginning of his term, Reagan tested the presidential waters in 1968 as part of a "Stop Nixon" movement, hoping to cut into Nixon's Southern support*[tpl]cite book|author=Fischer, Klaus|title=America in White, Black, and Gray: The Stormy 1960s|year=2006|publisher=Continuum|isbn=0-8264-1816-3|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=sCXig_6abwkC&pg=PA241|pages=241–243[/tpl] and be a compromise candidate[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,899963,00.html|title=The New Rules of Play|work=Time|date=March 8, 1968|accessdate=October 16, 2007[/tpl] if neither Nixon nor second-place Nelson Rockefeller received enough delegates to win on the first ballot at the Republican convention. However, by the time of the convention Nixon had 692 delegate votes, 25 more than he needed to secure the nomination, followed by Rockefeller with Reagan in third place.
Reagan was involved in high-profile conflicts with the protest movements of the era. On May 15, 1969, during the People's Park protests at UC Berkeley, Reagan sent the California Highway Patrol and other officers to quell the protests, in an incident that became known as "Bloody Thursday", resulting in the death of student James Rector and the blinding of carpenter Alan Blanchard.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,904149,00.html|accessdate=December 9, 2007|date=February 16, 1970|title=Postscript to People's Park|work=Time[/tpl] Reagan then called out 2,200 state National Guard troops to occupy the city of Berkeley for two weeks to crack down on the protesters.Cannon, Lou (2001), p. 50. A year after "Bloody Thursday", Reagan responded to questions about campus protest movements saying, "If it takes a bloodbath, let's get it over with. No more appeasement."Cannon, Lou (2003), p. 295. When the Symbionese Liberation Army kidnapped Patty Hearst in Berkeley and demanded the distribution of food to the poor, Reagan joked to a group of political aides about a botulism outbreak contaminating the food.Reagan's botulism joke is variously reported as "sometimes you wonder whether there shouldn't be an outbreak of botulism" (Sarasota Journal, March 7, 1974, p.15A) and "It's just too bad we can't have an epidemic of botulism" (Los Angeles Times, March 14, 1974, "Reagan Raps Press on Botulism Quote".) Conversely, in that one afternoon, "Bloody Thursday", 111 police officers were injured, including one C.H.P. officer who was knifed in the chest. After calling in the National Guard, the Guard remained in Berkeley for 17 days, camping in People's Park, and demonstrations subsided as the University removed cordoned-off fencing and placed all development plans for People's Park on hold.[tpl]cite news|url=http://police.berkeley.edu/about_UCPD/ucpdhistory.html#anchor178048|accessdate=|date=August 2006|title=A Brief History of UCPD: Berkeley, History Topic: People's Park|work=http://police.berkeley.edu/[/tpl]
Early in 1967, the national debate on abortion was beginning. Democratic California state senator Anthony Beilenson introduced the "Therapeutic Abortion Act", in an effort to reduce the number of "back-room abortions" performed in California. The State Legislature sent the bill to Reagan's desk where, after many days of indecision, he signed it.Cannon (2001), p. 51 About two million abortions would be performed as a result, most because of a provision in the bill allowing abortions for the well-being of the mother. Reagan had been in office for only four months when he signed the bill, and stated that had he been more experienced as governor, it would not have been signed.[tpl]clarify|date=March 2014[/tpl] After he recognized what he called the "consequences" of the bill, he announced that he was pro-life. He maintained that position later in his political career, writing extensively about abortion.Reagan, Ronald. (1984) Abortion and the conscience of the nation. Nashville: T. Nelson. ISBN 0-8407-4116-2
Despite an unsuccessful attempt to recall him in 1968,Recall Idea Got Its Start in L.A. in 1898, Los Angeles Times, July 13, 2003 Reagan was re-elected in 1970, defeating "Big Daddy" Jesse Unruh. He chose not to seek a third term in the following election cycle. One of Reagan's greatest frustrations in office concerned capital punishment, which he strongly supported. His efforts to enforce the state's laws in this area were thwarted when the Supreme Court of California issued its People v. Anderson decision, which invalidated all death sentences issued in California prior to 1972, though the decision was later overturned by a constitutional amendment. The only execution during Reagan's governorship was on April 12, 1967, when Aaron Mitchell's sentence was carried out by the state in San Quentin's gas chamber.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Seneker, Carl J|title=Governor Reagan and Executive Clemency|journal=California Law Review|volume=55|issue=2|pages=412–418|date=May 1967|doi=10.2307/3479351|jstor=3479351[/tpl]
In 1969, Reagan, as Governor, signed the Family Law Act which was the first no-fault divorce legislation in the United States.1969 Cal. Stats. chapter 1608, page 3313
Reagan's terms as governor helped to shape the policies he would pursue in his later political career as president. By campaigning on a platform of sending "the welfare bums back to work", he spoke out against the idea of the welfare state. He also strongly advocated the Republican ideal of less government regulation of the economy, including that of undue federal taxation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/publication/7092/reagan_economic_legacy.html|title=The Reagan Economic Legacy|accessdate=August 22, 2007|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations|date=June 9, 2004|author=Kubarych, Roger M[/tpl]
Reagan did not seek re-election to a third term as governor in 1974 and was succeeded by Democratic California Secretary of State Jerry Brown on January 6, 1975.

==1976 presidential campaign==

In 1976, Reagan challenged incumbent President Gerald Ford in a bid to become the Republican Party's candidate for president. Reagan soon established himself as the conservative candidate with the support of like-minded organizations such as the American Conservative Union which became key components of his political base, while President Ford was considered a more moderate Republican.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/history/presidents/gf38.html|title=Biography of Gerald R. Ford|publisher=The White House|accessdate=March 29, 2007[/tpl] Ford considered himself a "a moderate in domestic affairs, a conservative in fiscal affairs, and a dyed-in-the-wool internationalist in foreign affairs".
Reagan's campaign relied on a strategy crafted by campaign manager John Sears of winning a few primaries early to damage the inevitability of Ford's likely nomination. Reagan won North Carolina, Texas, and California, but the strategy failed, as[tpl]Cite news|date=September 24, 1979|accessdate=May 10, 2008|title=Candidate Reagan is Born Again|work=Time|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,947391-2,00.html[/tpl] he ended up losing New Hampshire, Florida, and his native Illinois.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.politicallibrary.org/TallState/1976rep.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061006023552/http://www.politicallibrary.org/TallState/1976rep.html|archivedate=October 6, 2006|title=1976 New Hampshire presidential Primary, February 24, 1976 Republican Results|publisher=New Hampshire Political Library|accessdate=November 10, 2008[/tpl] The Texas campaign lent renewed hope to Reagan, when he swept all ninety-six delegates chosen in the May 1 primary, with four more awaiting at the state convention. Much of the credit for that victory came from the work of three co-chairmen, including Ernest Angelo, the mayor of Midland, and Ray Barnhart of Houston, whom President Reagan would appoint in 1981 as director of the Federal Highway Administration.[tpl]cite journal|author=Hathorn Billy|year =2010|title =Mayor Ernest Angelo, Jr., of Midland and the 96–0 Reagan Sweep of Texas, May 1, 1976|journal=West Texas Historical Association Yearbook|volume =86|pages =77–91 [/tpl]
However, as the GOP convention neared, Ford appeared close to victory. Acknowledging his party's moderate wing, Reagan chose moderate Senator Richard Schweiker of Pennsylvania as his running mate if nominated. Nonetheless, Ford prevailed with 1,187 delegates to Reagan's 1,070. Ford would go on to lose the 1976 Presidential election to the Democrat Jimmy Carter.
Reagan's concession speech emphasized the dangers of nuclear war and the threat posed by the Soviet Union. Though he lost the nomination, he received 307 write-in votes in New Hampshire, 388 votes as an Independent on Wyoming's ballot, and a single electoral vote from a faithless elector in the November election from the state of Washington,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/scores.html#1976|title=Electoral College Box Scores 1789–1996|accessdate=April 30, 2007|publisher=U.S. National Archives and Records Admin.[/tpl] which Ford had won over Democratic challenger Jimmy Carter.
Following the campaign, Reagan remained in the public debate with the Ronald Reagan Radio Commentary serieshttp://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/tf7c6005hf/ and his political action committee, Citizens for the Republic, which was later revived in Alexandria, Virginia in 2009 by the Reagan biographer Craig Shirley.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cftr.org/about/default.aspx|title=Citizens for the Republic: Who We Are|publisher=cftr.org|accessdate=September 19, 2013[/tpl]

Reagan launched his campaign by declaring "I believe in states' rights."  After receiving the Republican nomination, Reagan selected one of his primary opponents, George H.W. Bush, to be his running mate. His showing in the October televised debate boosted his campaign. Reagan won the election, carrying 44 states with 489 electoral votes to 49 electoral votes for Carter (representing six states and Washington, D.C.).

His opposition to the initiative was instrumental in its landslide defeat by Californian voters.

During Reagan's administration, the unemployment rate declined from 7.5% to 5.4%, with the rate reaching highs of 10.8% in 1982 and 10.4% in 1983, averaging 7.5% over the eight years, and GDP growth average 7.9% with a high of 12.2% growth in 1982.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/cps/prev_yrs.htm|title=Employment status of the civilian noninstitutional population 16 years and over, 1940 to date|publisher=United States Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=December 6, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000000|title=Labor Force Statistics from the Current Population Survey|publisher=Data.bls.gov|date=August 17, 2011|accessdate=October 4, 2012[/tpl]

Citing the economic theories of Arthur Laffer, Reagan promoted the proposed tax cuts as potentially stimulating the economy enough to expand the tax base, offsetting the revenue loss due to reduced rates of taxation, a theory that entered political discussion as the Laffer curve. Reaganomics was the subject of debate with supporters pointing to improvements in certain key economic indicators as evidence of success, and critics pointing to large increases in federal budget deficits and the national debt. His policy of "peace through strength" resulted in a record peacetime defense buildup including a 40% real increase in defense spending between 1981 and 1985.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Bartels, Larry M.|title=Constituency Opinion and Congressional Policy Making: The Reagan Defense Build Up|journal=The American Political Science Review|date=June 1, 1991|volume=85|issue=2|pages=457–474|doi=10.2307/1963169|issn=0003-0554|first=L.

Then, in 1982 the Job Training Partnership Act of 1982 was signed into law, initiating one of the United States' first public-private partnerships and a major part of the president's job creation program. Reagan's Assistant Secretary of Labor and Chief of Staff, Al Angrisani, was a primary architect of the bill. The Tax Reform Act of 1986, another bipartisan effort championed by Reagan, further reduced the top rate  to 28%, raised the bottom bracket from 11% to 15%, and, cut the number of tax brackets to 4.
Conversely, Congress passed and Reagan signed into law tax increases of some nature in every year from 1981 to 1987 to continue funding such government programs as Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA), Social Security, and the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 (DEFRA).Bruce Bartlett on Tax Increases & Reagan on NRO Financial.

During Reagan's presidency, a program was initiated within the U.S. intelligence community to ensure America's economic strength. The program, Project Socrates, developed and demonstrated the means required for the United States to generate and lead the next evolutionary leap in technology acquisition and utilization for a competitive advantage—automated innovation. To ensure that the United States acquired the maximum benefit from automated innovation, Reagan, during his second term, had an executive order drafted to create a new federal agency to implement the Project Socrates results on a nation-wide basis. However, Reagan's term came to end before the executive order could be coordinated and signed, and the incoming Bush administration, labeling Project Socrates as "industrial policy", had it terminated.[tpl]cite news|first =Gene|last =Koprowski|title =Tech Intelligence Revival?

====Operation Urgent Fury (Grenada), 1983====

On October 25, 1983, Reagan ordered U.S. forces to invade Grenada, code named Operation Urgent Fury, where a 1979 coup d'état had established an independent non-aligned Marxist-Leninist government. A formal appeal from the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) led to the intervention of U.S. forces; President Reagan also cited an allegedly regional threat posed by a Soviet-Cuban military build-up in the Caribbean and concern for the safety of several hundred American medical students at St. George's University as adequate reasons to invade. Operation Urgent Fury was the first major military operation conducted by U.S. forces since the Vietnam War, several days of fighting commenced, resulting in a U.S. victory,[tpl]cite web|publisher=Defense Technical Information Center|url=http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/history/urgfury.pdf|format=PDF|title=Operation Agent Fury|accessdate=March 9, 2007|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070605104546/http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/history/urgfury.pdf|archivedate =June 5, 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl] with 19 American fatalities and 116 wounded American soldiers.[tpl]cite web|author=Cooper, Tom|url=http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/article_159.shtml|title=Grenada, 1983: Operation 'Urgent Fury'|date=September 1, 2003|accessdate=April 8, 2007|publisher=Air Combat Information Group[/tpl] In mid-December, after a new government was appointed by the Governor-General, U.S. forces withdrew.

====1984 presidential campaign====

Reagan accepted the Republican nomination in Dallas, Texas. He proclaimed that it was "morning again in America", regarding the recovering economy and the dominating performance by the U.S. athletes at the 1984 Summer Olympics, among other things. He became the first American president to open an Olympic Games held in the United States.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sok.se/inenglish/losangeles1984.4.18ea16851076df63622800011008.html|title=Los Angeles 1984|publisher=Swedish Olympic Committee|accessdate=March 7, 2007[/tpl]
Reagan's opponent in the 1984 presidential election was former Vice President Walter Mondale. With questions about Reagan's age, and a weak performance in the first presidential debate, his ability to perform the duties of president for another term was questioned. His apparent confused and forgetful behavior was evident to his supporters; they had previously known him clever and witty. Rumors began to circulate that he had Alzheimer's disease.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/flashback/editors200410040912.asp|title=The Debate: Mondale vs. Reagan|work=National Review|date=October 4, 2004|accessdate=May 25, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070416191912/http://www.nationalreview.com/flashback/editors200410040912.asp |archivedate=April 16, 2007[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/debatingourdestiny/newshour/84_1stprez-analysis.html|title=Reaction to first Mondale/Reagan debate|publisher=PBS|date=October 8, 1984|accessdate=December 31, 2007[/tpl] Reagan rebounded in the second debate, and confronted questions about his age, quipping, "I will not make age an issue of this campaign.

===Second term, 1985–1989===

Reagan was sworn in as president for the second time on January 20, 1985, in a private ceremony at the White House. Because January 20 fell on a Sunday, a public celebration was not held but took place in the Capitol Rotunda the following day. January 21 was one of the coldest days on record in Washington, D.C.; due to poor weather, inaugural celebrations were held inside the Capitol. In the coming weeks he shook up his staff somewhat, moving White House Chief of Staff James Baker to Secretary of the Treasury and naming Treasury Secretary Donald Regan, a former Merrill Lynch officer, Chief of Staff.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/05/us/briefing-186924.html|title=Phil Gailey and Warren Weaver, Jr., "Briefing"|work=The New York Times |accessdate=January 27, 2011|date=June 5, 1982[/tpl]
In 1985, Reagan visited a German military cemetery in Bitburg to lay a wreath with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. It was determined that the cemetery held the graves of forty-nine members of the Waffen-SS. Reagan issued a statement that called the Nazi soldiers buried in that cemetery as themselves "victims", a designation which ignited a stir over whether Reagan had equated the SS men to victims of the Holocaust; Pat Buchanan, Reagan's Director of Communications, argued that the president did not equate the SS members with the actual Holocaust.[tpl]cite web|author=Buchanan, Pat|authorlink =Pat Buchanan|url=http://www.buchanan.org/pma-99-1105-wallstjl.html|title=Pat Buchanan's Response to Norman Podhoretz's OP-ED|publisher=The Internet Brigade|year=1999|accessdate=September 3, 2007|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070927193354/http://www.buchanan.org/pma-99-1105-wallstjl.html|archivedate =September 27, 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl] Now strongly urged to cancel the visit,Reeves, p. 249 the president responded that it would be wrong to back down on a promise he had made to Chancellor Kohl.

====War on Drugs====

Reagan announced a War on Drugs in 1982, following concerns about the increasing crack epidemic.

====Libya bombing====

Relations between Libya and the United States under President Reagan were continually contentious, beginning with the Gulf of Sidra incident in 1981; by 1982, Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi was considered by the CIA to be, along with USSR leader Leonid Brezhnev and Cuban leader Fidel Castro, part of a group known as the "unholy trinity" and was also labeled as "our international public enemy number one" by a CIA official.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,925697,00.htm | title= Libya: Fury in the Isolation Ward|work=Time|date=August 23, 1982|accessdate=August 12, 2011[/tpl] These tensions were later revived in early April 1986, when a bomb exploded in a Berlin discothèque, resulting in the injury of 63 American military personnel and death of one serviceman. Stating that there was "irrefutable proof" that Libya had directed the "terrorist bombing", Reagan authorized the use of force against the country. In the late evening of April 15, 1986, the United States launched a series of air strikes on ground targets in Libya.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/el_dorado_canyon.htm|title=Operation El Dorado Canyon|publisher=GlobalSecurity.org|date=April 25, 2005|accessdate=April 19, 2008[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/15/newsid_3975000/3975455.stm|title=1986:US Launches air-strike on Libya|accessdate=April 19, 2008|date=April 15, 2008|publisher=BBC News [/tpl] The UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher allowed the U.S. Air Force to use Britain's air bases to launch the attack, on the justification that the UK was supporting America's right to self-defense under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. The attack was designed to halt Gaddafi's "ability to export terrorism", offering him "incentives and reasons to alter his criminal behavior". The president addressed the nation from the Oval Office after the attacks had commenced, stating, "When our citizens are attacked or abused anywhere in the world on the direct orders of hostile regimes, we will respond so long as I'm in this office". The attack was condemned by many countries. By a vote of 79 in favor to 28 against with 33 abstentions, the United Nations General Assembly adopted resolution 41/38 which "condemns the military attack perpetrated against the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya on April 15, 1986, which constitutes a violation of the Charter of the United Nations and of international law".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/41/a41r038.htm |title=A/RES/41/38 November 20, 1986 |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-14[/tpl]

====Immigration====

Reagan signed the Immigration Reform and Control Act in 1986. The act made it illegal to knowingly hire or recruit illegal immigrants, required employers to attest to their employees' immigration status, and granted amnesty to approximately three million illegal immigrants who entered the United States prior to January 1, 1982, and had lived in the country continuously. Critics argue that the employer sanctions were without teeth and failed to stem illegal immigration.[tpl]Cite news|author=Graham, Otis|date=January 27, 2003|url=http://www.otisgraham.com/otis_graham_writings/art_ronald_reagans_big_mistake.html|title=Ronald Reagan's Big Mistake|work=The American Conservative|accessdate=August 15, 2007[/tpl] Upon signing the act at a ceremony held beside the newly refurbished Statue of Liberty, Reagan said, "The legalization provisions in this act will go far to improve the lives of a class of individuals who now must hide in the shadows, without access to many of the benefits of a free and open society. Very soon many of these men and women will be able to step into the sunlight and, ultimately, if they choose, they may become Americans".Reagan, Ronald. (November 6, 1986) Statement on Signing the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. Collected Speeches, Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. Retrieved August 15, 2007. Reagan also said, "The employer sanctions program is the keystone and major element. It will remove the incentive for illegal immigration by eliminating the job opportunities which draw illegal aliens here".

====Iran–Contra affair====

President Reagan professed ignorance of the plot's existence. He appointed two Republicans and one Democrat (John Tower, Brent Scowcroft and Edmund Muskie, known as the "Tower Commission") to investigate the scandal. The commission could not find direct evidence that Reagan had prior knowledge of the program, but criticized him heavily for his disengagement from managing his staff, making the diversion of funds possible.[tpl]Cite news|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/213195.stm|title=Reagan's mixed White House legacy|accessdate=August 19, 2007|date=June 6, 2004[/tpl] A separate report by Congress concluded that "If the president did not know what his national security advisers were doing, he should have".

Reagan recognized the change in the direction of the Soviet leadership with Mikhail Gorbachev, and shifted to diplomacy, with a view to encourage the Soviet leader to pursue substantial arms agreements.

During his 1980 campaign, Reagan pledged that, if given the opportunity, he would appoint the first female Supreme Court Justice.Reagan (1990), p. 280 That opportunity came in his first year in office when he nominated Sandra Day O'Connor to fill the vacancy created by the retirement of Justice Potter Stewart. In his second term, Reagan elevated William Rehnquist to succeed Warren Burger as Chief Justice, and named Antonin Scalia to fill the vacant seat. Reagan nominated conservative jurist Robert Bork to the high court in 1987. Senator Ted Kennedy, a Democrat of Massachusetts, strongly condemned Bork, and great controversy ensued.[tpl]Cite news|title=Washington; Kennedy And Bork|accessdate=April 28, 2008|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/05/opinion/washington-kennedy-and-bork.html|author=Reston, James|date=July 5, 1987|work=The New York Times[/tpl] Bork's nomination was rejected 58–42.[tpl]Cite news|author=Greenhouse, Linda|title=Bork's Nomination Is Rejected, 58–42; Reagan 'Saddened'|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/24/us/bork-s-nomination-is-rejected-58-42-reagan-saddened.html|work=The New York Times|date=October 24, 1987|accessdate=November 12, 2007[/tpl] Reagan then nominated Douglas Ginsburg, but Ginsburg withdrew his name from consideration after coming under fire for his cannabis use."Media Frenzies in Our Time", Special to The Washington Post Anthony Kennedy was eventually confirmed in his place.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.supremecourthistory.org/myweb/justice/kennedy.htm|title=Anthony M.

Early in his tenure, Reagan appointed Clarence M. Pendleton, Jr., of San Diego as the first African American to chair the United States Commission on Civil Rights. Pendleton tried to steer the commission into a conservative direction in line with Reagan's views on social and civil rights policy during his time as tenure from 1981 until his sudden death in 1988. Pendleton soon aroused the ire of many civil rights advocates and feminists when he ridiculed the comparable worth proposal as being "Looney Tunes".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uky.edu/Libraries/nkaa/record.php?note_id=1144|title=Pendleton, Clarence M., Jr.|work=Notable Kentucky African Americans Database|publisher=University of Kentucky|accessdate=March 19, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://articles.philly.com/1988-06-07/news/26265015_1_chairman-pendleton-clarence-m-pendleton-civil-rights|author=Gerald B.

In 1984, Reagan commuted the 18-year sentence of former Louisiana Commissioner of Agriculture and Forestry Gil Dozier, a Democrat from Baton Rouge, to the time served for violations of both the Hobbs and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations acts. On September 23, 1980, the United States District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana convicted Dozier of extortion and racketeering when he pushed companies doing business with his department to make campaign contributions on his behalf.[tpl]cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/707/862/230224/|title=707 F.2d 862: United States of America, Plaintiff-appellee, v.

===Alzheimer's disease===

====Announcement and reaction====

In August 1994, at the age of 83, Reagan was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, an incurable neurological disorder which destroys brain cells and ultimately causes death. In November he informed the nation through a handwritten letter,[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/06/us/in-poignant-public-letter-reagan-reveals-that-he-has-alzheimer-s.html?pagewanted=all|title=In Poignant Public Letter, Reagan Reveals That He Has Alzheimer's|date=November 6, 1994|accessdate=December 30, 2007|work=The New York Times|author=Gordon, Michael R[/tpl] writing in part:

Altman, a physician employed as a reporter for the New York Times, noted that "the line between mere forgetfulness and the beginning of Alzheimer's can be fuzzy", and all four of Reagan's White House doctors said that they saw no evidence of Alzheimer's while he was president. Dr. John E. Hutton, Reagan's primary physician from 1984 to 1989, said the president "absolutely" did not "show any signs of dementia or Alzheimer's". Reagan did experience occasional memory lapses, though, especially with names. Once, while meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, he repeatedly referred to Vice President Bush as "Prime Minister Bush".[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,951325-3,00.html|title=Questions of Age and Competence|work=Time|author=Thomas, Evan|date=October 22, 1984|accessdate=January 7, 2008|page=3[/tpl] Reagan's doctors, however, note that he only began exhibiting overt symptoms of the illness in late 1992[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/15/health/the-doctor-s-world-a-recollection-of-early-questions-about-reagan-s-health.html?pagewanted=all|work=The New York Times|title=The Doctors World; A Recollection of Early Questions About Reagan's Health|author=Altman, Lawrence K.|date=June 15, 2004|accessdate=January 7, 2008[/tpl] or 1993, several years after he had left office.

Complicating the picture, Reagan suffered an episode of head trauma in July 1989, five years prior to his diagnosis. After being thrown from a horse in Mexico, a subdural hematoma was found and surgically treated later in the year.Reagan, Nancy (2002), p. 179–180 Nancy Reagan, citing what doctors told her, asserts that her husband's 1989 fall hastened the onset of Alzheimer's disease, although acute brain injury has not been conclusively proven to accelerate Alzheimer's or dementia.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Van Den Heuvel C, Thornton E, Vink R|title=Traumatic brain injury and Alzheimer's disease: a review|journal=Progress in Brain Research|volume=161|pages=303–16|year=2007|pmid=17618986|doi=10.1016/S0079-6123(06)61021-2|series=Progress in Brain Research|isbn=978-0-444-53017-2[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal|author=Szczygielski J, Mautes A, Steudel WI, Falkai P, Bayer TA, Wirths O|title=Traumatic brain injury: cause or risk of Alzheimer's disease?

====Progression====

As the years went on, the disease slowly destroyed Reagan's mental capacity. He was only able to recognize a few people, including his wife, Nancy. He remained active, however; he took walks through parks near his home and on beaches, played golf regularly, and until 1999 he often went to his office in nearby Century City.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/05/us/reagan-s-twilight-a-special-report-a-president-fades-into-a-world-apart.html|title=Reagan's Twighlight– A special report; A President Fades Into a World Apart|accessdate=June 18, 2008|author=Altman, Lawrence K|date=October 5, 1997|work=The New York Times[/tpl]

==Legacy==

Since Reagan left office in 1989, substantial debate has occurred among scholars, historians, and the general public surrounding his legacy. Supporters have pointed to a more efficient and prosperous economy as a result of Reaganomics,Hayward, pp. 635–38 foreign policy triumphs including a peaceful end to the Cold War after Reagan's eight years in office,Beschloss, p. 324 and a restoration of American pride and morale. Critics contend that Reagan's economic policies resulted in huge budget deficits, a wider gap in wealth, and an increase in homelessnessDon't add Reagan's Face to Mount Rushmore by Dr. Peter Dreier, The Nation, April 3, 2011 and that the Iran-Contra affair lowered American credibility.[tpl]cite web|author=Gilman, Larry|url=http://www.espionageinfo.com/Int-Ke/Iran-Contra-Affair.html|title=Iran-Contra Affair|publisher=Advameg|accessdate=August 23, 2007[/tpl]
Opinions of Reagan's legacy among the country's leading policy makers and journalists differ as well. Edwin Feulner, President of The Heritage Foundation, said that Reagan "helped create a safer, freer world" and said of his economic policies: "He took an America suffering from 'malaise'... and made its citizens believe again in their destiny."[tpl]cite web|author=Feulner, Edwin J., PhD|url=http://www.heritage.org/Press/Commentary/ed060904b.cfm|title=The Legacy of Ronald Reagan|publisher=The Heritage Foundation|date=June 9, 2004|accessdate=August 23, 2007[/tpl] However, Mark Weisbrot, co-Director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, contended that Reagan's "economic policies were mostly a failure"[tpl]cite web|author=Weisbrot, Mark|url=http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0607-09.htm|title=Ronald Reagan's Legacy|publisher=Common Dreams News Center|date=June 7, 2004|accessdate=August 23, 2007[/tpl] while Howard Kurtz of The Washington Post opined that Reagan was "a far more controversial figure in his time than the largely gushing obits on television would suggest."[tpl]Cite news|last=Kurtz|first=Howard|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A21671-2004Jun7.html|title=Reagan: The Retake|work=The Washington Post|date=June 7, 2004|accessdate=August 25, 2005[/tpl]
Despite the continuing debate surrounding his legacy, many conservative and liberal scholars agree that Reagan has been the most influential president since Franklin D. Roosevelt, leaving his imprint on American politics, diplomacy, culture, and economics. Since he left office, historians have reached a consensus,David Henry in Journal of American History December 2009 v. 96#3 p. 934 as summarized by British historian M. J. Heale, who finds that scholars now concur that Reagan rehabilitated conservatism, turned the nation to the right, practiced a considerably pragmatic conservatism that balanced ideology and the constraints of politics, revived faith in the presidency and in American self-respect, and contributed to victory in the Cold War.Heale, M.J. in Cheryl Hudson and Gareth Davies, eds.

The Cold War was a major political, economic and military endeavor for over four decades, but the confrontation between the two superpowers had decreased dramatically by the end of Reagan's presidency.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20040606/news_lz1x6legacy.html|title=Reagan's legacy|date=June 6, 2004|accessdate=February 16, 2008|work=U-T San Diego[/tpl] The significance of Reagan's role in ending the Cold War has spurred contentious and opinionated debate.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/flashback/dsouza200406061619.asp|title=Russian Revolution|date=June 6, 2004|accessdate=January 6, 2008|work=National Review|last=D'Souza|first=Dinesh|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211150646/http://www.nationalreview.com/flashback/dsouza200406061619.asp |archivedate=December 11, 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://hnn.us/articles/5569.html|title=Reagan's Role in Ending the Cold War Is Being Exaggerated|date=June 14, 2004|accessdate=January 6, 2008|last=Chapman|first=Roger|publisher=George Mason University[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|url=http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/ronnie-turns-one-hundred-4829|title=Reagan Turns One Hundred: Foreign Policy Lessons|date=February 11, 2011|accessdate=December 21, 2011|work=The National Interest|last=Chang|first=Felix[/tpl] That Reagan played a role in contributing to the downfall of the Soviet Union is agreed, but the extent of this role is continuously debated, with many believing that Reagan's defense policies, economic policies, military policies and hard line rhetoric against the Soviet Union and Communism, as well as summits with General Secretary Gorbachev played a significant part in ending the Cold War.[tpl]Cite news|title=American Dreamer|last1=Meacham|first1=John|author2=Andrew Murr, Eleanor Clift, Tamara Lipper, Karen Breslau, and Jennifer Ordonez|date=June 14, 2004|work=Newsweek|accessdate=June 3, 2008|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/54017?tid=relatedcl[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal|last=Knopf, PhD|first=Jeffery W.|date=August 2004|title=Did Reagan Win the Cold War?|journal=Strategic Insights|volume=III|issue=8|publisher=Center for Contemporary Conflict|url=http://www.nps.edu/Academics/centers/ccc/publications/OnlineJournal/2004/aug/knopfAUG04.html|accessdate=January 6, 2008[/tpl]
He was first among post–World War II presidents to put into practice the concept that the Soviet Union could be defeated rather than simply negotiated with, a post-Détente strategy, a conviction that was vindicated by Gennadi Gerasimov, the Foreign Ministry spokesman under Gorbachev, who said that the Strategic Defense Initiative was "very successful blackmail. ... The Soviet economy couldn't endure such competition."Richard Ned Lebow and Janice Gross Stein: Reagan and the Russians The Atlantic, February 1994. Reagan's aggressive rhetoric toward the USSR had mixed effects; Jeffery W. Knopf observes that being labeled "evil" probably made no difference to the Soviets but gave encouragement to the East-European citizens opposed to communism.
General Secretary Gorbachev said of his former rival's Cold War role: "was a man who was instrumental in bringing about the end of the Cold War",[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-6986165.html|title=Gorbachev mourns loss of honest rival|date=June 7, 2004|accessdate=January 6, 2008|work=Oakland Tribune|last=Heintz|first=Jim|agency=Associated Press|format=Reprint[/tpl] and deemed him "a great President".

President Harry Truman's policy of containment is also regarded as a force behind the fall of the U.S.S.R., and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan undermined the Soviet system itself.

===Domestic and political legacy===

Ronald Reagan reshaped the Republican party, led the modern conservative movement, and altered the political dynamic of the United States.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/06/06/legacy.politics/index.html|title=Reagan cast a wide shadow in politics|author=Loughlin, Sean|date=July 6, 2004|accessdate=June 19, 2008|publisher=CNN[/tpl] More men voted Republican under Reagan, and Reagan tapped into religious voters. The so-called "Reagan Democrats" were a result of his presidency.
After leaving office, Reagan became an iconic influence within the Republican party.

Heritage.org. Retrieved July 15, 2013. has become the unofficial slogan for the rise of conservative commentators like Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh, as well as the emergence of the Tea Party movement.
