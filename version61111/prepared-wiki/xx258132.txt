==History==

The Manly-Warringah Wolves were formed in 1969. Founding members Harry Marston, George Klause and Bruce Hutton discovered enough interest on the northern beaches for an Australian Rules team to be formed. The club started in the SFL Under-20 competition.
The following year Manly-Warringah joined the newly formed Sydney District Association. The formation of this competition was the culmination of several clubs’ efforts, none more so than Manly, and in particular Harry Marston.
The Wolves have been a dominant performer in the Sydney AFL First Division competition. Manly-Warringah has now won Sydney AFL First Grade premierships in 1990, 1995, 1996 and in recent years has reached the finals in the past 8 successive seasons including premierships in 2007, 2011 and 2012. The Wolves were promoted to Premier Division in 2013 after an undefeated 2012 season in Division 1 and a percentage of over five hundred. They also had an astonishing average winning margin of over one hundred points per game.
After Division One premierships in 2011 and 2012, the 2013 season saw the Manly Warringah Wolves promoted to the Sydney AFL Premier Division for the first time in their history. The Wolves won their first game in the Sydney AFL Premier Division 159 - 42 against 2012 grand finalist, Balmain Dockers. The wolves had a dream start in the premier division winning 9 straight games to start the season. The wolves finished 2013 with the minor premiership. The wolves had the first week off in the semi finals before beating St George Dragons 85 - 67 to qualify for the grand final and earn a week off. The wolves faced Pennant Hills in the grand final and ran out winners 80 - 72. They are the first team in Sydney AFL history to win the grand final after being promoted to the Premier Division.
The Wolves will be known as the Giants for the 2014 season after a partnership with AFL club Greater Western Sydney Giants. The Wolves will have a G for Giants on their jersey and orange will be added to their usual maroon and white to show their link with GWS. It is unknown what the Manly logo will now look like. 
Premierships: 1985, 1990, 1995, 1996, 2007, 2011, 2012 and 2013
