Faustinopolis (also Colonia Faustinopolis and Halala) was an ancient city in the south of Cappadocia, about 20 km south of Tyana. It was named after the empress Faustina, the wife of Marcus Aurelius, who died there in a village, which her husband, by establishing a colony in it, raised to the rank of a town under the name of Faustinopolis. (Jul. Capitol. M. Ant. Philos. 26.) Hierocles (p. 700) assigns the place to Cappadocia Secunda, and it is mentioned also in the Antonine and Jerusalem Itineraries. The town was close to the defiles of the Cilician Gates, and was likely situated at modern-day Başmakçı, Niğde Province, Turkey.[tpl]Barrington|66 & notes[/tpl] Following the Muslim conquests and the subsequent Arab raids, the site was abandoned for the nearby fortress of Loulon.
