"Roar" is a song by American recording artist Katy Perry for her fourth studio album, Prism (2013). It was serviced to radio stations as the lead single from the record on August 10, 2013; it was digitally released on August 12, 2013. The song was written by Perry, Bonnie McKee, Dr. Luke, Max Martin, and Cirkut, and produced by the latter three. The lyrics address standing up for oneself and self-empowerment.
"Roar" received generally mixed reviews from music critics; many appreciated its overall production, while others felt that its lyrical content contained "clichés". The song was a commercial success, becoming Perry's eighth non-consecutive number one song on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, and, also peaked at number one in various charts, including Australia, Canada, Ireland, Scotland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. Additionally, it also reached the top five in most international charts, including France, Germany, Italy, and Switzerland.
To promote the song, Perry performed at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards, under the Brooklyn Bridge, as the ceremony's closing, on The X Factor, and on the German TV show Schlag den Raab. Grady Hall and Mark Kudsi directed the song's music video, which features Perry trying to adapt to the jungle where she survived a plane crash, and taming a tiger. It garnered generally mixed reviews from music critics. "Roar" was nominated for the Song of the Year and for the Best Pop Solo Performance at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards. The song is among some of the best-selling singles worldwide.

==Critical reception==

Miriam Coleman from Rolling Stone appreciated the songs's "easy poppy beat" and the its "repeated refrains", factors which the reviewer believed that contributed to make the song a "determined note for the new album".[tpl]cite web|last=Coleman|first=Miriam|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/katy-perry-drops-new-song-roar-20130811 |title=Katy Perry Drops New Song, 'Roar' |publisher=Rolling Stone|date=August 11, 2013[/tpl] James Montgomery of MTV described it as "one of the more perfect pop songs to come down the pipeline in quite a while".

==Usage in sports==

On September 16, 2013, the song was unexpectedly used during player introductions by the Cincinnati Bengals in their home opener against the rival Pittsburgh Steelers on Monday Night Football, to tie in the song's jungle theme with the team's nickname. Throughout the game, the song was also played sporadically during game breaks. Although the Bengals won the game 20-10, the song drew much criticism by Bengals fans and even some of the team's players. One Bengals fan even told the Wall Street Journal that Steeler fans sitting near him were laughing at the Bengals fans throughout the game; the Steelers themselves have used the Styx song "Renegade" frequently at Heinz Field since 2001.[tpl]Cite news | title = Steelers Turn To Power Of 'Renegade' To Fuel Defense: 'Oh Momma' Rallying Cry For Black And Gold| newspaper = WTAE-TV| publisher = www.thepittsburghchannel.com| date = November 9, 2009 | url = http://www.thepittsburghchannel.com/sports/21562637/detail.html|archivedate=November 22, 2009|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5lUNrH0FM[/tpl] Four days after the game, the team publicly apologized, announcing that while the song would not be nixed from Paul Brown Stadium's playlist completely, the team would use a hard rock or classic rock song for player introductions moving forward.[tpl]cite web|title=Katy Perry song nixed for intros|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/9701089/cincinnati-bengals-tone-katy-perry-roar-fan-backlash Katy Perry song nixed for intros|publisher=ESPN|date=September 21, 2013[/tpl]

===Synopsis===

At the beginning of the video, Katy and her boyfriend have crashed their plane in the middle of the jungle. Katy shows signs of worry, while her boyfriend takes pictures of himself and dumps his bags on her to explore. As it turns to night, they wander through the jungle as he throws things back at her. Suddenly, he is attacked by a tiger and Katy dumps her bags and runs off screaming. She approaches a lake and is almost bitten by a crocodile when she puts her hand in the water. She sits on a rock and ends up covered in tarantulas. As she looks into the lake while singing the chorus, she sees a reflection of a tiger instead of herself. Behind her in the darkness there are dozens of pairs of blinking eyes, but they are revealed to be fireflies which fly around her before forming an image of a roaring tiger in the sky.
Presumably a few days later, Katy has since made friends with a monkey and uses her stiletto heel to form a spear. She uses it to shoot a banana, which she gives to the monkey. In another scene, she bathes in the lake, with the help of an elephant who sprays her with water from the lake using its trunk. Katy helps a crocodile by brushing its teeth using a toothbrush she has salvaged, and tries to reach her clothes which have been taken by the elephant. At night, she holds a torch and explores a cave. Inside, she watches an animated drawing on the wall in which humans try to kill a tiger; attempting to burn it as it grows stronger and shooting spears which it sends firing back towards them. The next morning, Katy emerges from the cave, wearing a leopard-print bra and grass skirt, laced up legs and bare feet, displaying a boost of confidence and holding the spear she made earlier. She stands on top of a waterfall, overlooking the jungle, and then swings across the sky on a vine.
With the help of the monkey, Katy builds a cat toy which she uses to distract the tiger who ate her boyfriend earlier in the video. She lures it into an area of the jungle, and traps it inside. She comes face-to-face with the tiger and the two of them roar at each other, until her roar tames the tiger as it sits in front of her submissively. Afterwards, she is shown sitting on a giant grass throne, wearing a flower crown as the rest of the jungle animals sit around her, including the tiger, monkey and elephant. The tiger is shown wearing a collar that says "Kitty Purry", a reference to her real-life cat of the same name. Katy takes selfies with the monkey on her boyfriend's phone, applies lipstick made from berry juice, and paints the elephant's toenails pink. She then awakens from sleeping in the plane, leading the viewer to think all the previous events have just been a dream, but walks out of the plane still in the jungle, stretching her arms and yawning with the animals sitting around her.

===Reception===

Upon its release, the music video received mixed reviews from critics. Idolator contributors Robbie Daw, Sam Lansky, and Carl Willott gave it mostly lackluster reviews. Daw considered that the release of such a "safe" video was a disappointment for Perry and expressed eagerness to her next single; while Lansky likened its "edginess" to that of a "woman's antiperspirant commercial"; and the latter divided the video in what he considered to be of "good cheesy" and "bad cheesy": he highlighted the fake set, Perry's acting and the ending, but criticized the CGI, which he deemed "dopey", the product placement and Perry's "overly literal roar-off with a tiger". The only writer for the website that gave the visual a favorable review was Mike Wass, who appreciated the "campy elements" in it, while noting that it drew inspiration from the music video for "Doctor Jones" by the dance-pop group Aqua. In total, the reviews had an average score of approximately 6 out of 10.[tpl]cite web|author=Wass, Mike|title=Pop Perspective: Katy Perry's "Roar" Video Reviewed By All Four Idolator Editors|url=http://www.idolator.com/7482925/pop-perspective-katy-perry-roar-video|work=Idolator|publisher=Spin Media|accessdate=December 25, 2013|date=September 6, 2013[/tpl]
