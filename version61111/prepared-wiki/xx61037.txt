Northern Cyprus (or North Cyprus), officially the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC; [tpl]lang-tr|[tpl]italics correction|Kuzey Kıbrıs Türk Cumhuriyeti[/tpl][/tpl]), is a self-declared state that comprises the northeastern portion of the island of Cyprus. Recognised only by Turkey, Northern Cyprus is considered by the international community as Turkish-occupied territory of the Republic of Cyprus.[tpl]cite book|author=Susannah Verney|title=EUROSCEPTICISM IN SOUTHERN EUROPE|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=1S_dAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA161|date=13 September 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-99612-5|pages=161–|quote=The international community (UN, EU, Council of Europe and other international organisations) recognise the de jure sovereignty of the Republic of Cyprus over the whole island.[/tpl]
Northern Cyprus extends from the tip of the Karpass Peninsula in the north east, westward to Morphou Bay and Cape Kormakitis (the Kokkina/Erenköy exclave marks the westernmost extent of the area), and southward to the village of Louroujina. A buffer zone under the control of the United Nations stretches between Northern Cyprus and the rest of the island and divides Nicosia, the island's largest city and capital of both states.
The 1974 coup d'état, an attempt to annex the island to Greece, was followed by the Turkish invasion of Cyprus. This resulted in the eviction of much of the north's Greek Cypriot population, the flight of Turkish Cypriots from the south, and the partitioning of the island, leading to a unilateral declaration of independence by the North in 1983. Due to its lack of recognition, Northern Cyprus is heavily dependent on Turkey for economic, political and military support.Thomas M. Leonard. Encyclopedia of the Developing World, Volume 1, page 429. Taylor & Francis, 2006, 159 pages http://books.google.com/books?id=3mE04D9PMpAC&dq=TRNC%2Bdependent&source=gbs_navlinks_s
Attempts to reach a solution to the Cyprus dispute have been unsuccessful. Recognising the need for a resolution, in May 2008 the two sides began another round of negotiations after committing themselves to working towards "a bicommunal, bizonal federation with political equality, as defined by relevant Security Council resolutions."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=33631&Cr=cyprus&Cr1 |title=United Nations News Centre - Mutually beneficial solution to the Cyprus problem ‘within reach,’ Ban says |publisher=Un.org |date=2010-02-01 |accessdate=2014-02-14[/tpl] The Turkish Army maintains a large force in Northern Cyprus with its presence supported and approved by the TRNC government, which the Republic of Cyprus regards as an illegal occupation force, with its presence denounced in several United Nations Security Council resolutions.

==History==

A united Cyprus gained independence from British rule in August 1960, after both Greek and Turkish Cypriots agreed to respectively abandon plans for enosis (union with Greece) and taksim (Turkish for 'partition'). The agreement involved Cyprus being governed under a constitution which apportioned Cabinet posts, parliamentary seats and civil service jobs on an agreed ratio between the two communities. Within three years, tensions between the Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots in administrative affairs began to show. In particular, disputes over separate municipalities and taxation created a deadlock in government. In 1963 President Makarios proposed unilateral changes to the constitution, via 13 amendments. Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots rejected the proposed amendments, claiming that this was an attempt to settle constitutional disputes in favour of the Greek Cypriots[tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl] and as a means of demoting Turkish status from co-founders of the state to one of minority status removing their constitutional safeguards in the process. Turkish Cypriots filed a lawsuit against the 13 amendments in the Supreme Constitutional Court of Cyprus (SCCC). Makarios announced that he would not comply with whatever the decision of the SCCC would be,[tpl]cite web|url=http://ir.emu.edu.tr/staff/asozen/conferencepapers/konjic2002.pdf|title= Pre-Rejection of SCCC decision by Makarios : The fact that the decision of the SCCC would not be implemented by Makarios was made quite clear. Non-implementation of the decision of a Constitutional Court is sufficient reason to compel the resignation of its President|publisher=Emu.edu.tr|accessdate=2014-02-14[/tpl] and defended his amendments as being necessary "to resolve constitutional deadlocks" as opposed to the stance of the SCCC.[tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl] On 25 April 1963, the SCCC decided that Makarios' 13 amendments were illegal. The Cyprus Supreme Court's ruling found that Makarios had violated the constitution by failing to fully implement its measures and that Turkish Cypriots had not been allowed to return to their positions in government without first accepting the proposed constitutional amendments.Stephen, Michael, (1987) Cyprus: Two Nations in One Island Bow Educational Briefing No.5. London, Pages 1–7 On 21 May, the president of the SCCC resigned due to the Makarios' stance. On 15 July, Makarios ignored the decision of the SCCC.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.supremecourt.gov.cy/judicial/sc.nsf/DMLfaq_en/DMLfaq_en?OpenDocument |title=Supreme Court of Cyprus - FAQ |language=[tpl]el icon[/tpl] |publisher=Supremecourt.gov.cy |date= |accessdate=2014-02-14[/tpl] After the resignation of the president of the SCCC, the SCCC ceased to exist. The Supreme Court of Cyprus (SCC) was formed by merging the SCCC and the High Court of Cyprus and undertook the jurisdiction and powers of the SCCC and HCC.[tpl]cite web|url=http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/search.asp |title=HUDOC Search Page |publisher=Cmiskp.echr.coe.int |accessdate=2014-02-14[/tpl] On 30 November, Makarios legalized the 13 proposals.
In 1963, the Greek Cypriot wing of the government created the Akritas plan which outlined a policy that would remove Turkish Cypriots from the government and ultimately lead to union with Greece. The plan stated that if the Turkish Cypriots objected then they should be "violently subjugated before foreign powers could intervene".Cyprus – The Republic of Cyprus countrystudies.us, U.S. Library of Congress On 21 December 1963, a Turkish Cypriot crowd clashed with the plainclothes special constables of Yorgadjis. Almost immediately, intercommunal violence broke out with a major Greek Cypriot paramilitary attack upon Turkish Cypriots in Nicosia and Larnaca. Though the TMT — a Turkish resistance group created in 1959 to promote a policy of taksim (division or partition of Cyprus), in opposition to the Greek Cypriot nationalist group EOKA and its advocacy of enosis (union of Cyprus with Greece) — committed a number of acts of retaliation, historian of the Cyprus conflict Keith Kyle noted that "there is no doubt that the main victims of the numerous incidents that took place during the next few months were Turks." Seven hundred Turkish hostages, including women and children, were taken from the northern suburbs of Nicosia. Nikos Sampson, a nationalist and future coup leader, led a group of Greek Cypriot irregulars into the mixed suburb of Omorphita and attacked the Turkish Cypriot population.Andrew Borowiec, 2000. Cyprus: A troubled island. Praeger/Greenwood p.56 By 1964, 193 Turkish Cypriots and 133 Greek Cypriots had been killed, with a further 209 Turks and 41 Greeks missing and presumed dead.
Turkish Cypriot members of the government had by now withdrawn, creating an essentially Greek Cypriot administration in control of all institutions of the state. After the partnership government collapsed, the Greek Cypriot led administration was recognized as the legitimate government of the Republic of Cyprus at the stage of the debates in New York in February 1964.Cyprus-Mail, 09.03.2014 UNFICYP: a living fossil of the Cold War Widespread looting of Turkish Cypriot villages prompted 20,000 refugees to retreat into armed enclaves, where they remained for the next 11 years,Antiwar.com. In Praise of 'Virtual States', Leon Hadar, 16 November 2005 relying on food and medical supplies from Turkey to survive. Turkish Cypriots formed paramilitary groups to defend the enclaves, leading to a gradual division of the island's communities into two hostile camps. The violence had also seen thousands of Turkish Cypriots attempt to escape the violence by emigrating to Britain, Australia and Turkey.Quoted in Andrew Borowiec, 2000. Cyprus: A troubled island. Praeger/Greenwood p.58
On 15 July 1974, the Greek military junta of 1967-1974 and the Cypriot National Guard backed a Greek Cypriot military coup d'état in Cyprus. Pro-Enosis Nikos Sampson replaced President Makarios as the new dictator.[tpl]cite book | last = Cook | first = Chris | authorlink = |author2= Diccon Bewes | title = What Happened Where: A Guide to Places and Events in Twentieth-century History | publisher = Routledge | year = 1997 | location =  | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=FuGrcgcOiXoC&printsec=frontcover&dq#PPA65,M1 | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-85728-533-6| page = 65 [/tpl] The Greek Cypriot coupists proclaimed the establishment of the "Hellenic Republic of Cyprus".Strategic review, Volume 5 (1977), United States Strategic Institute, p. 48.Allcock, John B.

Turkey claimed that under the 1960 Treaty of Guarantee, the coup was sufficient reason for military action to protect the Turkish Cypriot populace, and thus Turkey invaded Cyprus on 20 July. Turkish forces proceeded to take over the northern four-elevenths of the island (about 37% of Cyprus's total area). The coup caused a civil war filled with ethnic violence, after which it collapsed and Makarios returned to power.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2011[/tpl]
On August 2, 1975, in the negotiations in Vienna, a Population Exchange Agreement was signed between community leaders Rauf Denktaş and Glafcos Clerides under the auspices of United Nations.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.un.org/Docs/journal/asp/ws.asp?m=s/11789 |title=Links to documents |publisher=Un.org |date=2002-09-09 |accessdate=2014-02-14[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=Murat Metin Hakki|title=The Cyprus Issue: A Documentary History, 1878-2006|year=2007|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-84511-392-6|pages=194–195[/tpl] On the basis of the Agreement, 196,000 Greek Cypriots living in the north were exchanged for 42,000 Turkish Cypriots living in the southKatholieke Universiteit Brussel, 2004 "Euromosaic III: Presence of Regional and Minority Language Groups in the New Member States", p.18 (the number of settlers was disputed[tpl]cite book|author1=Tozun Bahcheli|author2=Tozun Bahcheli Barry Bartmann|author3=Henry Felix Srebrnik|title=De Facto States: The Quest for Sovereignty|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=uIbah-giC0EC&pg=PA168|accessdate=27 November 2012|year=2004|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-7146-5476-8|page=168|quote=...the number of settlers was disputed between Turkish and ..[/tpl]).

In 1975, the Turkish Federated State of Cyprus (Kıbrıs Türk Federe Devleti) was declared as a first step towards a future federated Cypriot state, but was rejected by the Republic of Cyprus and the United Nations.
After eight years of failed negotiations with the leadership of the Greek Cypriot community,[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl] the north unilaterally declared its independence on 15 November 1983 under the name of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.trncpio.org/trncpio/en/index.asp?sayfa=cms&dmid=0&cmsid=155&ssid=98199036 |title=General Information |publisher=Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Public Information Office |accessdate=14 November 2011[/tpl] This was rejected by the UN and the Republic of Cyprus.

In recent years, the politics of reunification has dominated the island's affairs. The European Union decided in 2000 to accept Cyprus as a member, even if it was divided. This was due to their view of Rauf Denktaş, the pro-independence Turkish Cypriot President, as the main stumbling block, but also due to Greece threatening to block eastern EU expansion. It was hoped that Cyprus's planned accession into the European Union would act as a catalyst towards a settlement. In the time leading up to Cyprus becoming a member, a new government was elected in Turkey and Rauf Denktaş lost political power in Cyprus. In 2004, a United Nations–brokered peace settlement was presented in a referendum to both sides.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/node/17276362?zid=309&ah=80dcf288b8561b012f603b9fd9577f0e |title=Immovable object |newspaper=The Economist |date=21 October 2010 |accessdate=23 August 2012[/tpl] The proposed settlement was opposed by both the president of Cyprus, Tassos Papadopoulos, and Turkish Cypriot president Rauf Denktaş; in the referendum, while 65% of Turkish Cypriots accepted the proposal, 76% of Greek Cypriots rejected it.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl] As a result, Cyprus entered the European Union divided, with the effects of membership suspended for Northern Cyprus.
Denktaş resigned in the wake of the vote, ushering in the pro-solutionist Mehmet Ali Talat as his successor. However, the pro-solutionist side and Mehmet Ali Talat lost momentum due to the ongoing embargo[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl] and isolation, despite promises[tpl]clarify|date=December 2012[/tpl] from the European Union that these would be eased. As a result, the Turkish Cypriot electorate became frustrated. This led ultimately to the pro-independence side winning the general elections in 2009 and its candidate, former Prime Minister Derviş Eroğlu, winning the presidential elections in 2010. Although Eroğlu and his National Unity Party favours the independence of Northern Cyprus rather than reunification with the Republic of Cyprus, he is negotiating with the Greek Cypriot side towards a settlement for reunification.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl]
In 2011, Turkish Cypriots protested against economic reforms made by the Northern Cyprus and Turkish governments.

==Government and politics==

The politics of Northern Cyprus takes place in a framework of a semi-presidential representative democratic republic, whereby the President is head of state and the Prime Minister head of government, and of a multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the Assembly of the Republic. The Judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature.
The president is elected for a five-year term. The current president is Derviş Eroğlu and the current Prime Minister is Özkan Yorgancıoğlu. The legislature is the Assembly of the Republic, which has 50 members elected by proportional representation from five electoral districts. In the elections of July 2013, the left-leaning pro-unification Republican Turkish Party won an overall majority.
Due to Northern Cyprus' isolation and heavy reliance on Turkish support, Turkey has a high level of influence over the country's politics. This has led to some experts characterising it as an effective puppet state of Turkey.[tpl]cite book|author=Carlo Focarelli|title=International Law as Social Construct: The Struggle for Global Justice|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=oTYc6WY0_icC&pg=PA161|date=24 May 2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-958483-3|pages=161–|quote=In the 1995 and 1996 Loizidou Judgments the ECtHR treated the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) as a sort of puppet government whose acts fall within the jurisdiction of (and are attributable to) Turkey as an (unlawful) occupier.[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author1=Carlo Panara|author2=Gary Wilson|title=The Arab Spring: New Patterns for Democracy and International Law|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rWAzAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA59|date=9 January 2013|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=978-90-04-24341-5|pages=59–|quote=The situation with the South African homelands was similar and so was collective non-acceptance of the turkish puppet-government in northern Cyprus which has resulted in the turkish republic of northern Cyprus not being recognized as a state.[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=Ersun N.

In the wake of the April 2004 referendum on the United Nations Annan Plan, and in view of the support of the Turkish Cypriot community for the plan, the European Union made pledges towards ending the isolation of Northern Cyprus.

In 2004, the Organisation of Islamic Co-operation upgraded the delegation of the Turkish Cypriot Muslim community from "observer community" (1979) to that of a constituent state with the designation "Turkish Cypriot State", making Northern Cyprus an observer member of the organization.[tpl]cite web|url=http://islamic-conference-news.newslib.com/story/1413-3215426/ |title=Netwebsearch.com |publisher=Islamic-conference-news.newslib.com |accessdate=2014-02-14[/tpl] A number of high profile formal meetings have also taken place between former President Mehmet Ali Talat and various foreign leaders and politicians including the former US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, the then British foreign minister, Jack Straw and former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, and between President Dervis Eroglu and Ban Ki-Moon, Secretary-General of the United Nations.

The European Union considers the area not under effective control of the Republic of Cyprus as EU territory under Turkish military occupation and thus indefinitely exempt from EU legislation until a settlement has been found.

===Military===

Northern Cyprus has an indigenous 5,000-man Turkish Cypriot Security Force (TCSF), which is primarily made up of conscripted Turkish Cypriot males between the ages of 18 and 40.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl] There is also an additional reserve force consisting of about 11,000 first-line, 10,000 second-line and 5,000 third-line troops conscripted up to the age of 50. The TCSF is lightly armed and heavily dependent on its mainland Turkish allies, from which it draws much of its officer corps.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl] It is led by a Brigadier General drawn from the Turkish Army. It acts essentially as a gendarmerie charged with protection of the border of Northern Cyprus from Greek Cypriot incursions and maintaining internal security within Northern Cyprus."Cyprus." Jane's Sentinel: Eastern Mediterranean, issue 22, 2007.
In addition, the mainland Turkish Armed Forces maintain the Cyprus Turkish Peace Force (CTPF) consisting of around 30–40,000 troops drawn from the 9th Turkish Army Corps and comprising two divisions, the 28th and 39th. It is equipped with a substantial number of United States-made M48 Patton main battle tanks and artillery weapons. The Turkish Air Force, Turkish Navy and Turkish Coast Guard also have a presence in Northern Cyprus. Although formally part of Turkish 4th Army, headquartered in İzmir, the sensitivities of the Cyprus situation means that the commander of the CTPF also reports directly to the Turkish General Staff in Ankara. The CTPF is deployed principally along the Green Line and in locations where hostile amphibious landings might take place.
The presence of the mainland Turkish military in Cyprus is highly controversial, having been denounced as an illegal occupation force by the Republic of Cyprus and the international community. Several United Nations Security Council resolutions have called on the Turkish forces to withdraw.UN Security Council resolutions 353(1974), 357(1974), 358(1974), 359(1974), 360(1974), 365(1974)

==Geography and climate==

The winter in Northern Cyprus is cool and rainy, particularly between December and February, with 60% of annual rainfall.Section source. Weather cypnet.co.uk. Retrieved 2008-09-14. These rains produce winter torrents that fill most of the rivers, which typically dry up as the year progresses. Snow has been known to fall on the Kyrenia Range, but seldom elsewhere in spite of low night temperatures. The short spring is characterized by unstable weather, occasional heavy storms and the "meltem", or westerly wind. Summer is hot and dry enough to turn low-lying lands on the island brown. Parts of the island experience the "Poyraz", a north-westerly wind, or the sirocco, a wind from Africa, which is dry and dusty. Summer is followed by a short, turbulent autumn.
Climate conditions on the island vary by geographical factors. The Mesaoria Plain, cut off from the summer breezes and from much of the humidity of the sea, may reach temperature peaks of [tpl]convert|40|to|45|°C|°F|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. Humidity rises at the Karpaz Peninsula. Humidity and water temperature, [tpl]convert|16|to|28|°C|°F|0|abbr=on[/tpl], combine to stabilize coastal weather, which does not experience inland extremes. The Southern Range blocks air currents that bring rain and atmospheric humidity from the south-west, diminishing both on its eastern side.

==Economy==

The economy of Northern Cyprus is dominated by the services sector (69% of GDP in 2007) which includes the public sector, trade, tourism and education. The revenues gained by the education sector in 2011 was USD 400 million.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.zaman.com.tr/yazar.do?yazino=1175178&title=isadamlari-kuzey-kibrisa-cikarma-yapti |title=Zaman Yazarları |publisher=Zaman.com.tr |accessdate=2014-02-14[/tpl] Industry (light manufacturing) contributes 22% of GDP and agriculture 9%.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cy.html#Econ |title=The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |accessdate=2014-02-14[/tpl]
