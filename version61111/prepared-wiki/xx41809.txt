In logic, necessity and sufficiency are implicational relationships between statements.  The assertion that one statement is a necessary and sufficient  condition of another means that the former statement is true if and only if the latter is true. That is, the two statements must be either simultaneously true or simultaneously false.[tpl]cite book|last=Betz|first=Frederick|title=Managing Science: Methodology and Organization of Research|date=2011|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4419-7487-7|page=247[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Manktelow|first=K.I.|title=Reasoning and Thinking|date=1999|publisher=Psychology Press|location=East Sussex, UK|isbn=0-86377-708-2[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|author=Asnina, Erika; Osis, Janis; and Jansone, Asnate|title=Formal Specification of Topological Relations|journal=Databases and Information Systems VII|date=2013|page=175|doi=10.3233/978-1-61499-161-8-175|accessdate=14 April 2014[/tpl] 
In ordinary English, ‘necessary’ and ‘sufficient’ indicate relations between  conditions or states of affairs, not statements. Being a male sibling is a necessary and sufficient condition for being a brother. Fred’s being a male sibling is necessary and sufficient for the truth of the statement that Fred is a brother.

==Relationship between necessity and sufficiency==

A condition can be both necessary and sufficient. For example, at present, "today is the Fourth of July" is a necessary and sufficient condition for "today is Independence Day in the United States."  Similarly, a necessary and sufficient condition for invertibility of a matrix M is that M has a nonzero determinant.
Mathematically speaking, necessity and sufficiency are dual to one another.  For any statements S and N, the assertion that "N is necessary for S" is equivalent to the assertion that "S is sufficient for N." Another facet of this duality is that, as illustrated above, conjunctions (using "and") of necessary conditions may achieve sufficiency, while disjunctions (using "or") of sufficient conditions may achieve necessity.  For a third facet, identify every mathematical predicate N with the set T(N) of objects, events, or statements for which N holds true; then asserting the necessity of N for S is equivalent to claiming that T(N) is a superset of T(S), while asserting the sufficiency of S for N is equivalent to claiming that T(S) is a subset of T(N).

==Simultaneous necessity and sufficiency==

For example, in graph theory a graph G is called bipartite if it is possible to assign to each of its vertices the color black or white in such a way that every edge of G has one endpoint of each color.  And for any graph to be bipartite, it is a necessary and sufficient condition that it contain no odd-length cycles.  Thus, discovering whether a graph has any odd cycles tells one whether it is bipartite and vice versa.  A philosopherStanford University primer, 2006
might characterize this state of affairs thus: "Although the concepts of bipartiteness and absence of odd cycles differ in intension, they have identical extension."Meanings, in this sense, are often called intensions, and things designated, extensions. Contexts in which extension is all that matters are, naturally, called extensional, while contexts in which extension is not enough are intensional. Mathematics is typically extensional throughout."
