Ocean Park (also known as "Ocean Park Historic Buildings" or "Temple Square" (0213750228) or "Chautauqua-By-The-Sea") is an unincorporated community in the town of Old Orchard Beach in York County, Maine, United States.  A historic family style summer community affiliated with the Free Will Baptists, the site is located on Temple Avenue on Saco Bay.

==History==

The buildings in Ocean Park were mainly constructed in the 1880s in a Classical Revival style. The site was home to a large Free Will Baptist meeting site, organized in 1881 largely by Bates College President Oren B. Cheney. One of the prominent buildings is the Free Baptist Tabernacle Temple, a large meeting hall serving as the central gathering place of the camp. The style was similar to other prominent summer church "camp" revivals such those at Ocean Grove, New Jersey and Wesleyan Grove on Martha's Vineyard. The site was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.
