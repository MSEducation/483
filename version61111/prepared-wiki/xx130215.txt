London Buses route 53 is a Transport for London contracted bus route in London, United Kingdom. The service is currently contracted to Stagecoach London and runs between Plumstead and Whitehall.

==History==

Route 53 dates back to 1952. It traditionally ran from Erith to Parliament Hill Fields until the late 1970s, in which the route east of Plumstead was withdrawn, during the 1980s the 53 only continued to Camden and Hampstead during the rush hour, by 1989 however the route terminated at Oxford Circus at all times. Routemasters where replaced in 1988 by Leyland Titans and Olympians.
Throughout the 1990s and up until 2003, was London's most frequent route along with routes; 12, 36, 38, 73 and 207,
it ran in several overlapping sections such as:
Plumstead to Elephant & Castle, Woolwich to County Hall (Waterloo) and Blackheath to Oxford Circus, with the route running in shorter sections such as: Plumstead to New Cross and New Cross to Trafalgar Square.
In 2003, the route was cut back to the rather unusual location of  Whitehall, even though some journeys of the 53 used to terminate at Trafalgar Square, which is only two minutes up the road, it could be argued that the reason for this was so that the new sister route 453 wouldn't be undermined, the route also reduced in frequency. Despite the cutbacks in the route itself the 53 still remains one of London's longest bus routesRoute 53 londonbusroutes.net
The route is a major South East London trunk route and is very long. At one point, some journeys continued on to Erith. From the 1980s to 2001 there was a route X53 that had two eastern termini, Thamesmead and Erith, and ran to Plumstead, Woolwich and Blackheath, from where it was fast to Elephant and Castle then limited stops from that point onwards.
The route is among London's most famous routes as it serves not only some of London's most famous sights, such as Greenwich Park and Big Ben, the route also transverses through the heart of the traditional, well known suburban and urban districts of South East London such as; Plumstead, Woolwich, Charlton, Blackheath, Greenwich, Deptford, New Cross and Elephant and Castle.
Route 53, which is worked from Plumstead Bus Garage, is a frequent route. Prior to the 2003 changes it required over 40 buses. In 1995 52 new Volvo Olympian double-deckers were bought for the route by then-operator Stagecoach London at a cost of Â£5.5 million.[tpl]cite journal|last=Millar|first=Alan|title=Seeing red|journal=Buses Focus|publisher=Ian Allan Publishing|date=September 1995|page=61[/tpl] Route 185 parallels part of the 53; following the collapse of London Easylink in August 2002, it was left with a limited service provided by a number of operators, and extra journeys on the 53 were operated between Westminster and New Cross Gate to relieve overcrowding.[tpl]cite journal|last=Aldridge|first=John|title=Guess who's on the 185 now?|journal=Buses|publisher=Ian Allan Publishing|issue=573|date=December 2002|page=15[/tpl]
The service is the only Transport for London contracted route to serve the section of the A2 road through Blackheath Hill. In April 2003 subsidence in a chalk mine beneath the road led to the road being closed and the route being diverted via Lewisham.[tpl]cite journal|last=Aldridge|first=John|title=53 falls foul of Blackheath's big hole|journal=Buses Magazine|publisher=Ian Allan Publishing|issue=568|date=July 2002|page=15[/tpl]
In November 2008, a bus travelling on the route was involved in a collision with a car in Woolwich. There were no serious injuries. Passengers stated that the bus driver had braked sharply to avoid a more serious collision, and he was praised by a spokesman for bus operator Selkent.Bus and car crash in Hillreach, Woolwich (From News Shopper)
