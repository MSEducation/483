46 Mommas Shave for the Brave is a childhood cancer charity fundraising team for The St. Baldrick's Foundation founded in 2010 with an aim to help fund pediatric cancer research and to also raise awareness. It was founded by Tiffany Beamer (a mother whose 3-year-old daughter was diagnosed with Ewingâ€™s Sarcoma, a rare childhood cancer) and its activities are concentrated on United States & Canada. 46 Mommas Shave for the Brave is a fundraising team for the St. Baldrick's Foundation and since its formation, the organization was capable of raising $1 Million from their annual head shaving events.http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20100901006320/en/46-Mommas-Set-Brave-Shave-St.-Baldrick%E2%80%99s The organization got its unique name from the statistical fact that about 46 mothers are informed each week day that their child has cancer.http://www.hpe.com/life/features/x1202636782/Thomasville-woman-shaves-for-the-brave-children-with-cancer
left|thumb|Mothers shaving their heads on the 2nd annual meet of "46 Mommas"The idea of 46 Mommas happened when Tiffany Beamer, the founder, in a random discussion on the PAC2 website. On September 9, 2010 the inaugural team came together from across the US and met in Hollywood, CA. In the following years, the event happened at Washington DC & San Antonio, TX .http://www.momtrends.com/2011/09/46-mommas-stand-up-to-cancer/ Though initially meant as a domestic organization inside US, from 2012 mothers from Canada were also included in the annual event. In future, 46 Mommas targets to become an international organization comprising mothers from all the major countries. The tagline "46 Mommas" is 'Shave for the Brave'
Every year, a class comprising 46 volunteering mothers from various parts of US & Canada whose children suffering from cancer will meet for the annual event and shave their head showing solidarity with their children suffering from the deadly disease. Each year a new class of women are introduced. The idea is that when a large group of women shave their heads it will generate a lot of curiosity and media attention, thereby finding the funds for charity. http://www.wtsp.com/news/article/326506/8/46-Mommas-Getting-a-buzz-cut-to-raise-awareness-and-money-for-childhood-cancerThe funds are used for important research to help kids diagnosed with cancer. Though the primary focus is set of the 46 mothers, the organization entertains anyone who is ready to be a part of it.While advocating to increase funding, both nationally and locally, for childhood cancer specific issues, 46 Mommas also make collaboration with other childhood cancer organizations to help produce a stronger, united childhood cancer community.http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20100901006320/en/46-Mommas-Set-Brave-Shave-St.-Baldrick%E2%80%99s
