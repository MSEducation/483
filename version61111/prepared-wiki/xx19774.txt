Hearing loss, hearing impairment, or deafness,  is a partial or total inability to hear.[tpl]cite encyclopedia | year=2011 | title=Deafness | encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online | publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. | location= | id= | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/154327/deafness | accessdate=2012-02-22[/tpl] In children it may affect the development of language and can cause work related difficulties for adults.[tpl]cite journal|last=Lasak|first=JM|coauthors=Allen, P; McVay, T; Lewis, D|title=Hearing loss: diagnosis and management.|journal=Primary care|date=Mar 2014|volume=41|issue=1|pages=19–31|pmid=24439878[/tpl]
It is caused by many factors, including: genetics, aging, exposure to noise, illness, chemicals and physical trauma. Hearing testing may be used to determine the severity of the hearing loss. While the results are expressed in decibels, hearing loss is usually described as mild, mild-moderate, moderate, moderately severe, severe, or profound. Hearing loss is usually acquired by a person who at some point in life had no hearing impairment.
There are a number of measures that can prevent hearing loss and include avoidance of loud noise, chemical agents, and physical trauma. Testing for poor hearing is recommended for all newborns. But, in some cases such as due to disease, illness, or genetics, it is impossible to reverse or prevent. Hearing aids are partially effective for many.
Globally hearing loss affects about 10% of the population to some degree. It caused moderate to severe disability in 124 million people as of 2004 (108 million of whom are in low and middle income countries).[tpl]cite book | author=WHO | title=The global burden of disease : 2004 update |year=2008 | publisher=World Health Organization | location=Geneva, Switzerland |isbn=9789241563710 | pages=35 | edition=Online-Ausg.[/tpl] Of these 65 million developed the condition during childhood.[tpl]cite book |first=Abdelaziz Y | last=Elzouki | title=Textbook of clinical pediatrics |publisher=Springer | location=Berlin | isbn=9783642022012 | pages=602 |url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=FEf4EMjYSrgC&pg=PA602 | edition=2[/tpl] It is one of the most common medical conditions presenting to physicians.[tpl]cite journal|last=Zadeh|first=MH|coauthors=Selesnick, SH|title=Evaluation of hearing impairment.|journal=Comprehensive therapy|date=Winter 2001|volume=27|issue=4|pages=302–10|pmid=11765688[/tpl] It is viewed by some in the deaf community as a condition, not an illness. Treatments such as cochlear implants have caused controversy in the deaf community.

==Definition==

===Hearing loss===

Hearing loss exists when there is diminished sensitivity to the sounds normally heard. The terms hearing impairment or hard of hearing are usually reserved for people who have relative insensitivity to sound in the speech frequencies. The severity of a hearing loss is categorized according to the increase in volume above the usual level necessary before the listener can detect it.
Deafness is defined as a degree of impairment such that a person is unable to understand speech even in the presence of amplification. In profound deafness, even the loudest sounds produced by an audiometer (an instrument used to measure hearing by producing pure tone sounds through a range of frequencies) may not be detected. In total deafness, no sounds at all, regardless of amplification or method of production, are heard.

===Speech perception===

Another aspect of hearing involves the perceived clarity of a sound rather than its amplitude. In humans, that aspect is usually measured by tests of speech perception. These tests measure one's ability to understand speech, not to merely detect sound. There are very rare types of hearing impairments which affect speech understanding alone.eBook: Current Diagnosis & Treatment in Otolaryngology: Head & Neck Surgery, Lalwani, Anil K. (Ed.) Chapter 44: Audiologic Testing by Brady M. Klaves, PhD, Jennifer McKee Bold, AuD, Access Medicine

==Causes==

The following are some of the major causes of hearing loss.

===Age===

There is a progressive loss of ability to hear high frequencies with increasing age known as presbycusis. This begins in early adulthood, but does not usually interfere with ability to understand conversation until much later. Although genetically variable it is a normal concomitant of aging and is distinct from hearing losses caused by noise exposure, toxins or disease agents.[tpl]cite journal | last1=Robinson | first1=DW | last2=Sutton | first2=GJ | title=Age effect in hearing – a comparative analysis of published threshold data | journal=Audiology : official organ of the International Society of Audiology | volume=18 | issue=4 | pages=320–34 | year=1979 | pmid=475664[/tpl]

===Noise===

Noise is the cause of approximately half of all cases of hearing loss, causing some degree of problems in 5% of the population globally.[tpl]cite journal | last1=Oishi | first1=N. | last2=Schacht | first2=J. | title=Emerging treatments for noise-induced hearing loss | journal=Expert opinion on emerging drugs |date=June 2011 | volume=16 | issue=2 | pages=235–45 | pmid=21247358 | doi=10.1517/14728214.2011.552427 | pmc=3102156[/tpl]
Populations living near airports or freeways are exposed to levels of noise typically in the 65 to 75 dB(A) range.  If lifestyles include significant outdoor or open window conditions, these exposures over time can degrade hearing. The U.S. EPA and various states have set noise standards to protect people from these health risks.  The EPA has identified the level of 70 dB(A) for 24 hour exposure as the level necessary to protect the public from hearing loss and other disruptive effects from noise, such as sleep disturbance, stress-related problems, learning detriment, etc. (EPA, 1974).
Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is typically centered at 3000, 4000, or 6000 Hz.  As noise damage progresses, damage spreads to affect lower and higher frequencies.  On an audiogram, the resulting configuration has a distinctive notch, sometimes referred to as a "noise notch." As aging and other effects contribute to higher frequency loss (6–8 kHz on an audiogram), this notch may be obscured and entirely disappear.
Louder sounds cause damage in a shorter period of time. Estimation of a "safe" duration of exposure is possible using an exchange rate of 3 dB.  As 3 dB represents a doubling of intensity of sound, duration of exposure must be cut in half to maintain the same energy dose.  For example, the "safe" daily exposure amount at 85 dB A, known as an exposure action value, is 8 hours, while the "safe" exposure at 91 dB(A) is only 2 hours (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, 1998).  Note that for some people, sound may be damaging at even lower levels than 85 dB A.  Exposures to other ototoxins (such as pesticides, some medications including chemotherapy agents, solvents, etc.) can lead to greater susceptibility to noise damage, as well as causing their own damage.  This is called a synergistic interaction.
Some American health and safety agencies (such as OSHA, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and MSHA, the Mine Safety and Health Administration), use an exchange rate of 5 dB.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.msha.gov/regs/complian/guides/noise/g3appendixb.htm|title=Compliance Guide to MSHA's Occupational Noise Exposure Standard, APPENDIX B – GLOSSARY OF TERMS[/tpl]  While this exchange rate is simpler to use, it drastically underestimates the damage caused by very loud noise.  For example, at 115 dB, a 3 dB exchange rate would limit exposure to about half a minute; the 5 dB exchange rate allows 15 minutes.
Many people are unaware of the presence of environmental sound at damaging levels, or of the level at which sound becomes harmful.  Common sources of damaging noise levels include car stereos, children's toys, transportation, crowds, lawn and maintenance equipment, power tools, gun use, and even hair dryers.  Noise damage is cumulative; all sources of damage must be considered to assess risk.  If one is exposed to loud sound (including music) at high levels or for extended durations (85 dB A or greater), then hearing impairment will occur.  Sound levels increase with proximity; as the source is brought closer to the ear, the sound level increases.
Mainly, deafness or hard of hearing happens in the older.
In the USA, 12.5% of children aged 6–19 years have permanent hearing damage from excessive noise exposure.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/noise/ | title=Noise-Induced Hearing Loss: Promoting Hearing Health Among Youth | work=CDC Healthy Youth! | publisher=CDC | date=2009-07-01 | accessdate= [/tpl]

===Genetic===

Hearing loss can be inherited. Around 75–80% of all cases are inherited by recessive genes, 20–25% are inherited by dominant genes, 1–2% are inherited by X-linked patterns, and fewer than 1% are inherited by mitochondrial inheritance.[tpl]cite web|last=Rehm|first=Heidi|title=The Genetics of Deafness; A Guide for Patients and Families|url=http://hearing.harvard.edu/info/GeneticDeafnessBookletV2.pdf|work=Harvard Medical School Center For Hereditary Deafness|publisher=Harvard Medical School[/tpl]
When looking at the genetics of deafness, there are 2 different forms, syndromic and nonsyndromic.  Syndromic deafness occurs when there are other medical problems aside from deafness in an individual.  This accounts for around 30% of deaf individuals who are deaf from a genetic standpoint.  Nonsyndromic deafness occurs when there are no other problems associated with an individual other than deafness.  From a genetic standpoint, this accounts for the other 70% of cases, which attributes to the vast majority of hereditary hearing loss.   Syndromic cases occur with diseases such as Usher syndrome, Stickler, Waardenburg syndrome, Alport's Syndrome, and Neurofibromatosis type 2.  These are diseases that have deafness as one of the symptoms or a common feature associated with it.  The genetics that correspond with these various diseases are very complicated and are difficult to explain scientifically because the cause is unknown.  In nonsyndromic cases where deafness is the only ‘symptom’ seen in the individual it is easier to pinpoint the physical genes.
Recent gene mapping has identified dozens of nonsyndromic dominant (DFNA#) and recessive (DFNB#) forms of deafness.

===Illness===

====Neurological disorders====

Neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis and strokes can have an effect on hearing as well. Multiple sclerosis, or MS, is an autoimmune disease where the immune system attacks the myelin sheath, a covering that protects the nerves. Once the myelin sheaths are destroyed they cannot be repaired. Without the myelin to protect the nerves, nerves become damaged, creating disorientation for the patient. This is a painful process and may end in the debilitation of the affected person until they are paralyzed and have one or more senses gone. One of those may be hearing. If the auditory nerve becomes damaged then the affected person will become completely deaf in one or both ears. There is no cure for MS.[tpl]cite web | title=Multiple Sclerosis | url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/multiple-sclerosis/DS00188 | publisher=Mayo Clinic | date=2010-12-11 | accessdate=2011-12-02[/tpl] Depending on what nerves are damaged from a stroke, one of the side effects can be deafness.[tpl]cite web | title=Stroke | url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/stroke/DS00150 | publisher=Mayo Clinic | date=2010-07-01 | accessdate=2011-12-02[/tpl] Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease variant 1E (CMT1E)  is noted for demyelinating in addition to deafness.http://omim.org/entry/118300

===Medications===

Some medications cause irreversible damage to the ear, and are limited in their use for this reason. The most important group is the aminoglycosides (main member gentamicin) and platinum based chemotherapeutics such as cisplatin.
Some medications may reversibly affect hearing. This includes some diuretics, aspirin and NSAIDs, and macrolide antibiotics. According to a study by researchers at Brigham and Woman's Hospital in Boston, the link between nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen and hearing loss tends to be greater in women, especially those who take ibuprofen six or more times a week.[tpl]cite web | url=http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/176/6/544.abstract?sid=750067d3-6651-49ac-b40b-82ee5a3fc27b/ | title=Analgesic Use and the Risk of Hearing Loss in Women | first1=Sharon G. | last1=Curhan | first2=Josef | last2=Shargorodsky | first3=Roland | last3=Eavey | first4=Gary C. | last4=Curhan | date=2012-02-29 | publisher=Oxford Journals: American Journal of EPIDEMIOLOGY | accessdate= [/tpl] Others may cause permanent hearing loss.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.asha.org/public/hearing/Ototoxic-Medications/ | title=Ototoxic Medications (Medication Effects) | publisher=ASHA | first1=Barbara | last1=Cone | first2=Patricia | last2=Dorn | first3=Dawn | last3=Konrad-Martin | first4=Jennifer | last4=Lister | first5=Candice | last5=Ortiz | first6=Kim | last6=Schairer | publisher=American Speech-Language-Hearing Association | accessdate= [/tpl] On October 18, 2007, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that a warning about possible sudden hearing loss would be added to drug labels of PDE5 inhibitors, which are used for erectile dysfunction.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/2007/ucm109012.htm | title=FDA Announces Revisions to Labels for Cialis, Levitra and Viagra | author= | date=2007-10-18| publisher=Food and Drug Administration | accessdate=2011-10-30 [/tpl]

===Chemicals===

In addition to medications, hearing loss can also result from specific drugs; metals, such as lead; solvents, such as toluene (found in crude oil, gasoline[tpl]cite web | url=http://toxtown.nlm.nih.gov/text_version/chemicals.php?id=30 | title=Tox Town – Toluene – Toxic chemicals and environmental health risks where you live and work – Text Version | publisher=toxtown.nlm.nih.gov | accessdate=2010-06-09 [/tpl] and automobile exhaust, for example); and asphyxiants.[tpl]cite news | title=Addressing the Risk for Hearing Loss from Industrial Chemicals | first=Thais C. | last=Morata | work= | url=http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noise/pubs/presentations/AOHC.swf | publisher=CDC | accessdate=2008-06-05 [/tpl] Combined with noise, these ototoxic chemicals have an additive effect on a person’s hearing loss.
Hearing loss due to chemicals starts in the high frequency range and is irreversible. It damages the cochlea with lesions and degrades central portions of the auditory system. For some ototoxic chemical exposures, particularly styrene,[tpl]cite journal | last=Johnson | first=Ann-Christin | title=Occupational exposure to chemicals and hearing impairment – the need for a noise notation | journal=Karolinska Institutet | pages=1–48 | url=http://awww.arbetsmiljoverket.se/dokument/arkiv/neg/Chemicals_and_hearing_impairment.pdf | format=PDF | date=2008-09-09 | accessdate=2009-06-19 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120906103148/http://awww.arbetsmiljoverket.se/dokument/arkiv/neg/Chemicals_and_hearing_impairment.pdf | archivedate=2012-09-06 [/tpl] the risk of hearing loss can be higher than being exposed to noise alone. Controlling noise and using hearing protectors are insufficient for preventing hearing loss from these chemicals. However, taking antioxidants helps prevent ototoxic hearing loss, at least to a degree.  The following list provides an accurate catalogue of ototoxic chemicals:

===Physical trauma===

There can be damage either to the ear itself or to the brain centers that process the aural information conveyed by the ears.
People who sustain head injury are especially vulnerable to hearing loss or tinnitus, either temporary or permanent. I. King Jordan lost his hearing after suffering a skull fracture as a result of a motorcycle accident at age 21."The World of the Deaf," The Washington Post, February 26, 1978, p. G1.
Lesions to the auditory association cortex produced by physical trauma can result in deafness and other problems in auditory perception. The place where the lesion occurs on the auditory cortex plays an important role in what type of hearing deficit will occur in a person. A study conducted by Clarke et al. (2000) tested three subjects for the ability to identify a produced environmental sound, the source of the sound, and whether or not the source is moving. All three subjects had trauma to different parts of the auditory cortex, and each patient demonstrated a different set of auditory deficits, suggesting that different parts of the auditory cortex controlled different parts of the hearing process.Carlson, N. R. (2010). Physiology of behavior. (11 ed.). Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Pearson Education, Inc. This means, lesion one part of auditory cortex and it could result in one or two deficits. It would take larger lesions at the right parts to produce deafness.

===Neurobiological factors===

From a neurobiological perspective, there are simply two reasons that could cause a person to be deaf: either there is something wrong with the mechanical portion of the process, meaning the ear, or there is something wrong with the neural portion of the process, meaning the brain.
The process of understanding how sound travels to the brain is imperative in understanding how and why these two reasons would cause a person to go deaf. The process is as follows: sound waves are transmitted to the outer ear, sound waves are conducted down to ear canal, bringing the sound waves to the eardrum where they vibrate, these vibrations are now passed through the 3 tiny ear bones in the middle, which cause the fluid to move in the inner ear, the fluid moves the hair cells, the movement of the hair cells cause the vibrations to be converted into nerve impulses, the nerve impulses are taken to the brain by the auditory nerve,U.S.C. (2012). How We Hear. Sc.edu. Retrieved from http://www.sc.edu/ehs/modules/Noise/hearing.htm the auditory nerve takes the impulses to the medulla oblongata, the brainstem send the impulses to the midbrain, which finally goes to the auditory cortex of the temporal lobe to be interpreted as sound.Hayes, K. (2009). Hear. About.com. Retrieved from http://ent.about.com/od/entanatomybasics/ht/How We Hear.htm
This process is complex and involves several steps that depend on the previous step in order for the vibrations or nerve impulses to be passed on.  This is why if anything goes wrong at either the mechanical or neural portion of the process, it could result in sound not being processed by the brain, hence, leading to deafness.

==Diagnosis==

The severity of a hearing impairment is ranked according to the additional intensity above a nominal threshold that a sound must be before being detected by an individual; it is (measured in decibels of hearing loss, or dB HL). Hearing impairment may be ranked as mild, moderate, moderately severe, severe or profound as defined below:
Hearing sensitivity varies according to the frequency of sounds. To take this into account, hearing sensitivity can be measured for a range of frequencies and plotted on an audiogram.
For certain legal purposes such as insurance claims, hearing impairments are described in terms of percentages. Given that hearing impairments can vary by frequency and that audiograms are plotted with a logarithmic scale, the idea of a percentage of hearing loss is somewhat arbitrary, but where decibels of loss are converted via a recognized legal formula, it is possible to calculate a standardized "percentage of hearing loss" which is suitable for legal purposes only.
Another method for quantifying hearing impairments is a speech-in-noise test. As the name implies, a speech-in-noise test gives an indication of how well one can understand speech in a noisy environment. A person with a hearing loss will often be less able to understand speech, especially in noisy conditions. This is especially true for people who have a sensorineural loss – which is by far the most common type of hearing loss. As such, speech-in-noise tests can provide valuable information about a person's hearing ability, and can be used to detect the presence of a sensorineural hearing loss. A triple-digit speech-in-noise test was developed by RNID as part of an EU funded project Hearcom. The RNID version is available over the phone, on the web[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.rnid.org.uk/howwehelp/hearing_check/web | title=Take the check! – Action On Hearing Loss: RNID | publisher=RNID | deadurl=no | accessdate=2013-01-22[/tpl] and as an app on the iPhone.

===Classification===

Hearing impairments are categorized by their type, their severity, and the age of onset (before or after language is acquired). Furthermore, a hearing impairment may exist in only one ear (unilateral) or in both ears (bilateral). There are three main types of hearing impairments, conductive hearing impairment and sensorineural hearing impairment and a combination of the two called mixed hearing loss.

====Conductive hearing loss====

A conductive hearing impairment is present when the sound is not reaching the inner ear, the cochlea. This can be due to external ear canal malformation, dysfunction of the eardrum or malfunction of the bones of the middle ear. The ear drum may show defects from small to total resulting in hearing loss of different degree. Scar tissue after ear infections may also make the ear drum dysfunction as well as when it is retracted and adherent to the medial part of the middle ear.
Dysfunction of the three small bones of the middle ear – malleus, incus, and stapes – may cause conductive hearing loss. The mobility of the ossicles may be impaired for different reasons and disruption of the ossicular chain due to trauma, infection or anchylosis may also cause hearing loss.

====Sensorineural hearing loss====

A sensorineural hearing loss is one caused by dysfunction of the inner ear, the cochlea, the nerve that transmits the impulses from the cochlea to the hearing centre in the brain or damage in the brain. The most common reason for sensorineural hearing impairment is damage to the hair cells in the cochlea. Depending on the definition it could be estimated that more than 50% of the population over the age of 70 has impaired hearing.

====Mixed hearing loss====

Mixed hearing loss is a combination of the two types discussed above. Chronic ear infection (a fairly common diagnosis) can cause a defective ear drum or middle-ear ossicle damages, or both. Surgery is often attempted but not always successful. On top of the conductive loss, a sensory component is often added. If the ear is dry and not infected, an air conduction aid could be tried; if the ear is draining, a direct bone condition hearing aid is often the best solution. If the conductive part of the hearing loss is more than 30–35 dB, an air conduction device could have problems overcoming this gap. A direct bone conduction aid like the Baha or the Ponto could, in this situation, be a good option.

====Before language====

Prelingual deafness is hearing impairment that is sustained before the acquisition of language, which can occur due to a congenital condition or through hearing loss in early infancy. Prelingual deafness impairs an individual's ability to acquire a spoken language. Children born into signing families rarely have delays in language development, but most prelingual hearing impairment is acquired via either disease or trauma rather than genetically inherited, so families with deaf children nearly always lack previous experience with sign language. Cochlear implants allow prelingually deaf children to acquire an oral language with remarkable success if implantation is performed within the first 2–4 years.Kral A, O'Donoghue GM. Profound Deafness in Childhood. New England J Medicine 2010: 363; 1438-50.

====After language====

Post-lingual deafness is hearing impairment that is sustained after the acquisition of language, which can occur due to disease, trauma, or as a side-effect of a medicine. Typically, hearing loss is gradual and often detected by family and friends of affected individuals long before the patients themselves will acknowledge the disability.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2010[/tpl] Common treatments include hearing aids, cochlear implants and learning lip reading. Post-lingual deafness is far more common than pre-lingual deafness.
Those who lose their hearing later in life, such as in late adolescence or adulthood, face their own challenges, living with the adaptations that allow them to live independently.

====Unilateral and bilateral====

People with unilateral hearing loss or single-sided deafness (SSD) have difficulty in:
In quiet conditions, speech discrimination is approximately the same for normal hearing and those with unilateral deafness; however, in noisy environments speech discrimination varies individually and ranges from mild to severe.
A similar effect can result from King-Kopetzky syndrome (also known as Auditory disability with normal hearing and obscure auditory dysfunction), which is characterized by an inability to process out background noise in noisy environments despite normal performance on traditional hearing tests. See also: "cocktail party effect", House Ear Institute's Hearing In Noise Test.
One reason for the hearing problems these patients often experience is due to the head shadow effect. Newborn children with no hearing on one side but one normal ear could still have problems.Lieu JE. Speech-language and educational consequences of unilateral hearing loss in children. Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 2004: 130(5);524-30. Speech development could be delayed and difficulties to concentrate in school are common. More children with unilateral hearing loss have to repeat classes than their peers. Taking part in social activities could be a problem. Early aiding is therefore of utmost importance.

==Screening==

The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for all newborns.
The American Academy of Pediatrics advises that children should have their hearing tested several times throughout their schooling:
There is not enough evidence to determine the utility of screening in adults over 50 years old who do not have any symptoms.[tpl]cite web | url=http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=1309706 | title=Screening for Hearing Loss in Older Adults: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement | publisher=The American College of Physicians | work=Annals of Internal Medicine | first=Virginia A. | last=Moyer| date=2012-11-06 | volume=157 | issue=9 | pages=655–661 | accessdate=2012-11-06 [/tpl]

==Prevention==

It is estimated that half of cases of hearing loss are preventable. A number of preventative strategies are effective including: immunization against rubella to reduce congenital infections, immunization against H. influenza and S. pneumoniae to reduce cases of otitis media, and avoiding or protecting against excessive noise exposure. Education on the perils of hazardous noise exposure increases the use of hearing protectors.[tpl]cite journal | last1=El Dib | first1=R.P. | last2=Mathew | first2=J.L. | last3=Martins | first3=R.H. | title=Interventions to promote the wearing of hearing protection | journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online) | date=2012-04-18 | volume=4 | pages=CD005234 | pmid=22513929 | doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005234.pub5 | editor1-last=El Dib | editor1-first=Regina P[/tpl]

==Management==

There are a number of devices that can improve hearing in those who are hearing impaired or deaf or allow people with these conditions to manage better in their lives.

===Hearing aids===

Hearing aids, which amplify the incoming sound, will improve hearing ability, but nothing can restore normal hearing.[tpl]why?|date=July 2013[/tpl][tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]

===Cochlear implants===

Cochlear implants improve outcomes in people with hearing loss in either one or both ears.[tpl]cite journal | title=Cochlear Implantation in Adults A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis | journal=JAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surgery | year=2013 | doi=10.1001/jamaoto.2013.1744[/tpl] They work by artificial stimulation of the cochlear nerve by providing an electric impulse substitution for the firing of hair cells. They are expensive, and require programming along with extensive training for effectiveness. Cochlear implant are at higher risk for bacterial meningitis. Thus, meningitis vaccination is recommended.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/safety/cochlear.html | title=FDA Public Health Notification: Risk of Bacterial Meningitis in Children with Cochlear Implants |publisher=FDA | date=2002-07-24 | accessdate=2008-11-09[/tpl] People who have hearing impairments, especially those who develop a hearing problem in childhood or old age, may need support and technical adaptations as part of the rehabilitation process. Recent research shows variations in efficacy but some studies[tpl]cite web | url=http://cochlearimplant.net/page5/page5.html | title=Elliot & Oliver's Story – Research | publisher=cochlearimplant.net | year=2006 | accessdate= | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080302225726/http://www.cochlearimplant.net/page5/page5.html | archivedate=2008-03-02[/tpl] show that if implanted at a very young age, some profoundly impaired children can acquire effective hearing and speech, particularly if supported by appropriate rehabilitation.

===Assistive devices===

Many hearing impaired individuals use assistive devices in their daily lives:

===Wireless devices===

A wireless device has two main components: a transmitter and a receiver. The transmitter broadcasts the captured sound, and the receiver detects the broadcast audio and enables the incoming audio stream to be connected to accommodations such as hearing aids or captioning systems. 
Three types of wireless systems are commonly used: FM, audio induction loop, and InfraRed. Each system has advantages and benefits for particular uses. FM systems can be battery operated or plugged into an electrical outlet. FM system produce an analog audio signal, meaning they have extremely high fidelity. Many FM systems are very small in size, allowing them to be used in mobile situations. The audio induction loop permits the listener with hearing loss to be free of wearing a receiver provided that the listener has a hearing aid or cochlear implant processor with an accessory called a "telecoil".  If the listener does not have a telecoil, then he or she must carry a receiver with an earpiece. As with FM systems, the infrared (IR) system also requires a receiver to be worn or carried by the listener. An advantage of IR wireless systems is that people in adjoining rooms cannot listen in on conversations, making it useful for situations where privacy and confidentiality are required. Another way to achieve confidentiality is to use a hardwired amplifier, which contains or is connected to a microphone and transmits no signal beyond the earpiece plugged directly it.

===Classroom===

For a classroom setting, children with hearing impairments often benefit from interventions. One simple example is providing favorable seating for the child. Having the student sit as close to the teacher as possible improves the student's ability to hear the teacher's voice and to more easily read the teacher's lips. When lecturing, teachers should try to look at the student as much as possible and limit unnecessary noise in the classroom. In particular, the teacher should avoid talking when their back is turned to the classroom, such as while writing on a whiteboard. 
Some other approaches for classroom accommodations include pairing hearing impaired students with hearing students. This allows the hearing impaired student to ask the hearing student questions about concepts that they have not understood. The use of CART (Communication Access Real Time) systems, where an individual types a captioning of what the teacher is saying, is also beneficial.[tpl]cite web | url=http://deafness.about.com/cs/cart/a/cart.htm | title=CART Systems | publisher= | accessdate= [/tpl] The student views this captioning on their computer. Automated captioning systems are also becoming a popular option.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.auditorysciences.com/ | title=Auditory Sciences | publisher=Auditory Sciences | accessdate= [/tpl] In an automated system software, instead of a person, is used to generate the captioning. Unlike CART systems, automated systems generally do not require an Internet connection and thus they can be used anywhere and anytime. Another advantage of automated systems over CART is that they are much lower in cost. However, automated systems are generally designed to only transcribe what the teacher is saying and to not transcribe what other students say. An automated system works best for situations where just the teacher is speaking, whereas a CART system will be preferred for situations where there is a lot of classroom discussion.
