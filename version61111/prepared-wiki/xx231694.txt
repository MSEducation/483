Trau, schau, wem! (Take Care in Whom You Trust!), Op. 463, is a waltz composed by Johann Strauss II. The composition was dedicated to the portrait painter Franz von Lenbach, and was based on melodies from Strauss' operetta Waldmeister – the work is therefore also known as "Waldmeister Walzer". It premiered on 15 December 1895 in the Golden Hall of the Vienna Musikverein, conducted by Eduard Strauss.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.naxosdirect.com/title/8.223233 |title=STRAUSS II, J.: Edition – Vol. 33|accessdate=7 October 2008|publisher=NaxosDirect[/tpl]
