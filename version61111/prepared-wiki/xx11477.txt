Vacuum has been a frequent topic of philosophical debate since ancient Greek times, but was not studied empirically until the 17th century. Evangelista Torricelli produced the first laboratory vacuum in 1643, and other experimental techniques were developed as a result of his theories of atmospheric pressure. A torricellian vacuum is created by filling with mercury a tall glass container closed at one end and then inverting the container into a bowl to contain the mercury.How to Make an Experimental Geissler Tube, Popular Science monthly, February 1919, Unnumbered page, Scanned by Google Books: http://books.google.com/books?id=7igDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT3
Vacuum became a valuable industrial tool in the 20th century with the introduction of incandescent light bulbs and vacuum tubes, and a wide array of vacuum technology has since become available. The recent development of human spaceflight has raised interest in the impact of vacuum on human health, and on life forms in general.

==Etymology==

The word vacuum comes [tpl]ety|la||an empty space, void[/tpl], noun use of neuter of vacuus, meaning "empty", related to vacare, meaning "be empty".
Vacuum is one of the few words in the English language that contains two consecutive letter ues.[tpl]Cite web | title=What words in the English language contain two u's in a row? | work=Oxford Dictionaries Online | url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/page/twousinarow | accessdate=2011-10-23 | postscript=[tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl] [/tpl]

==Classical Field Theories==

The strictest criteria to define a vacuum is a region of space and time where all the components of the stressâ€“energy tensor are zero. It means that this region is empty of energy and momentum, and by consequence, it must be empty of particles and other physical fields (such as electromagnetism) that contain energy and momentum.

===Gravity===

In general relativity, a vanishing stress-energy tensor implies, through Einstein field equations, the vanishing of all the components of the Ricci tensor. Vacuum does not mean that the curvature of space-time is necessarily flat: the gravitational field can still produce curvature in a vacuum in the form of tidal forces and gravitational waves (technically, these phenomena are the components of the Weyl tensor). The black hole (with zero electric charge) is an eloquent example of a region completely "filled" with vacuum, but still showing a strong curvature.

===Electromagnetism===

In classical electromagnetism, the vacuum of free space, or sometimes just free space or perfect vacuum, is a standard reference medium for electromagnetic effects.[ref]
