==Setting and characters==

In the storyline, the Earth has been ravaged by pollution and natural disasters of all sorts. To escape this, humanity built vast underground cities in which they lived for approximately 600 years. Upon emerging, the humans found that the world had been reclaimed by previously extinct lifeforms (most spectacularly, dinosaurs).[tpl]cite news|title= A World Where Car Fan Is a Must |work= The Los Angeles Times|date=1992-06-16|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1992-06-16/business/fi-644_1|accessdate=2010-11-13[/tpl]   In the new 'Xenozoic' era, technology is extremely limited and those with mechanical skills command a great deal of respect and influence.    
The two chief protagonists of the series are mechanic Jack Tenrec and scientist and love interest, Hannah Dundee.  Tenrec operates a garage in which he restores cars, particularly Cadillacs.  Given that the post-apocalyptic world no longer possesses the ability to refine oil, Tenrec modifies his cars to run on dinosaur guano.  These cars, of course, are frequently chased by rampaging dinosaurs in pulp action-style adventure stories.
Other characters include various criminals, politicians, scientists, and inventors who populate the dystopian world of tomorrow.  There is also a race of reptilian humanoids who cannot speak in a human language but instead communicate by spelling words with Scrabble tiles.  These creatures have befriended Tenrec, and apparently have the ability to communicate telepathically with the dinosaurs. Added into the mix is Hermes, an allosaurus Jack raised, and who basically acts as the most threatening guard dog one could ask for.
