The Villa ''San Michele'' was built around the turn of the 20th century on the Isle of Capri, Italy, by the Swedish physician and author Axel Munthe. 

==Description==

The villa's gardens have panoramic views of the town of Capri and its harbour, the Sorrentine Peninsula, and Mount Vesuvius.  The villa sits on a ledge at the top of the Phoenician Steps, between Anacapri and Capri, at a height of 327 meters above sea level.
San Michele's gardens are adorned with many relics and works of art dating from ancient Egypt and other periods of classical antiquity. They now form part of the Grandi Giardini Italiani.
The story of the villa is recorded by Axel Munthe in his book The Story of San Michele, first published in 1929 and reprinted many times since then.
Between 1919 and 1920, Munthe was an unwilling landlord to the outrageous socialite and muse Luisa Casati, who took possession of Villa San Michele. This was described by the Scottish author Compton Mackenzie in his diaries.[tpl]cite book| title=Infinite variety: the life and legend of the Marchesa Casati|first=Scot D.|last=Ryersson|first2=Michael Orlando|last2=Yaccarino.|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=2004|pages=233|isbn=0-8166-4520-5[/tpl]
