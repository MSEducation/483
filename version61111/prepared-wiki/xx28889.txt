==Plot summary==

After losing to Fats, Eddie could spiral down to the scrapheap, but he meets Bert Gordon, a [tpl]Cuegloss|Stake|stakehorse[/tpl].  Bert teaches him about winning, or more particularly about losing.  Tautly written, it is a treatise on how someone, with all of the skills, can lose if he "wants" to lose; how a loser is beaten by himself, not by his opponent; and how he can learn to win, if he can look deeply enough into himself.
The book was followed by the sequel The Color of Money.
