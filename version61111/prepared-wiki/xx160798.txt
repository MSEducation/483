Dracut Senior High School is the public senior high school in the Merrimack Valley town of Dracut, Massachusetts.
The high school's colors are Columbia blue, navy blue, silver and white. The team name is the Middies and the symbol is an anchor, except for in Football where the logo is a "Lightning Sword".  These are references to midshipmen, as historically, the town was a place where U.S. Navy uniforms were created. The original Dracut High was built in the early 1950s and was frequently overcrowded, as roughly 1,600 students attend the school that was built for a fraction of that number, approximately 900. However, in 2011, the state approved funding to construct a new Dracut High School. The majority of the project was constructed in 2013; with the project anticipated for completion in August 2014. Sophomores, juniors and seniors at the school are using the new building; but due to construction, freshmen are using a wing of the Lakeview Junior High School, next door, through the end of the 2013-14 school year.

The Music Department has received numerous awards for their productions. 
Dracut High's Football team won the 2008 Division II State Championship on the back of their quarterback, Matt Grimard, who was selected as the Massachusetts Gatorade Player of the Year for 2008. The football team also made the playoffs in 2009 & 2010, but lost in the Semi-Finals both years.
The school was the first in Massachusetts to ban iPods and other electronic devices during school hours. This set a precedent that has been followed by 14 other schools, including Acton-Boxboro, Cohasset, Gloucester, and Durfee.
Dracut High School is surrounded by 3 other schools: the Lakeview Junior High School, George H. Englesby Intermediate School and Brookside Elementary School.
