There are three separate car parking areas that serve Heatherdale station. One is just to the north of platform 2 and is accessible from Heatherdale Road. A second car park is beside the railway line on the eastern side of Heatherdale Road, stretching towards EastLink and has been redeveloped as part of its project. The Heatherdale Road entrance will no longer serve as an exit but a new section has been added between the railway and Maroondah Highway and will provide the exit and a new entrance. A third parking area surrounds the power transmission pylons on Molan Street. A fourth car park, accessed from Newman Street, opened in June 2013 to replace the ones being closed at Mitcham as part of the Mitcham Road crossing removal works Mitcham Level Crossing Removals VicRoads
As part of the EastLink tollway project, Heatherdale was upgraded in 2007. The works were funded by ConnectEast. Upgrades included extra parking spaces, upgraded lighting and security measures, a new pedestrian crossing at Heatherdale Road and construction of new station buildings. The original station buildings were demolished and new shelters built. New lighting and signage was also installed along the platforms.
