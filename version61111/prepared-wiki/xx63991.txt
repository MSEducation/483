Laura Catherine Schlessinger (born January 16, 1947) is an American talk radio host, socially conservative commentator and author.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/102290|title=Listen Up, Callers: No Whining Allowed|last=King|first=Patricia|coauthors=Kendall Hamilton|date=May 27, 1996|publisher=Newsweek|accessdate=19 February 2010[/tpl] Her radio program consists mainly of her responses to callers' requests for personal advice and has occasionally featured her short monologues on social and political topics. Her website says that her show "preaches, teaches, and nags about morals, values and ethics".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.drlaura.com/pages/faq|title=The Dr. Laura Program - Top 10 questions|work=Frequently asked questions|publisher=DrLaura.com|accessdate=November 26, 2010[/tpl]
Previously, Schlessinger combined a local radio career with a private practice as a marriage and family counselor, but after going into national syndication she concentrated her efforts on the daily The Dr. Laura Program, and on authoring self-help books. The books Ten Stupid Things Women Do to Mess Up Their Lives, and The Proper Care and Feeding of Husbands are among her bestselling works. A short-lived television talk show hosted by Schlessinger was launched in 2000. In August 2010, she announced that she would end her syndicated radio show in December 2010.
Her show moved to Sirius XM Radio's Sirius XM Stars on January 3, 2011. Schlessinger announced a "multi-year" deal to be on satellite radio.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20101126/ap_en_tv/us_tv_dr_laura|title=Laura Schlessinger shifts to satellite radio|last=Bauder|first=David|date=November 26, 2010|publisher=Yahoo!

==Early life and education==

Schlessinger was born in Brooklyn, New York, and raised in Brooklyn and on Long Island.Bane, Vickie, pp. 20, 23. Her parents were Monroe "Monty" Schlessinger, a civil engineer of Jewish heritage, and Yolanda (Ceccovini) Schlessinger, an Italian Catholic war bride.[tpl]cite news|title=Diagnosing Dr. Laura|last=Bennetts|first=Leslie|work=Vanity Fair|publisher=Conde Nast Publications|issn=0733-8899|date=September 1998[/tpl]Her parents had met and married in Gorizia during the World War II liberation of Italy, World Net Daily, 4-11-2006. Schlessinger has said her father was charming and her mother beautiful as a young woman. She has a sister, Cindy, who is 11 years her junior.[tpl]cite book|title=Dr. Laura: An Unauthorized Biography|last=Bane|first=Vickie|year=2000|publisher=St. Martin's Paperbacks|page=24|isbn=978-0-312-97122-9[/tpl] Schlessinger has described her childhood environment as unloving and unpleasant, and her family as dysfunctional. She has ascribed some of the difficulty to extended family rejection of her parents' mixed faith Jewish-Catholic marriage.[tpl]cite web|url=http://70.85.195.205/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=49682|title=How to redeem a bad childhood|last=Schlessinger|first=Laura|date=April 11, 2006|publisher=World Net Daily[/tpl] Schlessinger said her father was "petty, insensitive, mean, thoughtless, demeaning and downright unloving". She described her mother as a person with "pathological pride", who "was never grateful", who "would always find something to criticize," and who "constantly expressed disdain for men, sex and love". She credited her father with giving her the drive to succeed.
Schlessinger attended Westbury High School and Jericho High School where she showed an interest in science.Bane, Vickie pp. 23, 26-28. She received a bachelor's degree from Stony Brook University.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/08/19/dr-lauras-ironic-college-_n_688022.html|title=Dr. Laura's Ironic College Journalism: Young Reporter Covered Obscenity Scandal|date=August 19, 2010|publisher=The Huffington Post||first=Leah|last=Finnegan[/tpl] Moving to Columbia University for graduate studies,Bane, Vickie, pp. 53-55. she earned a master's and Ph.D. in physiology in 1974. Her doctoral thesis was on insulin's effects on laboratory rats.Schelssinger, Laura. "The Effects of Insulin on 3-0-Methyglucose Transport in Isolated Rat Adipocytes"."DAI, 36, no. 05B, (1974): 2093[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/people/feature/1999/08/23/drlaura/print.html|last=Milam|first=Lorenzo W|title=Tell Laura I love her|date=August 23, 1999|publisher=Salon|[/tpl] After she began dispensing personal advice on the radio, she obtained training and certification in marriage and family counseling from the University of Southern California, and a therapist's license from the State of California. In addition, she opened up a part-time practice as a marriage and family counselor.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.drlaura.com/about/|title=About Dr. Laura|year=2009|publisher=DrLaura.com|[/tpl]The California Department of Consumer Affairs' Board of Behavioral Science's Online License / Registration Verification shows that she holds a Marriage And Family Therapist license, issued January 11, 1980, expiration February 28, 2013.

==Radio career==

Schlessinger's first appearance on radio was in 1975 when she called into a KABC show hosted by Bill Ballance. Impressed by her quick wit and sense of humor, Ballance began featuring her in a weekly segment.Bane, Vickie p. 63. Schlessinger's stint on Ballance's show led to her own shows on a series of small radio stations. By 1979 she was on the air Sunday evenings from 9:00 to midnight on KWIZ in Santa Ana, California. That year, the Los Angeles Times described her show as dealing with all types of emotional problems, "though sex therapy is the show's major focus".[tpl]cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/648626232.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Dec+4%2C+1979&author=JAMES+BROWIN&pub=Los+Angeles+Times+(1886-Current+File)&edition=&startpage=H1|title=Talk of the Town: Open-mike radio shows that encourage you to talk back|last=Brown|first=James|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=December 4, 1979|page=H9[/tpl](free abstract, article available for a fee)
In the late 1980s, Schlessinger was filling in for Barbara De Angelis' noon-time relationship-oriented talk show in Los Angeles on KFI, while working weekends at KGIL in San Fernando. Her big break came when Sally Jessy Raphael began working at ABC Radio, and Maurice Tunick, former Vice-President of Talk Programming for the ABC Radio Networks, needed a regular sub for Raphael's evening personal advice show. Tunick chose Schlessinger to fill in for Raphael.
Ultimately, Schlessinger began broadcasting a daily show on KFI which was nationally syndicated in 1994 by Synergy, a company owned by Schlessinger and her husband. In 1997, Synergy sold its rights to the show to Jacor Communications, Inc., for $71.5 million. Later, Jacor  merged with Clear Channel Communications and a company co-owned by Schlessinger, Take On The Day, LLC, acquired the production rights. The show became a joint effort between Take On The Day, which produced it, Talk Radio Network, which syndicated and marketed it to radio stations, and Premiere Radio Networks, (a subsidiary of Clear Channel), which provided satellite facilities and handled advertising sales. As of September 2009, Schlessinger  broadcast from her home in Santa Barbara, California with KFWB as her flagship station.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.radio-online.com/cgi-bin/rol.exe/headline_id=n19579|title=News KFWB-AM/Los Angeles Readies News/Talk Flip|publisher=Radio Online|date=August 10, 2009[/tpl] Podcasts and live streams of the show have been available on her website for a monthly fee, and the show was also on XM Satellite Radio.
At its peak, The Dr. Laura Program was the second-highest-rated radio show after The Rush Limbaugh Show, and was heard on more than 450 radio stations. Writing in 1998, Leslie Bennett described the popularity of the show:
In May 2002, the show still had an audience of more than 10 million, but had lost several million listeners in the previous two years as it was dropped by WABC and other affiliates, and was moved from day to night in cities such as Seattle and Boston. These losses were attributed in part to Schlessinger's shift from giving relationship advice to lecturing on morality and conservative politics. Pressure from gay rights groups caused dozens of sponsors to drop the radio show as well.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/2002/05/13/2002-05-13_maglaura_s_star_falling.html|title=Mag: Dr. Laura's Star Falling|last=Hinckley|first=David|publisher=N.Y. Daily News|date=May 13, 2002|location=New York[/tpl] In 2006, Schlessinger's show was being aired on approximately 200 stations. As of 2009, it was tied for third place along with The Glenn Beck Program and The Savage Nation.[tpl]cite news|url=http://talkers.com/online/?p=71|title=The Top Talk Radio Audiences|date=September 2009|publisher=Talkers Magazine|[/tpl]
Schlessinger used "Hot Talkin' Big Shot", a song by country and blues singer and songwriter Nikki Hornsby, for several years as cue music for her radio program and for a national radio commercial advertising for the show.[tpl]cite web|url=http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=viewImage&friendID=79852674&albumID=803078&imageID=18559692 |title=Myspace |publisher=Viewmorepics.myspace.com |date=2013-08-30 |accessdate=2013-09-04[/tpl]
On August 17, 2010, during an appearance on Larry King Live, Schlessinger announced the end of her radio show saying that her motivation was to "regain her First Amendment rights",[tpl]cite news|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/celebritology/2010/08/dr_laura_to_end_her_radio_care.html|title=Dr. Laura to end her radio career|author=Jen Chaney|coauthors=Liz Kelly|date=August 17, 2010|publisher=Washington Post|[/tpl] and that she wanted to be able to say what is on her mind without "some special interest group deciding this is a time to silence a voice of dissent."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.rttnews.com/Content/EntertainmentNews.aspx?Section=2&Id=1397054&SM=1|title=Dr. Laura Resigns After Racist Rant|date=August 18, 2010|author=RTT Staff Writer|publisher=RTT News|[/tpl] Several of her affiliates and major sponsors had dropped her show after her on air use of a racial epithet on August 10.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/auto/index.ssf/2010/08/general_motors_ends_sponsorshi.html|title=General Motors ends Dr. Laura sponsorship after N-word flap; host plans to end show this year|publisher=MLive.com|[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=129268632|title=Dr. Laura Plans To End Radio Show At End Of Year|agency=Associated Press|date=August 18, 2010|publisher=NPR|author=AP staff reporter|[/tpl]
On January 3, 2011, Schlessinger's show moved exclusively to Sirius XM Radio.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/26/AR2010112601996.html?nav=rss_artsandliving/entertainmentnews|title=Laura Schlessinger shifts to satellite radio|last=Bauder|first=David|date=November 26, 2010|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=26 November 2010[/tpl]

==Television show==

In 2000, Schlessinger signed a deal with Paramount Domestic Television to produce a syndicated talk show, which would be carried mainly by television stations owned and operated by CBS. The producers hoped to extend the success of Schlessinger's radio show to daytime television, however, the show was controversial before it ever aired, and it proved to be short-lived.
In the months before the premiere of her TV show, Schlessinger called homosexuality a "biological error", said that homosexuality was acceptable as long as it was not public, and said that homosexuals should not attempt to adopt children. She regularly compared gay parenting to pedophilia by reiterating her view that "a huge portion of the male homosexual populace is predatory on young boys."[tpl]cite web|url=http://stopdrlaura.com/laura/index.htm|title=Words of Dr. Laura|year=2000|publisher=StopDrLaura.com[/tpl] Schlessinger was frequently criticized in lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transsexual (LGBT) media for these views. Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD), an LGBT media watchdog group, began monitoring Schlessinger's on-air comments about LGBT people, posting transcripts of relevant shows on its website.
In March 2000, a group of gay activists launched StopDrLaura.com, an online campaign with the purpose of convincing Paramount to cancel the Dr. Laura television show prior to its premiere.We Stopped Dr. Laura.

The first episode of Schlessinger's television show aired September 11, 2000. Critics and viewers complained that the format had been dumbed down and did not stand out from any other daytime talk show. The biting rhetoric that worked well on radio seemed overly harsh for face-to-face discourse, owing to the normal sympathetic nature of most other daytime hosts; the radical change in Schlessinger's demeanor from her radio persona left viewers cold. Ultimately, the television show failed to generate the energy and interest of Schlessinger's radio show.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&contentId=A9459-2000Sep14|title=A Case of the Creeps: 'Dr. Laura' on UPN Looks Better on Radio|last=Shales|first=Tom|date=September 15, 2000|publisher=Washington Post|page=C 01|[/tpl]
The credibility of Schlessinger's television program also suffered during its first month when the New York Post reported that Schlessinger had used show staff to falsely pose as guests on the show. A September 25, 2000, episode named "Readin', Writin', and Cheatin'" featured a so-called college student who specialized in professional note-taking. On the next day's show, "Getting to the Altar," the same guest appeared in different hair and makeup and said she was a woman living with her boyfriend. In fact, the woman was San-D Duchas, a researcher for the show whose name appeared in the closing credits of the shows on which she posed as a guest.[tpl]cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=114986&page=1|title=Dr. Laura Accused of Using Fake Guest|date=October 3, 2000|publisher=ABC News|author=ABC News Staff|[/tpl] Apparently, Schlessinger was unaware of this incident until it was disclosed by the Post, and immediately put a stop to any further use of this practice.
By November 2000, advertisers that had originally committed to Schlessinger's show left, and the ratings plummeted.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/2004/11/08/2004-11-08_laura_s_advice_to_self__skip.html|title=Laura's Advice To Self: Skip TV|last=Hinckley|first=David|date=November 8, 2004|publisher=New York Daily News|[/tpl] CBS directed its stations to move the show to a late-night slot or replace it altogether.[tpl]cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/SHOWBIZ/TV/11/07/dr.laura/|title=CBS shoves Dr. Laura into late night slots, or dumps her|date=November 7, 2000|work=Entertainment TV|publisher=CNN|[/tpl] Other stations outside of CBS did the same thing, while others moved it to weaker sister stations. The television show was cancelled in March 2001 and last aired in September 2001.
In 2004, Schlessinger said that although there is more money and celebrity in television, it is not as meaningful or intimate as radio, and for her television was a "terrible experience".

==Publications==

===Books===

Schlessinger has written thirteen books for adults and four for children. Several follow the mold of her successful Ten Stupid Things Women Do to Mess Up Their Lives, with similarly named books giving advice for men, couples, and parents, while others are more moral in orientation.

===Magazine===

For several years, Schlessinger published a monthly magazine, Dr. Laura Perspective. She was the editor, her husband a contributing photographer, and her son the creative consultant.[tpl]cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/25475468.html?dids=25475468:25475468&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jan+18%2C+1998&author=JANET+WISCOMBE&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&desc=COVER+STORY%3B+I+Don%27t+Do+Therapy%3B+Dr.+Laura+Schlessinger%2C+the+Country%27s+Top+Female+Radio+Personality%2C+Calls+Herself+a+Prophet.+What+She+Frequently+Calls+Others+Is+an+Entirely+Different+Matter.&pqatl=google|title=I Don't Do Therapy; Dr. Laura Schlessinger, the Country's Top Female Radio Personality, Calls Herself a Prophet|last=Wiscombe|first=Janet|date=January 18, 1998|publisher=Los Angeles Times Magazine|work=Cover story[/tpl] The magazine has since gone out of publication.

===Website===

Schlessinger has a website which contains hints for stay-at-home parents, her blog, a reading list, and streaming audio of her shows (by subscription only). When it was started, 310,000 people tried to access it simultaneously and it crashed. Certain aspects of feminism are often discussed on her website; she was a self-proclaimed feminist in the 1970s, but is now opposed to feminism.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.drlaurablog.com/2007/01/08/womens-work-saves-womens-lives/#more-30|title=Women's Work Saves Women's Lives Feminism Kills Women|last=Schlessinger|first=Laura|publisher=Dr. Laura's blog|date=January 8, 2007[/tpl]

==Charitable work==

Schlessinger created the Laura Schlessinger Foundation to help abused and neglected children in 1998. Schlessinger regularly asked her on-air audience to donate items for My Stuff bags, which go to children in need. All other donations came from other people or groups, usually in the form of donated items for the bags. Per the foundation's reports, money not used for operations was directed toward pro-life organizations, such as crisis pregnancy centers. In September 2004, Schlessinger announced that she was closing down the foundation because it had become too difficult and costly for her and her husband to underwrite, and they wished to devote their "energies and resources to other pressing needs".[tpl]cite web|title=Statement by Dr. Laura Regarding The Dr. Laura Schlessinger Foundation Closing|date=September 2004|publisher=DrLaura.com, reprinted in The Free Republic[/tpl]
In 2007, Schlessinger began fundraising for Operation Family Fund, an organization which aids the families of fallen or seriously injured veterans of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. In 2008, she helped raise more than $1 million for the organization.

Schlessinger has received numerous awards from both media and conservative organizations.

==Religious beliefs==

Schlessinger was non-religious until she and her son began practicing Conservative Judaism in 1996. In 1998, Schlessinger, Bishop, and their son converted to Orthodox Judaism,Although Schlessinger's father was Jewish, her mother was not, thus, she was not a Jew under Jewish law, and conversion was required in order for her to become an Orthodox Jew. [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jewishaz.com/jewishnews/010323/laura.shtml|title=Loved and hated, 'Dr. Laura' receives award|last=Wiener|first=Julie|publisher=Jewish News of Greater Phoenix|date=March 23, 2001[/tpl] and began instruction under Rabbi Reuven P. Bulka of Ottawa, Ontario.  During this time, Schlessinger sometimes used Jewish law and examples to advise her callers about their moral dilemmas. She occasionally clarified ethical and moral issues with her local Orthodox Rabbi Moshe D. Bryski, before mentioning them on the air. She was embraced by many in the politically conservative segment of Orthodox Judaism for bringing more awareness of Orthodoxy to her radio show. Some of her expressed views were explicitly religious, and are referenced her 1999 book The Ten Commandments: The Significance of God's Laws in Everyday Life. Although her other books have stressed the importance of morality, they are more secular in nature.
In July 2003, Schlessinger announced on her show that she was no longer an Orthodox Jew.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/7887/|title=Dr. Laura Loses Her Religion Radio Host Drops Judaism|last=Keys|first=Lisa|publisher=The Forward|date=August 15, 2003[/tpl]

==Marriage and family life==

Schlessinger met and married Michael F. Rudolph, a dentist, in 1972 while she was attending Columbia University. The couple had a Unitarian ceremony.Bane, Vickie pp. 53-55 Separating from Rudolph, Schlessinger moved to Encino, California in 1975 when she obtained a job in the science department at the University of Southern California.Bane, Vickie pp. 58, 64. Their divorce was finalized in 1977.Bane, Vickie pp. 63, 83.
In 1975, while working in the labs at USC, she met Lewis G. Bishop, a professor of neurophysiology who was married and the father of three children.Bane, Vickie p. 82.

===Use of racial epithet===

On August 10, 2010, Nita Hanson, a black woman married to a white man, called Schlessinger's show to ask for advice on how to deal with a husband who did not care when she received racist comments by acquaintances. Schlessinger first replied that "some people are hypersensitive" and because of that she'd need at least 2 good examples of racism the caller had received. The caller informed Schlessinger that the acquaintances in question had stated, "How you black people do this? You black people like doing that." Schlessinger responded by telling the caller that her examples weren't racist and that "A lot of blacks only voted for Obama simply because he was half black. Didn't matter what he was going to do in office; it was a black thing. You gotta' know that. That's not a surprise." Schlessinger continued by telling the caller, "chip on your shoulder," "sensitive," "Don't NAACP me," "A lot of what I heard from Jade pseudonym is a lot of what I hear from black think and it's really distressing and disturbing," etc.CNN: Dr. Laura's rant: In her own words.

During the call, Schlessinger also used the word "nigger" eleven times. When Hanson asked, "Is it ever ok to say that word?" Schlessinger responded, "It depends how it’s said. Black guys talking to each other seem to think it’s ok." After the call Schlessinger said, "If you're that hypersensitive about color and don't have a sense of humor, don't marry out of your race." After the call, Schlessinger immediately took herself off the air, and early that evening wrote an apology to Los Angeles Radio People online journalist Don Barrett.
