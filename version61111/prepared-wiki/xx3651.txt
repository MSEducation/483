The reference to fragrance may refer to the harbour waters sweetened by the fresh water estuarine influx of the Pearl River, or to the incense from factories lining the coast to the north of Kowloon, which was stored around Aberdeen Harbour for export before the development of Victoria Harbour.

The name was often written as the single word Hongkong until the government adopted the current form in 1926.Hongkong Government Gazette, Notification 479, 3 September 1926 Nevertheless, some century-old organisations still use the single-word form, such as the Hongkong Post, Hongkong Electric and the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation.
The Mandarin pronunciation of the name [tpl]lang|zh-hant|香港[/tpl] is represented in pinyin as [tpl]transl|zh|Xiānggǎng[/tpl]. Unlike place names in Mainland China, which are now mostly romanised into English using (Mandarin-based) pinyin spelling, the official English name in this case remains the traditional Hong Kong.
The full official name is "Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China", this being the official convention employed on the Chinese text of the Hong Kong regional emblem, the text of the Hong Kong Basic Law, and the Hong Kong Government website,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gov.hk/en/residents/ |title=GovHK: Residents |publisher=Hong Kong Government |accessdate=29 September 2010[/tpl] although "Hong Kong Special Administrative Region" and "Hong Kong" are also accepted. (Chinese versions of the territory's names can be found in the lower box to the right.)
Hong Kong has many nicknames, but the most famous is "Pearl of the orient" (Cantonese: Dong Fong Chi Chu), reflecting the impressive city lights on both sides of Victoria Harbour, and the numerous high rise buildings.

In 1839 the refusal by Qing dynasty authorities to import opium resulted in the First Opium War between China and Britain. Hong Kong Island was occupied by British forces on 20 January 1841 and was initially ceded under the Convention of Chuenpee as part of a ceasefire agreement between Captain Charles Elliot and Governor Qishan, but the agreement was never ratified due to a dispute between high-ranking officials in both governments.[tpl]cite book|last=Courtauld|first=Caroline|last2=Holdsworth|first2=May|last3=Vickers|first3=Simon|year=1997|title=The Hong Kong Story|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=38–58|isbn=978-0-19-590353-9[/tpl] It was not until 29 August 1842 that the island was formally ceded in perpetuity to the United Kingdom under the Treaty of Nanking.

When the Union Flag was raised over Possession Point on 26 January 1841, the population of Hong Kong island was about 7,450, mostly Tanka fishermen and Hakka charcoal burners living in a number of coastal villages. In the 1850s large numbers of Chinese would emigrate from China to Hong Kong due to the Taiping Rebellion. Other events such as floods, typhoons and famine in mainland China would also play a role in establishing Hong Kong as a place to escape the mayhem.John Thomson 1837–1921,Chap on Hong Kong, Illustrations of China and Its People (London,1873–1874)Info Gov HK. "Hong Kong Gov Info[tpl]dead link|date=October 2013[/tpl]." History of Hong Kong. Retrieved on 16 February 2007.
The establishment of the free port made Hong Kong a major entrepôt from the start, attracting people from China and Europe alike. The society remained racially segregated and polarised due to British colonial policies and attitudes. Despite the rise of a British-educated Chinese upper class by the late 19th century, race laws such as the Peak Reservation Ordinance prevented Chinese from living in elite areas like Victoria Peak. Politically, the majority Chinese population also had little to no official governmental influence throughout much of the early years. There were, however, a small number of Chinese elites that the British governors relied on, including Sir Kai Ho and Robert Hotung.They accepted their place in the Hong Kong hierarchy, and served as main communicators and mediators between the government and the Chinese population. Sir Kai Ho was an unofficial member of the Legislative Council. Robert Hotung wanted Chinese citizens to recognise Hong Kong as the new home after the fall of China's last dynasty in 1911. As a millionaire with financial influence, he emphasised that no part of the demographics was purely indigenous.
According to the census of 1865, Hong Kong had a population of 125,504, of which some 2,000 were Americans and Europeans. In 1914 despite an exodus of 60,000 Chinese fearing an attack on the colony during World War I, Hong Kong's population continued to increase from 530,000 in 1916 to 725,000 in 1925 and 1.6 million by 1941.Linda Pomerantz-Zhang (1992). "Wu Tingfang (1842–1922): reform and modernization in modern Chinese history". Hong Kong University Press. p.8. ISBN 962-209-287-X In 1860 after China's defeat in the Second Opium War, the Kowloon Peninsula and Stonecutter's Island were ceded in perpetuity to Britain under the Convention of Peking. In 1894 the deadly Third Pandemic of bubonic plague spread from China to Hong Kong, causing 50,000–100,000 deaths.
In 1898 under the terms of the Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory, Britain obtained a 99-year lease of Lantau Island and the adjacent northern lands, which became known as the New Territories.[tpl]cite book|first=Trea|last=Wiltshire|title=Old Hong Kong|volume=Volume II: 1901–1945|page=148|publisher=FormAsia Books|edition=5th|year=1997|isbn=962-7283-13-4[/tpl] Hong Kong's territory has remained unchanged to the present.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.globaltimes.cn/www/english/life/travel/chinamap/2010-07/548745.html|title=History of Hong Kong|newspaper=Global Times|date=6 July 2010|accessdate=31 August 2010[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=November 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=Political change and the crisis of legitimacy in Hong Kong|first=Ian|last=Scott|year=1989|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|page=6|isbn=978-0-8248-1269-0[/tpl] During the first half of the 20th century, Hong Kong was a free port, serving as an entrepôt of the British Empire.

Through a policy of enforced repatriation of the unemployed to the mainland throughout the period, because of the scarcity of food, the population of Hong Kong had dwindled from 1.6 million in 1941 to 600,000 in 1945, when the United Kingdom resumed control of the colony.[tpl]cite news|last=Bradsher|first=Keith|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/17/international/asia/17cnd-hong.html|title=Thousands March in Anti-Japan Protest in Hong Kong|newspaper=The New York Times|date=17 April 2005|accessdate=20 October 2010[/tpl]

===Cold War era===

Hong Kong's population recovered quickly as a wave of migrants from China arrived for refuge from the ongoing Chinese Civil War. When the PRC was proclaimed in 1949, more migrants fled to Hong Kong for fear of persecution by the Communist Party. Many corporations in Shanghai and Guangzhou shifted their operations to Hong Kong.
In the 1950s Hong Kong's rapid industrialization was driven by textile exports and other expanded manufacturing industries. As the population grew and labour costs remained low, living standards rose steadily. The construction of Shek Kip Mei Estate in 1953 followed a massive slum fire, and marked the beginning of the public housing estate programme designed to cope with the huge influx of immigrants. Trade in Hong Kong accelerated even further when Shenzhen, immediately north of Hong Kong, became a special economic zone of the PRC, and Hong Kong was established as the main source of foreign investment in China.[tpl]cite web|first=Shang-Jin|last=Wei|date=January 2000|url=http://www.nber.org/chapters/c8501.pdf|title=Why Does China Attract So Little Foreign Direct Investment?|pages=6–8|publisher=National Bureau of Economic Research|format=PDF|accessdate=10 November 2009[/tpl] The manufacturing competitiveness gradually declined in Hong Kong due to the development of the manufacturing industry in southern China beginning in the early 1980s. By contrast, the service industry in Hong Kong experienced high rates of growth in the 1980s and 1990s after absorbing workers released from the manufacturing industry.[tpl]cite book|work=Hong Kong, China: Growth, Structural Change, and Economic Stability During the Transition|publisher=International Monetary Fund|year=1997|page=54|isbn=1-55775-672-4|first=John|last=Dodsworth|first2=Dubravko|last2=Mihaljek[/tpl]
Throughout the British colonial era, Hong Kong was industrialized and developed in all aspects from its economy to its health care system. Many health facilities were built for its citizens, such as the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, the Queen Mary Hospital, the Princess Margaret Hospital and the Prince of Wales Hospital. The Urban Council and Regional Council played a significant role in improving the sanitary conditions of the territory, and developed numerous culture and recreation facilities for residents. The development of the rapid transit railway system from the 1970s-on, a massive undertaking, greatly improved the experience of travel within the territory and served as a model for other such systems in Asia.Forsyth, Neil, dir. Underground Pride. Mass Transit Railway Corporation, 1990. Film. 21 November 2013 In 1983, when the United Kingdom reclassified Hong Kong from a British crown colony to a dependent territory, the governments of the United Kingdom and China were already discussing the issue of Hong Kong's sovereignty due to the impending expiration (within two decades) of the lease of the New Territories. In 1984 the Sino-British Joint Declaration – an agreement to transfer sovereignty to the People's Republic of China in 1997 – was signed. It stipulated that Hong Kong would be governed as a special administrative region, retaining its laws and a high degree of autonomy for at least 50 years after the transfer. The Hong Kong Basic Law, which is based on English law, would serve as the constitutional document after the transfer. It was ratified in 1990.

===Since 1997===

On 1 July 1997 the transfer of sovereignty from United Kingdom to the PRC occurred, officially ending 156 years of British colonial rule. Hong Kong became China's first special administrative region, and Tung Chee-Hwa took office as the first Chief Executive of Hong Kong. That same year, Hong Kong suffered an economic double blow from the Asian financial crisis and the H5N1 avian influenza.

The Executive Council is headed by the Chief Executive who is elected by the Election Committee and then appointed by the Central People's Government.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.basiclaw.gov.hk/en/basiclawtext/chapter_4.html#section_6|title=Basic Law, Chapter IV, Section 6|publisher=Basic Law Promotion Steering Committee|accessdate=10 November 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gov.hk/en/about/abouthk/factsheets/docs/civil_service.pdf|title=Civil Service|publisher=Information Services Department, Hong Kong Government|date=June 2009|accessdate=6 September 2010[/tpl] The civil service is a politically neutral body that implements policies and provides government services, where public servants are appointed based on meritocracy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.basiclaw.gov.hk/en/basiclawtext/chapter_4.html#section_1|title=Basic Law, Chapter IV, Section 1|publisher=Basic Law Promotion Steering Committee|accessdate=10 November 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Burns|first=John P.|title=Government Capacity and the Hong Kong Civil Service|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-590597-7|page=114[/tpl] The Legislative Council has 60 members, half of whom are directly elected by universal suffrage by permanent residents of Hong Kong according to five geographical constituencies.

The implementation of the Basic Law, including how and when the universal suffrage promised therein is to be achieved, has been a major issue of political debate since the transfer of sovereignty. In 2002, the government's proposed anti-subversion bill pursuant to Article 23 of the Basic Law, which required the enactment of laws prohibiting acts of treason and subversion against the Chinese government, was met with fierce opposition, and eventually shelved.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.basiclaw.gov.hk/en/basiclawtext/chapter_2.html|title=Basic Law, Chapter II|publisher=Basic Law Promotion Steering Committee|accessdate=10 November 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hkhrm.org.hk/english/reports/present_abode.html|title=Presentation to Legislative Council on Right of Abode Issue|work=Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor|date=10 May 1999|accessdate=20 January 2007[/tpl] Debate between pro-Beijing groups, which tend to support the Executive branch, and the Pan-democracy campcharacterises Hong Kong's political scene, with the latter supporting a faster pace of democratisation, and the principle of one man, one vote.[tpl]cite book|last=Cohen|first=Warren I.|last2=Li|first2=Zhao|year=1997|title=Hong Kong Under Chinese Rule: The Economic and Political Implications of Reversion|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-62761-0|pages=220–235[/tpl]
In 2004 the government failed to gain pan-democrat support to pass its so-called "district council model" for political reform.[tpl]cite journal|title=The Legitimacy Problem and Democratic Reform in Hong Kong|last=Ming|first=Sing|journal=Journal of Contemporary China|volume= 15|issue=48|date=August 2006|pages=517–532|publisher=Informa|doi=10.1080/10670560600736558[/tpl] In 2009, the government reissued the proposals as the "Consultation Document on the Methods for Selecting the Chief Executive and for Forming the LegCo in 2012". The document proposed the enlargement of the Election Committee, Hong Kong's electoral college, from 800 members to 1,200 in 2012 and expansion of the legislature from 60 to 70 seats. The ten new legislative seats would consist of five geographical constituency seats and five functional constituency seats, to be voted in by elected district council members from among themselves.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cmab-cd2012.gov.hk/doc/consultation_document_en.pdf|title=Public Consultation on the Methods for Selecting the Chief Executive and for Forming the Legislative Council in 2012|date=11 June 2010|publisher=Hong Kong Government|accessdate=5 September 2010[/tpl] The proposals were destined for rejection by pan-democrats once again, but a significant breakthrough occurred after the Central People's Government accepted a counter-proposal by the Democratic Party. In particular, the Pan-democracy camp was split when the proposal to directly elect five newly created functional seats was not acceptable to two constituent parties. The Democratic Party sided with the government for the first time since the handover and passed the proposals with a vote of 46–12.[tpl]cite web|last=Balfour|first=Frederik|last2=Lui|first2=Marco|date=25 June 2010|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-06-25/hong-kong-lawmakers-approve-tsang-s-election-plan.html|title=Hong Kong Lawmakers Approve Tsang's Election Plan|work=Businessweek|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=6 October 2010[/tpl]

===Legal system and judiciary===

Hong Kong's legal system is completely independent from the legal system of mainland China. In contrast to mainland China's civil law system, Hong Kong continues to follow the English Common Law tradition established under British rule.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.doj.gov.hk/eng/legal/index.htm |title=The Legal System in Hong Kong|publisher=Department of Justice, Hong Kong Government|accessdate=20 September 2008[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=October 2013[/tpl] The essence of English common law is that it is made by judges sitting in courts, applying legal precedent (stare decisis) to the facts before them. For example, murder is a common law crime rather than one established by an Act of Parliament. Common law can be amended or repealed by Parliament; murder, for example, now carries a mandatory life sentence rather than the death penalty. According to Article 92[tpl]dead link|date=October 2013[/tpl] of the Basic Law, Hong Kong's courts may refer to decisions rendered by courts of other common law jurisdictions as precedents,[tpl]cite book|last=Ash|first=Robert F.|title=Hong Kong in Transition: One Country, Two Systems|year=2003|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-29954-1|pages=161–188|volume=Volume 11: RoutledgeCurzon Studies in the Modern History of Asia[/tpl] and judges from other common law jurisdictions, most commonly England, Canada and Australia, are allowed to sit as non-permanent judges of the Court of Final Appeal.
Structurally, the court system consists of the Court of Final Appeal, the High Court, which is made up of the Court of Appeal and the Court of First Instance, and the District Court, which includes the Family Court. Other adjudicative bodies include the Lands Tribunal, the Magistrates' Courts, the Juvenile Court, the Coroner's Court, the Labour Tribunal, the Small Claims Tribunal, and the Obscene Articles Tribunal.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.judiciary.gov.hk/en/crt_services/pphlt/html/guide.htm|title=Introduction |publisher=Hong Kong Judiciary|accessdate=20 September 2008[/tpl] Justices of the Court of Final Appeal are appointed by Hong Kong's Chief Executive. The Court of Final Appeal has the power of final adjudication with respect to the law of Hong Kong as well as the power of final interpretation over local laws including the power to strike down local ordinances on the grounds of inconsistency with the Basic Lawhttp://www.doj.gov.hk/eng/public/basiclaw/basic13_2.pdfhttp://www.doj.gov.hk/eng/public/basiclaw/basic10_3.pdf
The Department of Justice is responsible for handling legal matters for the government. Its responsibilities include providing legal advice, criminal prosecution, civil representation, legal and policy drafting and reform, and international legal cooperation between different jurisdictions. Apart from prosecuting criminal cases, lawyers of the Department of Justice act on behalf of the government in all civil and administrative lawsuits against the government. As protector of the public interest, the department may apply for judicial reviews and may intervene in any cases involving the greater public interest.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.doj.gov.hk/eng/about/sjo.htm |title=About Us: Organisation chart of the Secretary for Justice's Office|publisher=Department of Justice, Hong Kong Government|accessdate=5 September 2008[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=October 2013[/tpl] The Basic Law protects the Department of Justice from any interference by the government when exercising its control over criminal prosecution.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.basiclaw.gov.hk/en/basiclawtext/chapter_4.html#section_2|title=Basic Law, Chapter IV, Section 2|publisher=Basic Law Promotion Steering Committee|accessdate=10 November 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Weisenhaus|first=Doreen|first2=Jill|last2=Cottrell|first3=Mei Ning|last3=Yan|title=Hong Kong Media Law: A Guide for Journalists and Media Professionals|year=2007|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|isbn=978-962-209-808-4|page=74[/tpl]

===Foreign relations===

Hong Kong continues to play an active role in the international arena and maintains close contact with its international partners. Under the Basic Law, Hong Kong is exclusively in charge of its external relations, whilst the Government of the People's Republic of China is responsible for its foreign affairs. According to the Basic Law, Hong Kong may on its own, using the name "Hong Kong, China", maintain and develop relations and conclude and implement agreements with foreign states and regions and relevant international organizations in the appropriate fields, including the economic, trade, financial and monetary, shipping, communications, tourism, cultural and sports fields.Article 151, Hong Kong Basic Law
As a separate customs territory, Hong Kong maintains and develops relations with foreign states and regions, and plays an active role in such international organizations as World Trade Organization (WTO) and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) in its own right under the name of Hong Kong, China. Under such special status, Hong Kong's international partners usually exercise particular policies to maintain relations with Hong Kong. Examples include United States-Hong Kong Policy Act.
There is a large foreign representation in Hong Kong, including 59 consulates-general, 62 consulates and 5 officially recognised international bodies, such as Office of European Union.Chapter 1, Hong Kong Year Book 2011 Due to Hong Kong's unique status, some consulates-generals operate as their own independent mission. For example, the U.S. Consulate General to Hong Kong is not under the jurisdiction of the United States Ambassador to China, and reports directly to the U.S. Department of State. The consulates-general of the United Kingdom also reports directly to the Foreign Office, instead of going through the British Embassy in Beijing, the Chinese capital.Hong Kong Economic Journal, 3 July 2007, Page 34.

===Human rights===

Hong Kong's Basic Law in general provides Hong Kong a high level of civil liberties.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=22&year=2009&country=7741|title=Country Report 2009 |work=Freedom House |accessdate=14 December 2009[/tpl] The Hong Kong government generally respects the human rights of its citizens, although core issues remain.[tpl]cite web|url=http://hongkong.usconsulate.gov/ushk_hr_2009022501.html |title=2008 Human Rights Report: China (Hong Kong) |work=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=2 March 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100123204017/http://hongkong.usconsulate.gov/ushk_hr_2009022501.html |archivedate=23 January 2010[/tpl] There are concerns over the freedom of assembly which is restricted by the Public Order Ordinance.

Internet censorship in Hong Kong operates under different principles and regulations from those of mainland China.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/5.06/china_pr.html |title=The Great Firewall of China |publisher=Wired.com |date=1 February 1996 |accessdate=2 November 2011 |first1=Geremie R. |last1=Barme |first2=Sang |last2=Ye[/tpl]

===Administrative districts===

Hong Kong has a unitary system of government; no local government has existed since the two municipal councils were abolished in 2000. As such there is no formal definition for its cities and towns. Administratively, Hong Kong is subdivided into 18 geographic districts, each represented by a district council which advises the government on local matters such as public facilities, community programmes, cultural activities, and environmental improvements.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gov.hk/en/about/abouthk/factsheets/docs/district_admin.pdf|title=Hong Kong– The Facts: District Administration |publisher=Hong Kong Government |accessdate=31 August 2008[/tpl]
There are a total of 534 district council seats, 405 of which are elected; the rest are appointed by the Chief Executive and 27 ex officio chairmen of rural committees. The Home Affairs Department communicates government policies and plans to the public through the district offices.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.had.gov.hk/en/about_us/mission/mission.htm|title=Mission|publisher=Home Affairs Department, Hong Kong Government |date=30 June 2009|accessdate=10 November 2009[/tpl]

===Military===

When the PRC assumed sovereignty in 1997 the British barracks were replaced by a garrison of the People's Liberation Army, comprising ground, naval, and air forces, and under the command of the Chinese Central Military Commission. The Hong Kong Basic Law protects local civil affairs against interference by the garrison, and members of the garrison are subject to Hong Kong laws. The Hong Kong Government remains responsible for the maintenance of public order; however, it may ask the PRC government for help from the garrison in maintaining public order and in disaster relief. The PRC government is now responsible for the costs of maintaining the garrison.[tpl]cite book|last=Rioni|first=S.

==Geography and climate==

Hong Kong is located on China's south coast, [tpl]convert|60|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] east of Macau on the opposite side of the Pearl River Delta. It is surrounded by the South China Sea on the east, south, and west, and borders the Guangdong city of Shenzhen to the north over the Shenzhen River. The territory's [tpl]convert|1104|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl] area consists of Hong Kong Island, the Kowloon Peninsula, the New Territories, and over 200 offshore islands, of which the largest is Lantau Island. Of the total area, [tpl]convert|1054|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl] is land and [tpl]convert|50|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl] is inland water. Hong Kong claims territorial waters to a distance of [tpl]convert|3|nmi|km|abbr=out[/tpl]. Its land area makes Hong Kong the 179th largest inhabited territory in the world.[ref]
