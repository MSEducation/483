Andrew John Corbett (born 20 February 1982 in Worcester, England) is a former English footballer. He was part of the Kidderminster Harriers youth system but found first team opportunities limited to seven appearances in the Football League, and moved to Solihull Borough. At Solihull he was a prolific striker and earned a move to Nuneaton Borough. After just a few months at Nuneaton, Burton Albion secured his signature for a small fee.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.burtonmail.co.uk/Sport/Burton-Albion-FC/STRIKER-SIGNS-FOR-BREWERS.htm|title=STRIKER SIGNS FOR BREWERS|last=Page|first=Rex|date=14 November 2003|work=Burton Mail|accessdate=3 January 2011[/tpl] Ironically Corbett joined the Brewers as a striker but has found more success at right back and right midfield, winning the clubs player of the season award in 2005. He is noted more for his hard working ethic than his ability with a football.
Corbett was part of the 2008/2009 Conference National winning squad and signed a new deal with the club in May 2009.
