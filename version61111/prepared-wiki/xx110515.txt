[tpl]nihongo|Ms. Pac-Man Maze Madness|ミズパックマン メイズマッドネス[/tpl] is a 3D, four-directional control (block-based) puzzle game starring Ms. Pac-Man.  It was first released on the Sony PlayStation console, followed by release on the Nintendo 64 and Sega Dreamcast. Unlike the previous 20th Anniversary Pac-Man World, the player must follow along designated paths. It was well received for its simple gameplay, staying true to the original 'Ms. Pac-Man' game, but its multiplayer mode was at times heavily criticized.

==Plot==

Professor Pac learns that the evil forces have taken control of the Enchanted Castle, using black magic. The princess has vanished, and a witch named Mesmerelda is planning on stealing all four Gems of Virtue (Generosity; Truth; Wisdom; Courage) to control the "four wonders" (areas of Pac-Land). These four areas have enemies in them, and are blocked by mysterious force fields. Professor Pac creates a device called a Pactrometer which allows Ms. Pac-Man to go to these areas, to recover the gems before Mesmerelda can get them first.[tpl]cite book |last1=Daniels |first1=Chip |title=Ms. Ms. Pac-Man Maze Madness: Prima's Official Strategy Guide. |edition=Platform: Nintendo 64, Sega Dreamcast, PlayStation |accessdate=June 7, 2012 |page= 2 |publisher=Prima Games |isbn=0-7615-3046-0[/tpl] However as the Professor is telling Ms. Pac-Man this, he gets sucked into a mirror by the witch, leaving Ms. Pac-Man with the Pactrometer. As she journey's through the areas she is helped by video messages that the professor placed in the Pactrometer, and by holograms of Professor Pac.
As Ms. Pacman gathers the last of the gems they are stolen by Mesmerelda. A battle insues, the witch is defeated and runs away, leaving behind a key.[tpl]cite book |last1=Daniels |first1=Chip |title=Ms. Ms. Pac-Man Maze Madness: Prima's Official Strategy Guide. |edition=Platform: Nintendo 64, Sega Dreamcast, PlayStation |accessdate=June 7, 2012 |pages= 105–106|publisher=Prima Games |isbn=0-7615-3046-0[/tpl] Without the key Mesmerelda can't get to her into the castle, to reach her crystal ball, and thus can't use the gems.[tpl]cite video game |title=Ms. Pac-Man Maze Madness |developer=Namco, Mass Media Inc., Full Fat |publisher=Namco |date=September 8, 2000 |quote=Mesmerelda: My key!

Ms. Pac-Man then returns to fight for the gems, and this times wins, regaining the gems. With them and the Pactrometer the witch's spell is broken, and Mesmerelda returns to here true form as the princess.[tpl]cite video game |title=Ms. Pac-Man Maze Madness |developer=Namco, Mass Media Inc., Full Fat |publisher=Namco |date=September 8, 2000 |quote=Princess: I'm sorry, I never meant to hurt anyone, but I was under the spell of a evil witch.

==Gameplay==

The player must navigate a series of mazes with Ms. Pac-Man. Along the way she encounters such obstacles as moving blocks, exploding boxes, and locked doors. To help her, there is 'Pac-Dot Radar' to locate missing dots the player will need before being allowed to reach the next section of an level. Placed about the maze are such devises as spring tiles (to jump over the walls of the maze, and sometimes on top of them); switches, keys, hearts to regain her health, and 'Power Pellets' used to allow Ms. Pac-Man to eat all the enemies in the area for a limited time.[tpl]cite book |last1=Daniels |first1=Chip |title=Ms. Ms. Pac-Man Maze Madness: Prima's Official Strategy Guide. |edition=Platform: Nintendo 64, Sega Dreamcast, PlayStation |accessdate=June 7, 2012 |pages= 3–7, |publisher=Prima Games |isbn=0-7615-3046-0[/tpl]
As the player progresses they must eat yellow dots scattered about each area, once they have eaten enough of these a door will open allowing them to reach a new section of that area. Each area has its own amount of dots, as well as snacks such as fruit and pretzels. If the player can get all of these, as well as reaching the exit of the areas they are rewarded with a 'Gold Star'. Once an area is beaten the player can also play it again for a Time Trial, 'Gold Star', and 'Gold Clock'. Earning enough stars will unlock various features such as 'Bouns Rounds' between some levels, and a 'Movie Player' to watch the games animated scenes.[tpl]cite book |last1=Daniels |first1=Chip |title=Ms. Ms. Pac-Man Maze Madness: Prima's Official Strategy Guide. |edition=Platform: Nintendo 64, Sega Dreamcast, PlayStation |accessdate=June 7, 2012 |pages= 4, 8, and 9 |publisher=Prima Games |isbn=0-7615-3046-0[/tpl]
Each enemy and item that the player eats gives them more points, which can earn them additional lives, as well as allow them to unlock other features. After beating the games two bosses; the green 'Gobblin' a face like creature similar to Ms. Pac-Man, and the final boss 'Mesmerelda'. The player receives the 'Witch's Key' which allows them unlock various locations in the earlier areas. However, the game requires the player to beat the bosses twice, in order to see the game's ending.[tpl]cite book |last1=Daniels |first1=Chip |title=Ms. Ms. Pac-Man Maze Madness: Prima's Official Strategy Guide. |edition=Platform: Nintendo 64, Sega Dreamcast, PlayStation |accessdate=June 7, 2012 |pages= 106, 135 |publisher=Prima Games |isbn=0-7615-3046-0[/tpl]

The multiplayer mode allows up to 4 people to play simultaneously (although a player can play solo, verse three computer-controlled characters).[tpl]cite book |last1=Daniels |first1=Chip |title=Ms. Ms. Pac-Man Maze Madness: Prima's Official Strategy Guide. |edition=Platform: Nintendo 64, Sega Dreamcast, PlayStation |accessdate=June 7, 2012 |pages= 9–11 |publisher=Prima Games |isbn=0-7615-3046-0[/tpl]

===Classic Ms. Pac-Man===

The original arcade version of Ms. Pac-Man is freely playable as an option on the main menu, similar to how the original Pac-Man arcade game was freely available on the main menu of the 20th Anniversary Pac-Man World game. This was not included in the Game Boy Advance version.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/ms-pac-man-maze-madness/reviews/ms-pac-man-maze-madness-review-6110341/ |title=Ms. Pac-Man Maze Madness - Review and Statistical ratings of Game Boy Advance |author=Frank Provo |work=GameSpot.com |publisher=CBS Interactive Inc. |accessdate=June 7, 2012[/tpl]

==Reception==

The reception for Ms. Pac-Man Maze Madness was mainly positive. IGN stated on the Nintendo 64 review "The simple gameplay of Ms. Pac-Man Maze Madness makes it an ideal choice for young kids.", and also adds "However, solid gameplay and some great extras will interest us "older kids as well". GameSpot gave this game a rating of 65% for the PlayStation and Game Boy Advance, 68% for the Nintendo 64, and 69% for the Dreamcast, saying that "While Maze Madness may be overly easy for experienced gamers, the younger crowd and inexperienced gamers should have loads of fun with the game."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/ms-pac-man-maze-madness/reviews/ms-pac-man-maze-madness-review-2660947/ |title="Ms. PacMan Maze Madness Review" for Dreamcast version |author=Tim Tracy |work=GameSpot.com |publisher=CBS Interactive Inc. |accessdate=June 7, 2012[/tpl] The multiplayer mode received less favorable Nintendo Power, stated "The multiplayer mode stumbles,"[tpl]cite journal |date=November 2000 |title=Nintendo Power |volume=138 |page=122 |publisher=Nintendo of America format=magazine |accessdate=June 7, 2012[/tpl] while N64 Magazine gave it a much harsher description. "The Multiplayer mazes are viewed from three-quarters angle -- and the blurry visuals make it all but impossible to see what's going on." They also continue comparing the tag games as being "runined by the fact that the chasers move twice as fast as the other players." Their final comment on the 'Multiplayer' mode is simply "Terrible."[tpl]cite journal |date=December 2000 |title=N64 Magazine |issue=48 |pages=64–65 |publisher=Future Publishing format=magazine |accessdate=June 7, 2012[/tpl]
