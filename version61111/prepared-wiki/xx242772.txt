==Reception==

The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow awarded the album 4 stars and states: "Adderley's greatest band — his sextet with cornetist Nat Adderley, Yusef Lateef (on tenor, flute and oboe), pianist Joe Zawinul, bassist Sam Jones, and drummer Louis Hayes — is featured on such exciting numbers as 'Jessica's Day,' Jones' 'Unit 7,' and 'The Jive Samba.' A special treat of this live date is hearing the leader's introductory words to several of the songs".Yanow, S. Allmusic Review accessed 20 October 2009. The Penguin Guide to Jazz awarded the album 3 stars stating "on favourite turf in San Francisco, the band are in good fettle ".
