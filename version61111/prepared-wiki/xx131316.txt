He is noteworthy for being involved in two trades that played significantly in the fortunes of the teams involved.  In 1976, he was traded along with Bill Buckner from the Dodgers to the Cubs for Rick Monday. In 1981, he was traded from the Cubs to the Phillies for Ryne Sandberg and Larry Bowa. 
In 1977, he had 595 assists, the 5th highest total ever for a shortstop. In 1978 he scored the most runs in the NL, with 104. In 1981 he finished with a .194 batting average, zero home runs, and 13 RBIs.
Since retiring from the majors DeJesús has been coaching and managing in the minor league systems - with the Los Angeles Dodgers organization in 1990–91, Seattle Mariners in 1992, and as a coach with the Houston Astros organization starting in 1994. Since 2001 DeJesús has been a manager with various Astros minor league teams, and received the 2003 Player Development Man of the Year award. 
On January 13, 2010, DeJesús was named the Chicago Cubs first-base coach. Previously he worked as a special assistant to Cubs manager Lou Piniella. On August 23, 2010, DeJesús was named the Cubs third-base coach after Mike Quade was named the interim manager of the team.  In December 16, 2011, he was not renewed as third base coach for 2012.
