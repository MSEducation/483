RTI International (formerly Research Triangle Institute) is a nonprofit organization, headquartered in the Research Triangle Park in North Carolina, that provides research and technical services. It was founded in 1958 by local businesses and the three North Carolina universities that form the Research Triangle region, with $500,000 in funding. RTI started with departments for research in isotopes, operational sciences and statistics. It restructured into four departments in 1971 and later created the Office for International Projects, now called the International Development Group. 
RTI later divided itself into eleven departments, including Health Research, Drug Discovery & Development, Education & Training Research, Survey Research, among others. RTI researchers work with the US Agency for International Development, which has come to account for 35 percent of RTI's revenue. RTI has also conducted research on HIV/AIDS, healthcare, education curriculum and environmental studies among others.

The Research Triangle Institute (now RTI International) was formed as the research park's first tenant in 1958 by the park's founders.[tpl]cite news|title=North Carolina Taps Research Triangle|newspaper=The Christian Science Monitor|title=North Carolina Taps Research Triangle|date=February 12, 1960|accessdate=January 8, 2013|url= http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/csmonitor_historic/access/272246772.html?dids=272246772:272246772&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&date=Feb+12%2C+1960&author=By+Charles+Blankstein+Written+for+The+Christian+Science+Monitor&pub=Christian+Science+Monitor&desc=North+Carolina+Taps+Research+Triangle&pqatl=google|first=Charles|last=Blankstein[/tpl] In January the following year, it was announced that $1.425 million was raised by the Research Triangle Foundation to fund the park and $500,000 of it was set aside for RTI.[tpl]cite news|title=Research Institute to be set up near 3 North Carolina Schools|pp=116|newspaper=The New York Times|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10912FB3D5C1A7B93C0A8178AD85F4D8585F9|accessdate=December 18, 2012|date=January 12, 1959|accessdate=January 6, 2013[/tpl][tpl]citation|title=Research Triangle Park: Evolution and Renaissance|url=http://www.rtp.org/sites/default/files/RTP_History_0.pdf|date=June 2006|accessdate=January 9, 2013|first=Rick|last=Weddle|coauthors=Elizabeth Rooks and Tina Valdecanas|work=2006 IASP World Conference[/tpl]

In 1971, RTI's staff of 430 was reorganized into four research groups: social and economic systems, statistical sciences, environmental sciences and engineering, and chemistry and life sciences. It also created a division for education called the Center for Education Research and Evaluation. Four years later, RTI created the Office for International Programs to manage international projects. RTI provided financial assistance to help start the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics, which was founded in 1980,[tpl]cite news|title=Science, math school opens with first classes|publisher=Associated Press|date=October 3, 1980[/tpl] and two years later RTI was part of a joint venture to create MCNC, a non-profit that created an IT network connecting local K-12 schools.[tpl]cite news|first=Ruth|last=Walker|title=A research center takes root among pine and possums|newspaper=Christian Science Monitor|date=June 15, 1982|accessdate=January 9, 2013|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1982/0615/061543.html[/tpl] A Health Solutions division was formed, in 2000, to serve the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device industries.[tpl]cite news|newspaper=Triangle Business Journal|date=February 20, 2006|accessdate=January 19, 2013|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/triangle/stories/2006/02/20/daily4.html?jst=b_ln_hl|title=RTI International Buys Cary Company[/tpl]

==Organization==

RTI International is a not-for-profit research organization established by three local universities, but managed independently by a separate board and management team. RTI's structure consists of members of the corporation, the board of governors and corporate officers. The members of the corporation elect governors, who in turn create the organization's policies. Corporate officers are senior managers that report to the board for their area of responsibility.[tpl]citation|url=http://www.rti.org/page.cfm/Corporate_Governance|title=Corporate Governance|publisher=The Research Triangle Institute|accessdate=January 9, 2013[/tpl]

It bids on $2 billion in research contracts a year and wins approximately 40 percent of the budget it bids on. RTI operates according to a social responsibility policy.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.rti.org/page.cfm?obj=B4FD37F9-5056-B155-2C495A137D0E2714 |title=Sustainability Commitment |accessdate = March 2, 2013 |publisher=RTI International[/tpl]
