Computerman are a four piece indie synthpop band from Nottingham, although they are often referred to as a Leicester band due to two members heralding from rural South Leicestershire. They released their debut single with Must Destroy Records[tpl]Cite news | title = Computerman | periodical = BBC | publication-date = 2005-12-13 | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/nottingham/content/articles/2005/12/09/computerman_interview_feature.shtml | postscript = [/tpl] (once home to The Darkness and Do Me Bad Things) and have completed two national tours of the United Kingdom, including supporting Bristol's The Fallout Trust on their February 2006 tour. 
Formed from the ashes of two Leicester bands Carolgees and The Martells, Computerman released their debut single 'No More Broken Hearts / Watch More Television' in December 2005 which entered the Indie Singles chart at number 28 under the London label, 'Must Destroy'. A super-limited 10" remix of 'Watch More Television' was released in March 2006. The band's second single proper 'All Runways' was intended to follow in May 2006, with a promotional video, final mixes, artwork and a remix by label-mates Colon Openbracket being produced. However, the single was delayed and the band commenced work on their debut album. 
Computerman began recording sessions for their first studio album late in 2006. The working title was 'Death Of The Great Romantic'. Rob Crich, guitarist and keyboard player, left the band on January 30, 2007, having completed his contribution to the album sessions. Mixing of the album was completed during May 2008 following a long hiatus for the band, during which time Adam Pickering also joined Leicester band Minnaars.
Following a period of uncertainty the band decided to call it a day and never released the album, although some tracks have been circulated online.
The band hope to release the album for download at some stage in the future and play a show to draw a line under the final chapter of Computerman.
