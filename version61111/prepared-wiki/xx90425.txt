==History==

Before ACS, there was the old Xolotlan Airport, about 2 miles east of Managua, built in 1915 which very soon became too small for Managua's airline service growth.  Thus, on January 22, 1942, the Nicaraguan Government and Pan American Airways signed a contract to construct an airport by Las Mercedes Country Estate which inspired the name for Las Mercedes Airport.[tpl]cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Aeropuerto Internacional "Augusto C.

In the early 1970s, Las Mercedes was expanded to more modern standards, such as four health inspectors, eight immigration officers and ten customs inspectors.[tpl]cite news|first=|last=|coauthors=|title=History|date=|publisher=EAAI |url =http://www.eaai.com.ni/english/historia/index.shtml | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2007-10-17|language =|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070810010213/http://www.eaai.com.ni/english/historia/index.shtml  |archivedate = 2007-08-10[/tpl] It was considered fully equipped, having air conditioning, background music, loudspeakers and conveyor belts for baggage handling.[tpl]cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Managua International Airport | date= | publisher= | url =http://www.airplanes.com/airports/nicaragua/managua-intl-airport/ | work =Airplanes.com | pages = | accessdate = 2007-10-17 | language = | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071012083539/http://www.airplanes.com/airports/nicaragua/managua-intl-airport/| archivedate= 12 October 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] It also had a restaurant on its upper floor where visitors and travelers could see airport movement.
The expanded airport could serve three aircraft at once and by 1975 Lanica, the Airline of Nicaragua, as well as Taca, Sahsa, Avianca, Iberia, Pan Am, KLM, SAM, Varig, and smaller local carriers, flew into Las Mercedes. When the Sandinistas took power, the airport was named after Augusto César Sandino, a Nicaraguan revolutionary and guerrilla leader, after whom the Sandinista movement is named. The Sandinistas however did not maintain the airport, and it began to deteriorate until it was expanded and remodeled in 1996, when, among other things, two new boarding bridges were installed. The airport was renamed "Managua International Airport" in 2001 by then President Arnoldo Aleman and renamed again in 2007 to its current name by President Daniel Ortega.
Las Mercedes served for a very long time as a hub for Nicaragua's flag carriers Lanica (until 1978), Aeronica from 1979 to the 80's and NICA afterwards. When NICA became a member of Grupo TACA during the 1990s, the number of important connections to the rest of Latin America from which ACS grew considerably.
