Murmansk ([tpl]lang-ru|Му́рманск[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-sjd|Мурман ланнҍ[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-se|Murmánska[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-sms|Muurman[/tpl]) is a port city and the administrative centre of Murmansk Oblast, Russia, located in the extreme northwest part of Russia, on the Kola Bay, an inlet of the Barents Sea on the northern shore of the Kola Peninsula, not far from Russia's borders with Norway and Finland. Despite its extreme northern location above the Arctic Circle, Murmansk tends to be nearly the same as any other Russian city of its size, featuring highway and railway access to the rest of Europe, a railway station, and a trolleybus system, in fact, the northernmost on Earth. Population: [tpl]ru-census|p2010=307,257|p2002=336,137|p1989=468,039[/tpl] Despite its rapidly declining population, Murmansk remains the largest city north of the Arctic Circle.

==History==

Murmansk was the last city founded in the Russian Empire.The Moscow Times. It's Always Colder in Murmansk, May 20, 2012 In 1915, World War I needs led to the construction of the railroad from Petrozavodsk to an ice-free location on the Murman Coast in the Russian Arctic, to which Russia's allies shipped military supplies.Administrative-Territorial Division of Murmansk Oblast, p. 24 The terminus became known as the Murman station and soon boasted a port, a naval base, and an adjacent settlement with a population which quickly grew in size and soon surpassed the nearby towns of Alexandrovsk and Kola.
On [tpl]OldStyleDateNY|June 29|July 12[/tpl], 1916, Russian Transport Minister Alexander Trepov petitioned to grant urban status to the railway settlement. On [tpl]OldStyleDateNY|July 6|July 19[/tpl], 1916, the petition was approved and the town was named Romanov-on-Murman ([tpl]lang|ru|Рома́нов-на-Му́рмане[/tpl], Romanov-na-Murmane), after the royal Russian dynasty of Romanovs. On [tpl]OldStyleDateNY|September 21|October 4[/tpl], 1916, the official ceremony was performed, and the date is now considered the official date of the city's foundation. After the February Revolution of 1917, on [tpl]OldStyleDateNY|April 3|April 16[/tpl], 1917, the town was given its present name.Administrative-Territorial Division of Murmansk Oblast, pp. 60–63
In the winter of 1917 the British North Russia Squadron under Rear Admiral Thomas Kemp was established at Murmansk.[ref]

From 1918 to 1920, during the Russian Civil War, the town was occupied by the Western powers, who had been allied in World War I, and by the White Army forces.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.naval-history.net/WW1z05NorthRussia.htm|title=Bolshevik, North Russian, Royal Navy, Expeditionary Force, Archangel, Dvina River|publisher=Naval-history.net|accessdate=2010-12-08[/tpl]
On February 13, 1926, local self-government was organized in Murmansk for the first time, during a plenary session of the Murmansk City Soviet, which elected a Presidium. Prior to this, the city was governed by the authorities of Alexandrovsky Uyezd and later of Murmansk Governorate. On August 1, 1927, the All-Russian Central Executive Committee (VTsIK) issued two Resolutions: "On the Establishment of Leningrad Oblast" and "On the Borders and Composition of the Okrugs of Leningrad Oblast", which transformed Murmansk Governorate into Murmansk Okrug within Leningrad Oblast and made Murmansk the administrative center of Murmansk Okrug.
In 1934, the Murmansk Okrug Executive Committee developed a redistricting proposal, which included a plan to enlarge the city by merging the surrounding territories in the north, south, and west into Murmansk. While this plan was not confirmed by the Leningrad Oblast Executive Committee, in 1935–1937 several rural localities of Kolsky and Polyarny Districts were merged into Murmansk anyway.
According to the Presidium of the Leningrad Oblast Executive Committee resolution of February 26, 1935, the administrative center of Polyarny District was moved from Polyarnoye to Sayda-Guba.Administrative-Territorial Division of Murmansk Oblast, p. 48 However, the provisions of the resolution were not fully implemented, and due to military construction in Polyarnoye, the administrative center was instead moved to Murmansk in the beginning of 1935. In addition to being the administrative center of Murmansk Okrug, Murmansk also continued to serve as the administrative center of Polyarny District until September 11, 1938. On February 10, 1938, when the VTsIK adopted a Resolution changing the administrative-territorial structure of Murmansk Okrug, the city of Murmansk became a separate administrative division of the okrug, equal in status to that of the districts. This status was retained when Murmansk Okrug was transformed into Murmansk Oblast on May 28, 1938.
During World War II, Murmansk was a link to the Western world for Russia, with large quantities of goods important to the respective military efforts traded with the Allies: primarily manufactured goods and raw materials into the Soviet Union. The supplies were brought to the city in the Arctic convoys.
German forces in Finnish territory launched an offensive against the city in 1941 as part of Operation Silver Fox, and Murmansk suffered extensive destruction, the magnitude of which was rivaled only by the destruction of Leningrad and Stalingrad.Мурманску исполняется 90 лет[tpl]Ref-ru[/tpl]Газета «Вечерний Мурманск» Выпуск № 93 от 28 мая 2005 [tpl]ru icon[/tpl] However, fierce Soviet resistance and harsh local weather conditions prevented the Germans from capturing the city and cutting off the vital Karelian railway line and the ice-free harbour.
For the rest of the war, Murmansk served as a transit point for weapons and other supplies entering the Soviet Union from other Allied nations. This unyielding, stoic resistance was commemorated at the 40th anniversary of the victory over the Germans in the formal designation of Murmansk as a Hero City on May 6, 1985.[tpl]cite web|url=http://2004.murman.ru/nature/adm_delenie/murmansk/index-eng.shtml|title=Nature Administrative-territorial system|publisher=2004.murman.ru|date=1916-10-04|accessdate=2009-05-05[/tpl] During the Cold War Murmansk was a centre of Soviet submarine and icebreaker activity. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the nearby city and naval base of Severomorsk remains the headquarters of the Russian Northern Fleet.
In 1974, a massive [tpl]convert|35.5|m|sp=us|adj=on[/tpl] tall statue Alyosha, depicting a Russian World War II soldier, was installed on a [tpl]convert|7|m|sp=uk|adj=on[/tpl] high foundation. In 1984, the Hotel Arctic, the tallest building above the Arctic Circle, opened.
To commemorate the 85th anniversary of the city's foundation, the snow-white church of the Savior-on-the-Waters was modeled after the White Monuments of Vladimir and Suzdal and built on the shore for the sailors of Murmansk (see photograph).

City districts were established in Murmansk for the first time by the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR of April 20, 1939; at the time, three city districts (Kirovsky, Leninsky, and Mikoyanovsky) were created. They were abolished on June 2, 1948. The same city districts were created for the second time on June 23, 1951. Mikoyanovsky City District was renamed Oktyabrsky on October 30, 1957, but on September 30, 1958, all three city districts were again abolished. On June 10, 1967, two city districts were created (Leninsky and Oktyabrsky); Pervomaysky City District was split from Oktyabrsky on February 21, 1975. In the Charter of the Hero City of Murmansk, adopted on December 17, 1995, the city districts started to be referred to as administrative okrugs.
