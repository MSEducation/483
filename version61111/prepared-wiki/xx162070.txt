[[Ourapterygini]]

CATEGORIES: Ourapterygini

The Ourapterygini are one of the large tribes of geometer moths in the Ennominae subfamily. They are particularly plentiful in the Neotropics. Ourapterygini are generally held to be the youngest tribe of their subfamily, and at least seasonally have characteristic apomorphic asymmetrical processes of the anellus.Young (2008)
Many members of this tribe are remarkably butterfly-like. The tribe contains more partially diurnal species than usual for geometer moths, and many do not have the cryptic coloration typical for the family. There is a tendency to light yellowish hues and either little or a quite bold pattern, making some species rather conspicuous. It is known that at least some are noxious to predators, and such coloration might be aposematic.

As numerous ennomine genera have not yet been assigned to a tribe,See references in Savela (2008) the genus list is preliminary.
