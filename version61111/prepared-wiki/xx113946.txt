==Description==

This was the one and only UK number-one 1 single for Slik, although lead singer and songwriter Midge Ure went on to have two more number ones in the UK as a member of Band Aid with "Do They Know It's Christmas?" in 1984 and as a solo artist in 1985 with "If I Was". Ure went on to join New Wave band Ultravox, then a fledgling band led by Dennis Leigh, later known as John Foxx and a successful electronic musician, who also played glam rock material like Slik in their early days such as their previous single "Boogiest Band in Town", which was unsuccessful.
The success of "Forever and Ever" saw the band appear on Top of the Pops. It was guitarist and singer Midge Ure's first TV appearance. The single was backed with "Again My Love".
