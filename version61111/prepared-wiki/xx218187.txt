===Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD===

Two competing high-definition (HD) optical-disc formats, HD DVD and Blu-ray, were introduced in 2006. The HD DVD format, promoted by Toshiba, had the backing by the DVD Forum, which voted to make it the official successor to DVD. Opposing HD DVD was the Blu-ray format, led by the Blu-ray Disc Association, which shares many members with the DVD forum.
With HD DVD launched in March 2006 and Blu-ray launched in June of the same year, a format war started. Industry analysts likened the situation to the VHS/Betamax format war of the 1980s. At the time of their launch, consumer awareness of either high-definition format was severely limited, with the end result that most consumers avoided both formats, already content with DVD. In February 2008, Toshiba capitulated, citing low demand for HD DVD and the faster growth of Blu-ray, among other reasons.[tpl]cite web |title=E-commerce and VÃ­deo Distribution:DVD and Blu-ray |url=http://ecommerceandvideodistributiondvd.blogspot.com/[/tpl] Toshiba ended production of their HD DVD players and discontinued promotion of the format, while the HD DVD movie release schedule concluded by June 2008.
After HD DVD was discontinued, Blu-ray became the de facto high-definition optical disc format. However, sales figures suggest that DVD is in no immediate danger of disappearing. All standard DVDs will play on existing Blu-ray players, making the switch to Blu-ray much easier than the switch from VHS to DVD.  In addition, a growing number of hardware vendors are enhancing their Blu-ray players with Internet connectivity for subscription-based video downloads.

===CBHD===

China Blue High-definition Disc (CBHD) was introduced in September 2007. This format is based on HD DVD. While the Blu-ray format is marketed internationally, CBHDs have sold significantly in the Chinese market.

==Hourly recording storage-capacity==

The bit rate chosen for encoding determines the length of programming that will fit on a DVD. The maximum total amount of data that can be recorded on a DVD is fixed. If the amount of data required per hour of video is lower (lower bit rate), then more hours will fit on a DVD using that bit rate. For example, a particular lower encoded bit rate allows 8 hours of TV programming on a disk. The highest bit rate within the specification allows 2 hours. A compromise (between length and quality) might allow 6 hours of programming to be recorded onto a DVD. DVD publishers often opt for the higher-quality, higher-bit-rate modes with roughly 2 hours worth of video per disk. For example, HBO recorded 2 one-hour episodes per disc for the DVD release of the Game of Thrones.
