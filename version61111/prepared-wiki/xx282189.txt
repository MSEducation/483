[[List of decommissioned ships of the Chilean Navy]]

CATEGORIES: Chilean Navy, Tall ships of Chile, Lists of ships of the Chilean Navy, Lists of ships by country

The list of decommissioned ships of the Chilean Navy is mostly compiled from information given in the website of the Chilean Navy. It consists of over 500 historical units including ships of the Patria Vieja, prizes, fireships, armed merchant ships, auxiliary ships, capital ships and, of course, regular warships of the navy ranging from the [tpl]convert|25000|LT|t[/tpl] capital ship [tpl]Ship|Chilean battleship|Almirante Latorre[/tpl] to small torpedo boats and early wooden vessels.
At the beginning, the Chilean Navy was almost entirely composed of merchant ships enlisted into naval service in time of war, hence the distinction between warships and merchant ships is often blurred and ships changed their status quickly and subtly.
