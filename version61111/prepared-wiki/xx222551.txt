Wimperis then began a theatre writing career as a lyricist and librettist for Edwardian musical comedies in London.  His first major show was The Dairymaids (1906), which was favourably reviewed by The Times, though the derivative nature of the plot was noted, as was the similarity between the lyrics for the song "Mary in the Dairy" and an earlier Punch magazine parody of a musical comedy number which contained the words, "Mary, Mary, managed a dairy".  This similarity was attributed to the paucity of rhymes for Mary, rather than deliberate plagiarism.[tpl]Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Apollo.

He next contributed songs (including "The Pipes of Pan", "I've Got a Motter", "Arcady Is Always Young", and "Half Past Two") for one of the most popular musicals of the Edwardian age, The Arcadians (1909), as well as to the short-lived The Mountaineers.
