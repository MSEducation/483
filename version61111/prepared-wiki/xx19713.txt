[[Volatilisation]]

CATEGORIES: Analytical chemistry

Volatilization is the process whereby a dissolved sample is vaporised. In atomic spectroscopy this is usually a two step process. The analyte is turned into small droplets in a nebuliser which are entrained in a gas flow which is in turn volatilised in a high temperature flame in the case of AAS or volatilised in a gas plasma torch in the case of ICP spectroscopy.

==Herbicide volatilisation==

Herbicide volatilisation refers to evaporation or sublimation of a volatile herbicide. The effect of gaseous chemical is lost at its intended place of application and may move downwind and affect other plants not intended to be affected causing crop damage. Herbicides vary in their susceptibility to volatilisation. Prompt incorporation of the herbicide into the soil may reduce or prevent volatilisation. Wind, temperature, and humidity also affect the rate of volatilisation with humidity reducing in. 2,4-D and dicamba are commonly used chemicals that are known to be subject to volatilisation[tpl]cite news|title=Dow Corn, Resistant to a Weed Killer, Runs Into Opposition|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/26/business/energy-environment/dow-weed-killer-runs-into-opposition.html|accessdate=April 25, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 25, 2012|author=Andrew Pollack[/tpl] but there are many others.[tpl]cite web|title=Getting the Most from Soil-Applied Herbicides|url=http://scarab.msu.montana.edu/CropWeedSearch/Docs/GettingtheMostfromSoil-AppliedHerbicides.htm|publisher=Montana State University|accessdate=April 25, 2012|author=Fabian Menalled and William E. Dyer[/tpl] Application of herbicides later in the season to protect herbicide-resistant genetically modified plants increases the risk of volatilisation as the temperature is higher and incorporation into the soil impractical.
Herbicide applied as a powder or a mist can also Pesticide drift in the wind in solid form as dust or liquid form as tiny drops. While drifting or after drifting by volatilisation it can become vapor, gas. Obviously, volatilisation also affects other substances, a commonplace example is water and ice.
