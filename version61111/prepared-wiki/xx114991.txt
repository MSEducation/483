[[Lapsias]]

CATEGORIES: Salticidae

Lapsias is a spider genus of the Salticidae family (jumping spiders).

==Phylogeny==

Lapsias, Galianora and Thrandina are informally classified as "lapsiines". These are believed to be basal jumping spiders, outside the Salticoida. While Galianora and Thrandina are sister genera, it is not certain if they form a clade with Lapsias, or if the common characteristics are symplesiomorphic.Maddison 2006a
