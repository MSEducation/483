</ref> In the very distant past, the Time Lords fought a genocidal war against the Great Vampires, which led to such a catastrophic loss of life that the Time Lords renounced violence. However, at some point they also entered conflict with the Racnoss, ultimately driving the race to near-extinction in 4.6 billion BC save for the Racnoss' Empress and the inhabitants of one vessel hidden deep within what would become the planet Earth ("[[The Runaway Bride (Doctor Who)|The Runaway Bride]]"). In some spinoff media, the Time Lords are also allied with less developed "Temporal Powers." The power of the Time Lords appears limited by their policy of non-interference with the universe and sometimes by intense internecine division. However, the view that they are self-appointed custodians of time developed in the [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-off]] media, but carried over into the television series; in ''The War Games'' the Time Lords return time-displaced humans abducted by the War Lord to their proper time zones on Earth.<ref name="The War Games"/>
In the 2005 television series, Gallifrey has been destroyed and the Time Lords are functionally extinct as a result of a mutually destructive Time War with the Daleks, with only two Time Lords known to have survived: the Doctor and his nemesis, the Master. The Doctor's cloned "daughter" Jenny may also be considered to be a surviving Time Lord, though in "The Doctor's Daughter" the Doctor initially rejected the suggestion.[tpl]cite episode | title = The Doctor's Daughter | series = Doctor Who | credits = Writer Stephen Greenhorn, Director Alice Troughton, Producer Phil Collinson | network = BBC | station = BBC One | city = Cardiff | airdate = 10 May 2008[/tpl] The fate of a fourth member of the race, Time Lady Romanadvoratrelundar (Romana), a former companion of the Doctor, is unknown, as when the character last appeared in the television series she was residing in a parallel dimension. Two other Time Lord-like beings appeared in the episode "Journey's End": Donna Noble, briefly empowered with the mind and knowledge of a Time Lord, and a half-human clone of the Doctor. Donna's memories related to the Doctor, as well as her Time Lord knowledge, were buried in order to save her life, while the clone is currently living out his existence in a parallel universe with Rose Tyler.[tpl]cite episode | title = Journey's End | series = Doctor Who | credits = Writer Russell T Davies, Director Graeme Harper, Producer Phil Collinson | network = BBC | station = BBC One | city = Cardiff | airdate = 5 July 2008[/tpl] There is also the question of whether the Doctor's granddaughter, Susan, was by nature a true Time Lord. She went off to live with a human, David Campbell, in the 22nd century at the end of The Dalek Invasion Of Earth. Whether she had survived the Time War or if she was not even a part of it is also unknown.
In "Father's Day"[tpl]cite episode | title = Father's Day | series = Doctor Who | credits = Writer Paul Cornell, Director Joe Ahearne, Producer Phil Collinson | network = BBC | station = BBC One | city = Cardiff | airdate = 14 May 2005[/tpl] the Ninth Doctor remarks that prior to their destruction, the Time Lords would have prevented or repaired paradoxes such as that which attracted the Reapers to 1987 Earth.

Well, in fact they did."
The End of Time saw the High Council of Time Lords led by a Time Lord President whom the Doctor named "Rassilon", attempting to escape the Time War by materialising Gallifrey in the place of Earth on Christmas 2009. However, the Doctor destroys the device which allows their passage into the present, sending them back into the events of the Time War.[tpl]cite serial |title=The End of Time |series=Doctor Who |credits=Writer Russell T Davies, Director Euros Lyn, Producer Tracie Simpson |network= BBC |station= BBC One |city= Cardiff |began=25 December 2009 |ended=1 January 2010[/tpl]
At the end of "Day of the Moon", a mysterious young girl tells a homeless man that she is dying and then begins to regenerate. The identity of this girl is implied in the episode "A Good Man Goes to War", where it is revealed that the daughter of Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill), Melody Pond, who later goes by her transliterated name "River Song", has been born with Time Lord-like genetic traits. An old acquaintance of the Doctor's, Vastra (Neve McIntosh) reminds the Doctor that the Time Lord race developed due to their billions of years' exposure to the time vortex. The Doctor then recalls that Rory and Amy had spent their wedding night in the TARDIS; therefore it is theorised that River's conception mirrored that of the Time Lords' genesis and therefore she herself developed Time Lord genetic characteristics.
During the episode "The Doctor's Wife" it was revealed that several Time Lords and their TARDISes had been trapped and destroyed by an entity called House who lived in a separate bubble universe.
In "The Night of the Doctor" and "The Day of the Doctor," it's shown that the Eighth Doctor regenerated into the War Doctor to fight in the Time War. He originally planned to use a Time Lord weapon known as The Moment to destroy the Time Lords and Daleks, but after being shown the tenth and Eleventh Doctors, he worked together with them to change the outcome of the Time War: every incarnation of the Doctor, including a previously-unseen future incarnation teamed up together to freeze Gallifrey in time and place it outside of our universe, protecting it and the remaining Time Lords while the Daleks destroyed themselves in their own crossfire once Gallifrey was gone. The Doctor has now set out to find Gallifrey and restore the Time Lords.

==Physical characteristics==

Time Lords look human (or, as the Eleventh Doctor tells Amy Pond in the The Beast Below, humans "look Time Lord", as Time Lords evolved first[tpl]cite episode | title = The Beast Below | episodelink = The Beast Below | series = Series 5 | serieslink = List_of_Doctor_Who_serials#Series_5_(2010) | credits = Steven Moffat, Andrew Gunn, Peter Bennett | network = British Broadcasting Corporation | airdate = 2010[/tpl]), but differ from them in many respects. Physiological differences from humans include two hearts which normally beat at 170 beats per minute,[tpl]cite episode | title = Inferno | episodelink = Inferno (Doctor Who) | series = Season 7 | serieslink = List_of_Doctor_Who_serials#Season_7_.281970.29 | credits = Don Houghton, Douglas Camfield, Barry Letts | network = British Broadcasting Corporation | airdate = 1970[/tpl] an internal body temperature of 15 degrees Celsius (59 degrees Fahrenheit) and a "respiratory bypass system" that allows them to survive strangulation. Time Lords can also survive full exposure to the vacuum of space with no ill effects, though when in a vacuum for an extended period, a Time Lord must take a supply of air along or suffocate. Time Lords also seem to have an increased resilience to higher frequencies of sound, as seen in "The Christmas Invasion" (although this may simply be the excess energy from his recent regeneration, or their hearing range may not go as high as a human's).[tpl]cite episode | title = The Christmas Invasion | episodelink = The Christmas Invasion | series = Christmas Special 2005 | serieslink = List_of_Doctor_Who_serials#Christmas_special_.282005.29 | credits = Russell T Davies, James Hawes | network = British Broadcasting Corporation | airdate = 2005[/tpl] and "Partners in Crime". If severely injured, Time Lords can go into a healing coma which lowers their body temperature to below freezing. In the serial Destiny of the Daleks, Romana was able to voluntarily stop both of her hearts beating, to fool the Daleks into believing that she was dead. The Doctor also shows a greater tolerance to cold compared to humans in The Seeds of Doom and Planet of the Ood and even Romana in The Ribos Operation, and in "42" the Doctor states he is able to survive at absolute zero for a short period of time. In "World War Three",[tpl]cite episode | title = World War Three | episodelink = World War Three (Doctor Who) | series = Series 1 | serieslink = List_of_Doctor_Who_serials#Series_1_.282005.29 | credits = Russell T Davies, Keith Boak | network = British Broadcasting Corporation | airdate = 2005[/tpl] the Doctor is able to shake off an electrocution attempt which is fatal to a number of humans, and appears unaffected by the energy whip wielded by the Sycorax in "The Christmas Invasion". In "Smith and Jones" the Tenth Doctor says that the radiation given off by X-rays pose no real threat to Time Lords, and proceeds to absorb an amount that would be lethal to a human, which he subsequently expels through his foot. The End of Time shows the Doctor as being capable of surviving (for a short period) a massive burst of radiation that would have killed anything else instantly. However, the radiation burst caused enough damage to start a regeneration cycle.
Time Lords are extremely long-lived, routinely counting their ages in terms of centuries; the Doctor claimed in The War Games that Time Lords could live "practically forever, barring accidents." The series has suggested that Time Lords have a different concept of ageing than humans. In Pyramids of Mars, the Doctor considers an age of 750 years to be "middle-aged". In "The Stolen Earth", he refers to being a "kid" at 90 years old. However, within a specific incarnation, a Time Lord is able to age, albeit much more slowly than a human. The War Doctor and Eleventh Doctor, over the course of the Last Great Time War and the Battle of Trenzalore, respectively, are seen to age within their respective incarnations to what would appear to a human to be old age; both conflicts are suggested within the series to last hundreds if not thousands of Earth years.
In The Daleks' Master Plan[tpl]cite episode | title = The Daleks' Master Plan | episodelink = The Daleks' Master Plan | series = Season 3 | serieslink = List_of_Doctor_Who_serials#Season_3_.281965.E2.80.9366.29 | credits = Terry Nation, Dennis Spooner, Douglas Camfield | network = British Broadcasting Corporation | airdate = 1965[/tpl] the First Doctor is able to resist the effects of the Time Destructor better than his companions, who are visibly aged by it; one of them, Sara Kingdom ages to dust before the Destructor device can be reversed. The Fourth Doctor is briefly aged 500 years in The Leisure Hive, leaving him an old man but still active. A similar situation occurred in "The Sound of Drums", where the Master uses specially made technology to age the Tenth Doctor by a century, leaving him in a frail and helpless state. A further application of this technology in the following episode, "Last of the Time Lords", suspends the Doctor's capacity to regenerate, showing the effects of 900 years of life without regeneration.
In The Two Doctors, the Doctor states that the "Rassilon Imprimatur" allows Time Lords to safely travel through time, becoming symbionts with their TARDISes, and that the reason other species are incapable of developing time travel are that they lack the imprimatur. However, he implies later that he was lying about at least some of this information to mislead the Sontarans. At the beginning of The Trial of a Time Lord, the Doctor suggests that a number of elder Time Lords were able to use their combined mental energy to summon his TARDIS against his will.
In The Shakespeare Code, the Tenth Doctor has only one heart working. He knows this and tries to stand up. However, it is revealed that he cannot because though his race has two hearts, he needs both of them working in order to function properly.
In The Unicorn and the Wasp, the Tenth Doctor is able to overcome the effects of cyanide by "stimulating the inhibited enzymes into reversal", a process he referred to as going through "detox".[tpl]cite episode | title = The Unicorn and the Wasp | series = Doctor Who | credits = Writer Gareth Roberts, Director Graeme Harper, Producer Susie Liggat | network = BBC | station = BBC One | city = Cardiff | airdate = 18 May 2008[/tpl]
In the episode Cold Blood, the Eleventh Doctor experiences excruciating pain when the Silurian attempts to decontaminate him of surface bacteria. The Doctor states this would kill him, most likely due to the scanners being programmed to 'detox' humans and therefore being unaware of what elements the Doctor requires.
A Time Lord is able to conceal their Time Lord nature, and become a human, by using the Chameleon Arch - a device that stores their "essence" and memories in an innocuous device such as a fob watch, and replaces them with false counterparts until the object is later re-opened. The process allows them to disguise themselves as humans physiologically and psychologically, meaning they only have one heart and are stripped of non-human powers, and of any memory of having been a Time Lord. This story element was notably featured in Series 3; the Doctor uses it to hide himself from the Family of Blood and becomes a schoolteacher in Edwardian England. His nemesis the Master used it to disguise himself as a human to escape the Time War.

===Mental powers===

Time Lords can communicate by telepathy,[tpl]cite episode | title = The Deadly Assassin | episodelink = The Deadly Assassin | series = Season 14 | serieslink = List_of_Doctor_Who_serials#Season_14_.281976.E2.80.9377.29 | credits = Robert Holmes, David Maloney | network = British Broadcasting Corporation | airdate = 1976[/tpl] and can link their minds to share information and enhance their powers.The Three Doctors (Doctor Who) In Castrovalva, the Doctor activates the TARDIS' Zero Room mentally. Additionally, both the Doctor and the Master demonstrate significant hypnotic abilities which may be supplemented by their telepathic abilities.
These powers were elaborated upon from 2005. The Doctor is seen using this method to query a cat about the goings-on of the flat in "The Lodger". In "A Good Man Goes to War" and "Closing Time" he is apparently able to even understand babies, as well as horses in "A Town Called Mercy". In "The Girl in the Fireplace",[tpl]cite episode | title = The Girl in the Fireplace | episodelink = The Girl in the Fireplace | series = Series 2 | serieslink = List_of_Doctor_Who_serials#Series_2_.282006.29 | credits = Steven Moffat, Euros Lyn| network = British Broadcasting Corporation | airdate = 2006[/tpl] the Tenth Doctor reads the mind of Madame de Pompadour—and in the process, to his surprise, she is able to read his mind as well.
