[[Metaphilosophy]]

CATEGORIES: Metaphilosophy

Metaphilosophy (sometimes called philosophy of philosophy) is ‘the investigation of the nature of philosophy.’ Its subject matter includes the aims of philosophy, the boundaries of philosophy, and its methods.[tpl]cite web |work=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy (IEP) |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/con-meta/ |title=Contemporary Metaphilosophy |author=Nicholas Joll |date=November 18, 2010[/tpl] It is considered by some to be a subject apart from philosophy,[ref]
See for example, [tpl]cite book |title=Platonic Writings/Platonic Readings |author= Charles L. Griswold Jr. |isbn=0271044810 |publisher=Penn State Press |year=2010 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ZCB33OPRE-AC&pg=PA146 |pages=144–146[/tpl] 
[/ref] while others see it as automatically a part of philosophy,[ref]
For example, see [tpl]cite book |author=Martin Heidegger |year=1956 |title=Was Ist Das--die Philosophie? |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6wclkEHlZyQC&pg=PA21 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |page=21 |isbn=0808403192[/tpl][/ref][tpl]cite book |author=Timothy Williamson |title= The Philosophy of Philosophy |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |year=2008 |chapter=Preface |page= ix |quote=The philosophy of philosophy is automatically part of philosophy, just as the philosophy of anything else is...|isbn=	0470695919 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YN2KGBgKwOcC&pg=PR9[/tpl] and still others see it as a combination of these subjects. The interest in metaphilosophy led to the establishment of the journal Metaphilosophy in January 1970.[ref]
The journal describes its scope as: "Particular areas of interest include: the foundation, scope, function and direction of philosophy; justification of philosophical methods and arguments; the interrelations among schools or fields of philosophy (for example, the relation of logic to problems in ethics or epistemology); aspects of philosophical systems; presuppositions of philosophical schools; the relation of philosophy to other disciplines (for example, artificial intelligence, linguistics or literature); sociology of philosophy; the relevance of philosophy to social and political action; issues in the teaching of philosophy."

==Relationship to philosophy==

Some philosophers consider metaphilosophy to be a subject apart from philosophy, above or beyond it,[ref]
See for example, [tpl]cite book |title=Platonic Writings/Platonic Readings |author= Charles L. Griswold Jr. |isbn=0271044810 |publisher=Penn State Press |year=2010 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ZCB33OPRE-AC&pg=PA146 |pages=144–146[/tpl] 
[/ref] while others object to that idea.[ref]
For example, see [tpl]cite book |author=Martin Heidegger |year=1956 |title=Was Ist Das--die Philosophie? |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6wclkEHlZyQC&pg=PA21 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |page=21 |isbn=0808403192[/tpl]
[/ref] Timothy Williamson argues that the philosophy of philosophy is "automatically part of philosophy," as is the philosophy of anything else. Nicholas Bunnin and Jiyuan Yu write that the separation of first- from second-order study has lost popularity as philosophers find it hard to observe the distinction.[tpl]cite book |author=Nicholas Bunnin and Jiyuan Yu |chapter= Metaphilosophy  |title=The Blackwell Dictionary of Western Philosophy |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |year=2009 |pages= 426–427 |isbn=1405191120 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0HyNPwAACAAJ[/tpl] As evidenced by these contrasting opinions, debate remains as to whether the evaluation of the nature of philosophy is 'second order philosophy' or simply 'plain philosophy'.
Many philosophers have expressed doubts over the value of metaphilosophy. Among them is Gilbert Ryle : "preoccupation with questions about methods tends to distract us from prosecuting the methods themselves. We run as a rule, worse, not better, if we think a lot about our feet. So let us... not speak of it all but just do it."[ref]

==Terminology==

The designations metaphilosophy and philosophy of philosophy have a variety of meanings, sometimes taken to be synonyms, and sometimes seen as distinct.
Morris Lazerowitz claims to have created the term ‘metaphilosophy’ around 1940 and used it in print in 1942.[tpl]cite journal |author=Lazerowitz, M. |year=1970 |title=A note on "metaphilosophy" |journal=Metaphilosophy  |volume=1 |issue=1 |page=91 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9973.1970.tb00792.x/abstract |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9973.1970.tb00792.x[/tpl] see also the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy article by Nicholas Joll: Contemporary Metaphilosophy  Lazerowitz proposed that metaphilosophy is ‘the investigation of the nature of philosophy.’  Earlier uses have been found in translations from the French.e.g. Clemenceau G., In the evening of my thought (Au soir de la pensée, Paris: Plon, 1927), Houghton Mifflin company, 1929, Vol. 2, p.498: "this teratological product of metaphilosophy"; Gilson E., Christianity and philosophy, Pub. for the Institute of Mediaeval Studies by Sheed & Ward, 1939, p. 88 The term is derived from Greek word meta μετά ("after", "beyond", "with") and philosophía φιλοσοφία ("love of wisdom").
The term ‘metaphilosophy’ is used by Paul Moser [tpl]cite book |author=Paul K. Moser |chapter=Metaphilosophy |editor= Robert Audi, ed |title= The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy |publisher= Paw Prints 2008-06-26 |year=2008 |edition=Paperback reprint of 2nd |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0bVXPwAACAAJ |isbn=1439503508 |pages= 561–562[/tpl] in the sense of a 'second-order' or more fundamental undertaking than philosophy itself, in the manner suggested by Charles Griswold:
This usage was considered nonsense by Ludwig Wittgenstein, who rejected the analogy between metalanguage and a metaphilosophy.[tpl]cite book |author=Wittgenstein L. |title=Philosophical Investigations |publisher=Blackwell |year=1963 |url=http://gormendizer.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Ludwig.Wittgenstein.-.Philosophical.Investigations.pdf |chapter=Paragraph 121[/tpl] As expressed by Martin Heidegger:
Some other philosophers treat the prefix meta as simply meaning ‘about...’, rather than as referring to a metatheoretical 'second-order' form of philosophy, among them Rescher[tpl]cite book |author=Rescher N. |year=2007 |title=Philosophical Dialectics, an Essay on Metaphilosophy |chapter=Chapter 1: Philosophical principles|page=1 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Ju4rh20YqJIC&pg=PA1 |isbn=0791467465 |publisher= State University of New York Press [/tpl] and Double.[tpl]cite book |author=Richard Double |year=1996 |title=Metaphilosophy and Free Will |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0195355415 |url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=dbKQUpUWgmEC&q=metaphilosophy[/tpl]  Others, such as Williamson, prefer the term ‘philosophy of philosophy’ instead of ‘metaphilosophy’ as it avoids the connotation of a 'second-order' discipline that looks down on philosophy, and instead denotes something that is a part of it.[tpl]cite book |author=Williamson, Timothy |year=2007 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YN2KGBgKwOcC&printsec=frontcover |title=The Philosophy of Philosophy |publisher= Wiley-Blackwell |chapter=Preface |isbn=1405133961[/tpl]  Joll suggests that to take metaphilosophy as 'the application of the methods of philosophy to philosophy itself' is too vague, while the view that sees metaphilosophy as a ‘second-order’ or more abstract discipline, outside philosophy, "is narrow and tendentious".
In the analytical tradition, the term "metaphilosophy" is mostly used to tag commenting and research on previous works as opposed to original contributions towards solving philosophical problems.e.g.PhilPapers

==Writings==

Ludwig Wittgenstein wrote about the nature of philosophical puzzles and philosophical understanding. He suggested philosophical errors arose from confusions about the nature of philosophical inquiry. In the Philosophical Investigations, Wittgenstein wrote that there is not a metaphilosophy in the sense of a metatheory of philosophy.One might think: if philosophy speaks of the use of the word "philosophy" there must be a second-order philosophy. But it is not so; it is, rather, like the case of othography, which deals with the word "orthography"  among others without then being second order. Ludwig Wittgenstein Philosophical Investigations Blackwell Oxford 1963 para 121.
C. D. Broad distinguished Critical from Speculative philosophy in his "The Subject-matter of Philosophy, and its Relations to the special Sciences," in Introduction to Scientific Thought, 1923. Curt Ducasse, in Philosophy as a Science, examines several views of the nature of philosophy, and concludes that philosophy has a distinct subject matter: appraisals. Ducasse's view has been among the first to be described as 'metaphilosophy'.Dommeyer F., (1961), A Critical Examination of C. J. Ducasse's Metaphilosophy, Philosophy and Phenomenological Research, Vol. 21, (Jun., 1961), No. 4 pp. 439-455
Henri Lefebvre in Metaphilosophie (1965)  argued, from a marxian standpoint, in favor of an "ontological break", as a necessary methodological approach for critical social theory (whilst criticizing Louis Althusser's "epistemological break" with subjective marxism, which represented a fundamental theoretical tool for the school of marxist structuralism).
Paul Moser writes that typical metaphilosophical discussion includes determining the conditions under which a claim can be said to be a philosophical one. He regards meta-ethics, the study of ethics, to be a form of metaphilosophy, as well as meta-epistemology, the study of epistemology.

==Topics==

Many sub-disciplines of philosophy have their own branch of 'metaphilosophy', examples being Meta-aesthetics, Meta-epistemology, Meta-ethics, Meta-ontology, and so forth. However, some topics within 'metaphilosophy' cut across the various subdivisions of philosophy to consider fundamentals important to all its sub-disciplines. Some of these are mentioned below.

===Aims===

Some philosophers (e.g. existentialists, pragmatists) think philosophy is ultimately a practical discipline that should help us lead meaningful lives by showing us who we are, how we relate to the world around us and what we should do. [tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2009[/tpl] Others (e.g. analytic philosophers) see philosophy as a technical, formal, and entirely theoretical discipline, with goals such as "the disinterested pursuit of knowledge for its own sake".Penguin Dictionary of Philosophy Other proposed goals of philosophy include "discovering the absolutely fundamental reason of everything it investigates",Modern Thomistic Philosophy by R Phillips "making explicit the nature and significance of ordinary and scientific beliefs",Collins English Dictionary and unifying and transcending the insights given by science and religion.Mastering Philosophy by Anthony Harrison-Barbet Others proposed that philosophy is a complex discipline because it has 4 or 6 different dimensions.Adler, Mortimer (1993) The Four Dimensions of Philosophy: Metaphysical-Moral-Objective-Categorical[tpl]cite journal|author=Vidal, Clément|title=Metaphilosophical Criteria for Worldview Comparison|journal=Metaphilosophy|year=2012|volume=43|issue=3|pages=306–347|url=http://homepages.vub.ac.be/%7Eclvidal/writings/Vidal-Metaphilosophical-Criteria.pdf|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9973.2012.01749.x[/tpl]

===Boundaries===

Defining philosophy and its boundaries is itself problematic; Nigel Warburton has called it "notoriously difficult".[tpl]cite book |title=Philosophy: The Basics |author=Nigel Warburton |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jNotC2OQocIC&printsec=frontcover |page=1 |isbn=0203202023 |year=2003 |publisher=CRC Press |edition=3rd[/tpl] There is no straightforward definition,Mastering Philosophy, by Anthony Harrison-Barbet[tpl]verify source|date=March 2013[/tpl] and most interesting definitions are controversial.[tpl]cite book |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |chapter=Philosophy |page=702 |author= The Rt. Hon. Lord Quinton |isbn=0199264791 |year=2005 |edition=2nd |publisher=Oxford University Press |editor =Ted Honderich, ed |url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/0199264791/ref=rdr_ext_tmb#reader_0199264791[/tpl] As Bertrand Russell wrote:

While there is some agreement that philosophy involves general or fundamental topics,Penguin Dictionary of Philosophy: "the most fundamental and general concepts and principles involved in thought, action and reality"; quoted in [tpl]cite web |title=Philosophy |work=New World Encyclopedia |url=http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/philosophy#The_Nature_of_Philosophy[/tpl]Modern Thomistic Philosophy, by R. Phillips: "the absolutely fundamental reason of everything it investigates",  "the fundamental reasons or causes of all things"[tpl]verify source|date=March 2013[/tpl] there is no clear agreement about a series of demarcation issues, including:
[/ref][tpl]cite book |title=Continental Philosophy of Science |editor=Gary Gutting, ed |author=Richard Tieszen |page=94 |chapter=Science as a triumph of the human spirit and science in crisis: Husserl and the fortunes of reason |quote=The sciences are in need of continual epistemological reflection and critique of a sort that only the philosopher can provide. ...Husserl pictures the work of the philosopher and the scientist as mutually complementary. |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=W6RVSDUG9acC&pg=PA94 |isbn=1405137444 |year=2008 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons[/tpl] Some analytical philosophers argue that all meaningful empirical questions are to be answered by science, not philosophy. However, some schools of contemporary philosophy such as the pragmatists and naturalistic epistemologists argue that philosophy should be linked to science and should be scientific in the broad sense of that term, "preferring to see philosophical reflection as continuous with the best practice of any field of intellectual enquiry".[tpl]cite book |page=277 |title=Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy |author =Simon Blackburn [/tpl]

===Methods===

Philosophical method (or philosophical methodology) is the study of how to do philosophy. A common view among philosophers is that philosophy is distinguished by the ways that philosophers follow in addressing philosophical questions. There is not just one method that philosophers use to answer philosophical questions.
Recently, some philosophers have cast doubt about intuition as a basic tool in philosophical inquiry, from Socrates up to contemporary philosophy of language. In Rethinking Intuition[ref]Rethinking Intuition: The Psychology of Intuition and its Role in Philosophical Inquiry ,(Studies in Epistemology and Cognitive Theory)
Michael DePaul , William Ramsey (Editors), Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc. (1998) ISBN 0-8476-8796-1; ISBN 978-0-8476-8796-1[/ref] various thinkers discard intuition as a valid source of knowledge and thereby call into question 'a priori' philosophy. Experimental philosophy is a form of philosophical inquiry that makes at least partial use of empirical research—especially opinion polling—in order to address persistent philosophical questions. This is in contrast with the methods found in analytic philosophy, whereby some say a philosopher will sometimes begin by appealing to his or her intuitions on an issue and then form an argument with those intuitions as premises.Knobe (forthcoming). However, disagreement about what experimental philosophy can accomplish is widespread and several philosophers have offered criticisms. One claim is that the empirical data gathered by experimental philosophers can have an indirect effect on philosophical questions by allowing for a better understanding of the underlying psychological processes which lead to philosophical intuitions.Knobe, J. and Nichols, S. (eds.) (2008) Experimental Philosophy §2.1

===Progress===

A prominent question in metaphilosophy is that of whether or not philosophical progress occurs[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl], and more so, whether such progress in philosophy is even possible. It has even been disputed, most notably by Ludwig Wittgenstein, whether genuine philosophical problems actually exist. The opposite has also been claimed, for example  by Karl Popper, who held that such problems do exist, that they are solvable, and that he had actually found definite solutions to some of them.
