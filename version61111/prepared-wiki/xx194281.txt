The American-French Genealogical Society also known as AFGS was established in 1978 as a genealogical and historical organization for French-Canadian research.

Its vast resources include more than 10,000 volumes of repertoires (marriage records), genealogies, biographies, and histories, as well as genealogical journals and publications of regional, national, and international scope.
The Society publishes a quarterly journal, Je Me Souviens.
