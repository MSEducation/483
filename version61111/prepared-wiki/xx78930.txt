Kennedy and numerous articles on railroads including the entries on Railroad Engineering and Foreign Railroad Technology for McGraw-Hill's encyclopedias.
Prouty served as a technical adviser to Oliver Stone's movie JFK and was the inspiration for the mysterious "X" who is based on him as well, played by Donald Sutherland, who assists Jim Garrison in the movie.[tpl]cite book|last=Toplin|first=Robert Brent|title=History by Hollywood: The Use and Abuse of the American Past|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Urbana, Illinois|isbn=9780252065361|pages=50–51|url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=rKuAxbE5ErkC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=January 17, 2013|chapter=JFK|chapterurl=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=rKuAxbE5ErkC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA50#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl]

==Controversial claims==

As a critic of the CIA, Prouty pointed out its influence in global matters, outside the realm of U.S. congressional and government oversight. His works detail the formation and development of the CIA, the origins of the Cold War, the U-2 incident, the Vietnam War, and the John F. Kennedy assassination. Prouty has written that he believes Kennedy's assassination was a coup d'etat, and that there is a secret, global "power elite," which operates covertly to protect its interests—and in doing so has frequently subverted democracy around the world.
Prouty subscribed to the theory that oil is not derived from fossils but from carbon deposits deep within the Earth (abiogenic petroleum origin theory).[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]
Prouty said that "it would not surprise me if this was a Secret Team operation" in response to the death of Princess Diana.Col. Prouty (JFK's Mr. X) & Diana's Accident
Prouty asserted that World War II could easily have been concluded with neither the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki nor the invasion of Japan whose obviation was the ostensible justification for those bombings.L. Fletcher Prouty, The CIA, Vietnam, and the Plot to Assassinate John F. Kennedy, Skyhorse Publishing (2009), p. 23.
Prouty presented "a quartet of the greatest propaganda schemes ever put forth by man" that included Darwin's theory of evolution and Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.L. Fletcher Prouty, The CIA, Vietnam, and the Plot to Assassinate John F. Kennedy, Skyhorse Publishing (2009), p. 2.
While working for the Church of Scientology, Prouty told Scientology leaders that L. Ron Hubbard's military discharge papers were "sheep dipped," meaning two sets of government records were created documenting Hubbard's service. The claim came to light when a Lawrence Wright expose' on the subject revealed that official government documents contained no mention of any injury suffered by Hubbard during his service, injuries Hubbard claimed were later healed through Dianetics. Prouty's assertion is of particular importance to Scientologists; had there been no injury to Hubbard, a cure of such injuries by use of Dianetics would have been impossible, and thus the foundational claim of Scientology would be undermined.http://www.npr.org/2011/02/08/133561256/the-church-of-scientology-fact-checked

===Kennedy assassination===

According to Prouty, people within the intelligence and military communities of the United States government conspired to assassinate Kennedy. He maintained that their actions were a coup d'état to stop the President from taking control of the CIA after the Bay of Pigs. Prouty stated that the assassination was orchestrated by Edward Lansdale ("Gen. Y" in Oliver Stone's JFK) and that Landsdale appeared in photographs of the "three tramps".
In 1975, Prouty appeared with Richard Sprague at a news conference in New York to present what they believed was photographic evidence of a conspiracy.[tpl]cite news|title=2 Claim Conspiracy Proof in JFK's Death|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SiMWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=zhEEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6431%2C544045|accessdate=January 18, 2013|newspaper=Milwaukee Sentinel|date=September 4, 1975|agency=UPI|page=3[/tpl] According to Prouty, the movement of Kennedy after a bullet struck his head was consistent with a shot from the grassy knoll. He also suggested that the actions of a man with an umbrella, the "Umbrella Man", were suspicious.

==Associations with Anti-Semitic Organizations==

Prouty was a featured speaker at the 1990 convention of the Liberty Lobby. Prouty was also named to the advisory board for the Lobby's Populist Action Committee. Prouty also sold the reprint rights for The Secret Team of the Noontide Press, the publishing arm for the Institute for Historical Review, a holocaust denial organization.[tpl]cite news | title=The Shooting of JFK | work=Esquire | date=November 1991 | accessdate=9 December 2013 | author=Anson, Robert Sam[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/prouty3.txt | title=RIGHT WOOS LEFT: Populist Party, LaRouchian, and Other Neo-fascist Overtures To Progressives, And Why They Must Be Rejected | publisher=Political Research Associates | date=November 22, 1993 | accessdate=9 December 2013 | author=Berlet, Chip | authorlink=Chip Berlet[/tpl]
Prouty denied having known of the racist and anti-semitic associations of the Lobby, noted that he also spoke at a ceremony at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, and assured Oliver Stone "... that he was neither a racist nor an anti-Semite... but merely a writer in need of a platform." In a response to an article about Prouty in Esquire,[tpl]cite news | title=Esquire Letter: Stone Shoots Back | work=Esquire | date=December 1991 | accessdate=26 January 2014 | author=Stone, Oliver[/tpl] Stone lamented Prouty's association with the Liberty Lobby but questioned its relevance to Prouty's reliability as a source, writing that "The truth does not always come from lawyers in three-piece suits. In cases like this it more often comes from street types, criminals and people with "histories" who talk." He also contended that the article contained "numerous errors, out-of-context quotes, and misunderstandings" of which "the character assassination of Colonel Fletcher Prouty" was a "case in point". Stone's assessment was echoed by Garry Trudeau writing in The New York Times who described the Esquire article as an "attack" piece that "squeezes off several cheap shots".[tpl]cite news | title=Overkill | work=The New York Times | date=January 8, 1992 | accessdate=26 January 2014 | author=Trudeau, Garry[/tpl] In a critical obituary in The Guardian, Michael Carlson wrote that "although Prouty himself never espoused such anti-semitic beliefs, the connection enabled critics to dismiss his later writings."
