==Club career==

===Youth career===

After graduating from Westfields Sports High School in 2007, Jurman furthered his football development at the AIS before signing for the Sydney FC youth team in 2008. In his first year at the club, Jurman helped Sydney FC to their first youth championship in the competition's inaugural campaign and later earned himself a senior deal at the club under then manager, John Kosmina.

===Sydney FC===

Jurman made his senior debut for Sydney FC off the bench on 9 September 2007 against Perth Glory. Throughout his time at Sydney, he went on to make 22 appearances in the league as well as a number of appearances for the club in the 2011 Asian Champions League. He scored his only goal for Sydney in a 2-1 away loss to Kashima Antlers.
Along with a strong finish to the season where he became a first team regular, Jurman is remembered for an incident that occurred during the 2010/11 season after Sydney FC striker Juho M채kel채 scored a crucial goal to put Sydney FC 2-0 ahead over Gold Coast United. M채kel채 jumped the fence to celebrate with the clubs fans followed by the rest of the squad. During the jubilant celebrations, the fence collapsed and pinned Jurman's causing fears that he may have broken his leg. Jurman eventually played on and confirmed after the game that there was moderate swelling and bruising but no significant damage sustained.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.sportsnewsfirst.com.au/articles/2011/01/11/jurman-okay-after-fence-collapse/ | title =Jurman okay after fence collapse | publisher = Sports News First | accessdate = 11 January 2011[/tpl]
