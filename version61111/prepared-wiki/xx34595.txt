In Greek and Roman mythology, the Astomi are an ancient legendary race of people who had no need to eat or drink anything at all.  They survived by smelling apples and flowers.
Megasthenes and Pliny the Elder (quoting Megasthenes) mentioned these people in his Indica.  Megasthenes located them at the mouth of the river Ganges. In his description, they had rough and hairy bodies and no mouths. When traveling, they would carry roots, flowers and apples to smell. They could die by smelling a strong, unpleasant smell.
