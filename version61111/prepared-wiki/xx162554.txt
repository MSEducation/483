 In portraying the [[Garden of Eden]] story, after [[Lucifer]] has tempted [[Eve]] to eat of the fruit of the [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil|Tree of Knowledge]], [[God the Father]] asks Lucifer what he is doing, and Lucifer replies "that which has been done on other worlds".

===Noncanonical statements by church leaders===

====Alleged statements of early church leaders====

Some individual Latter-day Saints have espoused opinions that demonstrate their personal beliefs on the subject of other life in the universe.
According to a Latter-day Saint, Oliver B. Huntington, Joseph Smith, Jr. made a statement that there was life on the Moon; Huntington also reported that he was promised in a patriarchal blessing given to him by Joseph Smith, Sr. that he would preach the gospel to the inhabitants of the Moon.O. B. Huntington, "Our Sunday Chapter: The Inhabitants of the Moon", Young Woman's Journal 3:263–264 (Mar. 1892).
However, LDS researchers John A. Tvedtnes and Van Hale have expressed doubt about the reliability of Huntington's two claims. Regarding the first claim, it is likely that Huntington was repeating a description provided by another Latter-day Saint, Philo Dibble. (Huntington was a child at the time Smith lived and was not a close contemporary of Smith at any time during his life.) It is unclear what Dibble's source for the statement is, because Dibble did not indicate whether the recollection was his own or something he had heard from another person. The alleged teaching was first recorded by Huntington in a journal entry after he heard it from Dibble approximately forty years after Smith's death.John A. Tvedtnes, "Nature of Prophets and Prophecy", Foundation for Apologetic Information & Research. Regarding Huntington's second claim, the official LDS Church's record of the blessing indicates that it was given to Huntington by his father, William Huntington, and not by Joseph Smith, Sr.
There are no contemporary reports, records, or any other written support of Smith's alleged views or statements on extraterrestrials, nor are there any reports of statements other than the one claimed by Huntington, which both LDS and non-LDS scholars[tpl]who|date=March 2013[/tpl] widely view as being entirely unreliable and unverified. It has also been pointed out by LDS scholars John A. Tvedtnes and James B. Allen that, unlike many of Smith's statements, there is no indication that Smith claimed that any such alleged opinions on extraterrestrials was revealed to him by God nor that Smith was allegedly speaking under any prophetic authority.[tpl]citation |first= James B. |last= Allen |authorlink= James B. Allen (historian) |title= But Dick Tracy Landed on the Moon |journal= Sunstone |volume= 7 |issue= 5 |date=September–October 1982 |url= https://www.sunstonemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/035-18-19.pdf [/tpl]
In a statement given on July 24, 1870, LDS Church President Brigham Young discussed the possibility that the sun and the moon were inhabited. However, Young stated clearly that this was his own personal belief and thoughts.Journal of Discourses 13:271. Further, in response to a claim of his being ignorant on the matter, Young self-admitted his own ignorance further stating, "Are not we all ignorant to these matters?"
Various publications regarding the subject of Young's statement acknowledge that these were personal beliefs held by Young and such beliefs were common in the nineteenth century and were even considered to be "scientific fact" by many at the time.[tpl]citation |first= Van |last= Hale |title= Mormons And Moonmen |journal= Sunstone |volume= 7 |issue= 5 |date=September–October 1982 |page= 15 |url= https://www.sunstonemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/035-12-17.pdf [/tpl] For example, William Herschel, the discoverer of the planet Uranus, argued "who can say that it is not extremely probable, nay beyond doubt, that there must be inhabitants on the Moon of some kind or another?" Furthermore, on the scientist William Herschel, historians have claimed that "he William thought it possible that there was a region below the Sun's fiery surface where men might live, and he regarded the existence of life on the Moon as 'an absolute certainty.'"Patrick Moore, New Guide to the Moon (W.W. Norton & Company, New York: 1976), cited by [tpl]citation |first= Van |last= Hale |title= Mormons And Moonmen |journal= Sunstone |volume= 7 |issue= 5 |date=September–October 1982 |page= 15 |url= https://www.sunstonemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/035-12-17.pdf [/tpl]
In any event, LDS scholars[tpl]who|date=March 2013[/tpl] have commented that the personal and, self-admitted, ignorant beliefs of Brigham Young on the subject of "inhabited worlds" has never even been considered as being doctrine (neither unofficial nor official) of the LDS Church.

====Modern leaders====

Some modern LDS Church leaders have taught that there are people living on other earths. For instance, apostle Joseph Fielding Smith (1876–1972) wrote:
 
 "We are not the only people that the Lord has created. We have brothers and sisters on other earths. They look like us because they, too, are the children of God and were created in his image, for they are also his offspring."Joseph Fielding Smith, Doctrines of Salvation 1:62, 1999, ISBN 978-1-57008-646-5

and
 
 "...the great universe of stars has multiplied beyond the comprehension of men. Evidently each of these great systems is governed by divine law; with divine presiding Gods, for it would be unreasonable to assume that each was not so governed."Joseph Fielding Smith, Answers to Gospel Questions 2:144, 1980, ISBN 978-0-87747-004-5

Apostle Neal A. Maxwell (1926–2004) wrote, "we do not know how many inhabited worlds there are, or where they are. But certainly we are not alone."Neal A. Maxwell, A Wonderful Flood of Light, 1989, p. 25.

==Mormon metaphysics==

Mormon scripture, and the teachings of Joseph Smith, Jr., include a number of details concerning the nature of light, elements, matter, "spirit matter", and intelligence.
According to Mormon scripture, "the elements are eternal".Doctrine and Covenants 93:33. This means, according to Smith, that the elements are co-existent with God, and "they may be organized and reorganized, but not destroyed. They had not beginning, and can have no end."The Contributor, vol. 4, p. 257 (Joseph Smith, April 1844 sermon).  This was elaborated by Brigham Young, who said, "God never made something out of nothing; it is not in the economy or law of which the worlds were, are, or will exist."Journal of Discourses 14:116  Thus, Mormons deny ex nihilo creation and instead believe that God created or "organized" the universe out of pre-existing elements.
Along with physical matter, Mormons believe that spirit "intelligences" have existed co-eternally with God.Joseph Smith (Joseph Fielding Smith ed.). Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith (Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret Book) pp. 353–354.Bruce R. McConkie (1966). Mormon Doctrine (Salt Lake City, Utah: Bookcraft) p. 387.
Mormons believe in a universe and a God governed by physical law, in which all miracles, including acts of God, have a natural explanation, though science does not yet have the tools or means necessary to explain them.[tpl]Harvtxt|Ostling|Ostling|2007|p=306[/tpl].

==Pre-Mortality==

===Spirit intelligences===

It is believed there were pre-existing "spirit intelligences" that existed before the Heavenly Parents (God the Father and the Mother in Heaven) created spiritual bodies for them. "Self-existing intelligences were organized into individual spirit beings"Marion G. Romney, “The Worth of Souls,” Ensign, November 1978, p. 13. by the Heavenly Parents and they became the "begotten sons and daughters of God".Doctrine and Covenants 76:24.

===God's spirit children===

Through an unexplained procreative process involving himself and the Mother in Heaven, God the Father created spirit bodies for an innumerable number of spirit intelligences.
Although the existence of a goddess mother is not explicitly taught in official Mormon scripture, official LDS Church publications refer to "heavenly parents", thereby suggesting that God the Father and a goddess Heavenly Mother may have co-produced spirit children.
