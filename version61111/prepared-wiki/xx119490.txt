Maria Ossowska (née Maria Niedźwiecka, 16 January 1896, Warsaw – 13 August 1974, Warsaw) was a Polish sociologist and social philosopher. 

==Life==

A student of the philosopher Tadeusz Kotarbiński, she originally in 1925 received a doctorate in philosophy at the University of Warsaw with a thesis on Bertrand Russell. In her later work, she focused on the philosophy and sociology of ethics. Ossowska is often mentioned as a member of the Lwów–Warsaw School of Logic, though strictly speaking this is not correct, since formal logic was not her main area of interest.
From 1941 until 1945, Ossowska taught in the Polish underground university system. 1945-1948 she was a professor at the University of Łódź, since then at the University of Warsaw. She was banned from teaching between 1952 and 1956, while sociology was removed from Polish universities as a "bourgeois" discipline. From 1952 until 1962, she directed the Institute for the History and Theory of Ethics within the Institute of Philosophy and Sociology of the Polish Academy of Sciences (PAN). In 1972, Ossowska was awarded a first-degree Polish National Award (Polska Nagroda Państwowa I stopnia), the highest accolade of the Polish state.
Ossowska was married to sociologist Stanisław Ossowski, with whom she closely cooperated in research and teaching.
Maria Ossowska and Stanisław Ossowski are considered to be among the founders of the field of "science of science" due to their authorship of a seminal 1935 paper titled "The Science of Science."Originally published in Polish as "Nauka o nauce" in the Polish journal Nauka Polska (Polish Science), vol. XX, no. 3, 1935; reprinted in English in Bohdan Walentynowicz, ed., Polish Contributions to the Science of Science, 1982, pp. 82-95.A synonym for "science of science" is the back-formed term "logology" (Christopher Kasparek, "Prus' Pharaoh:  the Creation of a Historical Novel", The Polish Review, vol. XXXIX, no. 1, 1994, note 3, pp. 45–46; Stefan Zamecki, Komentarze do naukoznawczych poglądów Williama Whewella (1794–1866):  studium historyczno-metodologiczne to the Logological Views of William Whewell (1794–1866):  A Historical-Methodological Study, Warsaw, Polish Academy of Sciences, 2012, English-language summary, pp. 741–43).  The term "logology" provides convenient grammatical variants not available with the earlier terms, "science of science" and "sociology of science":  i.e., "logologist", "to logologize", "logological", "logologically".
