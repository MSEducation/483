You Only Live Twice is the soundtrack for the fifth James Bond film of the same name. It was composed by Bond veteran John Barry. At the time, this was his fourth credited Bond film. The theme song, "You Only Live Twice", was sung by Nancy Sinatra, with music by Barry and lyrics by Leslie Bricusse. The film's incidental music is regarded as among the finest of Barry's scores for the Bond series.[tpl]By whom|date=May 2010[/tpl] "Capsule in Space", an impressionistic cue of layered piano and strings ostinatos, is probably the most famous piece of incidental music from the Bond series after "007".[tpl]By whom|date=May 2010[/tpl] The soundtrack has previously been available in two versions on CD – the first, a straight reissue of the LP soundtrack, and the second, an expanded reissue including several previously unreleased tracks.

==Alternative theme==

An earlier version of the theme song with a similar arrangement and lyrics but different melody (and without the distinctive cascading strings), sung by an uncredited Julie Rogers, was included in the James Bond 30th Anniversary 2-CD boxed set, cited as a "demo." Rogers never thought it was a demo, but a finished version for the film.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mi6.co.uk/sections/articles/interview_julie_rogers.php3?t=yolt&s=yolt|title=Julie Rogers Interview|publisher=MI6.co.uk|date=27 June 2007|accessdate=23 May 2010[/tpl] After this version was recorded, the producers sought out Nancy Sinatra for the vocal and Barry reorchestrated the song to suit her range.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mi6.co.uk/sections/articles/yolt_song_history.php3|title=You Only Sing Twice|publisher=MI6.co.uk|date=17 June 2007|accessdate=23 May 2010[/tpl] An alternative example of the title song (also called "You Only Live Twice" and sung by Lorraine Chandler) was discovered in the vaults of RCA records in the 1990s. Possibly intended as a demo for consideration by the film's producers,[tpl]fact|date=September 2012[/tpl] it can be found on compilations such as Rare, Collectable, and Soulful Vol. 2.[tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p185122/biography|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|title=Biography – Lorraine Chandler|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=2 February 2008[/tpl] Little Anthony & The Imperials recorded a rendition of the song for United Artists Records as well. It appeared on their 1967 album, Movie Grabbers on the label's Veep Records subsidiary that year, and was released as single from that album.

==Track listing==

Tracks 13 to 19 were added later, as a bonus, to the complete version of the original soundtrack upon its digitally remastered CD rerelease.
Twice Is the Only Way to Live was the final track on the soundtrack's original UK version. It was also included on the United Artists soundtrack compilation Ten Golden Years (1968). On certain releases of the You Only Live Twice soundtrack album, the alternate "007" theme is included. It is heard within the film when Little Nellie is being constructed and continues to play until three or four SPECTRE helicopters encounter Bond, at which point the music changes to the "James Bond Theme".
The theme "Kronos Unveiled" from the score of Pixar's 2004 film The Incredibles bears a close resemblance to the track "Capsule in Space" (reprised in "Soviet Capsule"), while the film's trailer had used Barry's original On Her Majesty's Secret Service theme.
Propellerheads' cover of Barry's On Her Majesty's Secret Service with David Arnold also incorporates, in its full 9-minute version, "Capsule in Space" as a central segue.
The song, "You Only Live Twice", was featured at the end of Mad Men episode "The Phantom".
