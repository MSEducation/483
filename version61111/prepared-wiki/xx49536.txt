The Karakoram, or Karakorum ([tpl]zh|s=喀喇昆仑山脉|t=喀喇崑崙山脈|p=Kālǎkūnlún Shānmài[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-hi|काराकोरम[/tpl], Kārākōram; [tpl]lang-ur|سلسلہ کوہ قراقرم[/tpl]), Balti: Kharan-a-Kuram, is a large mountain range spanning the borders between  Pakistan, India and China, located in the regions of Gilgit–Baltistan (Pakistan), Ladakh (India), and Xinjiang region, (China). It is one of the Greater Ranges of Asia and is considered to be a subrange of the Himalayas.
The Karakoram is home to the highest concentration of peaks over 8000m in height to be found anywhere on earth,BBC, Planet Earth, "Mountains", Part Three including K2, the second highest peak in the world [tpl]convert|8611|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl].
The range is about [tpl]convert|500|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] in length, and is the most heavily glaciated part of the world outside the polar regions. The Siachen Glacier at [tpl]convert|70|km|mi[/tpl] and the Biafo Glacier at [tpl]convert|63|km|mi[/tpl] rank as the world's second and third longest glaciers outside the polar regions.Tajikistan's Fedchenko Glacier is [tpl]convert|77|km|mi[/tpl] long.  Baltoro and Batura Glaciers in the Karakoram are [tpl]convert|57|km|mi[/tpl] long, as is Bruggen or Pio XI Glacier in southern Chile. Measurements are from recent imagery, generally supplemented with Russian 1:200,000 scale topographic mapping as well as Jerzy Wala,Orographical Sketch Map: Karakoram:  Sheets 1 & 2, Swiss Foundation for Alpine Research, Zurich, 1990. Some of the debris-covered Karakoram glaciers are found to be expanding but other ones are retreating.
The Karakoram is bounded on the northeast by the edge of the Tibetan Plateau, and on the north by the Pamir Mountains. The southern boundary of the Karakoram is formed, west to east, by the Gilgit, Indus, and Shyok Rivers, which separate the range from the northwestern end of the Himalaya range proper as these rivers converge southwestward towards the plains of Pakistan.
The Tashkurghan National Nature Reserve and the Pamir Wetlands National Nature Reserve in the Karalorun and Pamir mountains have been nominated for inclusion in UNESCO in 2010 by the National Commission of the People's Republic of China for UNESCO and has tentatively been added to the list.[tpl]cite web|title=Karakorum-Pamir|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5535/|publisher=unesco|accessdate=16 February 2013[/tpl]
