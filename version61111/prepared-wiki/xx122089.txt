==Game Play==

The official players in Mike Piazza's Strike Zone have different batting and pitching styles as well as stamina that causes them to perform with less precision after being used continuously. When batting the ball has a flame-like trail behind it that tells the hitter whether it is in the Strike Zone (red) or in the Ball Zone (blue), allowing the player to better choose which balls to hit. Saving the season, and saving a player created team, require separate Control Paks.Nintendo Power issue 110, page 65 While playing with a Rumble Pak it cannot be replaced with the control Pak while the game is being played, and a separate controller is needed to save.Instruction Booklet, page 15
