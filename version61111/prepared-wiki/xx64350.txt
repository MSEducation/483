Riverdale (population: 47,850, according to the 2000 U.S. Census) is an upper middle class residential neighborhood in the northwest portion of The Bronx, New York City. Riverdale contains the northernmost point in New York City.

==History==

Early in its residential development, Riverdale was a 19th-century estate district where many of Manhattan's moguls built their country estates.  At the turn of the century, the new popularity of railroad commute enabled wealthy businessmen to make Riverdale their year-round residence.  The Fieldston neighborhood, owned by a private association, is a particularly intact example of a turn-of-the century upper class suburb. The Hudson Hill neighborhood retains many of its historic mansions. Riverdale's elite private schools and historic churches also reflect this past.
As the 20th century progressed, upscale apartment buildings and smaller houses were added to the neighborhood. To this day, Riverdale continues to maintain its character as an affluent enclave in the city of New York. The rich history of Riverdale has led to the creation of the Riverdale Historic District.
Leland Weintraub, the commissioner who moved for the district's creation, noted that "most of the features commonly associated with the American romantic suburb of the mid-19th century," including "a picturesque site, landscaping and architecture; connection to the city by accessible transportation and a layout adapted to the topography" are present in the area.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/21/realestate/postings-historic-designation-recognizing-riverdale.html|title=Postings: Historic Designation; Recognizing Riverdale|newspaper=The New York Times|location=New York|date= October 21, 1990|edition= Late Edition (East Coast)|page= A.1|accessdate=June 11, 2009[/tpl]

==Geography==

Riverdale covers about three square miles in area. Riverdale has one of the highest elevations in New York City, affording it spectacular views of the Empire State Building, George Washington Bridge, Hudson River and New Jersey Palisades. It is also remarkable for the numerous parks and expanses of lush greenery and original forest that overwhelm its hilly, serene landscape. It is bordered on the north by the city of Yonkers; to the east by Van Cortlandt Park, the Kingsbridge section east of Broadway, and the Marble Hill section of Manhattan; to the west by the Hudson River; and to the south by the Harlem River, which creates a small geographic barrier between Riverdale and upper Manhattan.

==Housing==

Before the wider development of Riverdale, housing consisted of large, architecturally distinguished mansions built in the early 20th century, mostly in Georgian- and Tudor-revival styles, which recall scenes of "rural Connecticut" rather than the city.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/ref/realestate/nabe-riverdale.html |title=Riverdale, the Bronx, Real Estate Buying Guide |location=Bronx (NYC) |publisher=New York Times |date= |accessdate=2013-09-12[/tpl] These are mostly concentrated in the Fieldston section of Riverdale, known as the estate area. In addition, more affordable pre-war buildings and smaller houses are scattered throughout Riverdale.
The 1950s saw the construction of many low rise (six story) brick buildings. By the early to mid 1960s, a number of larger brick towers (10-20 stories) started popping up. Many of these full service buildings featuring doormen were designed by seasoned architect Philip Birnbaum who designed over 300 buildings in the city, including Skyview, the Windsors, and the Whitehall.[tpl]cite news|first=David W. |last=Dunlap |date=28 November 28, 1996 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/28/arts/philip-birnbaum-89-builder-celebrated-for-his-efficiency.html |title=Philip Birnbaum, 89, Builder Celebrated for His Efficiency |publisher=New York Times accessdate=2013-09-12[/tpl]
By the 1980s, most of the apartment buildings which were owned by single landlords and rented, were converted in to cooperatives. Unlike most of the Bronx, Riverdale is mostly owner-occupied housing.
Spuyten Duyvil has the greatest concentration of high rises in Riverdale with the Century, 555 Kappock, and Winston Churchill next to one another.
Since 2005, Central Riverdale has experienced a building boom with the addition of many mid- and high-rise condominium buildings which contrast with the older brick style.
