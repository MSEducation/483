Laurence Tomson (1539–1608) was an English politician, author, and translator.   He acted as the personal secretary of Sir Francis Walsingham, the secretary of state to Elizabeth I of England.  During the reign of Mary I he had been lecturer in Hebrew at the University of Geneva.
Tomson revised both the text and the annotations of the New Testament of the Geneva Bible.  His revised edition appeared in 1576.  Tomson was a Calvinist, and his annotations reflect that system of theology.

==Life==

He was born in Northamptonshire, and was admitted a demy of Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1553. He graduated B.A. in 1559, was elected a fellow of his college, and commenced M.A. in 1564. He accompanied Sir Thomas Hoby on his embassy to France in 1566; and in 1569 he resigned his fellowship.[tpl]cite DNB|wstitle=Tomson, Laurence[/tpl]
Between 1575 and 1587 Tomson represented Weymouth and Melcombe Regis in the House of Commons, and he was member for Downton in 1588–9. In 1582 he was in attendance at court at Windsor Castle. According to his epitaph he travelled in Sweden, Russia, Denmark, Germany, Italy, and France; was conversant with twelve languages; and at one period gave public lectures on the Hebrew language at Geneva. He was employed in political affairs by Sir Francis Walsingham, after whose death he retired into private life.
Tomson died on 29 March 1608, and was buried in the chancel of the church at Chertsey, Surrey, where a black marble was erected to his memory with a curious Latin inscription.
