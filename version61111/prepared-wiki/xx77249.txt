Jotham ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|oʊ|.|θ|əm[/tpl];LDS.org: "Book of Mormon Pronunciation Guide" (retrieved 2012-02-25), IPA-ified from «jō´thum» [tpl]Hebrew Name 1|יוֹתָם[/tpl] (yo-TAM), "God is perfect" or "God is complete"; [tpl]lang-el|Ιωαθαμ[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-la|Joatham[/tpl]) was the youngest of Gideon's seventy sons. He escaped when the rest were put to death by the order of his half-brother Abimelech (Judges 9:5). When "the citizens of Shechem and the whole house of Millo" were gathered together "by the plain of the pillar" (i.e., the stone set up by Joshua, 24:26; compare Genesis 35:4) "that was in Shechem, to make Abimelech king," from one of the heights of Mount Gerizim he protested against their doing so in the earliest parable, that of the bramble-king. This parable is often repeated at Tu Bishvat and is famous in Israel. His words then spoken were prophetic. There came a recoil in the feelings of the people toward Abimelech, and then a terrible revenge, in which many were slain and the city of Shechem was destroyed by Abimelech (Judg. 9:45). Having delivered his warning, Jotham fled to Beer from the vengeance of Abimelech (9:7-21).
