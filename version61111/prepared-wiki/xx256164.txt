Ordered by the Bristol General Steam Navigation Company, but before she was put into service she was purchased in May 1864 by George Campbell and Henry Collis, acting for the Virginia Importing and Exporting Company. She was renamed Old Dominion and used as a Blockade runner.
She arrived at Wilmington, North Carolina on 28 June 1864 from Bermuda, sailed back on 15 July 1864. A second voyage from Bermuda saw her arrive on 10 August 1864 again in Wilmington, North Carolina.  She was used in the blockade running until February 1865. She made six successful runs through the blockade. 
On her return to the UK, she was reregistered as P.S. ''Sheffield'' for the Liverpool and Dublin Steam Navigation Company.
In 1867 she was bought by Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway and London and North-Western Railway and renamed P.S. ''Prince Arthur'' for their Fleetwood to Belfast and Londonderry service.
She was sold by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway in 1877 to T. Seed in Liverpool.
