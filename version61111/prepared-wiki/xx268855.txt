==Death==

Silvestre was abducted and murdered 2 August 2011 in connection with his reports about drug trafficking.[tpl]cite news|first=Jean-Michel |last=Caroit |title=En République dominicaine, les narcotrafiquants ont infiltré tous les niveaux de pouvoir |newspaper=La Monde |date=August 30, 2011 |accessdate=2013-10-03 |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/ameriques/article/2011/08/29/en-republique-dominicaine-les-narcotrafiquants-ont-infiltre-tous-les-niveaux-de-pouvoir_1564845_3222.html |language=French[/tpl] The week before an attempt had been made on Silvestre's life. Police allege Matías Avelino Castro, also known as "Daniel" or "Daniel the Big Gun of Samana," ordered his murder. Silvestre was seized by at least four men outside a La Romana hotel near his home and was forced into a Ford Explorer. The attackers shot Silvestre three times to kill him and then dumped his corpse near a highway at a place called "El Peñón", which is near Sabana del Soco, San Pedro de Macorís, and is located between La Romana and Santo Domingo. Police say Castro, who also goes by the alias Joaquín Espinal Almeyda, wanted to avenge a mention in an article by Silvestre linking him to criminal activity, including the murder of two people in the eastern city of La Romana.[tpl]cite news|author=UPI Reporte Latin America. |title=Policía dominicana busca autor intelectual de asesinato de periodista |publisher=Radio la Primerisima |date=August 10, 2011 |accessdate=November 8, 2011 |url=http://www.radiolaprimerisima.com/noticias/103949/policia-dominicana-busca-autor-intelectual-de-asesinato-de-periodista |language=Spanish[/tpl] Silvestre said before his murder that he would make an announcement on his TV program.
