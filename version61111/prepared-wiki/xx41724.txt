==History==

The airport was founded in 1932 as a grass strip under the name Vliegveld Welschap (Welschap Airfield). In 1939 the airfield was acquired for use by the Air Force, as concerns over a military conflict with Germany increased. The airfield was captured quickly by German forces during the Battle of the Netherlands and re-used by them under the name Fliegerhorst Eindhoven. The airfield was expanded and improved by the Germans, with three paved runways and numerous hangars and support buildings being constructed. The airfield was captured by American paratroopers during Operation Market Garden. Damage to the airfield was repaired and the airfield was re-used as an Advanced Landing Ground by both US and British forces under the designation B-78. The airfield was returned to the Royal Netherlands Air Force in 1952. It was home to Republic F-84 Thunderjet and Republic F-84F Thunderstreak and later the Northrop F-5.
In 1984 a terminal building for civilian air traffic is constructed. After the end of the Cold War, Eindhoven was transformed into a military transport base. Initially it was home to F27-300M Troopship aircraft. Over the years to come, Fokker 50, Fokker 60, McDonnell Douglas KDC-10, Lockheed C-130 Hercules and Gulfstream IV aircraft were stationed at the air base. The Fokker aircraft have been retired.
On 15 July 1996, a Belgian Air Force C-130 Hercules crashed at the airport - known as the Herculesramp (Hercules disaster). The plane caught fire and in the intense heat, 34 people died. As a result of communication problems within the emergency services the fire services were not aware that the C130 carried many passengers, which likely caused more people to die than if the emergency services had known about this.[tpl]nl icon[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.zero-meridean.nl/c_eindhoven_150796.html|title=Hercules ramp Eindhoven|publisher=Zwaailichten disaster website|date=15 July 1996|accessdate=22 February 2009[/tpl]
On the civilian side, the airport has continued to grow and is now the second largest airport in the Netherlands. To accommodate this, in early 2012 work to further expand Eindhoven airport was started.[tpl]nl icon[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kcap.eu/en/news/2011/construction_terminal_extension_and_hotel_eindhoven_airport_has_started|title=Construction terminal extension and hotel Eindhoven Airport has started|publisher=kcap.eu|date=19 December 2011|accessdate=2013-01-21[/tpl] Now, there is a 120 room Tulip Inn Hotel.

==Airlines and destinations==

==Military==

From 1 July 2007, Eindhoven, is the location of the Movement Coordination Centre Europe (MCCE), a merger of the former European Airlift Centre (EAC), established by the European Air Group, and the Sealift Coordination Centre (SCC). MCCE is a non NATO/non European military organization. MCCE is an organization open to all Governments whose membership is accepted by all the others participant nations, regulated by a specific legal technical agreement. The Mission of the MCCE is to coordinate the use of Air Transport, Surface Transport  (sea and land) and Air-to-Air Refuelling (AAR) capabilities between participating Nations and thereby improve the overall efficiency of the use of owned or leased assets of the national military organisations. The Centreâ€™s main focus will be on strategic movements, but not excluding operational and tactical movements. 
From September 2010 Eindhoven Airport is also hosting the European Air Transport Command, composed of 5 European Nations (Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands) who are willing to share aerial military assets in a single operative command.

==Ground transport==

Eindhoven Airport is located just off the A2 motorway which offers direct connections to the west and south of the country, including the cities of Amsterdam, Utrecht and Maastricht. The airport is also served by two of Eindhoven's bus routes.
