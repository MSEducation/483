==History==

Tregaron received its royal charter as a town in 1292.Tregaron: Images of a country town Tregaron and District Historical Society & Landmark Publishing UK, 2006. ISBN 1-84306-197-X[tpl]rp|p7[/tpl] It owes its origin and growth to its central location in the upper Teifi Valley. It was the market town for the scattered agricultural communities in the broad, fertile countryside to the south and the rich landowners with extensive holdings in the uplands to the east, the home of many sheep and few people. To the north was Cors Caron which was a fertile land when drained, and to the west a hilly region with self-sufficient farmers on smallholdings of a few acres. These people all converged on Tregaron for the weekly market and the annual fair, Ffair Garon, where the sale of poultry, pigs, cattle and horses took place. The charter for the yearly fair was granted by Edward I in the 13th century.Jones, Emrys Tregaron: The Sociology of a Market Town in Central Cardiganshire in "Welsh Rural Communities", Ed. Davies E., Rees A. D., University of Wales Press, Cardiff 1960, p. 71 Sheep fairs were held in May and June and two hiring fairs took place in November. A large number of taverns and inns in the town catered for the influx of country folk to these events.Jenkins, J. Geraint: Ceredigion: Interpreting an Ancient County. Gwasg Careg Gwalch, 2005[tpl]rp|p30[/tpl]
In the middle of the 18th century, Matthew Evans kept an inn in the town. He had two sons and a daughter who were celebrated robbers and collectively known as Plant Mat ( Matthew's children in English). They lived for several years in a cave near Devils Bridge which still bears their name. They terrorized the district and would give to their friends a glove to act as a passport and identify them to their brethren. It was difficult to apprehend the trio because of the narrowness of the entrance to the cave which made it impossible to storm. After several years of success, they committed a murder and, eventually being taken, were sentenced to death and executed.Meyrick, Samuel Rush. The History of Cardiganshire. S. A. Collard (1907][tpl]rp|p240[/tpl]
Tregaron was a main gathering place for the drovers who, before the advent of rail transport, herded large numbers of cattle, sheep and even geese hundreds of miles to the markets of south-east England. Many Tregaron men were drovers and accumulated considerable wealth in the process. They acted as news carriers and unofficial postmen and some were adept at avoiding tollgates.[tpl]rp|p31[/tpl]
The Tregaron area had a number of water-driven woollen mills and was a centre for the manufacture of hosiery. Woollen socks were knitted at home by men, women and children and sold at the market, often to dealers who resold them in the industrial valleys of South Wales.[tpl]rp|p32[/tpl]

==Culture and community==

The church is dedicated to St Caron. He was a man of lowly origins but "his courage and generous deportment obtained him the sovereignty in Wales: he made war against the Romans, reigned seven years and was buried in Tregarron".[tpl]rp|p242[/tpl] The church has a tower and stands on a rocky eminence. It consists of a simple nave and chancel.
Other notable buildings in the town include the 13th-century Talbot Hotel, which supposedly has an elephant buried in its grounds.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-12697207 |title=University archaeologists to dig for Tregaron elephant |author= |date=10 March 2011 |work= |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=11 March 2011[/tpl]The Tregaron Elephant Project: Myth, story and legend at School of Archaeology, History and Anthropology, The University of Wales Trinity Saint David, April 2011 The remote chapel Soar y mynydd is close to Tregaron.

===Public transport===

In 1860, government subsidisation was approved for the construction of a railway from Manchester to Milford Haven. At the urging of local people led by David Davies and supported by Joseph Jenkins, capital was subscribed for a station at Tregaron.Phillips, Bethan Pity the Swagman (Cymdeithas Lifrau Ceredigion Gyf., Aberystwyth 2002)[tpl]rp|pp 70â€“72[/tpl] The section from Pencader to Lampeter was completed in January 1866 and the grand opening of the entire line was held at Aberystwyth on 12 August 1867.[tpl]rp|pp 79[/tpl] providing a boost to the economy of the town. 
Tregaron's train service was withdrawn and the station closed in 1965 after the line was badly damaged by flooding south of Aberystwyth.  There is an approximately two-hourly bus service to Aberystwyth and Lampeter and a more sporadic service to other neighbouring small towns and villages but, as with many rural areas, there are no buses after approximately 18.00 in the evening and none at all on Sundays and bank holidays.
