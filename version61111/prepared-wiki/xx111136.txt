Carl Friedrich Nagelsbach (March 28, 1806 – April 21, 1859), was a German classical scholar.
Nagelsbach was born at Wöhrd near Nuremberg. After studying at Erlangen and Berlin, in 1827 he accepted an appointment at the Nuremberg gymnasium and eventually became a professor of classics at Erlangen from 1842 until his death. Nagelsbach is chiefly known for his excellent Lateinische Stilistik (1846; 9th ed. by Ivan Müller, 1905). Two other important works by him are Die Homerische Theologie (1840; 3rd ed. by G. Autenrieth, 1886) and Die Nachhomerische Theologie (1857).
