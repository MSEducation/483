John William "Jack" McCartan (born August 5, 1935) was a goaltender for the gold-medal-winning 1960 United States hockey team. He is also a member of the United States Hockey Hall of Fame, inducted in 1983.
McCartan was born in Saint Paul, Minnesota. He was a college standout at the University of Minnesota from 1955-1958. McCartan also played baseball at Minnesota.http://www.gophersports.com/genrel/090607aaz.html McCartan was named First Team All-America after the 1957-1958 season. He played for the bronze medal winning US team in baseball at the 1959 Pan American Games.http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/mc/jack-mccartan-1.html After graduating, he joined the U.S. Army. While in the army, he joined the United States Olympic hockey team. His heroics helped the U.S. team defeat such powerful teams as Canada, the Soviet Union, and Czechoslovakia and win the gold medal at Squaw Valley. For his efforts, he was named as the "All-World" goaltender of the Winter Games.
He could not duplicate his success in the National Hockey League. The New York Rangers gave him a four-game trial late in the 1959–60 season and he did quite well, the highlight being a save on Gordie Howe of the Detroit Red Wings. Coach Alf Pike decided to alternate Gump Worsley and McCartan in 1960–61, but when McCartan gave up 36 goals in 7½ games, Worsley became the full-time goalkeeper and McCartan was demoted to the minors. He played for several minor league teams over the next several years. He played in the Eastern Professional League, Western League, Central League, and World Hockey Association. In the early 1970s he resurfaced when the Minnesota Fighting Saints of the World Hockey Association signed him, but he retired after two seasons.
He later scouted for the Vancouver Canucks.
