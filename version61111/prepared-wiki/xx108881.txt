==History==

Harrods Estates, part of the Harrods grouphttp://www.harrods.com/content/about-us/harrods-group/ (Harrods, Harrods Aviation, Air Harrods, Harrods Bank and Harrods Corporate Services), were founded in 1897 and occupied a discreet position on the ground floor of the main Harrods building before moving three times between 1904 and 1908 as the team expanded in size from two employees to 20.http://www.harrodsestates.com/company-info/history
In 1919 the office moved across the road to 62-64 Brompton Road and provided an additional Auction Hall in the floor above, but in 1944 the office suffered a direct strike by a V-I Flying Rocket also known as a 'doodlebug rocket' which demolished the building.http://www.harrodsestates.com/company-info/history  However, close to 300,000 packets of papers survived and a temporary move to the Wholesale office on Hans Crescent meant not a single day of work was lost.http://www.harrodsestates.com/company-info/history
Harrods Estates relocated its headquarters two more times to Basil Street then Park Lane, London http://www.harrodsestates.com/company-info/history before making their last move in 2001 when they returned to Brompton Road, this time number 82 -  giving them a location directly opposite the main store and just yards from their original premises.
