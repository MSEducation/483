==Atomic bombing==

The entire shopping area along Hondōri was destroyed by the 1945 atomic bombing, due to the blast and fire.  Shimomura Jewelers, located in a reinforced concrete building with an iconic clock tower, was severely damaged but like a number of concrete buildings in Hiroshima, it partially survived.  The blast caused its side walls to severely tilt over.  The Teikoku Bank building also survived the blast, although its roof collapsed, a wall was destroyed, and it received other structural damages.  By May 1950, the Teikoku Bank building had been restored and the Takaki Bakery (Andersen Bakery) opened in the building in 1967.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pcf.city.hiroshima.jp/virtual/VirtualMuseum_e/exhibit_e/exh0603_e/exh060309.html |title=Kamiya-cho and Hondori |publisher=Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum |accessdate=2008-05-23[/tpl]

==Present day==

In the 1950s, Hondōri was reconstructed and now it is a modern shopping arcade, which connects the Peace Memorial Park, across Rijō-dōri, to PARCO (shopping center/department store) and Hatchōbori.  
Hiroshima's Hiroden (street cars) stop at the Hondōri Tram Stop.  The Astram Line also serves Hondori, with the Hondōri Station as a terminal station.
Okonomi-mura, located near the east end of Hondōri, was the top food theme park destination for families in Japan according to an April 2004 poll.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.home-tv.co.jp/jstation/news/2004_2.html|title=「お好み村」が家族で行ってみたいフードテーマパークで1位に！|trans_title="Okonomi-mura" the #1 food theme park families want to visit!|date=May 3, 2004|publisher=Hiroshima Home Television|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uuBOF5jV|archivedate=December 11, 2010|language=Japanese[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jiu.ac.jp/books/bulletin/2007/tour/07_ushida.pdf|format=PDF|title=観光地における飲食業|trans_title=The food and drink industry in sightseeing areas|author=牛田泰正 (Yasumasa Uchida)|language=Japanese|date=Spring 2007|page=50|accessdate=December 11, 2010|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uuDHPwrW|archivedate=December 11, 2010[/tpl]
