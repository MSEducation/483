Aloha Stadium, also known as Hawaiian Airlines Field at Aloha Stadium, is a stadium located in Halawa, Hawaii; a western suburb of Honolulu (though with a Honolulu address). Aloha Stadium is currently home to the University of Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i Warriors football team (Mountain West Conference, NCAA Division I FBS). It hosts the NCAA's Hawai'i Bowl, and has also been home to the National Football League's Pro Bowl since 1980 (except in 2010) and the NCAA's Hula Bowl from 1975 to 1997 and again in 2006. It also hosts numerous high school football games during the season, and serves as a venue for large concerts and events. A swap meet in the stadium's parking lot every Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday draws large crowds.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.alohastadiumswapmeet.net/Contents/AboutUs.asp |title=Hawaii's premier Aloha Stadium Swap Meet an Outdoor Market in Hawaii|Aloha Outdoor Market, Flea Markets and Swap meet for shopping in Honolulu |publisher=Alohastadiumswapmeet.net |date=1975-09-12 |accessdate=2009-07-16| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090531123144/http://alohastadiumswapmeet.net/Contents/AboutUs.asp| archivedate= 31 May 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Aloha Stadium once served as home field for the AAA Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i Islanders of the Pacific Coast League from 1975 to 1987 before the team moved to Colorado Springs.

==History==

Located west of downtown Honolulu and two miles north of Honolulu International Airport, Aloha Stadium was constructed in 1975 at a cost of $37 million. It was built as a replacement for the aging Honolulu Stadium on King Street, demolished in 1976.
The first sporting event ever held at Aloha Stadium was a football game played between the University of Hawaii and Texas A&I (now Texas A&M-Kingsville) on September 13, 1975. The crowd was 32,247.Aloha Stadium Swap Meet "About Us" page, alohastadiumswapmeet.net
As originally built, Aloha Stadium could be reconfigured into various configurations for different sport venues and other purposes. Four movable 7,000-seat sections, each 3.5 million pounds could move using air casters into a diamond configuration for baseball (also used for soccer), an oval for football, or a triangle for concerts. A 2005 study by Honolulu engineering firm Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates, Inc. determined that the stadium required $99 million to be completely restored and an additional $115 million for ongoing maintenance and refurbishment over the next 20 years to extend its useful life.[tpl]cite web|url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2007/May/11/ln/FP705110373.html |title=Stadium rust to get $12.4M treatment|publisher=The Honolulu Advertiser |date=2007-05-11 |accessdate=2009-07-16[/tpl] In January 2007, the stadium was permanently locked into its football configuration due to cost and maintenance issues.  An engineer from Rolair Systems, the NASA spin-off company that engineered the system,[tpl]cite web|url=http://spinoff.nasa.gov/spinoff/spinitem?title=Convertible+Stadium|title=Convertible Stadium|accessdate=August 9, 2012|publisher=NASA[/tpl] claims that the problem was caused by a concrete contractor that ignored specifications for the concrete pads under the stadium.[tpl]cite journal|last=Kieding|first=Bob|title=Moving Seats|journal=Popular Science|publisher=Wright's Media|pages=8|year=2012|issue=October|accessdate=September 9, 2012[/tpl]
There have been numerous discussions with Hawaii lawmakers who are concerned with the physical condition of the stadium. There are several issues regarding rusting of the facility, several hundred seats that need to be replaced, and restroom facilities that need to be expanded to accommodate more patrons.  Much of the rust is due to a design flaw in the weathering steel used to build the stadium.  It was intended to create a protective patina that would eliminate the need for painting.  However, in the ocean salt-laden air of Honolulu, it has never stopped rusting.
In early 2007, the state legislature proposed to spend $300 million to build a new facility as opposed to spending approximately $216 million to extend the life of Aloha Stadium for another 20–30 years. The new stadium may also be used to attempt to lure a Super Bowl to Hawaii in the future.
One council member has said that if immediate repairs are not made within the next seven years, then the stadium will probably have to be demolished due to safety concerns. In May 2007, the state alloted $12.4 million to be used towards removing corrosion and rust from the structure.

==Expansion and improvements==

In 2003, the stadium surface was changed from AstroTurf (which had been in place since the stadium opened) to FieldTurf. up until 2011.
In July 2011 the field was upgraded to UBU Sports Speed S5-M synthetic turf system that features the exclusive Removable Active Panel system as part of the multimillion dollar renovation to Aloha Stadium.  The synthetic turf system covers 110,000 sq ft and has 22 Removable Active Panel's located in 7 locations.  The RAP's have inlaid logos for the University of Hawaii and Aloha Bowl as well as blank panels to accommodate the NFL Pro Bowl and NCAA Bowl Games that will be custom painted for each event.
In 2008, the state of Hawaii approved the bill of $185 million to refurbish the aging Aloha Stadium.[tpl]cite news |title=Hawaii stadium to get $185M overhaul; UH expands pay-per-view package |first=Brandon |last=Masuoka |url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2008/Jun/27/ln/hawaii806270385.html |newspaper=Honolulu Advertiser |publisher=Black Press |location=Honolulu, HI, USA |issn=1072-7191 |oclc=8807414 |date=2008-06-27 |accessdate=2013-02-04 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6ECDDmB5u |archivedate=2013-02-04 |deadurl=no[/tpl]  In 2010, Aloha Stadium completely retrofitted its scoreboard and video screen to be more up to date with its high definition capability. The Aloha Stadium Authority plans to add more luxury suites, replacing all seats, rusting treatments, parking lots, more restrooms, pedestrian bridge supports, enclosed lounge, and more. There is also a proposal that would close the 4 opening corners of the stadium to add more seats.
In 2011, the playing field was refurbished in part due to a naming rights sponsorship from Hawaiian Airlines. As a result of the sponsorship deal, the field is now referred to as Hawaiian Airlines Field at Aloha Stadium.Hawaiian Airlines Grabs Naming Rights To Aloha Stadium Field; SponsorPitch; 08-04-2011

==Events==

In [tpl]by|1997[/tpl], a three-game regular season series between Major League Baseball's St. Louis Cardinals and San Diego Padres was held at the stadium. The series was played as a doubleheader on April 19 and a nationally broadcast (ESPN) game on April 20. In 1975, the Padres had played an exhibition series against the Seibu Lions of Japan's Pacific League.
Aloha Stadium hosted the inaugural Pan-Pacific Championship (February 20–23, 2008), a knockout soccer tournament, involving four teams from Japan's J-League, North America's Major League Soccer (MLS) and Australia/New Zealand's A-League.
In 2013 the stadium played host to a rugby league test where the USA played Samoa.http://www.khon2.com/news/local-news/tomahawks-get-ready-for-match-up-with-na-toa-samoa-at-aloha-stadium
