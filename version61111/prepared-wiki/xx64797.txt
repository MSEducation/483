[[Wholphin]]

CATEGORIES: Mammal hybrids, Oceanic dolphins

A wholphin or wolphin is an extremely rare hybrid born from a mating of a female bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) with a male false killer whale (Pseudorca crassidens). The name implies a hybrid of whale and dolphin, although taxonomically, both are within the "oceanic dolphin" family, which is within the "toothed whale" suborder.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7508288/ |title=Whale-dolphin hybrid has baby wholphin |publisher=MSNBC |accessdate=November 12, 2009 |date=April 15, 2005[/tpl] The first recorded wholphin was born in a Tokyo SeaWorld, but he died after 200 days.[tpl]cite news|last=West|first=Karen|title=A Whale?

Although they have been reported to exist in the wild, only one is currently in captivity, at Sea Life Park in Hawaii.[tpl]cite news |author=Sean B.

The wholphin's size, color and shape are intermediate between the parent species. She has 66 teeth - intermediate between a bottlenose (88 teeth) and false killer whale (44 teeth) |work=New York Times |date=September 13, 2010 |accessdate=September 14, 2010[/tpl]
Kekaimalu proved fertile when she gave birth at a very young age. The calf died after a few days. However, in 1991, Kekaimalu gave birth once again, to daughter Pohaikealoha. For two years, she cared for the calf, but did not nurse it; it was hand-reared by trainers. Pohaikealoha died at age 9. On December 23, 2004, Kekaimalu had her third calf, daughter Kawili Kai, sired by a male bottlenose. This calf did nurse and was very playful. Only months after birth, it was the size of a one-year-old bottlenose dolphin.  All three calves were three-quarters bottlenose dolphin and one-quarter false killer whale.[tpl]cite journal|year=2006|month=January–February |title=Ditching SUVs and Breeding Beefalos|journal=E Magazine|volume=17|issue=1|page=64|publisher=Earth Action Network|accessdate=May 4, 2013|url=http://www.questiaschool.com/read/1G1-141706612/ditching-suvs-and-breeding-beefalos [tpl]subscription needed[/tpl][/tpl] Both Kekaimalu and Kawili Kai remain in captivity, and are now part of the normal tour at Sea Life Park.
In one episode of the show The Million Pound Drop Live, a team was asked which hybrid did not exist: a wholphin, a zorse, a liger, and a sheepig; they bet £550,000 on the wholphin and £150,000 on the sheepig.[tpl]cite news|title=Davina McCall's £550k pig of a row|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/3310992/Davina-McCalls-550k-pig-of-a-row.html|accessdate=12 July 2013|newspaper=The Sun|date=21 December 2010[/tpl] As the wholphin was real, they lost £550k of their money but later said that Mangalitsas are commonly referred to as sheepigs.
