Acyl-CoA thioesterase 2, also known as ACOT2, is an enzyme which in humans is encoded by the ACOT2 gene.[tpl]cite web | title = Entrez Gene: ACOT2 acyl-CoA thioesterase 2| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=10965| accessdate = [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Jones JM, Gould SJ | title = Identification of PTE2, a human peroxisomal long-chain acyl-CoA thioesterase | journal = Biochem.

Acyl-CoA thioesterases, such as ACOT2, are a group of enzymes that hydrolyze Coenzyme A (CoA) esters, such as acyl-CoAs, bile CoAs, and CoA esters of prostaglandins, to the corresponding free acid and CoA.[tpl]cite journal | author = Hunt MC, Yamada J, Maltais LJ, Wright MW, Podesta EJ, Alexson SE | title = A revised nomenclature for mammalian acyl-CoA thioesterases/hydrolases | journal = J.

ACOT2 shows high acyl-CoA thioesterase activity on medium- and long-chain acyl-CoAs, with an optimal pH of 8.5. It is most active on myristoyl-CoA but also shows high activity on palmitoyl-CoA, stearoyl-CoA, and arachidoyl-CoA.
