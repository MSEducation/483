Aristeidis Stergiadis ([tpl]lang-el|Αριστείδης Στεργιάδης[/tpl]) (1861, Herakleion, Crete - 22 June 1949, Nice, France) was the Greek high-commissioner, or governor-general, of Smyrna during the Greek occupation of the city from 1919 to 1922.  He was selected for the post by Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos, who was a fellow Cretan.  He is considered[tpl]who|date=January 2013[/tpl] one of the darkest figures in modern Greek history.[tpl]cn|date=January 2013[/tpl] Stergiadis was arguably[tpl]cn|date=January 2013[/tpl] possessed of a strict sense of justice and a high ideal of duty, he lived as a hermit, accepting no invitations and never appearing in society. According to George Horton, Stergiadis informed him that he wished "to accept no favors and to form no ties, so that he might administer equal justice to all, high and low alike." It soon became known that when he issued an order he expected it to be obeyed.
He abandoned Smyrna on 25 September 1922 on a British ship, and was transported to Britain. Later the same year he moved to Nice,[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2007[/tpl] where he lived until the end of his life, on 22 June 1949, under British protection, leading to wide spread rumors[tpl]cn|date=January 2013[/tpl] that he had been a Secret Intelligence Service spy. His family's property probably allowed him to live in wealth until the beginning of the Second World War, when most of the companies related to him were destroyed.

On a letter to the then young member of the Greek Parliament, Georgios Papandreou, shortly before the capture of Smyrna by the Turkish forces, Stergiadis writes, referring to the Asia Minor Greeks:The Blight of Asia, An Account of the Systematic Extermination of Christian Populations by Mohammedans and of the Culpability of Certain Great Powers; with the True Story of the Burning of Smyrna; George Horton, 1926.

His Herakleion residence houses the Public Archives and Library of Nicolas Kitsikis (1887-1978), the father of Dimitri Kitsikis. Stergiadis was the stepfather of Beata Petychakis, Dimitri Kitsikis's mother.
