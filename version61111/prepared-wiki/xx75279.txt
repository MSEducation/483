MRI was responsible for the design and development of the Desert Eagle pistol.[tpl]cite journal | last = Taffin| first = John | authorlink = John Taffin| coauthors = | title = The Desert Eagle of Magnum Research| journal = Guns Magazine| volume = 30| issue = 8| pages = | publisher = | year = 2005| url = | doi = | id = | accessdate = 3 January 2010 [/tpl]  The design was refined and the actual pistols were manufactured by Israel Military Industries until 1995, when MRI shifted the manufacturing contract to Saco Defense in Saco, Maine. In 2000 MRI moved manufacturing back to IMI, which later reorganized under the name Israel Weapon Industries.   Since 2009 the Desert Eagle Pistol has been produced in the USA at MRI’s Pillager, MN facility.  Both Saco and IMI/IWI were strictly contractors: all of the intellectual property, including patents, copyrights and trademarks are the property of Magnum Research.[tpl]cite book| last = Hartink| first = A.E.| title = The Complete Encyclopedia of Pistols and Revolvers| publisher = Chartwell Books, Inc| year = 2002 | pages = 165–167| location = Edison, New Jersey| isbn = 978-0-7858-1519-8[/tpl] 
MRI offers custom gunsmithing services and has a line of guns that are coated with titanium nitride in artful patterns and designs.  The newest TiN coated gun comes in a "Tiger Stripe" pattern which was developed by Coating Services Group.  Coating Services Group continues to provide titanium nitride services for Magnum Research and others.
Magnum Research imported the IMI/IWI Jericho 941 series of pistols under the Baby Eagle name until the end of 2008 and resumed importation of this model in 2011 under the name Baby Eagle II. Currently, the Baby Eagle name is used on a new series of striker-fired polymer-framed pistols.  For a time they also imported the Barak SP-21 pistol, but it is no longer offered. Other products include the BFR series of single-action magnum revolvers, the Mountain Eagle rifle, Magnum Lite rifle, and Micro Desert Eagle.[tpl]cite journal | last = Bodinson| first = Holt | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Extreme Revolvers| journal = Guns Magazine| volume = | issue = 3| pages = | publisher = | year = 1999| url = | doi = | id = | accessdate = 3 January 2010 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | last = Spomer| first = Ron | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Tradition or High Tech| journal = Sporting Classics| volume = 12| issue = 5| pages = | publisher = | year = 1997| url = | doi = | id = | accessdate = 3 January 2010 [/tpl][tpl]Cite press release | title = Micro Desert Eagle | publisher = ESPN Outdoors | date = January 16, 2009 | url = http://sports.espn.go.com/outdoors/hunting/news/story?id=3838325 | accessdate = January 3, 2010[/tpl]
