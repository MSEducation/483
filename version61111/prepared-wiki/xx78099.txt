==History==

Some of the islands have been inhabited since at least the Jomon period. During historic times, mentioned is made of the islands in the Shoku Nihongi and the Heike Monogatari, and local legend states that at least some of the islands were a refuge for the defeated Heike clan following the Gempei War.  During the Edo period, the islands came under the control of the Shimazu clan of Satsuma Domain. 
After the Meiji Restoration, these islands were allotted to Kawanabe District of Satsuma Province, and then transferred to Ōshima District of Ōsumi Province in 1897. In 1908, the islands were grouped together with the Tokara Islands into [tpl]nihongo|Jitto Village|十島村|Jitto-mura[/tpl], of which seven were inhabited. At that time, the ten islands included [tpl]nihongo|Iōjima|硫黄島[/tpl], [tpl]nihongo|Kuroshima|黒島[/tpl], [tpl]nihongo|Takeshima|竹島[/tpl], [tpl]nihongo|Kuchinoshima|口之島[/tpl], [tpl]nihongo|Nakanoshima|中之島[/tpl], [tpl]nihongo|Tairajima|平島[/tpl], [tpl]nihongo|Suwanosejima|諏訪之瀬島[/tpl], [tpl]nihongo|Akusekijima|悪石島[/tpl], [tpl]nihongo|Kodakarajima|小宝島[/tpl] and [tpl]nihongo|Takarajima|宝島[/tpl]. 
After World War II, from 2 February 1946 all of the Japanese islands south of 30th Latitude, including the Tokara Islands, were placed under United States military occupation as part of the Provisional Government of Northern Ryukyu Islands. However, the three northern inhabited islands in the archipelago, known as the [tpl]nihongo|Kamimishima|上三島|[/tpl]: Iōjima, Kuroshima and Takeshima, remained under the control of Japan, and were placed under the administration of the village of Mishima. The remaining Tokara Islands reverted to Japan on 10 February 1952 and are now administered as the village of Toshima. In 1973, the two villages were transferred to Kagoshima District.
