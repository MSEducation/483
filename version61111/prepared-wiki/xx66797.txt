==History==

Dagbladet Politiken (The Daily Politiken) was founded on 1 October 1884 in Copenhagen by Viggo Hørup, Edvard Brandes and Hermann Bing.[tpl]da icon[/tpl] Politiken The foundation came about after Hørup and Brandes had been fired as editors from the newspaper Morgenbladet over political differences. Politiken started with daily circulation of 2,000 copies.
In 1904 Ekstra Bladet was founded as a supplement to Politiken. On 1 January 1905 Ekstra Bladet became an independent newspaper.
Politiken established its present location in central Copenhagen at The City Hall Square in 1912.

==Wartime reporting==

On 28 April 1940, three weeks after the German invasion of Denmark, Politiken ran an editorial in which Winston Churchill was called "a dangerous man". The editorial was written by foreign affairs editor Einard Schou after a conversation in the editor-in-chief's office with chairman of the board and soon-to-be-again Danish foreign minister Erik Scavenius. The aim is thought to have been to please the German occupational force, though no other Danish newspaper took such steps at the time — usually it was enough to keep within the newly introduced censorship. This led to 15,000 readers, about 10% of subscribers, cancelling their subscriptions in protest.Politiken.dk

==Editorial line==

Historically Politiken was connected to the Danish Social Liberal Party (Det Radikale Venstre), but the newspaper declared its political independence in 1970. Interestingly the newspaper is older than the party, making this a rare case of a newspaper starting a party rather than a party starting a newspaper.[tpl]reference needed|date=June 2013[/tpl]
In February 2010 the editor in chief at the time Tøger Seidenfaden apologized to anyone who was offended by the newspaper's decision to reprint the cartoon drawing by Kurt Westergaard, depicting Muhammed with a bomb in his turban, which was originally published in Morgenavisen Jyllands-Posten. Seidenfaden explained that "Politiken has never intended to reprint the cartoon drawing as a statement of editorial opinion or values but merely as part of the newspaper's news coverage".Politiken.dk

==The Cavling Award==
