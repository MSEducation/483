Borodino Hall, also known as Borodino Grange Hall, is a building in the hamlet of Borodino, New York.  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006. The Borodino Hall was built @1835 by the First Religious Society of Borodino, and served as a church until 1868.  It is a two story building with a gabled roof on a high stone basement.  It is of heavy timber frame construction designed in the Federal style.  The building was sold in 1868, and a stage was added to the interior around that time, converting it into a hall.  In 1871, a performance of "Uncle Tomâ€™s Cabin" was presented there by the Borodino Dramatic Society.  At some time after this, the building became the Spafford Town Hall, a purpose it served until 1912.  In that year the Grange chapter #1272 began meeting in the Hall, and they purchased it in 1919.  Water service, a kitchen and restrooms were added in the early 1950s.  The Spafford Area Historical Society purchased the building in 1997.  It currently serves as a community center.[tpl]cite web|last=Opalka|first=Anthony|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Borodino Hall|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=101753|date=May 2006|accessdate=2008-02-03[/tpl] and Accompanying 10 photos, exterior and interior, from May, 2005  left|thumb|Historic Marker at Borodino Hall
