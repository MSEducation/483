[[HP Multi-Programming Executive]]

CATEGORIES: Hewlett-Packard, Proprietary operating systems

MPE (Multi-Programming Executive) is a business-oriented minicomputer real-time operating system made by Hewlett-Packard.
It runs the HP 3000 family of computers, which originally used HP custom 16 bit stack architecture CISC CPUs and were later migrated to PA-RISC where the operating system was called MPE/XL. The original version of MPE was written in a language called SPL (System Programming Language); later the name of the OS was changed to MPE/iX to indicate Unix interoperability with the addition of POSIX compatibility. The discontinuance of the product line was announced in late 2001 with support from HP terminating at the end of 2010. A number of 3rd party companies have announced plans to support both the hardware and software beyond this date for customers unable or unwilling to migrate to alternative platforms.
