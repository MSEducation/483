US 40 exits into Kansas east of Arapahoe in Cheyenne.

==Route description==

Entering Colorado to the south of Dinosaur National Monument, U.S. 40 runs east through the small town of Dinosaur along Brontosaurus Boulevard. The route continues a generally easterly course though Moffat and Routt counties, passing through several small communities along the way. It generally follows the course of the Yampa River. U.S. 40 becomes Lincoln Avenue as it runs through historic downtown Steamboat Springs, Colorado.
Taking a circuitous route through Rabbit Ears Pass, Muddy Pass and Berthoud Pass it descends the escarpment along the eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains. Just to the east of Empire, it merges with Interstate 70 for the first time. US 40 and I-70 will frequently share pavement across the U.S. The route leaves I-70 at exit 244, to the west of Idaho Springs and rejoins it again at between exits 252 and 254 in El Rancho. It parallels I-70, mostly as a frontage road, until the intersection with State Highway 26 to the south of Golden[tpl]cite web | last = Brusca | first = Frank X. | title = US 40 Scrapbook: Colorado | work = U.S. Route 40: America's Golden Highway | publisher = route40.net | year = 2002 | url = http://www.route40.net/scrapbook/co/index.shtml | accessdate = 2007-05-21 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070927203821/http://www.route40.net/scrapbook/co/index.shtml  |archivedate = 2007-09-27[/tpl][tpl]cite web | last = Salek | first = Matthew E. | title = US 40 | work = Colorado Highways | year = 2006 | url = http://www.mesalek.com/colo/us40.html | accessdate = 2007-05-22[/tpl]
Beginning in Golden, US 40 becomes Colfax Avenue, the main east–west thoroughfare through the Denver-Aurora Metropolitan Area. Along with US 40, the entire route along Colfax Avenue is cosigned as Business Loop 70. The route travels northeast through Golden, then turns due east to travel through Lakewood, Denver, and Aurora. Among the sights to be seen along US 40 is Lake Steam Bath, once the location of a thriving health industry centered on tuberculosis sanatoriums. Also along Colfax Avenue in Denver is the Denver branch of the United States Mint, which produces 50 million coins per day. US 40 rejoins I-70 at exit 288, just to the east of Aurora.[tpl]cite book | title = Mapsource | publisher = Garmin Ltd. | year = 2003[/tpl][tpl]cite web | last = Royston | first = Reggie | title = Denver's Road of Riches: Colfax Avenue | work = National Geographic News | publisher = National Geographic Society | year = 2001 | url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2001/05/0501_ColfaxAveDenver.html | accessdate = 2007-05-22[/tpl]
At exit 359 in Limon, US 40 leaves I-70 along Main Street, which it shares with Business Loop 70, US 24, US 287, and SH 71. US 40/US 287 continues to the southeast to the town of Kit Carson. From there, it leaves US 287 and continues east through the towns of Cheyenne Wells and Arapahoe before entering the state of Kansas.
