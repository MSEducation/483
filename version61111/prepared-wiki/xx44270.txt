The studio's predecessor (and the modern-day The Walt Disney Company's as a whole) was originally founded as the Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio, by filmmaker Walt Disney and his business partner and brother, Roy, in 1923.

The company divided motion picture productions within the studio as two units; one for animation and another for live-action. The latter division began producing live-action films in 1950 with the release of Treasure Island. By 1953, the company ended their agreements with such third-party distributors as RKO Radio Pictures and United Artists and formed their own distribution company; Buena Vista Distribution. In 1986, Walt Disney Productions was renamed The Walt Disney Company, while the live-action film studio was renamed Walt Disney Pictures in 1983 and the film animation studio initially Walt Disney Feature Animation, then eventually its current name Walt Disney Animation Studios.
