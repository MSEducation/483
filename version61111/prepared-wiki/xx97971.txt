The Wallace's Hanging Parrot (Loriculus flosculus) also known as the Flores Hanging Parrot, is a small (length: 11–12 cm) parrot endemic to the island of Flores.
This is an arboreal parrot. The male is predominantly green, with a red bill, a red spot on the throat, orange legs and dark red nape, bright red rump and uppertail-coverts. The female has the red on the throat reduced or absent.
This parrot qualifies as Endangered as it has a very small range and population. The main threat is habitat destruction. The current population is estimated at between 2500 and 10000.
It is named after Alfred Russel Wallace, a British naturalist, explorer, geographer, and biologist.[tpl]cite book|last=Beolens|first=Bo|title=Whose Bird?
