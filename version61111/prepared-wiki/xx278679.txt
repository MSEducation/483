"Don't Hurt Yourself" is the second single from Marillion's 13th studio album Marbles, released in July 2004. Following the band's comeback to the upper regions of the UK Singles Chart with  the previous single "You're Gone" in May, it reached number 16, becoming their second-highest charting hit since 1987's "Incommunicado". As with "You're Gone", the chart success of this single was largely based on making it available in two formats and encouraging fans to buy them simultaneously in the first week after their release. It also reached a top 40 position in the Dutch charts.
One of the two available discs contained a version of the Marbles album track "Angelina" mixed by Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree.
