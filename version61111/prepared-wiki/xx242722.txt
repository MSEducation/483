Having been elected Master of St John's in 1564, he was deprived of the position in 1569, by Richard Cox, the bishop of Ely, as College Visitor.[tpl]acad|LNGT549R|Longworth, Richard[/tpl]Churchill Babington, Materials for a history of Cockfield, Suffolk (1880), p. 35. Longworthâ€™s religious views were Puritan, and under his leadership St John's had become a major Puritan force in the university. The college's sympathies were manifested in the refusal of the Master and others to wear the surplice in chapel, and Longworth was summoned to London to explain himself.http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=66630 Longworth was allied with William Fulke, and Richard Curteys laid a complaint against both of them in 1565;:s:Curteys, Richard (DNB00) later they fell out, and Fulke headed the faction opposed to Longworth. The Visitor's intervention was prompted by the feuding in the college, and Fulke had to pull back, missing his own chance at the mastership.Dictionary of National Biography, article on Fulke.
