German submarine ''U-10 was a Type IIB U-boat built before World War II for service in Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine''. As she was one of the first batch of boats built following the renunciation of the Treaty of Versailles, she was only capable of coastal and short cruising work. This led to her being reassigned to training duties after the Norwegian campaign of 1940 together with many of her sister boats.
During the war U-10 sank two vessels:
After almost five years she was stricken on 1 August 1944 at Danzig (now Gda≈Ñsk) and broken up.
