</ref> The peninsula is made up of two different types of [[sedimentary rock]]s, the Amuri [[Limestone]] of [[Palaeocene]] age and [[Oligocene]] aged [[mudstone]]. Intense [[fold (geology)|fold]]ing and minor [[faulting]] have occurred, particularly in the limestone area. [[wave-cut platform|Shore platforms]] are developed in both [[Lithology|lithological units]], those in limestone displaying wider variability in [[Geomorphology|morphology]]. The multi-level [[Terrace (geology)|terraces]] were once [[wave-cut platform]]s, created at sea level and uplifted out of the sea by [[tectonic]] processes, at which point the next step would be cut. In the landscape they appear as a flight of terraces with the oldest appearing at the top and the youngest at the shoreline where the [[Kaikoura]] township is situated.<ref name="council">

The shoreline of the Kaikoura Peninsula is exposed to an extremely long fetch from the Pacific Ocean, and it is also characterized as a high-energy oceanic swell environment, with high-energy storms interrupting long periods of relative calm. High-energy storms due to the passage of cyclonic depressions over New Zealand can occur at any time of the year. The Kaikoura Coast is mesotidal with a mean range of 1.36 m and a maximum of 2.57 m. The region has a temperate climate with moderate rainfall, averaging 865 mm per year and mean monthly temperatures range from 7.7° Celsius in July to 16.2° Celsius in January.
The Kaikoura Peninsula environment is subject to highly energetic processes in terms of both marine and weathering processes. Shore platforms are exposed to the dominant wave directions and are in the intertidal zone. Consequently, both marine erosive forces and subaerial weathering processes contribute to erosion.[ref]
