The Benedictines of Mary, Queen of Apostles, are a Roman Catholic religious order in Gower, Missouri in the United States.

==History==

The community was established in 1995 as a small order of Benedictine nuns under the auspices of the Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter, in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Scranton, Pennsylvania. They were originally called the Oblates of Mary, Queen of Apostles. They began following a monastic horarium defined in the Rule of Saint Benedict, and chanting the Divine Office in Latin according to the 1962 Breviarium Monasticum.[tpl]cite web|url=http://benedictinesofmary.org/content/about-ephesus|title=About Ephesus|publisher=Benedictines of Mary, Queen of Apostles|accessdate=2013-08-09[/tpl]
Upon his arrival in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Kansas City-Saint Joseph in 2005, Bishop Robert Finn said that vocations to the priesthood and religious life would be seen as a "super-priority" for his diocese.[tpl]cite web|url=http://familyvocationsconference.com/project/vocations-to-priesthood-and-consecrated-life-a-super-priority/|title=Vocations to Priesthood and Consecrated Life: a Super-Priority|date=2012-07-14|publisher=Our Lady of Lourdes Vocation Conference|accessdate=2013-08-09[/tpl] In March 2006, Finn invited the order to the diocese, who were established as a public association of the faithful with the new name "Benedictines of Mary, Queen of Apostles".
