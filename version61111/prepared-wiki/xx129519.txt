==Method of Play==

Chips are placed on the table by means of a telephone menu.
TV Bingo is a fixed odds betting game similar to the lottery or Keno. 
You simply choose 6 numbers using your telephone by calling the number on screen during the show and follow the prompts. You can pick six numbers of your own or simply go for a "Lucky Dip" where the six numbers are randomly selected for you by the computer. Be sure to write these numbers down when you pick them. 
The first time you call the number on screen you will be put through to our administration centre so you can register. Registration is a very simple process where you give across your name, address, etc., choose your on-screen player name and make your first deposit of a minimum of £10. 
Once you have registered you can buy a TV Bingo ticket for anything from a minimum of £1 up to a maximum of £10. Once you have selected and confirmed your numbers you are in for the next draw. If you get in early enough you should also see your numbers and your player name appear on screen. 
Every two minutes we "Get ready to Jumble" where the winnings numbers are revealed by our computer. After this a list of the winners will appear on screen, so keep watching once you've bought your ticket to see if you're a winner!
