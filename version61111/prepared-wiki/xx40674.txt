The League of Corinth, also referred to sometimes as the Hellenic League (from Greek Ἑλληνκός - Hellenikos, "pertaining to Greece and Greeks"Ἑλληνκός, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus) was a federation of Greek states created by Philip II of Macedon during the winter of 338 BC/337 BC after the Battle of Chaeronea, to facilitate his use of military forces in his war against Persia. The name 'League of Corinth' was invented by modern historians due to the first council of the League being in Corinth. It was the first time in history that all the Greek states (with the notable exception of Sparta) managed to become part of a single political entity.[tpl]cite book|last=Pohlenz|first=Max|title=Freedom in Greek life and thought: the history of an ideal|year=1966|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-90-277-0009-4|pages=20|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zUY71_oc4b0C&pg=PA20&dq=%22league+of+corinth%22+%22hellas%22#v=onepage&q=%22league%20of%20corinth%22%20%22hellas%22&f=false[/tpl]
