As a player, at 24 years old, he was offered a 2-year contract with Bristol City, which he refused.  In 1979 he joined Bath City, where he became first a coach and then manager, spending seven years at the club in all. He played 700 games at conference level in his career.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.thefa.com/Womens/PremierLeague/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2003/03/43425.htm |title=Managers' Monthly: Tony Ricketts |work=TheFA.com |date=19 March 2003 |accessdate=16 May 2008[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
After leaving Bath, Ricketts worked for the Gloucestershire FA running the county's representative teams, as well as the ladies and under-18s sides. From here he earned a job with the Bristol Rovers women's team, who at the time were in the FA Women's Premier League Southern Division. In his first season at Rovers the team finished runners-up to the league's only professional side, Fulham L.F.C., and in his second year the team cantered to the league title, winning it with a quarter of the season still to spare.
After managing the women's side he went on to manage Bristol Rovers' under-18s' team, and was later appointed manager at Weston-super-Mare. He was largely ineffective at Weston and was eventually sacked on 1 December 2008.
