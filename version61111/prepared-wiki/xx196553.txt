The 1920 Rose Bowl, known at the time as the Tournament East-West Football Game, was a college football bowl game played on January 1, 1920. It was the 6th Rose Bowl Game. The Harvard Crimson defeated the Oregon Webfoots by a score of 7â€“6. Crimson halfback Edward Casey was named the Rose Bowl Player of the Game when the award was created in 1953 and selections were made retroactively.2008 Rose Bowl Program, 2008 Rose Bowl. Accessed January 26, 2008.  It was the first Rose Bowl game following World War I in which college football returned to the Tournament of Roses. The two previous Tournament games had featured teams from the United States armed forces. It established a pattern of inviting teams from the Eastern part of the United States to face teams from the West Coast. This pattern was unbroken until the 1944 Rose Bowl during World War II and then the advent of the Bowl Championship Series game in the 2002 Rose Bowl.
