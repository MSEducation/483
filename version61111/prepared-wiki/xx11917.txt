[[Political status of Western Sahara]]

CATEGORIES: Politics of Morocco, Politics of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, Government of Western Sahara, Diplomatic recognition, Western Sahara conflict

Western Sahara, formerly the Spanish colony of Spanish Sahara, is a disputed territory claimed by both the Kingdom of Morocco and the Polisario Front. It is listed by the United Nations (UN), as a non-decolonized territory and is thus included in the United Nations List of Non-Self-Governing Territories.
Since the Madrid Accords of 1975, a part of Western Sahara has been administered by Morocco as the Southern Provinces. Another section, the Liberated Territories, is administered by the Polisario Front as the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR). Mauritania administers temporally the western half of the Ras Nouadhibou Peninsula. A UN-monitored cease-fire has been in effect since September 1991.
In order to resolve the sovereignty issue, the UN has attempted to hold a referendum through the mission United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO), and is holding direct talks between the Kingdom of Morocco and the Polisario Front. The UN recognizes neither MoroccanUnited Nations Security Council: Report of the Secretary-General on the situation concerning Western Sahara (S/2006/249) paragraph 37, p. 10 nor SADR sovereignty over Western Sahara.

==Positions of the main parties==

===Kingdom of Morocco===

The official position of the Kingdom of Morocco since 1963 is that all of Western Sahara is an integral part of the kingdom. The Moroccan government refers to Western Sahara only as the "Sahara", "Moroccan Sahara", "Saharan provinces", or the "Southern Provinces".[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2008[/tpl]
According to the Moroccan government, in 1958 the Moroccan Army of Liberation fought Spanish colonizers and almost liberated what was then Spanish Sahara.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2010[/tpl] The fathers of many of the Polisario leaders were among the veterans of the Moroccan Southern Army, for example the father of Polisario leader Mohammed Abdelaziz. Morocco is supported in this view[tpl]clarify|date=September 2011|reason=What view?[/tpl] by a number of former Polisario founders and leaders. The Polisario Front is considered by Morocco to be a Moroccan separatist movement, referring to the Moroccan origins of most of its founding members, and its self-proclaimed SADR to be a puppet state used by Algeria to fight a proxy war against Morocco.

===Polisario Front / Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic===

The Polisario Front is described by itself and its supporters as a national liberation movement that opposes Moroccan control of Western Sahara, whilst it is considered by Morocco and supporters of Morocco's claims over the Western Sahara to be a separatist organisation. It began as a movement of students who felt torn between the divergent Spanish and Moroccan influences on the country. The original goal of the Polisario, which was to end Spanish colonialism in the region, was achieved, but their neighbours, Morocco and Mauritania, seized sovereignty of the region, which the Polisario felt belonged to it. The Polisario engaged in guerrilla warfare with the Moroccan and Mauritanian forces. It evacuated the Sahrawi population to the Tindouf refugee camps due to Royal Moroccan Air Force bombing of the refugee camps on Sahrawi land with napalm and white phosphorus.Surendra Bhutani, Conflict on Western Sahara, Strategic Analysis, 1754-0054, Volume 2, Issue 7, 1978, Pages 251 – 256.Tomás Bárbulo, La historia prohibida del Sáhara Español, Destino, Imago mundi, Volume 21, 2002, Pages 284-285
The Polisario Front has called for the self-determination of the people of Western Sahara to be decided through a referendum. Although the SADR is not recognised as a state by the UN, the Polisario is considered a direct participant in the conflict and as the legitimate representative of the Sahrawi people, recognized by the United Nations since 1979.
The Polisario Front argues that Morocco's position is due to economical interests (fishing, phosphate mining, and the potential for oil reserves) and political reasons (stability of the king's position and the governing elite in Morocco, deployment of most of the Moroccan Army in Western Sahara instead of in Morocco). The Polisario Front proclaimed the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic in Bir Lehlou (Western Sahara), on 27 February 1976.

===Mauritania===

Claims on Western Sahara had proliferated since the 1960s, fuelled by Mauritanian President Moktar Ould Daddah. Before Mauritania signed the Madrid Accords and after the withdrawal of the last Spanish forces, in late 1975, the Mauritanian Army invaded the southern part of Western Sahara, while the Moroccan Army did the same in the north. In April 1976, Mauritania and Morocco partitioned the country into three parts, Mauritania getting the southern one, which was named Tiris al-Gharbiyya. Mauritania waged four years of war against Polisario guerrillas, conducting raids on Nouakchott, attacks on the Zouerate mine train and a coup d'état that deposed Ould Daddah. Mauritania finally withdrew in the summer of 1979, after signing the Argel Accord with the Polisario Front, recognizing the right of self-determination for the Sahrawi people, and renouncing any claims on Western Sahara. The Moroccan Army immediately took control of the former Mauritanian territory. Mauritania recognized the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic on 27 February 1984.

===Algeria===

Algeria has supported the independence of Western Sahara diplomatically since 1975 because of its own national liberation war. In 1976, Algeria got involved directly in the conflict, but after a military confrontation at Amgala against the Moroccan Army, Algeria's role became indirect, through political and military support for the Polisario Front. Morocco argues that the Algerian position is due to the 1963 Sand War, in which the two countries clashed.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2010[/tpl] Algeria recognized the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic on 6 March 1976.

===United Nations===

Western Sahara was first placed, by Moroccan demand,[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2010[/tpl] on the UN list of territories to be decolonized in 1965, when it was still a Spanish colony. It has retained that status due to the persistence of the conflict.[tpl]Cite web| url = http://un.org/Depts/dpi/decolonization/trust3.htm | title = Non-Self-Governing Territories listed by GA in 2002 | accessdate =20 August 2006 | author = United Nations Fourth Committee | year = 2002 | publisher = United Nations | authorlink = United Nations Fourth Committee [/tpl] The UN has been involved since 1988 in trying to find a solution to the conflict through self-determination. In 1988, the Kingdom of Morocco and the Polisario Front agreed to settle the dispute through a referendum under the auspices of the UN that would allow the people of Western Sahara to choose between independence or integration with Morocco. In 1991, a ceasefire was agreed upon between the parties, contingent on the referendum being held the following year. Due to disputes over voter qualification, the vote has still not been held, and Morocco has made it clear in 2000 that henceforth it will not consider any option leading to the independence of the territory,[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2007[/tpl] and instead, is now proposing autonomy within Morocco. Lately,[tpl]when|date=April 2013[/tpl] the UN has argued for negotiations between Morocco and the Polisario Front to resolve the deadlock, culminating in the Manhasset negotiations.
Although Morocco claims that no recognition is required, Moroccan sovereignty over the territory is supported by the Arab League[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.arabicnews.com/ansub/Daily/Day/981217/1998121758.html | title = Arab League withdraws inaccurate Moroccan maps | accessdate =15 July 2006 | author = Arabicnews.com | date = 17 December 1998 | publisher = Arabicnews.com [/tpl][tpl]cite news | url = http://www.arabicnews.com/ansub/Daily/Day/990108/1999010849.html | title = Arab League supports Morocco's territorial integrity | accessdate =15 July 2006 | author = Arabicnews.com | date = 8 January 1999| publisher = Arabicnews.com [/tpl] and by some other states as a policy of deliberate ambiguity.

==Positions of other states==

The following lists contain the following states and entities:
Some states are on both lists; for example, when a state is supportive of the "right of self-determination", including the option of autonomy under Morocco sovereignty. Some states have changed their opinion frequently or have given separate announcements of support for both Morocco and the Polisario Front/SADR (Paraguay, Belgium, Benin, Botswana, Burundi, Chile, Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Guinea-Bissau, Malawi, Peru, Russia, Sierra Leone, Swaziland).[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl]
Some of the states announcing support of the "right of self-determination" currently recognize the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic. Not all of the states that have terminated diplomatic relations with or withdrawn recognition of the SADR have announced their support for the Moroccan claims.
Some states have not announced any position as of 2014.

===States supporting Sahrawi claims on Western Sahara===

Apart from the states that fully recognize the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic as the sovereign state of Western Sahara, some other states, although not recognizing the SADR for various reasons, have expressed explicit support for the right of self-determination of the Sahrawi people, which is the principal position of the Polisario Front, although such states may or may not recognise the Sahrawi claim to self-determination. Some states that do not recognize the Sahrawi Republic (neither as a state, nor as a government-in-exile[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl]) may, however, recognize the Polisario Front as the legitimate representative of the Sahrawi people.[tpl]clarify|date=October 2012[/tpl]

===States supporting Moroccan claims on Western Sahara===

No state recognizes the sovereignty of Morocco over Western Sahara, although many states have expressed support for Moroccan claims, or endorsed the Moroccan autonomy initiative for the territory. Several states have withdrawn their recognition of the SADR or canceled their relations with the SADR (close to 30 countries). Many of these states (mostly African countries and Caribbean or Pacific island-states) have done this as a result of Moroccan political pressures or exchanges and/or offers of economic assistance and investment.[tpl]cite news | title = Prime Minister Baldwin Spencer increases possibilities for cooperation with African and European countries | url = http://ab.gov.ag/gov_v4/article_details.php?id=970&category=38 | publisher = Government of Antigua and Barbuda - Press releases | date = 2010-09-24 | accessdate = 2010-12-09 [/tpl][tpl]cite news | title = Morocco to fund hotel project in Dominica | url = http://www.caribbeandailynews.com/dominica-morocco-to-fund-hotel-project-in-dominica/ | newspaper = Caribbean daily news | date = 2010-08-04 | accessdate = 2010-12-09 [/tpl][tpl]cite news | title = Talking diplomatic ties and cooperation with Morocco | url = http://www.gov.gd/egov/news/2010/aug10/11_08_10/item_1/diplomatic_ties_morocco.html | publisher = Government Information Service - Grenada | date = 2010-08-11 | accessdate = 2010-12-09[/tpl][tpl]cite news | title = Moroccan assistance to Grenada confirmed | url = http://www.grenadabroadcast.com/content/view/9096/51/ | publisher = Grenada broadcast | date = 2010-08-13 | accessdate = 2010-12-09[/tpl][tpl]cite news | title = Moroccan assistance - Ten scholarships annually and EC$1 million for Grenada | url = http://www.grenadabroadcast.com/content/view/8949/51/ | publisher = Grenada broadcast | date = 2010-08-24 | accessdate = 2010-12-09[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Ecuador: Vicecanciller toma posesión en la Comisión de Derechos Humanos de las Naciones Unidas en medio de una grave crisis político-jurídica|language= Spanish|url=http://www.voltairenet.org/Ecuador-Vicecanciller-toma|publisher= Voltaire Net (Altercom)|date=2005-04-01|accessdate=2012-02-17[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=St. Kitts and Nevis gets assistance from Morocco in education and youth empowerment|url=http://www.cuopm.com/admini/NEWS_POST_200803view.asp?CUOPMNEWSID=1536|publisher=CUOPM|date=2010-08-20|accessdate=2012-03-03[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Morocco offers 15 scholarships to St. Kitts and Nevis|url=http://www.cuopm.com/admini/NEWS_POST_200803view.asp?CUOPMNEWSID=2279|publisher=CUOPM|date=2012-08-17|accessdate=2012-03-03[/tpl][tpl]cite news | title = Zambia in diplomatic scandal – Citizen|url=http://www.trulyzambian.com/entertainment/zambia-in-diplomatic-scandal-%E2%80%93-citizen-5657|newspaper=Truly Zambian|date=2011-08-16|accessdate=2012-08-21[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Mount St. John's Medical Centre Receives Moroccan Gifts.

However, some international organizations, such as the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, have recognized the sovereignty of Morocco over what it calls its Southern Provinces.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.arabicnews.com/ansub/Daily/Day/990108/1999010849.html | title = Arab League supports Morocco's territorial integrity | accessdate =26 February 2009 | date = 8 January 1999 | publisher = Arabic News[/tpl][tpl]verify credibility|date=October 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url = http://www.arabicnews.com/ansub/Daily/Day/981217/1998121758.html | accessdate =26 February 2009 | publisher = Arabic News | title = Arab League withdraws inaccurate Moroccan maps | date = 17 December 1998[/tpl][tpl]verify credibility|date=October 2012[/tpl][tpl]citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]
Some UN member states have expressed explicit support of Morocco's territorial integrity in reference to Western Sahara as Moroccan provinces[tpl]Or|date=March 2012[/tpl], while others have endorsed or complemented the Moroccan proposal of autonomy for the territory as being credible and serious.http://www.map.ma/eng/sections/sahara/guinea-bissau_presid/view| source: MAP No country in the world, apart from Morocco itself, had recognized Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara. Morocco's old allies, France and the United States, have provided the kingdom with economic, diplomatic, and military aid, throughout the conflict. Saudi Arabia provided much economic aid as well.Antonio Díaz Fernandez, Los Servicios de Inteligencia Españoles, Alianza Editorial, Madrid, 2005, p. 176.
Morocco and the PRC maintain close relations, that have been improving steadily in the past decades. China has shown strong support for Morocco's territorial integrity,http://www.china.org.cn/english/international/140961.htm China.org and has welcomed the proposals put forth by Morocco in the peace negotiations.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl]
France enjoys close relations with Morocco. It is the kingdom's leading trade partner and the leading source of public development aid and private investments. The country claims neutrality on the Western Sahara issue, despite its military involvement in the Western Sahara War on the side of Morocco and Mauritania (see Operation Lamantin).

Former President Bill Clinton set a precedent on the conflict over Western Sahara which his successor, George W. Bush, followed. Both Presidents Clinton and Bush sided with Morocco and maintained the position that "Genuine autonomy under Moroccan sovereignty is the only feasible solution."House of Representatives letter to President Barack Obama. Accessed 21 February 2010.
The Obama administration disassociated itself from Moroccan autonomy in 2009, however, reversing the Bush-backed support of the Moroccan plan, and returning to a pre-Bush position, wherein the option of an independent Western Sahara is on the table again.[tpl]cite news| title = Obama reverses Bush-backed Morocco plan in favor of Polisario state | url = http://www.worldtribune.com/worldtribune/WTARC/2009/af_morocco0547_07_09.asp | publisher = World Tribune | date = 9 July 2009 | accessdate =3 July 2010[/tpl]
In April 2009, 229 members of the U.S. House of Representatives, a clear majority and more than 50 more than the number who signed the letter[tpl]clarify|date=September 2011|reason=What letter?[/tpl] in 2007, called on President Obama to support Morocco’s autonomy plan and to assist in drawing the conflict to a close. The signers[tpl]clarify|date=September 2011|reason=Signers in 2007?[/tpl] included Democratic Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and Republican Minority Leader John Boehner. In addition to acknowledging that Western Sahara has become a recruiting post for radical Islamists, the letter affirmed that the conflict is “the single greatest obstacle impending the security and cooperation necessary to combat” terrorism in the Maghreb.House of Representatives letter to President Barack Obama. Retrieved 21 February 2010. The letter referenced UN Security Council Resolution 1813 (2008), and encouraged President Obama to follow the policy set by President Clinton and followed by President Bush. The congressmen expressed concerns about Western Sahara's viability. They referenced a UN fact-finding mission to Western Sahara which confirmed the State Department’s view that the Polisario proposal, which ultimately stands for independence, would lead to a non-viable state. In closing, the letter stated, "We remain convinced that the U.S. position, favoring autonomy for Western Sahara under Moroccan sovereignty is the only feasible solution. We urge you to both sustain this longstanding policy, and to make clear, in both words and actions, that the United States will work to ensure that the UN process continues to support this framework as the only realistic compromise that can bring this unfortunate and longstanding conflict to an end."
Commenting on a 2004 free trade agreement with Morocco, US Trade Representative Robert Zoellick stated in a letter to Congressman Joe Pitts in response to his questioning, "the United States and many other countries do not recognize Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara and have consistently urged the parties to work with the United Nations to resolve the conflict by peaceful means.

In April 2013, the United States proposed that MINURSO monitored human rights (as all the other UN mission since 1991) in Western Sahara and the Sahrawi refugee camps in south-western Algeria, a move that Morocco  strongly opposed, cancelling the annual African Lion military exercises with US Army troops.[tpl]cite news|title=U.S. proposes U.N.
