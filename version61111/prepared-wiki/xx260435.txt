==History==

Originally founded as a one-day event, NMF has grown to encompass three full days of music and arts in the downtown Norman area with attendance growing significantly in each successive year.  Beginning in 2009 the NMF logo added a number to the end of its acronym to denote the number of occurrences of the festival.  For example, the 2009 NMF was known as NMF2, 2010 was NMF3, and so on.
NMF is organized by volunteers and funded via donations from private citizens and nearby businesses.  The festival is now sponsored by the Norman Arts Council.

===2008===

NMF was first held in 2008 and at that time was a single-day musical event; it was not yet known if the festival would be a reoccurring phenomenon.  An estimated crowd of 15,000 people attended the one-day event.
