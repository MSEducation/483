Approximately 450,000 Nansen passports were providedNansen-pass Store Norske Leksikon, retrieved December 11, 2012 to stateless people and refugees who needed travel documents but could not obtain one from a national authority.
The Nansen passport was originally provided to refugees from the Russian civil war. It's estimated that about 800,000 Russian refugees had become stateless when Lenin revoked citizenship for all Russian expatriates in 1921.Arkivverket.no (in Norwegian), retrieved December 11, 2012
In 1933, the arrangement was broadened to also include Armenian, Assyrian, Chaldean and Turkish refugees.
