==History==

SALSA d'Haïti is a privately held airline formed in 2008 to provide service for travel within Haiti.  
While the primary focus of the airline is to serve the Haitian local population, international expansion is planned to further this goal to the large Haitian population living outside of Haiti while at the same time making foreign tourist travel to areas outside of Port-au-Prince available.

===Plans===

SALSA has orders for additional turboprop aircraft to expand domestic operations to Port-de-Paix, Jérémie and Les Cayes. Additionally, jet-powered aircraft were to be added in 2011 to serve international destinations in Kingston, Jamaica and Ft. Lauderdale, Florida.  

==Airline cooperations==

SALSA maintains interline or codeshare agreements with the following airlines:

These operations connect at Port-au-Prince where passengers must transfer from the international airport to the domestic airport for onward transportation to domestic destinations. SALSA provides complementary transportation between the Port-au-Prince international and domestic terminals.

==2010 Haiti earthquake==

Shortly after the 2010 Haiti earthquake on January 12, 2010, SALSA d'Haïti began organizing relief efforts with several non-governmental organizations and foreign governments to assist in the transportation of supplies into Port-au-Prince and other Haitian communities outside of the capital.
Relief flights were flown throughout Haiti, as well as supply flights from Santo Domingo, Aruba and Curacao.  Charter flights for the Royal Dutch Marines, from their base in Willemstad, Curacao, were some of the first flights from outside North America.
