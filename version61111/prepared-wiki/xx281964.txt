[[Pandoraviridae]]

CATEGORIES: DNA viruses

Pandoraviridae is a family of double-stranded DNA viruses that infect amoebae. There is only one genus in this family (Pandoravirus). Within this genus, two species have been described to date: Pandoravirus dulcis and Pandoravirus salinus.[tpl]cite journal | last=Yong | first=Ed | doi=10.1038/nature.2013.13410 | title=Giant viruses open Pandora's box | journal=Nature | date=18 July 2013 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | title=Pandoraviruses: Amoeba Viruses with Genomes Up to 2.5 Mb Reaching That of Parasitic Eukaryotes | author=Nadège Philippe | journal=Science |date=July 2013 | volume=341 | issue=6143 | pages=281–6 | doi=10.1126/science.1239181 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/341/6143/281.abstract |pmid=23869018| author-separator=, | author2= Matthieu Legendre | author3= Gabriel Doutre | author4=and others | displayauthors=3 | bibcode=2013Sci...341..281P | last5=Poirot | first5=Olivier | last6=Lescot | first6=Magali | last7=Arslan | first7=Defne | last8=Seltzer | first8=Virginie | last9=Bertaux | first9=Lionel | last10=Bruley | first10=Christophe | last11=Garin | first11=Jérome | last12=Claverie | first12=Jean-Michel | last13=Abergel | first13=Chantal [/tpl]

==History==

The viruses were discovered in 2013.

==Description==

The viruses in this family are the second largest known virus (~1 micrometer) in capsid length, after Pithovirus (1.5 micrometer).[tpl]cite news | title=Ancient "Giant Virus" Revived From Siberian Permafrost | work=National Geographic | date=3 March 2014 | last=Sirucek | first=Stefan | url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/03/140303-giant-virus-permafrost-siberia-pithovirus-pandoravirus-science/ [/tpl]  Pandoravirus has the largest viral genome known, containing 1.9 to 2.5 megabases of DNA.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2013/07/18/203298244/worlds-biggest-virus-may-have-ancient-roots | title=World's Biggest Virus May Have Ancient Roots | work=National Public Radio | date=18 July 2013 | accessdate=18 July 2013 | author=Brumfiel, Geoff[/tpl]
Pithovirus has a thick, oval wall with an opening at one end.  Internally, its structure resembles a honeycomb.
