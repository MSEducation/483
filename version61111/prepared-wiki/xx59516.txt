</ref> USU basketball is 157–12 at home during the [[Stew Morrill]] era, has received 6 [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]] berths in the last ten years, and has amassed more wins than any team in the nation except Duke, Kansas, and Gonzaga during that time.<ref>

After many years of futility in football, USU has risen to new heights under head coach Gary Andersen, ending the 2012 regular season with its USU's first-ever 10-win season, its first WAC championship, and nationwide Top 25 rankings in all three major polls.
In addition to Andersen's hiring, the football program's renaissance can be attributed in part to a recent emphasis, under Athletics Director Scott Barnes, on recruiting, TV coverage, fundraising, facilities upgrades, and internal reorganization, despite the athletics department's dismal budget in comparison with other state and WAC schools. In recognition of these efforts, USU Athletics was crowned the 2009 National Champion of the Excellence in Management Cup, which seeks to identify the university that wins the most championships with the lowest expenses.
The Aggies have been members of the WAC since 2005 and have won several conference championships in that time, including men's basketball in 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011, football in 2012, indoor track in 2008, outdoor track in 2007 and 2009, and cross country for numerous years. Women's cross country has also won WAC championships in 2006 and 2008, and women's soccer won in 2008. Utah State has won numerous conference championships in previous conferences. National championships include women's volleyball in 1978 and softball in 1980 and 1981.
