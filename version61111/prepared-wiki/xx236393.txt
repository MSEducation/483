==History==

The region was identified as important by the Swaziland National Trust Commission in the early 1970s. At that time most of the area was sheep grazing land and much was privately owned. However,  the area had little agricultural potential and residents were resettled on good agricultural land adjacent to Malolotja.

==Animals==

Animals in the reserve include zebra, wildebeest, reedbuck, blesbok, red hartebeest, oribi, leopard, serval, aardwolf, jackal and bushpig. The Natal Ghost Frog, Plaintive Rain Frog and the Gray's Stream Frog are endemic to Swaziland, South Africa and Lesotho. In Swaziland they have only been found in Afromontane mist belt forest.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ecs.co.sz/malolotja_mistbeltforest.htm|title=The Conservational Importance of the Mgwayiza Mist Belt Forest, Malolotja Nature Reserve, Swaziland|last=Boycott|first=Richard C.|date=31 December 1997|publisher=Environmental Centre for Swaziland|accessdate=2009-10-18|location=Malolotja Nature Reserve  [/tpl]

==Birds==

Birdlife includes louries, sunbirds, sugarbirds, blue cranes and swallows. Bald ibis nest in colony on cliffs near Malolotja Falls. A number of bird species are of conservation importance, because their habitat is limited and threatened outside the reserve. They are the Orange Ground-thrush, Brown Robin, Bush Blackcap, Chorister Robin-chat, White-starred Robin, Grey Cuckoo-shrike, Olive Bush Shrike, Southern Boubou, Narina Trogon and Knysna Lourie.

==Flora==

Includes tall grasses, orchids, lilies, and ancient cycads.

==Climate==

Most rain falls in summer thunderstorms from December to April. Frost is common in June and July.

==Ngwenya Mine==

The Ngwenya iron ore mine is located within the nature reserve, near the Hawane Dam. Salgaocar is the company that is contracted to extract over 32 million tons of ore, amid much protest from locals over environmental repercussions and the detriment to one of the nation's main water supplies.http://mg.co.za/article/2012-08-31-00-swazilands-ngwenya-mine-extracts-its-ore-and-exacts-its-price Ngwenya Mine

There are a number of designated camping sites.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.footprint.co.za/malolotja.htm|title=http://www.footprint.co.za/malolotja.htm|publisher=Footprint Hiking Club|accessdate=2009-10-17[/tpl]
