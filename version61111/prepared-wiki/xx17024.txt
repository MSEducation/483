The [[apparent magnitude]] is a measure of the diminishing flux of light as a result of distance according to the [[inverse-square law]].<ref name="HAWAII2003">

By measuring the width of certain absorption lines in the stellar spectrum, it is often possible to assign a certain luminosity class to a star without knowing its distance. Thus a fair measure of its absolute magnitude can be determined without knowing its distance nor the interstellar extinction, allowing astronomers to estimate a star's distance and extinction without  parallax calculations. Since the stellar parallax is usually too small to be measured for many distant stars, this is a common method of determining such distances.
To conceptualize the range of magnitudes in our own galaxy, the smallest star to be identified has about 8% of the Sun’s mass and glows feebly at absolute magnitude +19. Compared to the Sun, which has an absolute of +4.8, this faint star is 14 magnitudes or 400,000 times dimmer than our Sun. Our galaxy's most massive stars begin their lives with masses of roughly 100 times solar, radiating at upwards of absolute magnitude –8, over 160,000 times the solar luminosity. The total range of stellar luminosities, then, occupies a range of 27 magnitudes, or a factor of 60 billion.
In measuring star brightnesses, absolute magnitude, apparent magnitude, and distance are interrelated parameters. If you know two, you can determine the third. Since the Sun's luminosity is the standard, comparing these parameters with the Sun's apparent magnitude and distance is the easiest way to remember how to convert between them.

===Luminosity formula===

The Stefan–Boltzmann equation applied to a black body gives the value for luminosity for a black body, an idealized object which is perfectly opaque and non-reflecting:
where A is the area and σ is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant, with a value of [tpl]physconst|sigma|after=.[/tpl]

For stars on the main sequence, luminosity is also related to mass:

===Magnitude formulae===

====Apparent====

The magnitude of a star is a logarithmic scale of observed visible brightness. The apparent magnitude is the observed visible brightness from Earth, and the absolute magnitude is the apparent magnitude at a distance of 10 parsecs.
Given a visible luminosity (not total luminosity), one can calculate the apparent magnitude of a star from a given distance (ignoring extinction):
where

====Bolometric====

The difference in bolometric magnitude is related to the luminosity ratio according to:
which makes by inversion:

===Computational challenges===

Calculating a star's luminosity and magnitude is sometimes a tremendous astrophysical challenge.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl] Although the formulae are well understood, obtaining accurate data to plug into those formulae is not always easy.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]  This is particularly the case for enigmatic stars like Betelgeuse whose thick circumstellar nebula [tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl] makes it difficult to identify the size and shape of the star's photosphere [tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl], leading to significant error factors in determining its luminosity.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]
As already discussed, the calculation of stellar brightness requires three variables: angular diameter, distance and temperature.  A wide variance in any of these components will lead to significant error factors in the star's luminosity.  In the last century, there has been a noticeable variance in all 3 components, leading to much debate on the star's actual brightness.  In 1920 when the photosphere was first measured, the published angular diameter was 0.047 arcseconds, a measurement which resulted in a diameter of 3.84 × 108 km (2.58 AU) based on the then-current parallax value of 0.018".[ref]
