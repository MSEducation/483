[[Grain (unit)]]

A grain is a unit of measurement of mass equal to 64.79891 milligrams. It is nominally based upon the mass of a single seed of a cereal. From the Bronze Age into the Renaissance the average masses of wheat and barley grains were part of the legal definition of units of mass. However, there is no evidence of any country ever having used actual seeds or cereal grains. Rather, expressions such as "thirty-two grains of wheat, taken from the middle of the ear" appear to have been ritualistic formulas, essentially the premodern equivalent of legal boilerplate.[tpl]cite book|last1=McDonald|first1=Daniel McLean|last2=Scarre|first2=Christopher|authorlink2=Chris Scarre|title=The origins of metrology: collected papers of Dr. Daniel McLean McDonald|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8ujaAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=15 September 2012|year=1992|publisher=McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research[/tpl][tpl]rp|27[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=R.

==History==

At least since antiquity, grains of wheat or barley were used by Mediterranean traders to define units of mass; along with other seeds, especially those of the carob tree. According to a longstanding tradition, 1 carat (the mass of a carob seed) was equivalent to the weight of 4 wheat grains or 3 barleycorns.[tpl]cite journal |last=Ridgeway |first=William |authorlink=William Ridgeway |title=Metrological Notes: III.- Had the People of Pre-historic Mycenae a Weight Standard? |journal=The Journal of Hellenic Studies |volume=10 |year=1889 |pages=90–97 |publisher=The Council for the Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies |location=London |issn=0075-4269 |oclc=51205085 |doi=10.2307/623588 |jstor=623588[/tpl][tpl]rp|95[/tpl] Since the weights of these seeds are highly variable, especially that of the cereals as a function of moisture, this is a convention more than an absolute law.[tpl]cite book |last=Connor |first=R.D. |coauthors=Simpson, A.D.C. |title=Weights and Measures in Scotland |location=East Linton |year=c. 2004[/tpl][tpl]rp|120–1[/tpl]
The history of the modern British grain can be traced back to a royal decree in 13th century England, re-iterating decrees that go back as far as King Offa (eighth century).[tpl]cite book|last=Zupko|first=Ronald Edward|title=British Weights and Measures|year=1977|publisher=University of Wisconson|location=Maddison|isbn=0-299-07340-8|pages=11[/tpl]   The tower pound was one of many monetary pounds of 240 silver pennies.
[tpl]quote|By consent of the whole Realm the King's Measure was made, so that an English Penny, which is called the Sterling, round without clipping, shall weigh Thirty-two Grains of Wheat dry in the midst of the Ear; Twenty pennies make an Ounce; and Twelve Ounces make a Pound.|Tractatus de Ponderibus et Mensuris|[tpl]rp|119[/tpl][/tpl]
The pound in question is the Tower pound. The Tower pound, abolished in 1527, consisted of 12 ounces like the troy pound, but was [tpl]frac|16[/tpl] lighter. The weight of the original sterling pennies was 22½ troy grains, or 32 "Tower grains".[tpl]rp|116[/tpl]
The troy pound was only "the pound of Pence, Spices, Confections, as of Electuaries", as such goods might be measured by a troi or small balance.  The old troy standard was set by King Offa's currency reform, was in full use in 1284 (Assize of Weights and Measures, King Edward I), but was restricted to currency (the pound of pennies) until it was abolished in 1527.  This pound was progressively replaced by a new pound, based on the weight of 120 gold dirhems of 48 grains.  The new pound used a barley-corn grain, rather than the wheat grain.[tpl]cite book|last=Watson|first=C. M.|title=British Weights and Measures|year=1910|publisher=John Murry|location=London|pages=32–34[/tpl]
Avoirdupois (goods of weight) refers to those things measured by the lesser but quicker balances: the bismar or uncel, the Roman balance, and the steelyard.  The original mercantile pound of 25 shillings or 15 (tower) ounces was displaced by variously the pound of the Hanseatic League (16 tower ounces) and by the pound of the then-important wool trade (16 ounces of 437 grains).  A new pound of 7680 grains was inadvertently created by as 16 troy ounces, referring to the new troy rather than the old troy.  Eventually, the wool pound won out.
The avoirdupois pound was defined in prototype, rated as 6992 to 7004 grains.  In the Imperial Weights and Measures Act of 1824, the avoirdupois pound was defined as 7000 grains exactly.  The act of 1855 that authorised Miller's new standards to replace those lost in the fire that destroyed the Houses of Parliament.  The standard was an avoirdupoise pound, the grain being defined as 1/7000 of it.
The division of the carat into four grains, survives in both senses well into the early twentieth century.  For pearls and diamonds, weight is quoted in carats, divided into four grains.  The carat was eventually set to 205 milligrams (1877), and later 200 milligrams. For touch or fineness of gold, the fraction of gold was given as a weight, the total being a solidus of 24 carats or 96 grains.[tpl]cite book|last=Woolhouse|first=W. S.
