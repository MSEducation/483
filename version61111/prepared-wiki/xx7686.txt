[[Mole fraction]]

CATEGORIES: Chemical properties, Dimensionless numbers of chemistry

The sum of all the mole fractions is equal to 1:
The same concept expressed with a denominator of 100 is the mole percent or molar percentage (mol%).
The mole fraction is one way of expressing the composition of a mixture with a dimensionless quantity; mass fraction (percentage by weight, wt%) and volume fraction (percentage by volume, vol%) are others. 

==Properties==

Mole fraction is used very frequently in the construction of phase diagrams. It has a number of advantages:

==Related quantities==

===Mass fraction===

Replacing the expression of the molar mass:

===Mole percentage===

Multiplying mole fraction by 100 gives the mole percentage, also referred as amount/amount percent (abbreviated as n/n%).

===Mass concentration===

===Molar concentration===

or

===Mass and molar mass===

==Spatial variation and gradient==

In a spatially non-uniform mixture, the mole fraction gradient triggers the phenomenon of diffusion.
