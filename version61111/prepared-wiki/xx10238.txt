A robot is a mechanical or virtual artificial agent, usually an electro-mechanical machine that is guided by a computer program or electronic circuitry. Robots can be autonomous or semi-autonomous and range from humanoids such as Honda's Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility (ASIMO) and TOSY's TOSY Ping Pong Playing Robot (TOPIO) to industrial robots, collectively programmed 'swarm' robots, and even microscopic nano robots. By mimicking a lifelike appearance or automating movements, a robot may convey a sense of intelligence or thought of its own.
The branch of technology that deals with the design, construction, operation, and application of robots,[tpl]cite web|title=robotics|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/view/entry/m_en_gb0714530#m_en_gb0714530|publisher=Oxford Dictionaries|accessdate=4 February 2011[/tpl] as well as computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing is robotics. These technologies deal with automated machines that can take the place of humans in dangerous environments or manufacturing processes, or resemble humans in appearance, behavior, and/or cognition. Many of today's robots are inspired by nature contributing to the field of bio-inspired robotics. These robots have also created a newer branch of robotics: Soft robotics.
From the time of ancient civilization there have been many accounts of user-configurable automated devices and even automata resembling animals and humans, designed primarily as entertainment. As mechanical techniques developed through the Industrial age, there appeared more practical applications such as automated machines, remote-control and  wireless remote-control. Electronics evolved into the driving force of development with the advent of the first electronic autonomous robots created by William Grey Walter in Bristol, England in 1948. The first digital and programmable robot was invented by George Devol in 1954 and was named the Unimate. It was sold to General Motors in 1961 where it was used to lift pieces of hot metal from die casting machines at the Inland Fisher Guide Plant in the West Trenton section of Ewing Township, New Jersey.Pearce, Jeremy. "George C. Devol, Inventor of Robot Arm, Dies at 99", The New York Times, August 15, 2011. Retrieved February 7, 2012. "In 1961, General Motors put the first Unimate arm on an assembly line at the company’s plant in Ewing Township, N.J., a suburb of Trenton. The device was used to lift and stack die-cast metal parts taken hot from their molds."
Robots have replaced humans[tpl]cite web|last=Akins|first=Crystal|title=5 jobs being replaced by robots|url=http://excelle.monster.com/benefits/articles/4983-5-jobs-being-replaced-by-robots?page=1|work=Excelle|publisher=Monster|accessdate=2013-04-15[/tpl] in the assistance of performing those repetitive and dangerous tasks which humans prefer not to do, or are unable to do due to size limitations, or even those such as in outer space or at the bottom of the sea where humans could not survive the extreme environments.
There are concerns about the increasing use of robots and their role in society. Robots are blamed for rising unemployment as they replace workers in some functions. The use of robots in military combat raises ethical concerns. The possibilities of robot autonomy and potential repercussions have been addressed in fiction and may be a realistic concern in the future.

==Summary==

The word robot can refer to both physical robots and virtual software agents, but the latter are usually referred to as bots.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.atis.org/tg2k/_bot.html|title=Telecom glossary "bot"|publisher=Alliance for Telecommunications Solutions|date=2001-02-28|accessdate=2007-09-05|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070202121608/http://www.atis.org/tg2k/_bot.html|archivedate=2008-07-14[/tpl] There is no consensus on which machines qualify as robots but there is general agreement among experts, and the public, that robots tend to do some or all of the following: move around, operate a mechanical limb, sense and manipulate their environment, and exhibit intelligent behavior — especially behavior which mimics humans or other animals. In practical terms, "robot" usually refers to a machine which can be electronically programmed to carry out a variety of physical tasks or actions.
There is no one definition of robot that satisfies everyone and many people have their own.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.virtuar.com/click/2005/robonexus/index.htm|first=Igor|last=Polk|title=RoboNexus 2005 robot exhibition virtual tour|publisher=Robonexus Exhibition 2005|date=2005-11-16|accessdate=2007-09-10[/tpl]  For example Joseph Engelberger, a pioneer in industrial robotics, once remarked: "I can't define a robot, but I know one when I see one."[tpl]cite web|first=Tom|last=Harris|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/robot.htm|title=How Robots Work|publisher=How Stuff Works|accessdate=2007-09-10[/tpl]  The two ways that robots differ from actual beings are, simply stated, in the domain of cognition, and in the domain of biological form. The general consensus is that a "robot" is a machine and not a being simply because it is not intelligent (it requires programming to function), regardless of how human-like it may appear. In contrast, an imaginary "machine" or "artificial life form" (as in science fiction) that could think near or above human intelligence, and had a sensory body, would no longer be a "robot" but would be some kind of "artificial being" or "cognitive robot",  (see also cyborg).
According to the Encyclopaedia Britannica a robot is "any automatically operated machine that replaces human effort, though it may not resemble human beings in appearance or perform functions in a humanlike manner."  Merriam-Webster describes a robot as a "machine that looks like a human being and performs various complex acts (as walking or talking) of a human being", or a "device that automatically performs complicated often repetitive tasks", or a "mechanism guided by automatic controls".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/robot|title=Robot |publisher=Merriam-Webster Dictionary|accessdate=2008-08-04[/tpl]

==History==

The idea of automata originates in the mythologies of many cultures around the world. Engineers and inventors from ancient civilizations, including Ancient China,[tpl]cite book|last=Needham|first=Joseph|authorlink=Joseph Needham|year=1991|title=Science and Civilisation in China: Volume 2, History of Scientific Thought|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-05800-7[/tpl] Ancient Greece, and Ptolemaic Egypt,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~currie/roboadam.htm|title=The History of Robotics|first=Adam|last=Currie|year=1999|accessdate=2007-09-10[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=December 2013[/tpl] attempted to build self-operating machines, some resembling animals and humans. Early descriptions of automata include the artificial doves of Archytas,Noct. Att. L. 10 the artificial birds of Mozi and Lu Ban,Needham, Volume 2, 54. a "speaking" automaton by Hero of Alexandria, a washstand automaton by Philo of Byzantium, and a human automaton described in the Lie Zi.

===Early beginnings===

Many ancient mythologies, and most modern religions include artificial people, such as the mechanical servants built by the Greek god Hephaestus[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=h5tKJvApybsC&pg=PA114&lpg=PA114&dq=hephaestus+handmaidens|title=Ancient Greek Ideas on Speech, Language, and Civilization|author=Deborah Levine Gera|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-19-925616-7[/tpl] (Vulcan to the Romans), the clay golems of Jewish legend and clay giants of Norse legend, and Galatea, the mythical statue of Pygmalion that came to life. Since circa 400 BC, myths of Crete include Talos, a man of bronze who guarded the Cretan island of Europa from pirates.
In ancient Greece, the Greek engineer Ctesibius (c. 270 BC) "applied a knowledge of pneumatics and hydraulics to produce the first organ and water clocks with moving figures."Mark E. Rosheim (1994). "Robot evolution: the development of anthrobotics". p.2. Wiley-IEEE. ISBN 0-471-02622-0"Robots then and now". BBC. In the 4th century BC, the Greek mathematician Archytas of Tarentum postulated a mechanical steam-operated bird he called "The Pigeon". Hero of Alexandria [tpl]nowrap|(10–70 AD)[/tpl], a Greek mathematician and inventor, created numerous user-configurable automated devices, and described machines powered by air pressure, steam and water.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/Biographies/Heron.html | author=O'Connor, J.J. and E.F. Robertson | title=Heron biography | accessdate=2008-09-05 | work=The MacTutor History of Mathematics archive[/tpl]
The 11th century Lokapannatti tells of how the Buddha's relics were protected by mechanical robots (bhuta vahana yanta), from the kingdom of Roma visaya (Rome); until they were disarmed by King Ashoka. [tpl]sfn|Strong|2007|p=143[/tpl] [tpl]sfn|Strong|2007|p=133-134[/tpl]
In ancient China, the 3rd century text of the Lie Zi describes an account of humanoid automata, involving a much earlier encounter between Chinese emperor King Mu of Zhou and a mechanical engineer known as Yan Shi, an 'artificer'. Yan Shi proudly presented the king with a life-size, human-shaped figure of his mechanical 'handiwork' made of leather, wood, and artificial organs.Needham, Volume 2, 53. There are also accounts of flying automata in the Han Fei Zi and other texts, which attributes the 5th century BC Mohist philosopher Mozi and his contemporary Lu Ban with the invention of artificial wooden birds (ma yuan) that could successfully fly. In 1066, the Chinese inventor Su Song built a water clock in the form of a tower which featured mechanical figurines which chimed the hours.
The beginning of automata is associated with the invention of early  Su Song's astronomical clock tower featured mechanical figurines that chimed the hours.[tpl]cite journal|title=The Museum of Music: A History of Mechanical Instruments|first=Charles B.|last=Fowler|journal=Music Educators Journal|volume=54|issue=2|date=October 1967|pages=45–49|doi=10.2307/3391092|publisher=MENC_ The National Association for Music Education|jstor=3391092[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://physics.nist.gov/GenInt/Time/early.html |title=Earliest Clocks |work=A Walk Through Time |accessdate=2008-08-11 |publisher=NIST Physics Laboratory |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080531063139/http://physics.nist.gov/GenInt/Time/early.html  |archivedate = 2008-05-31[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|date=July 6, 2007|publisher=IPC Magazines|work=New Scientist|pages=32–35[/tpl] His mechanism had a programmable drum machine with pegs (cams) that bumped into little levers that operated percussion instruments. The drummer could be made to play different rhythms and different drum patterns by moving the pegs to different locations.
In Renaissance Italy, Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) sketched plans for a humanoid robot around 1495.  Da Vinci's notebooks, rediscovered in the 1950s, contained detailed drawings of a mechanical knight now known as Leonardo's robot, able to sit up, wave its arms and move its head and jaw.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.leonardo3.net/leonardo/books%20I%20robot%20di%20Leonardo%20-%20Taddei%20Mario%20-%20english%20Leonardo%20robots%201.html|title=Leonardo da Vinci's Robots|publisher=Leonardo3.net|accessdate=2008-09-25[/tpl] The design was probably based on anatomical research recorded in his Vitruvian Man. It is not known whether he attempted to build it.
In Japan, complex animal and human automata were built between the 17th to 19th centuries, with many described in the 18th century Karakuri zui (Illustrated Machinery, 1796). One such automaton was the karakuri ningyō, a mechanized puppet.Jane Marie Law, Puppets of Nostalgia – The Life, Death and Rebirth of the Japanese Awaji[tpl]disambiguation needed|[tpl]subst:DATE[/tpl]|date=August 2012[/tpl] Ningyo Tradition, 1997, Princeton University Press, ISBN 978-0-691-02894-1 Different variations of the karakuri existed: the Butai karakuri, which were used in theatre, the Zashiki karakuri, which were small and used in homes, and the Dashi karakuri which were used in religious festivals, where the puppets were used to perform reenactments of traditional myths and legends.
In France, between 1738 and 1739, Jacques de Vaucanson exhibited several life-sized automatons: a flute player, a pipe player and a duck.  The mechanical duck could flap its wings, crane its neck, and swallow food from the exhibitor's hand, and it gave the illusion of digesting its food by excreting matter stored in a hidden compartment.Wood, Gabby. "Living Dolls: A Magical History Of The Quest For Mechanical Life", The Guardian, 2002-02-16.

===Remote-controlled systems===

Remotely operated vehicles were demonstrated in the late 19th Century in the form of several types of remotely controlled torpedos. The early 1870s saw remotely controlled torpedos by John Ericsson (pneumatic), John Louis Lay (electric wire guided), and Victor von Scheliha (electric wire guided).Edwyn Gray, Nineteenth-century torpedoes and their inventors, page 18
The Brennan torpedo, invented by Louis Brennan in 1877 was powered by two contra-rotating propellors that were spun by rapidly pulling out wires from drums wound inside the torpedo. Differential speed on the wires connected to the shore station allowed the torpedo to be guided to its target, making it "the world's first practical guided missile".[tpl]cite book | last = Gray | first = Edwyn | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Nineteenth-Century Torpedoes and Their Inventors | publisher = Naval Institute Press | year = 2004 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-59114-341-1[/tpl] In 1897 the British inventor Ernest Wilson was granted a patent for a torpedo remotely controlled by "Hertzian" (radio) wavesMarc Seifer Life and Times of Nikola Tesla, page 1893 google booksBenjamin Franklin Miessner, Radiodynamics: The Wireless Control of Torpedoes and Other Mechanisms, D.

Archibald Low, known as the "father of radio guidance systems" for his pioneering work on guided rockets and planes during the First World War. In 1917, he demonstrated a remote controlled aircraft to the Royal Flying Corps and in the same year built the first wire-guided rocket.

===Humanoid robots===

The term 'robot' was first used to denote fictional automata in a 1921 play R.U.R. Rossum's Universal Robots by the Czech writer, Karel Čapek.
In 1928, one of the first humanoid robots was exhibited at the annual exhibition of the Model Engineers Society in London. Invented by W. H. Richards, the robot Eric's frame consisted of an aluminium body of armour with eleven electromagnets and one motor powered by a twelve-volt power source. The robot could move its hands and head and could be controlled through remote control or voice control.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.reffell.org.uk/people/ericrobot.php|title=AH Reffell & Eric Robot (1928)[/tpl]
Westinghouse Electric Corporation built Televox in 1926; it was a cardboard cutout connected to various devices which users could turn on and off. In 1939, the humanoid robot known as Elektro was debuted at the World's Fair.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.freetimes.com/stories/13/35/robot-dreams-the-strange-tale-of-a-mans-quest-to-rebuild-his-mechanical-childhood-friend |work=The Cleveland Free Times |title=Robot Dreams : The Strange Tale Of A Man's Quest To Rebuild His Mechanical Childhood Friend |accessdate=2008-09-25[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=December 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=Robots of Westinghouse: 1924-Today |author=Scott Schaut |publisher=Mansfield Memorial Museum |year=2006 |isbn=0-9785844-1-4[/tpl] Seven feet tall (2.1 m) and weighing 265 pounds (120.2 kg), it could walk by voice command, speak about 700 words (using a 78-rpm record player), smoke cigarettes, blow up balloons, and move its head and arms. The body consisted of a steel gear, cam and motor skeleton covered by an aluminum skin. In 1928, Japan's first robot, Gakutensoku, was designed and constructed by biologist Makoto Nishimura.

===Modern autonomous robots===

The first electronic autonomous robots with complex behaviour were created by William Grey Walter of the Burden Neurological Institute at Bristol, England in 1948 and 1949. He wanted to prove that rich connections between a small number of brain cells could give rise to very complex behaviors - essentially that the secret of how the brain worked lay in how it was wired up. His first robots, named Elmer and Elsie, were constructed between 1948 and 1949 and were often described as tortoises due to their shape and slow rate of movement. The three-wheeled tortoise robots were capable of phototaxis, by which they could find their way to a recharging station when they ran low on battery power.
Walter stressed the importance of using purely analogue electronics to simulate brain processes at a time when his contemporaries such as Alan Turing and John von Neumann were all turning towards a view of mental processes in terms of digital computation.  His work inspired subsequent generations of robotics researchers such as Rodney Brooks, Hans Moravec and Mark Tilden.  Modern incarnations of Walter's turtles may be found in the form of BEAM robotics.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.ias.uwe.ac.uk/Robots/gwonline/gwonline.html |title=The Grey Walter Online Archive |accessdate=2008-09-25 |author=Owen Holland[/tpl]

Commercial and industrial robots are now in widespread use performing jobs more cheaply or with greater accuracy and reliability than humans. They are also employed for jobs which are too dirty, dangerous or dull to be suitable for humans. Robots are widely used in manufacturing, assembly and packing, transport, earth and space exploration, surgery, weaponry, laboratory research, and mass production of consumer and industrial goods.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.emrotechnologies.com/ |title=About us[/tpl]

==Etymology==

The word robot was introduced to the public by the Czech interwar writer Karel Čapek in his play R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots), published in 1920.[tpl]cite web|url=http://capek.misto.cz/english/robot.html|first=Dominik|last=Zunt|title=Who did actually invent the word "robot" and what does it mean?|publisher=The Karel Čapek website|accessdate=2007-09-11[/tpl] The play begins in a factory that makes artificial people called robots, though they are closer to the modern ideas of androids, creatures who can be mistaken for humans. They can plainly think for themselves, though they seem happy to serve. At issue is whether the robots are being exploited and the consequences of their treatment.
Karel Čapek himself did not coin the word. He wrote a short letter in reference to an etymology in the Oxford English Dictionary in which he named his brother, the painter and writer Josef Čapek, as its actual originator.
In an article in the Czech journal Lidové noviny in 1933, he explained that he had originally wanted to call the creatures laboři ("workers", from Latin labor). However, he did not like the word, and sought advice from his brother Josef, who suggested "roboti".  The word robota means literally "corvée", "serf labor", and figuratively "drudgery" or "hard work" in Czech and also (more general) "work", "labor" in  many Slavic languages (e.g.: Bulgarian, Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Polish, Macedonian, Ukrainian, archaic Czech). Traditionally the robota was the work period a serf (corvée) had to give for his lord, typically 6 months of the year.   The origin of the word is the Old Church Slavonic (Old Bulgarian) rabota "servitude" ("work" in contemporary Bulgarian and Russian), which in turn comes from the Proto-Indo-European root *orbh-. Robot is cognate with the German root Arbeit (work).[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080512121943/www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE363.html |title=Indo-European root *orbh- |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2008-05-12 |accessdate=2014-02-08[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=robot&searchmode=or|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=2012-06-10[/tpl]
The word robotics, used to describe this field of study, was coined by the science fiction writer Isaac Asimov. Asimov created the "Three Laws of Robotics" which are a recurring theme in his books. These have since been used by many others to define laws used in fact and fiction.

===Mobile robot===

Mobile robots P. Moubarak, P. Ben-Tzvi, Adaptive Manipulation of a Hybrid Mechanism Mobile Robot, in Proceedings of IEEE International Symposium on Robotic and Sensors Environments, ROSE ’11, 2011, Montreal, Canada, pp. 113 – 118. have the capability to move around in their environment and are not fixed to one physical location. An example of a mobile robot that is in common use today is the automated guided vehicle or automatic guided vehicle (AGV). An AGV is a mobile robot that follows markers or wires in the floor, or uses vision or lasers.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl] AGVs are discussed later in this article.
Mobile robots are also found in industry, military and security environments. They also appear as consumer products, for entertainment or to perform certain tasks like vacuum cleaning. Mobile robots are the focus of a great deal of current research and almost every major university has one or more labs that focus on mobile robot research.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl]
Mobile robots are usually used in tightly controlled environments such as on assembly lines because they have difficulty responding to unexpected interference.  Because of this most humans rarely encounter robots.  However domestic robots for cleaning and maintenance are increasingly common in and around homes in developed countries. Robots can also be found in military applications.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl]

===Industrial robots (manipulating)===

Industrial robots usually consist of a jointed arm (multi-linked manipulator) and an end effector that is attached to a fixed surface. One of the most common type of end effector is a gripper assembly.
The International Organization for Standardization gives a definition of a  manipulating industrial robot in ISO 8373:
"an automatically controlled, reprogrammable, multipurpose, manipulator programmable in three or more axes, which may be either fixed in place or mobile for use in industrial automation applications."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dira.dk/pdf/robotdef.pdf |title=Definition of a robot|format=PDF|publisher=Dansk Robot Forening|accessdate=2007-09-10|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070628064010/http://www.dira.dk/pdf/robotdef.pdf|archivedate=2008-07-15[/tpl]
This definition is used by the International Federation of Robotics, the European Robotics Research Network (EURON) and many national standards committees.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.euron.org/resources/standards.html |title=Robotics-related Standards Sites |publisher=European Robotics Research Network |accessdate=2008-07-15[/tpl]

===Service robot===

Most commonly industrial robots are fixed robotic arms and manipulators used primarily for production and distribution of goods. The term "service robot" is less well-defined. The International Federation of Robotics has proposed a tentative definition, "A service robot is a robot which operates semi- or fully  autonomously to perform services useful to the well-being of humans and equipment, excluding manufacturing operations."Provisional definition of Service Robots[tpl]dead link|date=December 2013[/tpl] English, 27th of October 2012

===Educational Robot===

Robots  are used as educational assistants to teachers. From the 1980s, robots such as turtles were used in schools and programmed using the Logo language.[tpl]cite news | title='Nova's' 'Talking Turtle' Pofiles High Priest of School Computer Movement | work=Gainesville Sun | date=October 25, 1983 | author=Mitgang, Lee[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=W4diAAAAIBAJ&sjid=s3cNAAAAIBAJ&pg=1326,3744066&dq=logo+turtle+robot&hl=en | title=Robots In School: Games Or Learning? | work=Observer-Reporter | date=January 29, 1985 | accessdate=March 7, 2012 | author=Barnard, Jeff | location=Washington[/tpl]
There are robot kits like Lego Mindstorms, BIOLOID, OLLO from ROBOTIS, or BotBrain Educational Robots can help children to learn about mathematics, physics, programming, and electronics. Robotics have also been introduced into the lives of elementary and high school students in the form of robot competitions with the company FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology). The organization is the foundation for the FIRST Robotics Competition, FIRST LEGO League, Junior FIRST LEGO League, and FIRST Tech Challenge competitions.
There have also been devices shaped like robots such as the teaching computer, Leachim (1974), and 2-XL (1976), a robot shaped game / teaching toy based on an 8-track tape player, both invented Michael J. Freeman.

===Modular robot===

Modular robots are a new breed of robots that are designed to increase the utilization of robots by modularizing their architecture.P. Moubarak, et al., Modular and Reconfigurable Mobile Robotics, Journal of Robotics and Autonomous Systems, 60 (12) (2012) 1648 – 1663. The functionality and effectiveness of a modular robot is easier to increase compared to conventional robots. These robots are composed of a single type of identical, several different identical module types, or similarly shaped modules, which vary in size. Their architectural structure allows hyper-redundancy for modular robots, as they can be designed with more than 8 degrees of freedom (DOF). Creating the programming, inverse kinematics and dynamics for modular robots is more complex than with traditional robots.
Modular robots may be composed of L-shaped modules, cubic modules, and U and H-shaped modules. ANAT technology, an early modular robotic technology patented by Robotics Design Inc., allows the creation of modular robots from U and H shaped modules that connect in a chain, and are used to form heterogeneous and homogenous modular robot systems. These “ANAT robots” can be designed with “n” DOF as each module is a complete motorized robotic system that folds relatively to the modules connected before and after it in its chain, and therefore a single module allows one degree of freedom. The more modules that are connected to one another, the more degrees of freedom it will have. L-shaped modules can also be designed in a chain, and must become increasingly smaller as the size of the chain increases, as payloads attached to the end of the chain place a greater strain on modules that are further from the base. ANAT H-shaped modules do not suffer from this problem, as their design allows a modular robot to distribute pressure and impacts evenly amongst other attached modules, and therefore payload-carrying capacity does not decrease as the length of the arm increases.
Modular robots can be manually or self-reconfigured to form a different robot, that may perform different applications. Because modular robots of the same architecture type are composed of modules that compose different modular robots, a snake-arm robot can combine with another to form a dual or quadra-arm robot, or can split into several mobile robots, and mobile robots can split into multiple smaller ones, or combine with others into a larger or different one.  This allows a single modular robot the ability to be fully specialized in a single task, as well as the capacity to be specialized to perform multiple different tasks.

===Collaborative robots===

A collaborative robot or cobot is a robot that can safely and effectively interact with human workers while performing simple industrial tasks. However, end-effectors and other environmental conditions may create hazards, and as such risk assessments should be done before using any industrial motion-control application.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.controleng.com/single-article/universal-robots-collaborate-outside-enclosures/83cc537080cf25e043eb9b770fd1d62f.html |title=Universal Robots collaborate outside enclosures | Control Engineering |publisher=Controleng.com |accessdate=2013-06-04[/tpl]

===Autonomy and ethical questions===

As robots have become more advanced and sophisticated, experts and academics have increasingly explored the questions of what ethics might govern robots' behavior,AAAI webpage of materials on robot ethics[tpl]dead link|date=December 2013[/tpl].  and whether robots might be able to claim any kind of social, cultural, ethical or legal rights.AAAI compilation of articles on robot rights[tpl]dead link|date=December 2013[/tpl], Sources compiled up to 2006.

He suggests that it may be somewhat or possibly very dangerous for humans.The Coming Technological Singularity: How to Survive in the Post-Human Era, by Vernor Vinge, Department of Mathematical Sciences, San Diego State University, (c) 1993 by Vernor Vinge. This is discussed by a philosophy called Singularitarianism.
In 2009, experts attended a conference hosted by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) to discuss whether computers and robots might be able to acquire any autonomy, and how much these abilities might pose a threat or hazard. They noted that some robots have acquired various forms of semi-autonomy, including being able to find power sources on their own and being able to independently choose targets to attack with weapons. They also noted that some computer viruses can evade elimination and have achieved "cockroach intelligence." They noted that self-awareness as depicted in science-fiction is probably unlikely, but that there were other potential hazards and pitfalls.Scientists Worry Machines May Outsmart Man By John Markoff, The New York Times, July 26, 2009.

===Relationship to unemployment===

A recent example of human replacement involves Taiwanese technology company Foxconn who, in July 2011, announced a three-year plan to replace workers with more robots. At present the company uses ten thousand robots but will increase them to a million robots over a three-year period.[tpl]cite news|title=Foxconn to replace workers with 1 million robots in 3 years|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2011-07/30/c_131018764.htm|accessdate=4 August 2011|agency=Xinhua News Agency|date=30 July 2011|author=Yan[/tpl]
Service robots of different varieties including medical robots, underwater robots, surveillance robots, demolition robots and other types of robots that carry out a multitude of jobs are gaining in numbers. Service robots are everyday tools for mankind. They can clean floors, mow lawns and guard homes and will also assist old and handicapped people, do some surgeries, inspect pipes and sites that are hazardous to people, fight fires and defuse bombs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2004/10/041021085857.htm |title=retrieved September-03-11 |publisher=Sciencedaily.com |accessdate=2014-02-08[/tpl]

==Contemporary uses==

At present, there are two main types of robots, based on their use: general-purpose autonomous robots and dedicated robots.
Robots can be classified by their specificity of purpose.  A robot might be designed to perform one particular task extremely well, or a range of tasks less well. Of course, all robots by their nature can be re-programmed to behave differently, but some are limited by their physical form. For example, a factory robot arm can perform jobs such as cutting, welding, gluing, or acting as a fairground ride, while a pick-and-place robot can only populate printed circuit boards.

===General-purpose autonomous robots===

General-purpose autonomous robots can perform a variety of functions independently. General-purpose autonomous robots typically can navigate independently in known spaces, handle their own re-charging needs, interface with electronic doors and elevators and perform other basic tasks. Like computers, general-purpose robots can link with networks, software and accessories that increase their usefulness. They may recognize people or objects, talk, provide companionship, monitor environmental quality, respond to alarms, pick up supplies and perform other useful tasks. General-purpose robots may perform a variety of functions simultaneously or they may take on different roles at different times of day. Some such robots try to mimic human beings and may even resemble people in appearance; this type of robot is called a humanoid robot. Humanoid robots are still in a very limited stage, as no humanoid robot can, as of yet, actually navigate around a room that it has never been in. [tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl] Thus, humanoid robots are really quite limited, despite their intelligent behaviors in their well-known environments.

===Factory robots===

Over the last three decades, automobile factories have become dominated by robots. A typical factory contains hundreds of industrial robots working on fully automated production lines, with one robot for every ten human workers.  On an automated production line, a vehicle chassis on a conveyor is welded, glued, painted and finally assembled at a sequence of robot stations.
Industrial robots are also used extensively for palletizing and packaging of manufactured goods, for example for rapidly taking drink cartons from the end of a conveyor belt and placing them into boxes, or for loading and unloading machining centers.
Mass-produced printed circuit boards (PCBs) are almost exclusively manufactured by pick-and-place robots, typically with SCARA manipulators, which remove tiny electronic components from strips or trays, and place them on to PCBs with great accuracy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.contactsystems.com/c5_series.html |publisher=Contact Systems |title=Contact Systems Pick and Place robots|accessdate=2008-09-21[/tpl] Such robots can place hundreds of thousands of components per hour, far out-performing a human in speed, accuracy, and reliability.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.assembleon.com/surface-mount-assembly/pick-and-place-equipment/a-series/|publisher=Assembleon| title=SMT pick-and-place equipment|accessdate=2008-09-21 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080803173021/http://www.assembleon.com/surface-mount-assembly/pick-and-place-equipment/a-series/  |archivedate = 2008-08-03[/tpl]

Review of Space Probes: 50 Years of Exploration from Luna 1 to New Horizons, by Philippe Séguéla Firefly, 2011. Some were launched in the 1960s with very limited abilities, but their ability to fly and land (in the case of Luna 9) is an indication of their status as a robot. This includes the Voyager probes and the Galileo probes, and others.
Teleoperated robots, or telerobots, are devices remotely operated from a distance by a human operator rather than following a predetermined sequence of movements, but which has semi-autonomous behaviour. They are used when a human cannot be present on site to perform a job because it is dangerous, far away, or inaccessible. The robot may be in another room or another country, or may be on a very different scale to the operator. For instance, a laparoscopic surgery robot allows the surgeon to work inside a human patient on a relatively small scale compared to open surgery, significantly shortening recovery time. They can also be used to avoid exposing workers to the hazardous and tight spaces such as in duct cleaning. When disabling a bomb, the operator sends a small robot to disable it.

===Mining robots===

Mining robots are designed to solve a number of problems currently facing the mining industry, including skills shortages, improving productivity from declining ore grades, and achieving environmental targets. Due to the hazardous nature of mining, in particular underground mining, the prevalence of autonomous, semi-autonomous, and tele-operated robots has greatly increased in recent times. A number of vehicle manufacturers provide autonomous trains, trucks and loaders that will load material, transport it on the mine site to its destination, and unload without requiring human intervention. One of the world's largest mining corporations, Rio Tinto, has recently expanded its autonomous vehicle fleet to the world's largest, consisting of 150 autonomous Komatsu trucks, operating in Western Australia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.riotinto.com/media/5157_21165.asp |title=Rio Tinto Media Center – Rio Tinto boosts driverless truck fleet to 150 under Mine of the Future™ programme |publisher=Riotinto.com |accessdate=2014-02-08[/tpl]

===Healthcare===

Robots in healthcare have two main functions. Those which assist an individual, such as a sufferer of a disease like Multiple Sclerosis, and those which aid in the overall systems such as pharmacies and hospitals.
Robots have developed over time from simple basic robotic assistants, such as the Handy 1,[tpl]cite journal |last=Topping |first=Mike |coauthors=Smith, Jane |title=An Overview Of Handy 1, A Rehabilitation Robot For The Severely Disabled |journal=CSUN Center on Disabilities Conference Proceedings |year=1999 |volume=Proceedings |series=1999 |pages=Session 59 |url= http://www.csun.edu/cod/conf/1999/proceedings/session0059.htm |accessdate=14 August 2010 |quote=The early version of the Handy 1 system consisted of a Cyber 310 robotic arm with five degrees of freedom plus a gripper.[/tpl] through to semi-autonomous robots, such as FRIEND which can assist the elderly and disabled with common tasks.
The population is aging in many countries, especially Japan, meaning that there are increasing numbers of elderly people to care for, but relatively fewer young people to care for them.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4012797.stm|publisher=BBC News|first=Christine|last=Jeavans|date=2004-11-29|title=Welcome to the ageing future|accessdate=2007-09-26[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stat.go.jp/english/data/handbook/c02cont.htm|title=Statistical Handbook of Japan: Chapter 2 Population|publisher=Statistics Bureau & Statistical Research and Training Institute|accessdate=2007-09-26[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=December 2013[/tpl] Humans make the best carers, but where they are unavailable, robots are gradually being introduced.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.e-health-insider.com/comment_and_analysis/250/robotic_future_of_patient_care|publisher=E-Health Insider|title=Robotic future of patient care|date=2007-08-16|accessdate=2007-09-26[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=December 2013[/tpl]
FRIEND is a semi-autonomous robot designed to support disabled and elderly people in their daily life activities, like preparing and serving a meal. FRIEND make it possible for patients who are paraplegic, have muscle diseases or serious paralysis (due to strokes etc.), to perform tasks without help from other people like therapists or nursing staff.
Script Pro manufactures a robot designed to help pharmacies fill prescriptions that consist of oral solids or medications in pill form. The pharmacist or pharmacy technician enters the prescription information into its information system. The system, upon determining whether or not the drug is in the robot, will send the information to the robot for filling. The robot has 3 different size vials to fill determined by the size of the pill. The robot technician, user, or pharmacist determines the needed size of the vial based on the tablet when the robot is stocked. Once the vial is filled it is brought up to a conveyor belt that delivers it to a holder that spins the vial and attaches the patient label. Afterwards it is set on another conveyor that delivers the patient’s medication vial to a slot labeled with the patient's name on an LED read out. The pharmacist or technician then checks the contents of the vial to ensure it’s the correct drug for the correct patient and then seals the vials and sends it out front to be picked up. The robot is a very time efficient device that the pharmacy depends on to fill prescriptions.
McKesson’s Robot RX is another healthcare robotics product that helps pharmacies dispense thousands of medications daily with little or no errors. The robot can be ten feet wide and thirty feet long and can hold hundreds of different kinds of medications and thousands of doses. The pharmacy saves many resources like staff members that are otherwise unavailable in a resource scarce industry. It uses an electromechanical head coupled with a pneumatic system to capture each dose and deliver it to its either stocked or dispensed location. The head moves along a single axis while it rotates 180 degrees to pull the medications. During this process it uses barcode technology to verify its pulling the correct drug. It then delivers the drug to a patient specific bin on a conveyor belt. Once the bin is filled with all of the drugs that a particular patient needs and that the robot stocks, the bin is then released and returned out on the conveyor belt to a technician waiting to load it into a cart for delivery to the floor.

While most robots today are installed in factories or homes, performing labour or life saving jobs, many new types of robot are being developed in laboratories around the world. Much of the research in robotics focuses not on specific industrial tasks, but on investigations into new types of robot, alternative ways to think about or design robots, and new ways to manufacture them. It is expected that these new types of robot will be able to solve real world problems when they are finally realized.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2009[/tpl]
Nanorobotics is the emerging technology field of creating machines or robots whose components are at or close to the microscopic scale of a nanometer (10−9 meters). Also known as "nanobots" or "nanites", they would be constructed from molecular machines. So far, researchers have mostly produced only parts of these complex systems, such as bearings, sensors, and synthetic molecular motors, but functioning robots have also been made such as the entrants to the Nanobot Robocup contest.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.techbirbal.com/viewtopic.php?p=3687&sid=7faaeeb64eaf84880b23755fea7fa7cd |title=Nanobots Play Football |publisher=Techbirbal |accessdate=2014-02-08[/tpl] Researchers also hope to be able to create entire robots as small as viruses or bacteria, which could perform tasks on a tiny scale.

A few researchers have investigated the possibility of creating robots which can alter their physical form to suit a particular task,(1996) LEGO(TM)s to the Stars: Active MesoStructures, Kinetic Cellular Automata, and Parallel Nanomachines for Space Applications like the fictional T-1000. Real robots are nowhere near that sophisticated however, and mostly consist of a small number of cube shaped units, which can move relative to their neighbours. Algorithms have been designed in case any such robots become a reality.(Robert Fitch, Zack Butler and Daniela Rus) Reconfiguration Planning for Heterogeneous Self-Reconfiguring Robots
Robots with silicone bodies and flexible actuators (air muscles, electroactive polymers, and ferrofluids), controlled using fuzzy logic and neural networks, look and feel different from robots with rigid skeletons, and can have different behaviors.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/27/science/27robo.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1&ei=5070&en=91395fe7439a5b72&ex=1177128000 |title=In the Lab: Robots That Slink and Squirm |author=John Schwartz |work=The New York Times |accessdate=2008-09-22 | date=2007-03-27[/tpl]
Inspired by colonies of insects such as ants and bees, researchers are modeling the behavior of swarms of thousands of tiny robots which together perform a useful task, such as finding something hidden, cleaning, or spying. Each robot is quite simple, but the emergent behavior of the swarm is more complex. The whole set of robots can be considered as one single distributed system, in the same way an ant colony can be considered a superorganism, exhibiting swarm intelligence. The largest swarms so far created include the iRobot swarm, the SRI/MobileRobots CentiBots project((cite web|http://www.activrobots.com/RESEARCH/wheelchair.html|title=SRI/MobileRobots Centibot project)) and the Open-source Micro-robotic Project swarm, which are being used to research collective behaviors.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.swarmrobot.org|title=Open-source micro-robotic project|accessdate=2007-10-28[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.irobot.com/sp.cfm?pageid=149|publisher=iRobot Corporation|title=Swarm|accessdate=2007-10-28[/tpl] Swarms are also more resistant to failure. Whereas one large robot may fail and ruin a mission, a swarm can continue even if several robots fail. This could make them attractive for space exploration missions, where failure is normally extremely costly.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2000/12/40750 |work=Wired |title=Look, Up in the Sky: Robofly |first=Louise|last=Knapp |date=2000-12-21|accessdate=2008-09-25[/tpl]
Robotics also has application in the design of virtual reality interfaces. Specialized robots are in widespread use in the haptic research community. These robots, called "haptic interfaces", allow touch-enabled user interaction with real and virtual environments. Robotic forces allow simulating the mechanical properties of "virtual" objects, which users can experience through their sense of touch.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?id=17363&ch=biotech&sc=&pg=1 |publisher=MIT Technology review |title=The Cutting Edge of Haptics |accessdate=2008-09-25[/tpl]

==Future development==

===Technological trends===

Various techniques have emerged to develop the science of robotics and robots. One method is evolutionary robotics, in which a number of differing robots are submitted to tests. Those which perform best are used as a model to create a subsequent "generation" of robots. Another method is developmental robotics, which tracks changes and development within a single robot in the areas of problem-solving and other functions.

As robots become more advanced, eventually there may be a standard computer operating system designed mainly for robots. Robot Operating System is an open-source set of programs being developed at Stanford University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Technical University of Munich, Germany, among others. ROS provides ways to program a robot's navigation and limbs regardless of the specific hardware involved. It also provides high-level commands for items like image recognition and even opening doors. When ROS boots up on a robot's computer, it would obtain data on attributes such as the length and movement of robots' limbs. It would relay this data to higher-level algorithms.

9. cook fast food and work in other service industries
10. household robot.
Generally such predictions are overly optimistic in timescale.

==Robots in popular culture==

===Literature===

Robotic characters, androids (artificial men/women) or gynoids (artificial women), and cyborgs (also "bionic men/women", or humans with significant mechanical enhancements) have become a staple of science fiction.
The first reference in Western literature to mechanical servants appears in Homer's Iliad. In Book XVIII, Hephaestus, god of fire, creates new armor for the hero Achilles, assisted by robots.[ref]
[tpl]dead link|date=December 2013[/tpl][/ref] According to the Rieu translation, "Golden maidservants hastened to help their master. They looked like real women and could not only speak and use their limbs but were endowed with intelligence and trained in handwork by the immortal gods."  Of course, the words "robot" or "android" are not used to describe them, but they are nevertheless mechanical devices human in appearance. "The first use of the word Robot was in Karel Čapek's play R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots) (written in 1920)". Writer Karel Čapek was born in Czechoslovakia (Czech Republic).
Possibly the most prolific author of the twentieth century was Isaac Asimov (1920–1992)[tpl]cite book|last=Freedman|first=ed. by Carl|title=Conversations with Isaac Asimov|year=2005|publisher=Univ.

[tpl]cite book|title=Isaac Asimov: a life of the grand master of science fiction |url=http://books.google.com/?id=EWbMiyS9v98C |isbn=0-7867-1518-9 |pages=1–2 |author=White, Michael |year=2005 |publisher=Carroll & Graf[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.anu.edu.au/people/Roger.Clarke/SOS/Asimov.html|title=Asimov's Laws of Robotics – Implications for Information Technology|publisher=Australian National University/IEEE|author=R. Clarke|accessdate=2008-09-25[/tpl] Asimov carefully considered the problem of the ideal set of instructions robots might be given in order to lower the risk to humans, and arrived at his Three Laws of Robotics: a robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm; a robot must obey orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law; and a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.[tpl]cite web |last=Seiler |first=Edward |coauthors=Jenkins, John H. |url=http://www.asimovonline.com/asimov_FAQ.html |title=Isaac Asimov FAQ |publisher=Isaac Asimov Home Page |date=2008-06-27 |accessdate=2008-09-24[/tpl]  These were introduced in his 1942 short story "Runaround", although foreshadowed in a few earlier stories.  Later, Asimov added the Zeroth Law: "A robot may not harm humanity, or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm"; the rest of the laws are modified sequentially to acknowledge this.
According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first passage in Asimov's short story "Liar!" (1941) that mentions the First Law is the earliest recorded use of the word robotics.  Asimov was not initially aware of this; he assumed the word already existed by analogy with mechanics, hydraulics, and other similar terms denoting branches of applied knowledge.[tpl]cite book|author=White, Michael|title=Isaac Asimov: A Life of the Grand Master of Science Fiction|pages=56|year=2005|publisher=Carroll & Graf|isbn=0-7867-1518-9[/tpl]

===Problems depicted in popular culture===

Fears and concerns about robots have been repeatedly expressed in a wide range of books and films. A common theme is the development of a master race of conscious and highly intelligent robots, motivated to take over or destroy the human race. (See The Terminator, Runaway, RoboCop, the Replicators in Stargate, the Cylons in Battlestar Galactica, The Matrix, Enthiran and I, Robot.) Some fictional robots are programmed to kill and destroy; others gain superhuman intelligence and abilities by upgrading their own software and hardware. Examples of popular media where the robot becomes evil are 2001: A Space Odyssey, Red Planet and Enthiran. Another common theme is the reaction, sometimes called the "uncanny valley", of unease and even revulsion at the sight of robots that mimic humans too closely.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.macdorman.com/kfm/writings/pubs/Ho2007EmotionUncanny.pdf |first=C.

March 11–14. Amsterdam.[/tpl] Frankenstein (1818), often called the first science fiction novel, has become synonymous with the theme of a robot or monster advancing beyond its creator. In the TV show, Futurama, the robots are portrayed as humanoid figures that live alongside humans, not as robotic butlers. They still work in industry, but these robots carry out daily lives. Other problems may include events pertaining to robot surrogates (e.g. the movie Surrogates) where tissue of living organisms is interchanged with robotic systems. These problems can leave many possibilities where electronic viruses or an electro magnetic pulse (EMP) can destroy not only the robot but kill the host/operator as well.
