==Life and career==

Brock was born in Charlotte, North Carolina. His father was a freelance journalist and graphic designer. His stepfather, Danny Thomas, was a drummer for the 13th Floor Elevators. As a teenager, Brock led the Progressive Rock/Avant-Garde band ChiaroscurO in Charlotte. He also assisted his father, James Brock, in writing and design. He later worked for James Robert Smith (editor, and author, The Flock) at a comic book store where he met many like-minded individuals and honed his creative writing skills. After that, he worked as a graphic designer for Morris Costumes in their catalog department and also served as an artistâ€™s apprentice for Pat Piro and as an audio engineer trainee at Reflection Sound Studio under Mark Williams.
Brock has lived on the West Coast since 1993 spending time in Seattle, Los Angeles and Vancouver, WA. He was an award-winning Field Service Engineer and Regional Manager for several photo companies (Kits/Ritz Cameras, Konica Quality Photo West) before working as a Product Specialist for Fuji Photo Film; he left to form JaSunni Productions, LLC in 2005.
Brock and his wife, Sunni, are longtime vegetarians (often vegan) and animal lovers/animal rights activists. They have several skinks, an iguana named Liz, and four red-foot tortoises that roam their home wearing diapers.  During filming of the Charles Beaumont documentary, he struck up a deep friendship with William F. Nolan who is also a vegetarian and very fond of animals. Nolan relocated to Vancouver, WA to be near the Brocks who are like an extended family.
