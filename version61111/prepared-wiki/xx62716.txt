Hooverphonic is a Belgian rock/pop  group, formed in 1995. Though early on categorized as a trip hop group, they quickly expanded their sound to the point where they could no longer be described as a lone genre, but rather encompass alternative, electronica, electropop, rock, and mixture of others. The band originally called themselves Hoover, but later changed their name to Hooverphonic after discovering other groups were already using the Hoover name and to avoid any legal issues with the vacuum cleaner company.
On 10 October 2008, Geike Arnaert, the lead singer of the band, announced she would leave the group by the end of the year to pursue her solo career. Arnaert had been working on solo material for a few months.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=36381_0_2_0_C |title=Hooverphonic front woman Geike Arnaert quits band |publisher=Side-line.com |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2014-03-07[/tpl] The last concert of Hooverphonic with Geike was on 13 December 2008 in Tele-Club, Ekaterinburg, Russia. It was filmed by the local MTV station and was shown on Russian TV in 2009.
On 29 October 2010, Hooverphonic announced their new single on their website.

On 4 November 2010, the new singer was announced on De Laatste Show at the VRT, the Flemish public broadcasting organization.

==A New Stereophonic Sound Spectacular==

The original members of the group were vocalist Esther Lybeert, keyboardist Frank Duchêne, bassist Alex Callier, and guitarist Raymond Geerts. Lybeert recorded several demos with the group; however, she backed out of the band on the day they were to sign their contract with Sony Music.[tpl]cite video |people=Callier, Alex |year=2005 |title=10 Years With Hooverphonic - Alex Callier Interview |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGeGq6ab2U |medium=television interview |language=Dutch |publisher=ëën |accessdate=29 November 2012 |time=1:47 |quote=In fact the demos were done by Esther. She also did all the showcases and on the day we had to sign our record contract at Sony Music she said: "I don't think I can do this..."[/tpl] The band then brought in Liesje Sadonius to record the album. Sadonius left Hooverphonic on amicable terms shortly after the release of A New Stereophonic Sound Spectacular. Kyoko Baertsoen, singer for fellow Belgian trip-hop band Lunascape, filled in for Sadonius for three months of a European tour in 1997 before Geike Arnaert was made the permanent singer in early 1998.
The band achieved international recognition through the inclusion of the Stereophonic track "2Wicky" on the soundtrack to Bernardo Bertolucci's 1996 film Stealing Beauty. "2Wicky" also appeared on the soundtracks of I Know What You Did Last Summer and Heights. The track's main riff is sampled from Isaac Hayes' recording of the 1960s hit Walk On By.
Additional session musicians for Stereophonic include Eric Bosteels, a session drummer with Hooverphonic from 1997–98 (replaced by Mario Goossens until 2005) and David Poltrock, a keyboard player from the group on-and-off from 1998 until 2005. In 1998 Hooverphonic also contributed to the Depeche Mode tribute album For the Masses, with their cover of "Shake the Disease".

==Blue Wonder Power Milk==

After an extensive European tour with artists such as Massive Attack, Morcheeba and Apollo 440, and a tour opening for Fiona Apple in the United States in 1997, the band released Blue Wonder Power Milk in 1998 with 18-year-old Arnaert on vocals. A marked departure from their debut, the album is driven less by breakbeats and samples and more by organic string elements and traditional song structures.
The single "Club Montepulciano" was a hit in native Belgium and a minor college hit in the U.S., while "Renaissance Affair" was featured in the North American commercial campaign for the new Volkswagen Vapor Beetle.  "This Strange Effect" and "Eden" were both featured in American cell phone commercials-- "This Strange Effect" for the Motorola SLVR, and most recently in 2006, "Eden" for the Cingular 8525.  "Eden" was also used in the 1998 slasher film I Still Know What You Did Last Summer. At the time of their release, both songs were also featured in two separate third season episodes of La Femme Nikita.  Shortly afterward, Sarah Brightman recorded a cover of "Eden" on her 1998 album "Eden".

==The Magnificent Tree==

The band followed up Blue Wonder Power Milk with 2000's The Magnificent Tree, which expands on the sound of Milk with a warmer, more approachable sound.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl] Highlights from the album are the string-laden "Out Of Sight", "Mad About You", and the title track.
The same year, Hooverphonic was asked to write a song specifically for the opening ceremony of the 2000 European Football Championship, which took place in Brussels, Belgium. The result - a 12-minute long track called "Visions" - became the theme song of the championship, and Hooverphonic's performance at the opening ceremony was heard/seen by more than 1 billion people.
On the heels of Tree's success, the band became the first Belgian outfit to headline the Belgian musical festival Rock Werchter in 2001.

==Hooverphonic Presents Jackie Cane==

2002 saw the group shifting gears again, this time releasing the concept album Hooverphonic Presents Jackie Cane. The album tells the story of the fictional title character, a celebrity and singer catapulted into stardom at the expense of her relationship with her twin sister. Driven to the brink of insanity by the pressures of fame, Jackie quits show business and returns home to attempt reconciliation, where her sister kills them both with a poisoned last supper.
Jackie Cane retains the dreamy elements of Hooverphonic's previous works, most notably on songs "Nirvana Blue" and "Human Interest" (which contains references to "Echoes" by Pink Floyd), but tracks like "The World Is Mine" (the first single) and "Day After Day" have a clear Broadway influence and quality to them.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2007[/tpl]  The album went platinum in Belgium and won the group ZAMU's Best Pop/Rock Band and Best Album awards in 2002.

==Sit Down and Listen to Hooverphonic==

In 2003, the band released a live (i.e. recorded live with an orchestra but without any audience) album entitled Sit Down and Listen to Hooverphonic, featuring a selection of songs from the band's body of work, as well as the new songs  "Antarctica" and "The Last Thing I Need Is You", and a cover of Lee Hazlewood's "My Autumn's Done Come". The band launched into an extended European tour in September 2003, performing in over 100 concert halls.

==No More Sweet Music==

The band's fifth studio album, a double CD entitled No More Sweet Music/More Sweet Music, was released in December 2005.  Both CDs include the same 11 tracks, however, they are all different versions.

==Singles '96 - '06==

In 2006 the band left Sony/BMG, complaining of lack of label support for No More Sweet Music. A best-of album (Singles '96 - '06) was released to end the relation with Sony/BMG. The band is now going to work without a label.

==The President of the LSD Golf Club==

In an interview for the Spanish TV program Nosolomusica, Alex Callier gave some hints of a new, more psychedelic orientation for the band's music. During a show in Moscow (October 2007) the band revealed the first single of the new album, "Expedition Impossible".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tngzeajrco4 |title=Hooverphonic - Expedition Impossible (Live @ B-2 / Moscow) |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2014-03-07[/tpl] Alex Callier told [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.side-line.com/interviews_comments.php?id=29329_0_16_0_C |title=Hooverphonic - "I'm a gearslut!" |publisher=Side-line.com |date=2008-02-16 |accessdate=2014-03-07[/tpl] Side-Line Magazine that the new album also means an abrupt end with their previous label Sony.
