==History==

===Flextech (1990–2000)===

Flextech, was formerly an oil services group, previously being floated as an energy investment company back in 1983. It was not until the arrival of chief executive Roger Luard in 1986 that its focus began to change and becoming a TV programme provider. Its first media acquisition  was in 1990 with a 20% stake in programme producer/distributor HIT Communications, by October 1990 acquired a stake in The Children's Channel, when it brought 25% holding in Starstream Ltd, from BT, who no longer need to make sure quality programming was being broadcast on the Cable network.cbronline "BT is continuing the offloading of its cable television programming interests with the sale of its 25% holding in Startstream Ltd" 03 October 1990 By 1992, Flextech was a media-only group, having built up stakes in local cable operators selling off its non core asset.Guardian December 18, 1999 P28 "INTERVIEW Adam Singler and Tony Illsley By David Teather[tpl]cite web|last=Carter |first=Meg |url=http://www.marketingweek.co.uk/flextech-scales-scottish-heights/2039036.article |title=Flextech scales Scottish heights |publisher=Marketing Week |date=1995-09-08 |accessdate=2013-09-02[/tpl]

A new independent sales house was created to managed air time of over 14 channels. In 1993, Flextech gain its first stake in UK Gold after acquiring Tele-Communications' (TCI) TV interest in Europe. In 1996, it started discussions about increasing its stake to gain full control.

During 1996, talks began between Flextech and the BBC about a partnership to launch a new range of entertainment channels which had access to the BBC's entire programme library. The deal was signed in March 1997 when the BBC and Flextech unveiled their new venture, which included BBC Showcase, an entertainment channel; BBC Horizon, documentaries; BBC Style, lifestyle; BBC Learning, for schools, and BBC Arena, for the arts, plus three other channels including BBC Sport, BBC Catch-Up, for repeats of popular programmes within days of their original transmission, and a TV version of Radio 1. Initially, it was assumed that the new channels would be BBC-branded but Flextech wanted the channels to have advertisements.  The BBC argued that BBC-branded services in the UK should not carry advertising, and thought that this would undermine the rationale of the license fee in the UK. A compromise was reached when the BBC launch BBC Choice and BBC Learning (later renamed BBC Knowledge shortly before launch) on its own while the remainder of the deal was past to BBC Worldwide controlled 50/50.[tpl]cite news|last=Willcock |first=John |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/flextech-to-inject-pounds-20m-into-bbc-deal-1270994.html |title=Flextech to inject £20m into BBC deal |publisher=The Independent |date=1997-03-04 |accessdate=2013-09-02[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbcworldwide.com/annualreviews/report1998/Channels/page06.htm |title=Annual Review |publisher=BBC Worldwide |accessdate=2013-09-02[/tpl] 
Eventually the concept of the BBC/Flextech channels led the launch of UKTV in September 1997, with BBC Horizon becoming UK Horizons, BBC Style becoming UK Style and BBC Arena becoming UK Arena. Also the concept of a TV version of BBC Radio 1 was reused for the UK Play channel, which launched on October 1998, but became defunct in September 2002 and the concepts of BBC Showcase and BBC Catch-Up was later reused for the channel Watch, which was launched on October 2008. The concept of a dedicated BBC Sport channel never materialised, however, it has been reused when BBC Parliament was temporarily replaced by a dedicated BBC Sport channel in the 2008 Summer Olympics and the 2012 Summer Olympics, plus a range of dedicated BBC Sport channels was launched specifically for the 2012 Summer Olympics, plus there is a BBC Sport interactive channel that is available on Freeview channel 301 as a part of the BBC Red Button service.
Flextech agreed to acquire Minotaur International for around $6.5 million in 1999[tpl]cite news|url=http://variety.com/1999/more/news/flextech-goes-global-with-minotaur-pickup-1117758566/|title=Flextech goes global with Minotaur pickup|accessdate=2007-06-12 | work=Variety | first=Adam | last=Dawtrey | date=3 December 1999[/tpl] Minotaur International was responsible for international sales of most programmes commissioned by the network.

===Telewest/NTL/Virgin (2000–09)===

Flextech continued to expand under Telewest ownership with UKTV continuing to expanded its network of channels with the BBC, plus a new venture which saw a shopping channel come into operation in Autumn 2000. In 2003, Flextech restructured its marketing department with creative solutions put together by central in-house marketers who worked agencies including Banc and Karmarama.  The new marketing strategy was also used as a forerunner for the company's newest channel Ftn which launched in January 2003 on the Freeview platform.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.marketingweek.co.uk/flextech-boss-to-go-in-restructure/2011863.article |title=Flextech boss to go in restructure |publisher=Marketing Week |date=2002-11-28 |accessdate=2013-09-02[/tpl] This was followed by Living TV receiving a new on-screen look and additional channel Living 2 which specialised in reality and entertainment television.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.marketingweek.co.uk/flextech-launches-reality-channel/2024096.article |title=Flextech launches reality channel |publisher=Marketing Week |date=2004-10-07 |accessdate=2013-09-02[/tpl] During the Spring of 2004, United Business Media and RTL, which both held shares in Five, held talks with Flextech about merging the advertising sales teams of Five and Flextech's channels together, but came to nothing.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.marketingweek.co.uk/five-and-flextech-in-talks-to-merge-sales-teams/2028814.article |title=Five and Flextech in talks to merge sales teams |publisher=Marketing Week |date=2004-03-18 |accessdate=2013-09-02[/tpl]
In 2005, Telewest, in preparation for its long-awaited merger with NTL, put Flextech up for sale as the companies agreed "a content provider" had no place within the merged operation. A lot of interest was generated by the sale which included RTL, Hallmark Channel, ITV, Time Warner and Viacom. It become clear the BBC had the right to veto any change in ownership of Flextech's stake in the UKTV joint venture, which lead to further speculation that Flextech's assets may have ended up being split. NTL also complicated matters by stating it would be reluctant to see any of Flextech's channels in the hands of terrestrial broadcasters such as ITV or Five. The underlying fear is that a terrestrial broadcaster could use Flextech to bolster the digital terrestrial platform and its appeal to viewers. Commercial terrestrial players have found that the popularity of Freeview has worked to their advantage, as viewers have fewer channels to choose from than on pay-TV platforms.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.marketingweek.co.uk/will-flextech-be-swallowed-whole-or-in-parts/2017823.article |title=Will Flextech be swallowed whole or in parts? |publisher=Marketing Week |date=2005-07-28 |accessdate=2013-09-02[/tpl]

Media analysis at the time did not believe the sale was genuine, although five other bidders including RTL and ITV did mark an interest.[tpl]cite web|last=Wachman |first=Richard |url=http://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/sep/25/business.citynews |title=Telewest pulls out of plan to sell Flextech |publisher=The Guardian |date=2005-09-25 |accessdate=2013-09-02[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.warc.com/LatestNews/News/BSkyB%20Pulls%20Ahead%20in%20Flextech%20Race.news?ID=18118 |title=BSkyB Pulls Ahead in Flextech Race |publisher=Warc |date=2005-09-20 |accessdate=2013-09-02[/tpl] Simon Duffy, NTL's chief executive, stated "Flextech remains a key focus".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.marketingweek.co.uk/will-ntl/telewests-combined-might-pay-off/2004306.article |title=Will NTL/Telewest's combined might pay off? |publisher=Marketing Week |date=2005-10-06 |accessdate=2013-09-02[/tpl] Shortly afterwards Flextech appointed Jonathan Webb to replace Lisa Opie as managing director; Jonathan Webb was responsible for moving Challenge away from its staple of game shows and axing Bravo's "laddism" strategy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.marketingweek.co.uk/flextech-appoints-new-managing-director/2053726.article |title=Flextech appoints new managing director |publisher=Marketing Week |date=2006-11-02 |accessdate=2013-09-02[/tpl]
In November 2006, NTL:Telewest began rebranding itself as Virgin Media. The group acquired Virgin Mobile in July, but went further by licensing the "Virgin" name, as they believed "Virgin Media would shake up the market by bringing the Virgin traditions of value-for-money, brilliant customer service and innovation to the world of entertainment and communications".[tpl]cite web|last=Allen |first=Katie |url=http://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/nov/08/citynews.digitalmedia |title=NTL rebrands as Virgin Media |publisher=The Guardian |date=2006-11-08 |accessdate=2013-09-02[/tpl] As part of the rebrand, Flextech was also renamed as Richard Branson was keen to move into branded content and insisted that the Flextech business was retained as a condition of NTL buying Virgin Mobile and licensing the name.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.marketingweek.co.uk/ntl-to-launch-tv-channels-after-virgin-media-rebrand/2053922.article |title=NTL to launch TV channels after Virgin Media rebrand |publisher=Marketing Week |date=2006-11-16 |accessdate=2013-09-02[/tpl] On 8 February 2007, Flextech was renamed Virgin Media Television as part of a larger re-branding exercise covering the whole of NTL:Telewest, Virgin Mobile and Virgin.net.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6343341.stm |title=NTL renames itself Virgin Media |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-02-08 |accessdate=2013-09-02[/tpl]

===Sale to BSkyB (2009–11)===

On 7 April 2009, Virgin Media formally began the sale of its content operation, issuing a sales memorandum for its Virgin Media Television unit and its ad sales division, IDS. It excluded its 50% stake in UKTV from the sale. Virgin Media sold its stake in UKTV, by then a portfolio of 10 pay-TV channels including Gold, Dave, Home, Watch, Yesterday and Good Food, in August 2011 to US-owned broadcaster Scripps Networks for £339 million (about $504 million). Scripps was negotiating a deal to give BBC Worldwide the option of increasing its stake to a maximum of 60%, by using a combination of cash and an unspecified "package of digital rights" for UKTV. "The new agreement we are developing will bring benefits to UKTV's audiences in the way they can consume content and will help to sustain UKTV's track record of growth," said BBC Worldwide chief executive John Smith.[tpl]cite web|last=Sweney |first=Mark |url=http://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/aug/15/virgin-sells-uktv-stake-to-scripps-networks |title=Virgin sells UKTV stake to Scripps for £339m |publisher=The Guardian |date=2011-08-15 |accessdate=2013-07-07[/tpl]
On 4 June 2010, British Sky Broadcasting and Virgin Media announced that they had reached an agreement for the acquisition by Sky of Virgin Media Television.[tpl]cite web|url=http://about.virginmedia.com/press-release/417/bskyb-and-virgin-media-reach-agreements-on-sale-of-vmtv-and-channel-distribution |title=BSkyB and Virgin Media reach agreements on sale of VMtv and channel distribution |publisher=Virgin Media |date=2010-06-04 |accessdate=2013-09-02[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://corporate.sky.com/page.aspx?pointerid=6123cbfe61d648e38fb10a1e7a2024e5 |title=BSkyB and Virgin Media Reach Agreements on Sale of VMtv and Channel Distribution |publisher=BSkyB |date=2010-06-04 |accessdate=2013-09-02[/tpl] The companies had, in parallel, agreed to enter into a number of agreements providing for the carriage of certain Sky standard and high-definition (HD) channels. Sky acquired VMtv for a total consideration of up to £160 million in cash, with £105 million paid on completion and the remainder paid following the regulatory process. The acquisition expanded Sky's portfolio of basic pay TV channels and eliminated the carriage fees it previously paid for distributing VMtv channels on its TV services. New carriage agreements secured wholesale distribution of Sky's basic channel line-up, including Sky1 and Sky Arts, and the VMtv channels, on Virgin Media's cable TV service. For an incremental wholesale fee, Virgin Media, for the first time, had the option of carrying any of Sky's basic HD channels, Sky Sports HD 1 and Sky Sports HD 2, and all Sky Movies HD channels. Virgin Media will make available through its on-demand TV service a range of content from Sky's basic and premium channels, including the VMtv channels. Virgin Media also gained access to red button interactive sports coverage and the opportunity to deliver selected standard definition programming over the internet. Sky would assume responsibility for selling advertising for the newly acquired VMtv channels from January 2011. Completion of the agreements was conditional on obtaining merger control clearance in the Republic of Ireland.
Virgin1 was also a part of the deal, but was rebranded as Channel One on 3 September 2010, as the Virgin name was not licensed to Sky.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2010/06/04/virgin-secures-new-sky-carriage-deal-after-vmtv-sale/|title=Virgin secures new Sky carriage deal after VMtv sale|publisher=Broadband TV News|date=2010-06-04[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://licensing.ofcom.org.uk/tv-broadcast-licences/updates/072010|title=Television Broadcast Licensing Update July 2010|publisher=Ofcom|accessdate=3 August 2010[/tpl] Virgin Media's stake in UKTV was not included in the deal.

In completing the acquisition, Sky paid Virgin Media an initial £105 million. Up to an additional £55 million would be paid on UK regulatory clearance.
On 20 July 2010, The Office of Fair Trading announced that they would review BSkyB's acquisition of the Virgin Media Television business to judge whether it posed any competition concerns in the UK.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tech/news/a247293/oft-to-review-skys-vmtv-deal.html|title=OFT to review Sky's VMtv deal|publisher=Digital Spy|date=2010-07-20[/tpl] The OFT planned to investigate the deal to see whether it could constitute a qualifying merger under the Enterprise Act 2002.
