==Career==

Born in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, Wroe came through the youth system of Barnsley and during a match for their academy he was sent off for violent conduct, which resulted in him receiving a three-match ban. He made his first team debut on 3 May 2003 against Wigan Athletic in the Second Division. He signed a new contract with Barnsley in December 2004, which would expire in the summer of 2007. He joined Bury on a one-month loan on 9 February 2007, making his debut in a 4–0 defeat against Wycombe Wanderers in League Two on 17 February. The loan was extended for a second month in March and he finished the spell with five appearances.
He signed for Scottish First Division side Hamilton Academical on a one-match contract in August 2007. He made his debut in a 2–1 defeat against Ayr United in the Challenge Cup, but was released by Hamilton after the game. He signed for York City in the Conference Premier towards the end of the transfer window after playing a match for the reserve side, during which he picked up a knock and so was unable to make his debut against Rushden & Diamonds. He eventually made his debut in a 2–0 defeat to Stevenage Borough on 15 September 2007. He was rested for York's Conference League Cup match against Northwich Victoria in February 2008. He missed the remainder of the 2007–08 season due to a knee problem, with his last game being a 4–0 victory against Stafford Rangers on 8 April 2008. He finished the season with 40 appearances and 10 goals. York manager Colin Walker exercised his option for Wroe's contract to be extended for the 2008–09 season in April 2008, but was transfer listed in May after claiming he did not want to play for the club.
Wroe moved to Conference Premier rivals Torquay United for an undisclosed fee on 28 May 2008. He made his debut in a 1–1 draw with Histon on the opening day of the season, and after starting in two further games he was dropped for the game against Crawley Town to make way for another player. However, he fought his way back into the side and in February 2009 was called up to the England C team for their game against Malta under-21s. He started the game as England won 4–0.[ref]

Wroe joined League Two rivals Shrewsbury Town for an undisclosed fee on 31 January 2011 in a trade deal, with Jake Robinson joining Torquay. He made 44 appearances and scored six goals in the 2011–12 season, as Shrewsbury won promotion to League One as League Two runners-up.
On 16 May 2012, Wroe joined League One side Preston North End on a two-year contract after rejecting a new contract at Shrewsbury.
Wroe joined League Two side Oxford United on loan until the end of the 2013–14 season on 10 January 2014.[tpl]Cite web |title=Oxford United sign Nicky Wroe |url=http://www.oufc.co.uk/news/article/00100114-wroe-signs-1285483.aspx |work=Oxford United FC |date=10 January 2014[/tpl]
