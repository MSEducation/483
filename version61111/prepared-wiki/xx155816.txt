CATEGORIES: Solute carrier family

Citrin also known as solute carrier family 25, member 13 (citrin) or SLC25A13 is a protein which in humans is encoded by the SLC25A13 gene.[tpl]cite journal | author = Kobayashi K, Sinasac DS, Iijima M, Boright AP, Begum L, Lee JR, Yasuda T, Ikeda S, Hirano R, Terazono H, Crackower MA, Kondo I, Tsui LC, Scherer SW, Saheki T | title = The gene mutated in adult-onset type II citrullinaemia encodes a putative mitochondrial carrier protein | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 22 | issue = 2 | pages = 159–63 |date=June 1999 | pmid = 10369257 | doi = 10.1038/9667 | url =  [/tpl]
