CATEGORIES: Neighbourhoods of Barcelona, Sarrià-Sant Gervasi

Vallvidrera is a neighborhood of Vallvidrera, Tibidabo i les Planes of the Sarrià-Sant Gervasi district of Barcelona, Catalonia, in one of the sides of the Collserola hills (Tibidabo being one of those). There are excellent views over the city and the Mediterranean from Vallvidrera, on a clear day it's possible to see the peaks of Mallorca on the horizon. To the north, the snow-capped Pyrenees can often be seen. It used to be a cool summer retreat where wealthy people from Barcelona had their summer houses, now the wealthy live there all year round.
It can be reached by the Funicular de Vallvidrera, a funicular railway that is 736 m. long and goes up for 158 m. (from 192 m. to 350 m. in height over the sea level).  The funicular connects at the bottom with metropolitan railways (FGC, to reach the city center of Barcelona, via the Terrassa / Sabadell  train lines), and at the top it can be combined with a minibus (line 111) to reach the top of the Tibidabo hill. Alternatively, you can walk to Tibidabo in about half an hour, via Norman Foster's telecommunications tower, the Torre de Collserola.
