[[Continent]]

CATEGORIES: Continents

A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. They are generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, with up to seven regions commonly regarded as continents. These are (from largest in size to smallest): Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/places/continents/|title=Continents: What is a Continent?|publisher=National Geographic|archivedate=2009-06-29|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090629180448/http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/places/continents/[/tpl] "Most people recognize seven continents—Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia, from largest to smallest—although sometimes Europe and Asia are considered a single continent, Eurasia."
In geology, continents are described by means of tectonic plates. Plate tectonics is the  process and study of the movement, collision and division  of continents.

==Definitions and application==

Conventionally, "continents are understood to be large, continuous, discrete masses of land, ideally separated by expanses of water."[tpl]cite book|last=Lewis |first=Martin W. |authorlink= |coauthors=Kären E. Wigen |title=The Myth of Continents: a Critique of Metageography |year=1997 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |id=ISBN 0-520-20742-4, ISBN 0-520-20743-2 |page=21 |chapter= |quote= [/tpl]  Many of the seven most commonly recognized continents identified by convention are not discrete landmasses separated by water. The criterion "large" leads to arbitrary classification: Greenland, with a surface area of [tpl]convert|2166086|sqkm[/tpl] is considered the world's largest island, while Australia, at [tpl]convert|7617930|sqkm[/tpl] is deemed a continent. Likewise, the ideal criterion that each be a continuous landmass is often disregarded by the inclusion of the continental shelf and oceanic islands, and contradicted by classifying North and South America as two continents; and/or Eurasia and Africa as two continents, with no natural separation by water. This anomaly reaches its extreme if the continuous land mass of Europe and Asia is considered to constitute two continents. The Earth's major landmasses are washed upon by a single, continuous world ocean, which is divided into a number of principal oceanic components by the continents and various geographic criteria."Ocean".

Retrieved 20 February 2007. Continents are sometimes extended beyond the major landmasses, in a way that every bit of land on earth is included in a continent.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/continent|title=Definition of a continent in Miriam-Webster Dictionary|publisher=Miriam Webster|accessdate=2013-03-08[/tpl] "one of the six or seven great divisions of land on the globe"

===Extent of continents===

The narrowest meaning of continent is that of a continuous"continent n. 5. a." (1989) Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd edition. Oxford University Press ; "continent1 n." (2006) The Concise Oxford English Dictionary, 11th edition revised. (Ed.) Catherine Soanes and Angus Stevenson. Oxford University Press; "continent1 n." (2005) The New Oxford American Dictionary, 2nd edition. (Ed.) Erin McKean. Oxford University Press; "continent n 4 a" (1996) Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged. ProQuest Information and Learning ; "continent" (2007) Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved 14 January 2007, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online. area of land or mainland, with the coastline and any land boundaries forming the edge of the continent. In this sense the term continental Europe (sometimes "the Continent") is used to refer to mainland Europe, excluding islands such as Great Britain, Ireland, and Iceland, and the term continent of Australia may refer to the mainland of Australia, excluding Tasmania and New Guinea. Similarly, the continental United States refers to the 48 contiguous states in central North America and may include Alaska in the northwest of the continent (the two being separated by Canada), while excluding Hawaii in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.
From the perspective of geology or physical geography, continent may be extended beyond the confines of continuous dry land to include the shallow, submerged adjacent area (the continental shelf)"continent n 6" (1996) Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged. ProQuest Information and Learning. "a large segment of the earth's outer shell including a terrestrial continent and the adjacent continental shelf" and the islands on the shelf (continental islands), as they are structurally part of the continent.[tpl]cite book |last=Monkhouse |first=F. J. |coauthors=John Small |title=A Dictionary of the Natural Environment |year=1978 |publisher=Edward Arnold |location=London |id= |pages= 67–68 |quote=structurally it includes shallowly submerged adjacent areas (continental shelf) and neighbouring islands [/tpl] From this perspective the edge of the continental shelf is the true edge of the continent, as shorelines vary with changes in sea level.Ollier, Cliff D. (1996). Planet Earth. In Ian Douglas (Ed.), Companion Encyclopedia of Geography: The Environment and Humankind. London: Routledge, p. 30. "Ocean waters extend onto continental rocks at continental shelves, and the true edges of the continents are the steeper continental slopes. The actual shorelines are rather accidental, depending on the height of sea-level on the sloping shelves." In this sense the islands of Great Britain and Ireland are part of Europe, while Australia and the island of New Guinea together form a continent.
As a cultural construct, the concept of a continent may go beyond the continental shelf to include oceanic islands and continental fragments. In this way, Iceland is considered part of Europe and Madagascar part of Africa. Extrapolating the concept to its extreme, some geographers group the Australasian continental plate with other islands in the Pacific into one continent called Oceania. This divides the entire land surface of the Earth into continents or quasi-continents.[tpl]cite book |last=Lewis |first=Martin W. |authorlink= |coauthors=Kären E.

===Separation of continents===

The ideal criterion that each continent be a discrete landmass is commonly disregarded in favor of more arbitrary, historical conventions. Of the seven most commonly recognized continents, only Antarctica and Australia are completely separated from other continents.
Several continents are defined not as absolutely distinct bodies but as "more or less discrete masses of land".[tpl]cite book |last=Lewis |first=Martin W. |authorlink= |coauthors=Kären E. Wigen |title=The Myth of Continents: a Critique of Metageography |year=1997 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |id=ISBN 0-520-20742-4, ISBN 0-520-20743-2 |page=35 |chapter= |quote= [/tpl]  Asia and Africa are joined by the Isthmus of Suez, and North and South America by the Isthmus of Panama. Both these isthmuses are very narrow compared to the bulk of the landmasses they join, and both are transected by artificial canals (the Suez and Panama canals), which provide maritime passage across these landmasses.
The traditional division of the landmass of Eurasia into the continents of Asia and Europe is an anomaly, as no sea separates them. The alternative view—in geology and geography—that Eurasia is a single continent results in a six-continent view of the world. Some view separation of Eurasia into Europe and Asia as a residue of Eurocentrism: "In physical, cultural and historical diversity, China and India are comparable to the entire European landmass, not to a single European country. A better (if still imperfect) analogy would compare France, not to India as a whole, but to a single Indian state, such as Uttar Pradesh."[tpl]cite book |last=Lewis |first=Martin W. |authorlink= |coauthors=Kären E. Wigen |title=The Myth of Continents: a Critique of Metageography |year=1997 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |id=ISBN 0-520-20742-4, ISBN 0-520-20743-2 |pages=? |chapter= |quote= [/tpl][tpl]Clarify|date=November 2009[/tpl] However, for historical and cultural reasons, the view of Europe as a separate continent continues in several categorizations.
North America and South America are treated as separate continents in the seven-continent model. However, they may also be viewed as a single continent known as America. This viewpoint was common in the United States until World War II, and remains prevalent in some Asian six-continent models.[tpl]cite book |last=Lewis |first=Martin W. |authorlink= |coauthors=Kären E. Wigen |title=The Myth of Continents: a Critique of Metageography |year=1997 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |id=ISBN 0-520-20742-4, ISBN 0-520-20743-2 |pages= |chapter=1 |quote=While it might seem surprising to find North and South America still joined into a single continent in a book published in the United States in 1937, such a notion remained fairly common until World War II. ... By the 1950s, however, virtually all American geographers had come to insist that the visually distinct landmasses of North and South America deserved separate designations.[/tpl] This remains the more common vision in Latin American countries, Spain, Portugal, France, Italy and Greece, where they are taught as a single continent. This use is shown in names such as the Organization of American States. From the 19th century some people used the term "Americas" to avoid ambiguity with the United States of America.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]
When continents are defined as discrete landmasses, embracing all the contiguous land of a body, then Asia, Europe and Africa form a single continent known by various names such as Afro-Eurasia. This produces a four-continent model consisting of Afro-Eurasia, America, Antarctica and Australia.
When sea levels were lower during the Pleistocene ice age, greater areas of continental shelf were exposed as dry land, forming land bridges. At this time Australia-New Guinea was a single, continuous continent. Likewise the Americas and Afro-Eurasia were joined by the Bering land bridge. Other islands such as Great Britain were joined to the mainlands of their continents. At that time there were just three discrete continents: Afro-Eurasia-America, Antarctica, and Australia-New Guinea.

===Number of continents===

There are numerous ways of distinguishing the continents:

Using this latter model as a starting point, the International Olympic Committee uses only inhabited continents (excluding Antarctica) and thus a five-continent model as depicted in the Olympic logo.The Olympic symbols. International Olympic Committee. 2002. Lausanne: Olympic Museum and Studies Centre. The five rings of the Olympic logo represent the five inhabited, participating continents  (Africa, America, Asia, Europe, and Oceania); thus, Antarctica is excluded from the flag. Also see Association of National Olympic Committees: http://www.acnoa.info/ http://www.ocasia.org/ http://www.eurolympic.org/ http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/int@paso.html http://www.oceaniasport.com/
The terms Oceania or Australasia are sometimes substituted for Australia to denote a region encompassing the Australian continent and various islands in the Pacific Ocean that are not included in the seven-continent model. For example, the Atlas of Canada names Oceania, as does the model taught in Italy, Greece and in Ibero-America (Spain, Portugal, Brazil and Hispanic America).

==Area and population==

The following table summarises  area and population of each continent using the seven continent model, sorted by decreasing area."Total Population – Both Sexes". World Population Prospects, the 2010 Revision. United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs. 28 June 2011. Retrieved 24 October 2011. (Per linked individual article definitions, North America includes UN population estimates for North America, Central America and Caribbean; Australia includes Australia and Papua New Guinea.)
The total land area of all continents is [tpl]convert|148647000|sqkm[/tpl], or 29.1% of earth's surface ([tpl]convert|510065600|sqkm|abbr=on|disp=or[/tpl]).
A rough estimate of the total population of all the continents is 7,000,000,000.

==Highest and lowest points==

The following table lists the seven continents with their highest and lowest points on land, sorted in decreasing highest points.
† The lowest exposed points are given for North America and Antarctica. The lowest non-submarine bedrock elevations in these continents are the trough beneath Jakobshavn Glacier ([tpl]convert|-1512|m[/tpl]Plummer, Joel. Jakobshavn Bed Elevation, Center for the Remote Sensing of the Ice Sheets, Dept of Geography, University of Kansas.) and Bentley Subglacial Trench ([tpl]convert|-2540|m[/tpl]), but these are covered by kilometers of ice.
Some sources list the Kuma–Manych Depression (a remnant of the Paratethys) as the geological border between Europe and Asia. This would place the Caucasus outside of Europe, thus making Mont Blanc (elevation 4810 m) in the Graian Alps the highest point in Europe - the lowest point would still be the shore of the Caspian Sea.

==Other divisions==

Aside from the conventionally known continents, the scope and meaning of the term continent varies.  Supercontinents, largely in evidence earlier in the geological record, are landmasses that comprise more than one craton or continental core.  These have included Laurasia, Gondwana, Vaalbara, Kenorland, Columbia, Rodinia, and Pangaea.
Certain parts of continents are recognized as subcontinents, particularly those on different tectonic plates from the rest of the continent. The most notable examples are the Indian subcontinent and the Arabian Peninsula. Greenland, generally reckoned as the world's largest island on the northeastern periphery of the North American Plate, is sometimes referred to as a subcontinent.  Where the Americas are viewed as a single continent (America), it is divided into two subcontinents (North America and South America)English map of 1770 by JongheDPD: AméricaDicionário da língua portuguesa: Contiente or various regions.In Ibero-America, North America usually designates a region (subcontinente in Spanish) of the Americas containing Canada, the U.S., and Mexico, and often Greenland, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, and Bermuda; the land bridge of Central America is generally considered a subregion of North America.Norteamérica (Mexican version)/(Spaniard version).  Encarta Online Encyclopedia.. Archived 2009-10-31.
Some areas of continental crust are largely covered by the sea and may be considered submerged continents. Notable examples are Zealandia, emerging from the sea primarily in New Zealand and New Caledonia, and the almost completely submerged Kerguelen continent in the southern Indian Ocean.
Some islands lie on sections of continental crust that have rifted and drifted apart from a main continental landmass. While not considered continents because of their relatively small size, they may be considered microcontinents. Madagascar, the largest example, is usually considered an island of Africa but has been referred to as "the eighth continent" from a biological perspective.[tpl]Cite book | last1 = Hillstrom | first1 = Kevin | last2 = Collier Hillstrom | first2 =Laurie | title = Africa and the Middle East: a continental overview of environmental issues | publisher = ABC-CLIO | location = Santa Barbara, CA | year = 2003 | page = 50 | isbn = 978-1-57607-688-0 |url = http://books.google.com/books?id=XxIk9zTm_e8C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl]

==History of the concept==

===Early concepts of the Old World continents===

The first distinction between continents was made by ancient Greek mariners who gave the names Europe and Asia to the lands on either side of the waterways of the Aegean Sea, the Dardanelles strait, the Sea of Marmara, the Bosporus strait and the Black Sea.Toynbee, Arnold J. (1954). A Study of History. London: Oxford University Press, v. 8, pp. 711-12. The names were first applied just to lands near the coast and only later extended to include the hinterlands.[tpl]cite book |last=Tozer |first=H. F. |title=A History of Ancient Geography |year=1897 |publisher=University Press |location=Cambridge |page= 69[/tpl] But the division was only carried through to the end of navigable waterways and "... beyond that point the Hellenic geographers never succeeded in laying their finger on any inland feature in the physical landscape that could offer any convincing line for partitioning an indivisible Eurasia ..."
Ancient Greek thinkers subsequently debated whether Africa (then called Libya) should be considered part of Asia or a third part of the world. Division into three parts eventually came to predominate.[tpl]cite book |last=Tozer |first=H. F. |title=A History of Ancient Geography |year=1897 |publisher=University Press |location=Cambridge |page= 67[/tpl] From the Greek viewpoint, the Aegean Sea was the center of the world; Asia lay to the east, Europe to the west and north and Africa to the south.[tpl]cite book |last=Lewis |first=Martin W. |authorlink= |coauthors=Kären E. Wigen |title=The Myth of Continents: a Critique of Metageography |year=1997 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |id=ISBN 0-520-20742-4, ISBN 0-520-20743-2 |pages=21–22 |chapter= |quote = [/tpl] The boundaries between the continents were not fixed. Early on, the Europe–Asia boundary was taken to run from the Black Sea along the Rioni River (known then as the Phasis) in Georgia. Later it was viewed as running from the Black Sea through Kerch Strait, the Sea of Azov and along the Don River (known then as the Tanais) in Russia.[tpl]cite book |last=Tozer |first=H. F. |title=A History of Ancient Geography |year=1897 |publisher=University Press |location=Cambridge |page= 68[/tpl] The boundary between Asia and Africa was generally taken to be the Nile River.

Ames, Iowa: Omphaloskepsis, book 2, p. 18. in the 5th century BC, however, objected to the unity of Egypt being split into Asia and Africa ("Libya") and took the boundary to lie along the western border of Egypt, regarding Egypt as part of Asia. He also questioned the division into three of what is really a single landmass,Herodotus. Translated by George Rawlinson (2000).

"I cannot conceive why three names ... should ever have been given to a tract which is in reality one," a debate that continues nearly two and a half millennia later.
Eratosthenes, in the 3rd century BC, noted that some geographers divided the continents by rivers (the Nile and the Don), thus considering them "islands". Others divided the continents by isthmuses, calling the continents "peninsulas". These latter geographers set the border between Europe and Asia at the isthmus between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, and the border between Asia and Africa at the isthmus between the Red Sea and the mouth of Lake Bardawil on the Mediterranean Sea.Strabo. Translated by Horace Leonard Jones (1917). Geography.http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/ Harvard University Press, book 1, ch. 4.http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/1D*.html
Through the Roman period and the Middle Ages, a few writers took the Isthmus of Suez as the boundary between Asia and Africa, but most writers continued to consider it the Nile or the western border of Egypt (Gibbon). In the Middle Ages, the world was usually portrayed on T and O maps, with the T representing the waters dividing the three continents. By the middle of the 18th century, "the fashion of dividing Asia and Africa at the Nile, or at the Great Catabathmus boundary between Egypt and Libya farther west, had even then scarcely passed away".Goddard, Farley Brewer (1884). "Researches in the Cyrenaica". The American Journal of Philology, 5 (1) p. 38.

===European arrival in the Americas===

Christopher Columbus sailed across the Atlantic Ocean to the West Indies in 1492, sparking a period of European exploration of the Americas. But despite four voyages to the Americas, Columbus never believed he had reached a new continent—he always thought it was part of Asia.
In 1501, Amerigo Vespucci and Gonçalo Coelho attempted to sail around what they considered the southern end of the Asian mainland into the Indian Ocean, passing through Fernando de Noronha. After reaching the coast of Brazil, they sailed a long way further south along the coast of South America, confirming that this was a land of continental proportions and that it also extended much further south than Asia was known to.[tpl]cite book | last = O'Gorman | first = Edmundo | authorlink = Edmundo O'Gorman | title = The Invention of America | publisher = Indiana University Press | year=  1961 | pages = 106–112[/tpl] On return to Europe, an account of the voyage, called Mundus Novus ("New World"), was published under Vespucci’s name in 1502 or 1503,Formisano, Luciano (Ed.) (1992). Letters from a New World: Amerigo Vespucci's Discovery of America. New York: Marsilio, pp. xx-xxi. ISBN 0-941419-62-2. although it seems that it had additions or alterations by another writer.Zerubavel, Eviatar (2003). Terra Cognita: The Mental Discovery of America. New Brunswick: Transaction Publishers, pp. 77–79. ISBN 0-7658-0987-7. Regardless of who penned the words, Mundus Novus credited Vespucci with saying, "I have discovered a continent in those southern regions that is inhabited by more numerous people and animals than our Europe, or Asia or Africa",Formisano, Luciano (Ed.) (1992). Letters from a New World: Amerigo Vespucci's Discovery of America. New York: Marsilio, p. 45. ISBN 0-941419-62-2. the first known explicit identification of part of the Americas as a continent like the other three.
Within a few years the name "New World" began appearing as a name for South America on world maps, such as the Oliveriana (Pesaro) map of around 1504–1505. Maps of this time though, still showed North America connected to Asia and showed South America as a separate land.
In 1507 Martin Waldseemüller published a world map, Universalis Cosmographia, which was the first to show North and South America as separate from Asia and surrounded by water. A small inset map above the main map explicitly showed for the first time the Americas being east of Asia and separated from Asia by an ocean, as opposed to just placing the Americas on the left end of the map and Asia on the right end. In the accompanying book Cosmographiae Introductio, Waldseemüller noted that the earth is divided into four parts, Europe, Asia, Africa and the fourth part, which he named "America" after Amerigo Vespucci's first name.Zerubavel, Eviatar (2003). Terra Cognita: The Mental Discovery of America. New Brunswick: Transaction Publishers, pp. 80–82. ISBN 0-7658-0987-7. On the map, the word "America" was placed on part of South America.

===The word continent===

From the 16th century the English noun continent was derived from the term continent land, meaning continuous or connected land"continent n." (1989) Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd edition. Oxford University Press. and translated from the Latin terra continens."continent1 n." (2006) The Concise Oxford English Dictionary, 11th edition revised. (Ed.) Catherine Soanes and Angus Stevenson. Oxford University Press. The noun was used to mean "a connected or continuous tract of land" or mainland. It was not applied only to very large areas of land—in the 17th century, references were made to the continents (or mainlands) of Isle of Man, Ireland and Wales and in 1745 to Sumatra. The word continent was used in translating Greek and Latin writings about the three "parts" of the world, although in the original languages no word of exactly the same meaning as continent was used.[tpl]cite book |last=Lewis |first=Martin W. |authorlink= |coauthors=Kären E. Wigen |title=The Myth of Continents: a Critique of Metageography |year=1997 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |id=ISBN 0-520-20742-4, ISBN 0-520-20743-2 |page=29 |chapter= |quote= [/tpl]
While continent was used on the one hand for relatively small areas of continuous land, on the other hand geographers again raised Herodotus’s query about why a single large landmass should be divided into separate continents. In the mid 17th century Peter Heylin wrote in his Cosmographie that "A Continent is a great quantity of Land, not separated by any Sea from the rest of the World, as the whole Continent of Europe, Asia, Africa." In 1727 Ephraim Chambers wrote in his Cyclopædia, "The world is ordinarily divided into two grand continents: the old and the new." And in his 1752 atlas, Emanuel Bowen defined a continent as "a large space of dry land comprehending many countries all joined together, without any separation by water. Thus Europe, Asia, and Africa is one great continent, as America is another."Bowen, Emanuel. (1752). A Complete Atlas, or Distinct View of the Known World. London, p. 3. However, the old idea of Europe, Asia and Africa as "parts" of the world ultimately persisted with these being regarded as separate continents.

===Beyond four continents===

From the late 18th century some geographers started to regard North America and South America as two parts of the world, making five parts in total. Overall though the fourfold division prevailed well into the 19th century.[tpl]cite book |last=Lewis |first=Martin W. |authorlink= |coauthors=Kären E.

Europeans discovered Australia in 1606 but for some time it was taken as part of Asia. By the late 18th century some geographers considered it a continent in its own right, making it the sixth (or fifth for those still taking America as a single continent). In 1813 Samuel Butler wrote of Australia as "New Holland, an immense island, which some geographers dignify with the appellation of another continent" and the Oxford English Dictionary was just as equivocal some decades later."continent n. 5. a." (1989) Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd edition. Oxford University Press. "the great island of Australia is sometimes reckoned as another continent"
Antarctica was sighted in 1820 and described as a continent by Charles Wilkes on the United States Exploring Expedition in 1838, the last continent identified, although a great "Antarctic" (antipodean) landmass had been anticipated for millennia. An 1849 atlas labelled Antarctica as a continent but few atlases did so until after World War II.[tpl]cite book |last=Lewis |first=Martin W. |authorlink= |coauthors=Kären E.

From the mid-19th century, atlases published in the United States more commonly treated North and South America as separate continents, while atlases published in Europe usually considered them one continent. However, it was still not uncommon for American atlases to treat them as one continent up until World War II.[tpl]cite book |last=Lewis |first=Martin W. |authorlink= |coauthors=Kären E.

From the 1950s, most U.S. geographers divided the Americas into two continents. With the addition of Antarctica, this made the seven-continent model. However, this division of the Americas never appealed to Latin Americans, who saw their region spanning an [tpl]lang|es|América[/tpl] as a single landmass, and there the conception of six continents remains, as it does in scattered other countries.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl]
Some geographers regard Europe and Asia together as a single continent, dubbed Eurasia.Some geographers list only six continents, combining Europe and Asia into Eurasia. In parts of the world, students learn that there are just five continents: Eurasia, Australia, Africa, Antarctica, and the Americas.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/faq/geography.html#continents|title=How many continents are there?|publisher=National Geographic Society|accessdate=2010-09-26[/tpl] In this model, the world is divided into six continents, with North America and South America considered separate continents.

==Geology==

Geologists use the term continent in a different manner from geographers, where a continent is defined by continental crust: a platform of metamorphic and igneous rock, largely of granitic composition. Some geologists restrict the term 'continent' to portions of the crust built around stable Precambrian "shield", typically 1.5 to 3.8 billion years old, called a craton. The craton itself is an accretionary complex of ancient mobile belts (mountain belts) from earlier cycles of subduction, continental collision and break-up from plate tectonic activity. An outward-thickening veneer of younger, minimally deformed sedimentary rock covers much of the craton. The margins of geologic continents are characterized by currently active or relatively recently active mobile belts and deep troughs of accumulated marine or deltaic sediments. Beyond the margin, there is either a continental shelf and drop off to the basaltic ocean basin or the margin of another continent, depending on the current plate-tectonic setting of the continent. A continental boundary does not have to be a body of water. Over geologic time, continents are periodically submerged under large epicontinental seas, and continental collisions result in a continent becoming attached to another continent. The current geologic era is relatively anomalous in that so much of the continental areas are "high and dry" compared to much of geologic history.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2012[/tpl]
Some argue that continents are accretionary crustal "rafts" that, unlike the denser basaltic crust of the ocean basins, are not subjected to destruction through the plate tectonic process of subduction. This accounts for the great age of the rocks comprising the continental cratons. By this definition, Eastern Europe, India and some other regions could be regarded as continental masses distinct from the rest of Eurasia because they have separate ancient shield areas (i.e. East European craton and Indian craton). Younger mobile belts (such as the Ural Mountains and Himalayas) mark the boundaries between these regions and the rest of Eurasia.
There are many microcontinents, or continental fragments, that are built of continental crust but do not contain a craton. Some of these are fragments of Gondwana or other ancient cratonic continents: Zealandia, which includes New Zealand and New Caledonia; Madagascar; the northern Mascarene Plateau, which includes the Seychelles. Other islands, such as several in the Caribbean Sea, are composed largely of granitic rock as well, but all continents contain both granitic and basaltic crust, and there is no clear boundary as to which islands would be considered microcontinents under such a definition. The Kerguelen Plateau, for example, is largely volcanic, but is associated with the breakup of Gondwanaland and is considered a microcontinent,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.utexas.edu/opa/news/99newsreleases/nr_199905/nr_continent990528.html |title=UT Austin scientist plays major rule in study of underwater "micro-continent" |publisher=Utexas.edu |accessdate=2012-08-26[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/353277.stm |title=Sci/Tech | 'Lost continent' discovered |publisher=BBC News |date=1999-05-27 |accessdate=2012-08-26[/tpl] whereas volcanic Iceland and Hawaii are not. The British Isles, Sri Lanka, Borneo, and Newfoundland are margins of the Laurasian continent—only separated by inland seas flooding its margins.
Plate tectonics offers yet another way of defining continents. Today, Europe and most of Asia constitute the unified Eurasian Plate, which is approximately coincident with the geographic Eurasian continent excluding India, Arabia, and far eastern Russia. India contains a central shield, and the geologically recent Himalaya mobile belt forms its northern margin. North America and South America are separate continents, the connecting isthmus being largely the result of volcanism from relatively recent subduction tectonics. North American continental rocks extend to Greenland (a portion of the Canadian Shield), and in terms of plate boundaries, the North American plate includes the easternmost portion of the Asian land mass. Geologists do not use these facts to suggest that eastern Asia is part of the North American continent, even though the plate boundary extends there; the word continent is usually used in its geographic sense and additional definitions ("continental rocks," "plate boundaries") are used as appropriate.
The movement of plates has caused the formation and break-up of continents over time, including occasional formation of a supercontinent that contains most or all of the continents. The supercontinent Columbia or Nuna formed during a period of 2.0–1.8 billion years and broke up about 1.5–1.3 billion years ago.[tpl]Cite journal |first=Guochun |last=Zhao |coauthors = Cawood, Peter A.; Wilde, Simon A.; Sun, M. |date=November 2002 |title=Review of global 2.1–1.8 Ga orogens: implications for a pre-Rodinia supercontinent |journal=Earth-Science Reviews |volume=59 |pages=125–162 |accessdate=2013-01-07 |doi=10.1016/S0012-8252(02)00073-9 |bibcode=2002ESRv...59..125Z|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825202000739[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal |first=Guochun |last=Zhao |coauthors=Sun, M.; Wilde, Simon A.; Li, S.Z. |date=November 2004 |title=A Paleo-Mesoproterozoic supercontinent: assembly, growth and breakup |journal=Earth-Science Reviews |volume=67 |pages=91–123 |accessdate=2013-01-08 |doi=10.1016/j.earscirev.2004.02.003 |bibcode=2004ESRv...67...91Z|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825204000182[/tpl] The supercontinent Rodinia is thought to have formed about 1 billion years ago and to have embodied most or all of Earth's continents, and broken up into eight continents around 600 million years ago. The eight continents later re-assembled into another supercontinent called Pangaea; Pangaea broke up into Laurasia (which became North America and Eurasia) and Gondwana (which became the remaining continents).
