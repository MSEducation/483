Virginia Eriksdotter (1 January 1559, Kalmar Castle – 1633), was a Swedish noble. She was the recognized illegitimate daughter of King Erik XIV of Sweden and Agda Persdotter.
In 1560, her father became king, and in 1561, she and her sister Constantia Eriksdotter were placed under the responsibility of Princess Cecilia of Sweden, and after 1564 Princess Elizabeth of Sweden. Karin Månsdotter belonged to their staff from 1565, and became their stepmother in 1568. In 1566, her father suggested that she marry Tsarevich Ivan Ivanovich of Russia, but Virginia refused, and nothing came of the plans. Her father was deposed by her uncle in 1568. In 1585, she was granted estates in Västergötland by her uncle king John III of Sweden. In 1586, she herself chose to marry the noble Håkan Knutsson Hand, governor of Kronoberg Castle. In 1589, she was granted further estates by Charles IX of Sweden.
