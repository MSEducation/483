Ardencaple Castle, also known as Ardincaple Castle, and sometimes referred to as Ardencaple Castle Light, is a listed building, situated about [tpl]convert|1|smi|km[/tpl] from Helensburgh, Argyll and Bute, Scotland.[tpl]cite book|author=Black, Adam; Black, Charles|title=Black's Picturesque Tourist of Scotland|year=1861|edition=15th edition|publisher=Adam and Charles Black|location=Edinburgh|page=440[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/index/heritage/historicandlistedbuildings/listedbuildingsresults.htm?p_out=xml&p_all=ardencaple&p_couname=0&p_parbur=0|title=Historic & listed buildings|accessdate=2008-05-08|work=Historic Scotland (historic-scotland.gov.uk)[/tpl] Today, all that remains of the castle is a tower, perched on the edge of a plateau, looking down on a flat tract of land between it and the shore of the Firth of Clyde.[tpl]cite book|author=Argyll, John Douglas Sutherland Campbell, Duke of|title=Passages from the past|url=http://www.archive.org/details/passagesfrompast01argyuoft|volume=1|year=1907|publisher=Hutchinson |location=London|pages=185|authorlink=John Campbell, 9th Duke of Argyll[/tpl] The original castle was thought to have been built sometime in the 12th century,[tpl]cite book|title=The New Statistical Account of Scotland|accessdate=2008-04-03|volume=8|pages=73–75|chapter=Parish of Row|chapterurl=http://stat-acc-scot.edina.ac.uk/link/1834-45/StAS.2.8.1.M.Dumbarton.Contents_and_Misc%0ADumbarton/Row/8/65/[/tpl] and part of the remains of the original castle were said to have existed in the 19th century.

==Lairds of Ardincaple==

The word Ardencaple or Ardincaple has been said to be derived from the Gaelic Ard na gCapull, meaning "cape of the horses", or "of the mares", or "height of the horses".[tpl]cite book|author=Newton, Michael|title=Bho Chluaidh Gu Calasraid: From the Clyde to Callander|publisher=Acair|location=Stornoway|year=1996|isbn=0-86152-265-6|page=143[/tpl] In 1351 this place name was recorded as Airdendgappil.[tpl]cite book|title=The History of the Celtic Place-names of Scotland|author=Watson, William John|year=1926|publisher=W. Blackwood & Sons|pages=241|authorlink=William J. Watson[/tpl] From the Middle Ages the lands of Ardencaple were controlled by the Lairds of Ardincaple. By the late 15th century or 16th century the lairds had adopted the surname MacAulay. By this time the Laird of Ardincaple was considered the clan chief of Clan MacAulay.
The fortunes of the Lairds of Ardincaple failed in the 18th century. These chiefs of Clan MacAulay were forced to divide and sell, piece by piece, the lands once governed by former lairds of Ardincaple. In the 1740s,[tpl]cite book|author=Cook, Barbara Collier; Cook, James Wyatt|title=Man-Midwife, Male Feminist: The Life and Times of George Macaulay, M.D., PH.

In about 1767,[tpl]cite book|last=Irving|first=Joseph|title=The Book of Dumbartonshire|volume=2|year=1879|publisher=W. and A. K.

==Modern era and destruction of the castle==

In 1923, Sir Iain Colquhoun sold the castle to Mrs. H. Macaulay-Stromberg,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.clanmacaulay.org.uk/Heritage/Ardencapel/Ardencaple.html|title=Ardencaple|accessdate=2008-05-09|work=Clan MacAulay Association in Scotland (clanmacaulay.org.uk)|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070806064449/http://www.clanmacaulay.org.uk/Heritage/Ardencapel/Ardencaple.html|archivedate=2007-08-06[/tpl] a wealthy American, who restored the castle and lived there until her death, in 1931.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.macaulay.org/Ardencaple.htm|title=Ardencaple Castle|accessdate=2007-08-19|work=Clan Macaulay USA (macaulay.org)| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070928185931/http://www.macaulay.org/Ardencaple.htm| archivedate= 28 September 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] The castle then passed to Adelaide Parker Voorheis until 1935, when it passed to a consortium of developers who had constructed, in 1936-1937 a housing estate on what used to be the Tower Lawn. The castle then was requisitioned by the Royal Navy with the outbreak of World War II.
In 1957 most of the castle was demolished by the government in order to build naval housing for the nearby HMNB Clyde (Faslane Naval Base), though one tower was left to be used as a mount for navigational beacons and transit lights for the Royal Navy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stayatlochlomond.com/article/helensburgh-history/|title=The History of Helensburgh|accessdate=2008-05-09|work=Loch Lomond B&B and Loch Lomond Self-Catering Accommodation (stayatlochlomond.com)| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080510143015/http://www.stayatlochlomond.com/article/helensburgh-history/| archivedate= 10 May 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]  From then on, the [tpl]convert|45|ft|m|0|adj=on[/tpl] high tower was known as "Ardencaple Castle Range Rear Light", and had two green lights mounted on its south-west corner.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lighthousedepot.com/database/uniquelighthouse.cfm?value=4211|title=Ardencaple Castle Light|accessdate=2007-08-02|work=Lighthouse Depot (lighthousedepot.com)| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070828175128/http://www.lighthousedepot.com/database/uniquelighthouse.cfm?value=4211| archivedate= 28 August 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Ardencaple Castle has been considered a Category B listed building since May 14, 1971. Today, all that remains of the grand turreted mansion is one solitary tower.
