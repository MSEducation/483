In microeconomic theory, an indifference curve is a graph showing different bundles of goods between which a consumer is indifferent. That is, at each point on the curve, the consumer has no preference for one bundle over another. One can equivalently refer to each point on the indifference curve as rendering the same level of utility (satisfaction) for the consumer. In other words an indifference curve is the locus of various points showing different combinations of two goods providing equal utility to the consumer. Utility is then a device to represent preferences rather than something from which preferences come.Geanakoplis (1987), p. 117. The main use of indifference curves is in the representation of potentially observable demand patterns for individual consumers over commodity bundles.Böhm and Haller (1987), p. 785.
There are infinitely many indifference curves: one passes through each combination. A collection of (selected) indifference curves, illustrated graphically, is referred to as an indifference map.

==History==

The theory of indifference curves was developed by Francis Ysidro Edgeworth, who explained in his book "Mathematical Psychics: an Essay on the Application of Mathematics to the Moral Sciences,” 1881,http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/book/lookupid?key=olbp34052 the mathematics needed for its drawing; later on, Vilfredo Pareto was the first author to actually draw these curves, in his book "Manual of Political Economy," 1906;http://archive.org/details/manualedieconomi00pareuofthttp://www.policonomics.com/indifference-curves/ and others in the first part of the 20th century. The theory can be derived from William Stanley Jevons's ordinal utility theory, which posits that individuals can always rank any consumption bundles by order of preference.http://www.policonomics.com/william-stanley-jevons/

==Map and properties of indifference curves==

A graph of indifference curves for an individual consumer associated with different utility levels is called an indifference map. Points yielding different utility levels are each associated with distinct indifference curves and these indifference curves on the indifference map are like contour lines on a topographical map. Each point on the curve represents the same elevation. If you move "off" an indifference curve traveling in a northeast direction (assuming positive marginal utility for the goods) you are essentially climbing a mound of utility. The higher you go the greater the level of utility. The non-satiation requirement means that you will never reach the "top," or a "bliss point," a consumption bundle that is preferred to all others
Indifference curves are typically represented to be:
The negative slope of the indifference curve implies that the marginal rate of substitution is always positive;

==Assumptions of consumer preference theory==

It also implies that the commodities are good rather than bad. Examples of bad commodities can be disease, pollution etc. because we always desire less of such things.

===Application===

Consumer theory uses indifference curves and budget constraints to generate consumer demand curves. For a single consumer, this is a relatively simple process. First, let one good be an example market e.g., carrots, and let the other be a composite of all other goods. Budget constraints give a straight line on the indifference map showing all the possible distributions between the two goods; the point of maximum utility is then the point at which an indifference curve is tangent to the budget line (illustrated). This follows from common sense: if the market values a good more than the household, the household will sell it; if the market values a good less than the household, the household will buy it. The process then continues until the market's and household's marginal rates of substitution are equal.Lipsey (1975). pp. 182-186. Now, if the price of carrots were to change, and the price of all other goods were to remain constant, the gradient of the budget line would also change, leading to a different point of tangency and a different quantity demanded. These price / quantity combinations can then be used to deduce a full demand curve. A line connecting all points of tangency between the indifference curve and the budget constraint is called the expansion path.Salvatore, Dominick (1989).

The different shapes of the curves imply different responses to a change in price as shown from demand analysis in consumer theory. The results will only be stated here. A price-budget-line change that kept a consumer in  equilibrium on the same indifference curve:

==Preference relations and utility==

Choice theory formally represents consumers by a preference relation, and use this representation to derive indifference curves showing combinations of equal preference to the consumer.

These examples might be useful for modelling individual or aggregate demand.

====Biology====

As used in Biology, the indifference curve is a model for how animals 'decide' whether to perform a particular behavior, based on changes in two variables which can increase in intensity, one along the x-axis and the other along the y-axis.  For example, the x-axis may measure the quantity of food available while the y-axis measures the risk involved in obtaining it.   The indifference curve is drawn to predict the animal's behavior at various levels of risk and food availability.
