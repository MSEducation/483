[[Religious clothing]]

CATEGORIES: Religious vesture

Religious clothing is dress which has a special significance to a faith group.

==Christianity==

Vestments are liturgical garments and articles associated primarily with the Christian religions, especially the Latin Rite and other Roman Catholics, Eastern Orthodox, Anglicans, Methodists, and Lutheran Churches.  Other groups also make use of vestments, but this was a point of controversy in the Protestant Reformation and sometimes since - notably during the Ritualist controversies in England in the 19th century. Clerical clothing is non-liturgical clothing worn exclusively by clergy. It is distinct from vestments in that it is not reserved specifically for services.

==Ecumenicism==

A Peace Mala is a symbolic bracelet used to promote the message of the Golden Rule of mutual respect recognised by many spiritual paths. It consists of 16 beads, forming a double rainbow, which represent Christianity, Buddhism, Sikhism, Islam, Judaism, Bahá'í, ISKCON, Zoroastrianism, Tribal and Native Religions, Jainism, Earth Religions, Taoism, Hinduism and Yungdrung Bön, with the central white bead representing the wearer and whatever path they may follow.

==Judaism==

===Jewish mysticism===

Wearing a thin red string (as a type of talisman) is a custom, popularly thought to be associated with Judaism's Kabbalah, in order to ward off misfortune brought about by an "evil eye"  (עין הרע in Hebrew). In Yiddish the red string is called a roite bindele.
The red string itself is usually made from thin red wool thread. It is worn, or tied, as a type of bracelet or "band" on the left wrist of the wearer (the receiving side).[tpl]cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4233623.stm |title=Do you know your awareness bracelets? |accessdate=2008-04-28 |date=2005-02-04 |publisher=BBC News Magazine[/tpl]

==Islam==

Dress in Islam varies from country to country. The Quranic sura An-Nur ("The Light") prescribes modesty in dress. These prescriptions have been interpreted differently in different regions of the Islamic world: in many countries a headscarf is usual, whereas in Saudi Arabia the niqab is typical, and in Afghanistan and parts of Pakistan the burqa is common.
