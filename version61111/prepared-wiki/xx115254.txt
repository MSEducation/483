[[Pellolessertia]]

CATEGORIES: Salticidae

Pellolessertia is a spider genus of the Salticidae family (jumping spiders). So far, only one species, P. castanea, has been found in Cameroon, Congo and Ethiopia.
Males are about six millimeters long.
The most similar genus seems to be Monomotapa (Szüts & Scharff, 2005).

==Distribution==

The species was first found in Avakubi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and it has been recorded in Cameroon. Dippenaar-Schoeman & Jocqué (1997) give the distribution range as Zad're to Ethiopia.

==Name==

The genus name is derived in part from the arachnologist Lessert, and also from the salticid genus Pellenes because it bears resemblance to several genera in the subfamily Pelleninae.
Its original genus name Avakubia was changed in 1929 because that name was preoccupied for a gastropod subgenus (Gulella (Avakubia) Pilsbry, 1919, Streptaxidae, Stylommatophora).
