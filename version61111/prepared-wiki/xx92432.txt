</ref>  Somewhat later, in 1956, a 30&nbsp;cm chamber outfitted with three cameras was used in the discovery of the neutral [[Sigma baryon|Sigma hyperon]] and a measurement of its mass.<ref>

[/ref] This observation was important for confirming the existence of the SU(3) flavor symmetry which hypothesizes the existence of the strange quark.
An important characteristic of the weak interaction is its violation of parity symmetry.  This characteristic was established through the measurement of the spins and parities of many hyperons. Steinberger and his collaborators contributed several such measurements using large (75 cm) liquid-hydrogen bubble chambers and separated hadron beams at Brookhaven.  One example is the measurement of the invariant mass distribution of electron-positron pairs produced in the decay of Sigma-zero hyperons to Lambda-zero hyperons.

==Neutrinos and the weak neutral current==

In the 1960s, the emphasis in the study of the weak interaction shifted from strange particles to neutrinos.  Leon Lederman, Steinberger and Schwartz built large spark chambers at Nevis Lab and exposed them in 1961 to neutrinos produced in association with muons in the decays of charged pions and kaons.  They used the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS) at Brookhaven, and obtained a number of convincing events in which muons were produced, but no electrons. This result, for which they received the Nobel Prize in 1988, proved the existence of a type of neutrino associated with the muon, distinct from the neutrino produced in beta decay.

==Study of CP violation==

The CP violation (charge conjugation and parity) was established in the neutral kaon system in 1964.  Steinberger recognized that the phenomenological parameter epsilon (ε) which quantifies the degree of CP violation could be measured in interference phenomena (See CP violation).  In collaboration with Carlo Rubbia, he performed an experiment while on sabbatical at CERN during 1965 which demonstrated robustly the expected interference effect, and also measured precisely the difference in mass of the short-lived and long-lived neutral kaon masses.[ref]

Back in the United States, Steinberger conducted an experiment at Brookhaven to observe CP violation in the semi-leptonic decays of neutral kaons.  The charge asymmetry relates directly to the epsilon parameter, which was thereby measured precisely.[ref]
