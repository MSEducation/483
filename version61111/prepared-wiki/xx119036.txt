[tpl]nihongo|Takanobu Okabe|岡部 孝信|Okabe Takanobu[/tpl] (born October 26, 1970 in Shimokawa, Hokkaido) is a Japanese former ski jumper who competed in the ski jumping World Cup from 1990 to 2014.
His debut World Cup performance was on December 16, 1989 in Sapporo and at the moment he is the oldest ski jumper in a world of ski jumping. Competing in three Winter Olympics, he won two medals in the team large hill event at the Winter Olympics with a silver in 1994 and a gold in 1998.
Okabe had his biggest successes at the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships, winning five medals. This included a gold in the individual normal hill (1995), a silver in the team large hill (1997), and three bronzes in the team large hill (1995, 2007, 2009). 
Okabe has five individual World Cup victories, three of which came on flying hills. At the time of his latest win in Kuopio on March 10, 2009 he was, at the age of 38 years and 135 days, the oldest ski jumper to ever win a World Cup competition. This record has since been beaten by his compatriot Noriaki Kasai.
On 12 March 2014, the International Ski Federation announced his retirement.
