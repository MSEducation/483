Fucking ([tpl]IPA-de|ˈfʊkɪŋ[/tpl], rhymes with "booking") is an Austrian villageTarsdorf Official map in the municipality of Tarsdorf,Official governmental Homepage of Tarsdorf Municipality in the Innviertel region of western Upper Austria. The village is [tpl]convert|33|km[/tpl] north of Salzburg, [tpl]convert|4|km[/tpl] east of the German border.
Despite having a population of only 104, the village has become famous for its name in the English-speaking world. Its road signs are a popular visitor attraction, and were often stolen by souvenir-hunting tourists until 2005, when they were modified to be theft-resistant.

==Etymology==

It is believed that the settlement was founded in the 6th century by Focko, a Bavarian nobleman. The existence of the village was documented for the first time in 1070 and historical records show that some twenty years later the lord was Adalpertus de Fucingin. The spelling of the name has evolved over the years; it is first recorded in historical sources with the spelling as Vucchingen in 1070, Fukching in 1303,[tpl]cite book|last=Etz|first=Albrecht|title=Die Siedlungsnamen des Innviertels als lauthistorische Quellen|page=212|series=Volume 53 of Dissertationen der Universität Wien|publisher=Notring|year=1971[/tpl] Fugkhing in 1532, and in the modern spelling Fucking in the 18th century,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2005/09/02/1125302734420.html|title=What's the F---ing joke?|date=3 September 2005|publisher=The Age|accessdate=2009-10-25[/tpl] which is pronounced with the vowel oo as in book. The ending -ing is an old Germanic suffix indicating the people belonging to the root word to which it is attached, thus Fucking means "(place of) Focko's people.""Brits steal carloads of F**king Austrian roadsigns", The Register, 15 August 2005.

==Demographics and transportation==

The Austrian census of 2001 recorded that the village had a population of 93.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.statistik.at/blickgem/vz2/g40443.pdf|title=Wohnbevölkerung nach Ortschaften|date=29 July 2009|publisher=Statistik Austria|language=German|accessdate=2009-10-25[/tpl] The Age reported in 2005 that it had 104 people and 32 houses.

==Name and notoriety==

Fucking's most famous feature is four traffic signs with its name on them, beside which tourists stop to have their photograph taken, owing to the identical spelling to the present participle and gerund of the English-language profanity fuck. One version of the sign features the village name with an additional sign beneath it, with the words "Bitte – nicht so schnell!" ("Please – not so fast!"). The lower sign—which features an illustration of two children—is meant to advise drivers to slow down, but tourists interpret it, in conjunction with the "Fucking" sign, as a double entendre.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/photos/signs/austria.asp |title=Urban Legends Reference Pages: Welcome to Austria |publisher=Snopes.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26[/tpl]
British and American soldiers based in nearby Salzburg noticed the name after World War II, and began to travel to the village to have their photos taken beside the signs while striking various poses. The local residents, the Fuckingers, were considerably bemused as they had not previously been aware of the meaning of their village's name when read as English. Since then, the number of visitors to Fucking has increased, with the occasional visit by a tour bus.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/austria/1497132/No-there-are-no-Fing-postcards.html|title='No, there are no F***ing postcards'|last=Harnden|first=Toby|date=28 August 2005|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph | location = London |accessdate=2009-11-07[/tpl]
The village is especially popular with British tourists; as a local tour guide explained: "The Germans all want to see Mozart's house in Salzburg; the Americans want to see where The Sound of Music was filmed; the Japanese want Hitler's birthplace in Braunau; but for the British, it's all about Fucking."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/columnists/parsons/2005/08/29/this-town-s-a-f-joke-115875-15907192/|title=This Towns A F****** Joke|date=29 August 2005|newspaper=The Daily Mirror|location = London | accessdate=2009-11-07[/tpl] Augustina Lindlbauer, the manager of an area guesthouse, noted that the area had lakes, forests, and vistas worth visiting, but there was an "obsession with Fucking". Lindlbauer recalled how she had to explain to a British female tourist "that there were no Fucking postcards."[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20050828/wl_uk_afp/britainaustriaoffbeat |title=Brits driving Austrians bonkers over rude village name |date=28 August 2005|agency=Agence France Presse|accessdate=2009-11-07|location=London |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050911151145/http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20050828/wl_uk_afp/britainaustriaoffbeat |archivedate = 2005-09-11[/tpl]
The road signs were commonly stolen as souvenirs—the only crime which has been reported in the village. It cost some 300 Euros to replace each stolen sign, and the costs were reflected in the taxes that local residents pay. In 2004, owing mainly to the stolen signs, a vote was held on changing the village's name, but the residents voted against doing so. Tarsdorf municipality's mayor Siegfried Höppl stated that it was decided to keep the name as it had existed for 800 years, and further stated that "everyone here knows what it means in English, but for us Fucking is Fucking—and it's going to stay Fucking."[tpl]cite book |last1=Haywood |first1=Anthony |last2=Walker | first2 =Kerry |title=Austria |publisher=Lonely Planet |year=2008 |edition=5 |page=217 |isbn=1-74104-670-X |url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=dXQLdFUKa0UC|accessdate=2009-11-07[/tpl]
After a spate of thefts, which included the theft of all four signs in one night, and a total of fifteen over a period of several years, in August 2005 the road signs were replaced with theft-resistant ones, welded to steel and secured in concrete to prevent them being stolen. Mayor Höppl said that officials were fed up with English-speaking tourists stealing the signs, and noted that with the newly installed signs it would take all night to steal one. Höppl said that tourists, and the money they bring to the area, were welcome, but locals were sick of replacing the Fucking signs.[tpl]cite news |title=Austrian town uses concrete to block cursed sign thefts |date=23 August 2005 |newspaper=The Ottawa Citizen |pages=A8[/tpl] Commander Schmitzberger, the local police chief, also hinted at other avenues to stop what he calls "foreign criminals" from disturbing order in the village. Regarding these "other avenues", Schmitzberger stated, "what they are, I am not at liberty to disclose, but we will not stand for the Fucking signs being removed. It may be very amusing for you British, but Fucking is simply Fucking to us. What is this big Fucking joke? It is puerile."[tpl]cite news|title=Austrians Not Amused |url=http://www.banderasnews.com/0611/nw-fucking-austria.htm |date=November 2006 |newspaper=BanderasNews.com[/tpl]
A resident of the village, Josef Winkler, attempted to cash in on the village's fame by setting up a website (www.fucking.at), on which he sold T-shirts featuring the village road signs, with the slogan "I like Fucking in Austria" printed on them. According to Winkler, they were selling well, and he was in negotiations with Maxim regarding possible promotions, but was forced to stop his venture after being shouted at and threatened in the street. Winkler said, "It was a bit of fun that didn't hurt anyone, but I found out that in this region you just can't do something like that. The whole thing became a real trial for me and I had to stop. People are very traditional here."
In July 2009, it was announced that the village would install CCTV cameras in an attempt to deter summertime tourists from filming themselves having sexual intercourse in front of the Fucking signs. A resident of the village said that installing cameras around the village may make tourists think twice and instead choose only to have a photograph taken in front of the sign.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/playlist/view/91341/Would-you-please-all-stop-f-ing-in-F-ing/ |title=Would you please all stop f*&%ing in F***ing |date=28 July 2009 |newspaper=Daily Star| location = London |accessdate=2009-10-24[/tpl] Juergen Stoll, the operator of a guesthouse at Wank, close to the Austrian-German border, stated that the residents of Fucking should be cashing in on its name, although Mayor Franz Meindl states: "We don't find it funny. We just want to be left alone. We don't harm anyone and just want to live in peace."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/2572607/Rude-named-town-gets-a-helping-hand-from-its-neighbours.html |title=Rude town gets handy advice |last=Watson |first=Leon |date=5 August 2009 |newspaper=The Sun | location = London |accessdate=2009-11-07[/tpl]—and added that he would prefer not to see the village being featured in the press any more.[tpl]de icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite news |url=http://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/Home/Nachrichten/Bayern/Artikel,-Die-Ortstafel-als-Souvenir-_arid,1196026_regid,2_puid,2_pageid,4289.html |title=Die Ortstafel als Souvenir |last=Schmidt |first=Von Axel |date=24 March 2008 |newspaper=Augsburger Allgemeine|accessdate=2009-11-07[/tpl] Meindl appears to have the opposite view to former Mayor Höppl, by proclaiming that residents wish their village to be left alone by tourists.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.thelondonpaper.com/thelondonpaper/weird/odd-news/people-in-the-village-of-fucking-hate-tourists |title=People in the village of Fucking hate tourists |last=Ross |first=Kirsty |date=30 July 2009 |newspaper=thelondonpaper| location = London |accessdate=2009-11-07[/tpl]
Putting the problem in context, however, tz-online notes that numerous villages across the border in Germany have names that are "unfortunate" even in German, including Affendorf (Monkey Village), Faulebutter (Putrid Butter), Fickmühlen (Fuck Mill), Himmelreich (Kingdom of Heaven), Katzenhirn (Cat Brain), Plöd (Stupid), Regenmantel (Raincoat), Sklavenhaus (Slave House) and Warzen (Warts).[tpl]cite news |title=Schluss mit Plöd! - Wie ein lustiger Ortsname zur Last wird |url=http://www.tz-online.de/aktuelles/bayern/schluss-mit-ploed---wie-ein-lustiger-ortsname-zur-last-wird-72134.html |newspaper=TZ | location = Munich | language = German |date=14 November 2008[/tpl]

===False rumours of name change===

Rumours spread through international news media in April 2012 that villagers had been thinking about changing the name of the village or had actually voted to change it. The satirical website The Spoof! published a story on 18 April 2012 saying that the villagers were fed up and wanted to change the name.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thespoof.com/news/spoof.cfm?headline=s3i106192 |title=Fucking Village To Change Name |publisher=The Spoof! |date=18 April 2012[/tpl] This minor satire was expanded upon and appeared on the same day in the Daily Mirror newspaper[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/fucking-village-told-they-cant-be-renamed-798433 |title=No Fugging chance: Fucking village told they can't be renamed Fugging because name is already taken |publisher=The Mirror |date=18 April 2012[/tpl] and elsewhere during the following week as a genuine news item, and was repeated by The Guardian and The Huffington Post, who reported that a vote had taken place to change the name to Fugging, but it was discovered that a village with that name already existed in the municipality of Obritzberg-Rust just west of Herzogenburg.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2012/apr/25/silly-placenames-dull-and-boring |title=Silly placenames: welcome to Dull, twinned with Boring |publisher=The Guardian |date=25 April 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tony-phillips/fucking-austria-weird-city-names_b_1439680.html |title=Citizens Vote to Rename Austrian Town From F---ing to Fugging |publisher=Huffington Post |date=20 April 2012[/tpl] The mayor of Fucking denied these false stories when contacted.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/18/uk-austria-village-idUSLNE83H02B20120418 |title=Nothing profane about our name Austrian hamlet says |publisher= Reuters |date=18 April 2012[/tpl]
