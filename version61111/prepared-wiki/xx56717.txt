Walter James Redfern Turner (13 October 1889http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/36589?docPos=1 – 18 November 1946) was an Australian-born, English-domiciled writer and critic.McKenna, C. W. F., (1990). online: 'Turner, Walter James Redfern (1884–1946)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 12, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University: Melbourne University Press, accessed 28 October 2012.
Born in South Melbourne, the son of a church musician – organist at St Paul's Cathedral – and a warehouseman, Walter James Turner, and a woman of long golden hair, Alice May (née Watson), he was educated at Carlton State School, Scotch College and the Working Men's College. In 1907 he left for England to pursue a career in writing. There he met and befriended a number of literary intellectual figures, including Siegfried Sassoon, Virginia Woolf, Vita Sackville-West, and Lady Ottoline Morrell (the caricature of her in his book The Aesthetes ended their friendship). On 5 April 1918, in Chelsea, he married Delphine Marguerite Dubuis (died 1951). During the period from the First World War until the mid-1930s, he was known primarily as a poet.  His 1916 'Romance' ("Chimborazu, Cotopaxi....") is probably the best remembered of his poems.
W. B. Yeats had the highest praise for Turner's poetry, saying that it left him "lost in admiration and astonishment",[tpl]cn|date=June 2013[/tpl] and included some of it in his Oxford Book of Modern Poetry (while omitting several authors very much better known today for their verse, such as Wilfred Owen). But today, although Turner produced several novels and plays, as well as books of poems, his reputation rests on his musical biographies of Mozart, Beethoven and Berlioz. He was musically untrained, and in the words of the music critic Charles Reid, "unhampered by any excess of technical knowledge" to restrain his "racy dogmatism."Reid, p. 189 His Mozart in has been reprinted many times in the 70 years since it was first published. Some of his musical articles for the New Statesman and other journals were reprinted in Music and Life, Facing the Music, Musical Meanderings, and Variations on the theme of Music. 
Turner was a close friend of the pianist Artur Schnabel, about whom he frequently wrote, and with whom he frequently went hiking.[tpl]cn|date=June 2013[/tpl] He was a champion of Arturo Toscanini's conducting, which was for him a revelation in structure and expression. Siegfried Sassoon was another close friend of Turner, at least for a while. Turner, his wife, and Sassoon all cohabited a house on Tufton Street before Sassoon moved out in 1925. After this he fell out with Turner so badly that he made no mention whatsoever of him in his autobiography.[tpl]cn|date=June 2013[/tpl] During the Second World War, he edited a number of volumes about English culture. On 18 November 1946 he died at Hammersmith of a cerebral thrombosis.[tpl]cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article35767906 |title=Cable News in Brief. |newspaper=The Advertiser (Adelaide, SA : 1931 - 1954) |agency=Australian Associated Press (AAP) |location=Adelaide, SA |date=21 November 1946 |accessdate=28 October 2012 |page=8 |publisher=National Library of Australia | quote = Literary Editor Dies The death has occurred of Mr. Walter James ("Redfern") Turner, literary editor of "The Spectator." at the age of 57.
