New Denver is a village in southeastern British Columbia, Canada, along the shore of Slocan Lake. New Denver was founded as a mining town in 1892, and briefly known as Eldorado City before being renamed after Denver, Colorado. It was incorporated as a village in 1929 and currently has approximately 504 residents.

==History==

During World War II, New Denver became a Japanese Canadian internment camp. Not long after the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, men between the ages of 18 to 45 were sent to labour camps in the Interior of British Columbia or farther into Eastern Canada. Approximately 1,500 women, children, and elderly men were sent to the "Orchard", a small section of New Denver set up to house them. New Denver's Nikkei Internment Memorial Centre is dedicated to the history of the 23,000 Japanese Canadians that were interned by the Canadian government and is a National Historic Site of Canada.[tpl]CRHP|15382|Nikkei Internment Memorial Centre|28 January 2012[/tpl]
In the 1950s, children of Freedomites, a Doukhobor extremist group, were removed from their parents and sent to residential school in New Denver. The Freedomites refused to send their children to school because of their religious beliefs.[tpl]cite news|title=Russia Handed Propaganda Gift By Persecuted Sect In Canada|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=47wyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=JewFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2314,2561471|accessdate=19 November 2010|newspaper=Miami News|date=21 January 1958[/tpl]
