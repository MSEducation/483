Alexander Nikolayevich Spesivtsev ([tpl]lang-ru|Александр Николаевич Спесивцев[/tpl]) is a Russian man who was accused of killing up to 80 people and cannibalizing some of his victims. His mother, Ludmila, lured some of the victims into their apartment under different pretenses and went unnoticed due to her inconspicuous babushka appearance. She would dispose of the remains by throwing them into the Aba river late at night. Alexander kept a diary detailing some of his crimes and did not deny his actions when captured. However, he confessed only to 19 murders and boasted with crimes, that couldn't be proven. In his house was found 82 complects of bloody clothes, near 40 jewelry items and some photos of unknown people, who possibly were his unproved victims. He was ruled insane by a court and committed to a psychiatric hospital,[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com.au/newspapers?id=hYYUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=6QMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5590,1874764&dq=alexander-spesivtsev&hl=en|title=Insane Russian accused of killing, eating people|date=6 October 1999|publisher=Toledo Blade|accessdate=22 January 2010[/tpl] and had previously been confined to a mental institution for 3 years after torturing and killing his girlfriend.
