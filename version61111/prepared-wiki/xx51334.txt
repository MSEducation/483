BBC Northern Ireland ([tpl]lang-ga|BBC Thuaisceart Éireann[/tpl], Ulster-Scots: BBC Norlin Airlan) is the main public service broadcaster in Northern Ireland.
The organisation is one of the three national regions of the BBC, together with BBC Scotland and BBC Cymru Wales. Based at Broadcasting House, Belfast, it provides television, radio, online and interactive television content.    BBC Northern Ireland currently employs 700 people, largely in Belfast.

==Television==

BBC Northern Ireland operates two television stations;
Prior to 27 October 2006, BBC Two NI was a digital only service while BBC Two Northern Ireland was available on analogue transmission. Since 28 October 2006, BBC Two Northern Ireland has been the on-air name for both services which have been merged.
BBC Northern Ireland has its own team of continuity announcers which introduce the vast majority of programmes on BBC One and BBC Two in Northern Ireland.
BBC Northern Ireland makes some of its own programmes itself. However, unlike the radio stations, the television stations' content is for the most part identical to that broadcast by the BBC One and BBC Two channels in England. Some network programmes may however be time-shifted in order to make room for more local programming. Most local programmes are broadcast on BBC One Northern Ireland.

As well as programmes intended purely for a regional audience, BBC Northern Ireland also produces programmes for national consumption on the BBC's channels across the UK.

BBC Northern Ireland takes part in the 'Regionalisation' of some of the BBC's national radio output. Until 2012, for example, Radio 1 split the home nations on Thursday morning from midnight to 2am, with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland broadcasting their own shows to showcase regional talent. The Radio 1 session from Northern Ireland was last presented by Phil Taggart from Omagh.

==Online==

BBC Northern Ireland's online service provides News, Sport, Schools,  Learning and Programme information for television and radio programmes.  It provides a streaming audio service for Radio Ulster and Radio Foyle as well as every programme on demand for up to a week after transmission. bbc.co.uk/northernireland/ is part of BBC Online and operated from the Belfast base. It also provides multi platform interactivity for TV programmes including the annual Schools' Cup Rugby union and Gaelic Athletic Association finals.

The road show allows people to learn more about day to day life in the BBC as well as allowing them to take part in activities such as presenting the news or weather, starring in a radio drama or making jingles. For the majority of the days, there is an outside broadcast from BBC Radio Ulster's Hugo Duncan.

====Gaelic games====

BBC NI in recent years has been accused of showing bias against Gaelic games,[tpl]cite news |first=Alan |last=Rodgers |title=GAA coverage comes under fire|work=Gaelic Life |page=3 |date=17 October 2008 |accessdate= |url= [/tpl] the most popular sports in Northern Ireland.[tpl]cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/csc/reports/sugdenharvie/sugdenharvie95-2.htm|title=Sport and Community Relations in Northern Ireland|date=28 August 2008|publisher=CAIN|accessdate=9 January 2009[/tpl]
Many Gaelic-games fans claim the sports are being discriminated against by the BBC in comparison to other sports. The BBC's coverage of Ulster inter-county football did improve in 2008, with them showing all but one of the 2008 Ulster Senior Football Championship matches, yet their lack of coverage of hurling, club matches and non-Ulster Championship games still angers GAA supporters. Little or no coverage was given to the 2008 club championships or the All-Ireland Minor Championship final replay between Tyrone and Mayo on BBC TV or radio. The BBC would have had to purchase the rights to show matches outside of the Ulster championships[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.westtyronesinnfein.com/news/9040|title = Lack of BBC GAA Coverage Unacceptable – Begley|date = 7 August 2007|accessdate = 9 January 2009| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20081201084206/http://www.westtyronesinnfein.com/news/9040| archivedate = 1 December 2008 | deadurl = no[/tpl] and described the situation as a "complicated rights issue".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2008/08_august/28/gaa.shtml|title=BBC Northern Ireland to screen GAA All-Ireland Football Championship Semi-Final|date=28 August 2008|publisher=BBC|accessdate=9 January 2009[/tpl] The popular show Sunday Sports Sound on BBC Radio Ulster was scrapped, before being reinstated in early 2008 and again in October 2008. The removal of the show had caused outrage among GAA fans in Ulster. Ulster Council President Tom Daly called for the corporation to give "more attention and coverage because of the huge interest in Gaelic games at all levels" although he had previously stated that he was "confident that the standard of coverage of Gaelic Games in Ulster this year will be at a very high level."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2008/02_february/20/gaa.shtml|title=New GAA deal secured by BBC Northern Ireland|date=10 August 2008|publisher=BBC|accessdate=9 January 2009[/tpl]
