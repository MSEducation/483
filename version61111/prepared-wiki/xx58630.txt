==Early life==

Born in Brooklyn, New York City,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.reuben.org/ncs/members/bios/Drucker.jpg|title=Mort Drucker bio|publisher=National Cartoonists Society|format=JPG|accessdate=August 31, 2010[/tpl] Drucker attended Brooklyn's Erasmus Hall High School. There he met his future wife Barbara, whom he married shortly after her graduation. The couple moved to Long Island, living in Woodbury, where they brought up two daughters, Laurie and Melanie; their family eventually expanded with three grandchildren."Man Behind the Drawing Board", The Adventures of Bob Hope 87, 1963.

==Career==

Drucker entered the comics field by assisting Bert Whitman on Debbie Dean in 1947 when he was 18, based on a recommendation from Will Eisner. He moved on to do a syndicated newspaper gag panel, The Mountain Boys. He then joined the staff of National Periodical Publications (DC Comics), where he worked as a retoucher. Early in the 1950s, Drucker began doing freelance work.

===Mad===

In the fall of 1956, shortly after the departure of Mad's founding editor Harvey Kurtzman, Drucker found his way to Mad. His first visit to the magazine's offices coincided with a World Series broadcast, and publisher Bill Gaines told Drucker that if the Brooklyn Dodgers won the game, he would be hired. The Dodgers did win. Capricious though Drucker's alleged audition process may have been, it made for a good anecdote. Years later, Gaines unsurprisingly confessed, "We would have hired him anyway." More than a half century later, Drucker held the longest uninterrupted tenure of any Mad artist.
Drucker had arrived at the Mad offices with drawings of the Lone Ranger and Hopalong Cassidy; while unlike the continuities he would become best known for, the Mad staff reacted favorably.  The first to review Drucker's portfolio was Mad associate editor Nick Meglin, who admitted, "I didn't spot how great he was at caricatures.  Not at first.  But then, he wasn't that great then."  Drucker himself says that he "just wanted to be an artist... to get paid for drawing anything," and only started focusing on caricature work because he started getting more and more of those assignments.  "That's when I realized I'd found my calling," said Drucker.Evanier, Mark, MAD Art, Watson-Guptill Publications, 2002  At the time of Drucker's arrival, Mad did not regularly feature TV and movie satires; editor Al Feldstein credited Drucker's style and ability for the decision to start featuring them in every issue.
Meglin called Drucker "number one in a field of one."  Charles Schulz wrote, "Frankly, I don't know how he does it, and I stand in a long list of admirers... I think he draws everything the way we would all like to draw."  In 2012, the Comics Reporter's Tom Spurgeon wrote, "The way he draws James Caan's eyebrow in parody of "The Godfather" is worth some folks' entire careers."http://www.comicsreporter.com/index.php/bundled_tossed_untied_and_stacked052212/
In 2012, Drucker discussed his art style, and how he applied it to his Mad assignments:

Drucker also remained active for DC, illustrating War Stories, among other titles. Beginning in 1959, he spent four years drawing DC's The Adventures of Bob Hope comic book.  Drucker credits this stint as a key moment in his career, because it focused his work on caricature.MAD's Greatest Artists: Mort Drucker, 2012, Running Press, pg. 12
In 1962, Drucker teamed with the prolific humor writer Paul Laikin on the highly successful JFK Coloring Book (Kanrom Publishers), which sold 2,500,000 copies, prompting follow-up coloring books on Ollie North and Ronald Reagan.Pacific Stars and Stripes, August 24, 1987. His film posters include Universal's American Graffiti (1973).

He drew the prop cartoons used in the 1957 Broadway musical comedy, Rumple, starring Gretchen Wyler, Elliott Gould and Eddie Foy, Jr.
Between 1984 and 1987, Drucker collaborated with Jerry Dumas (and John Reiner) on the daily comic strip Benchley. Set in the White House, the plot revolved around the fictive character Benchley who acted as the assistant and admirer of contemporary president Ronald Reagan. Dumas commented, "Nobody ever did a strip about the government. It's a wonderful place to set a strip. There's so much room for humor in the White House.""Comic strip set in White House", Lethbridge Herald (Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada), July 5, 1984. Benchley was syndicated by The Register and Tribune Syndicate, Inc.[tpl]cite book|author=Gary Dowell, Greg Holman, Don Mangus, James L.
