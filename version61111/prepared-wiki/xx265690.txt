[[Trams in Portugal]]

CATEGORIES: Tram transport in Portugal

Trams in Portugal have generally been traditional electric cars in large cities such as Lisbon, Porto and Sintra. Portuguese tram routes are typically, but not necessarily, tourist attractions.
Tramways are usually embedded in the older parts of Portuguese cities. They are intended primarily for carrying passengers, and as a means of rapid transportation, since the trams usually have priority over the remaining traffic.
Trams came to Portugal in the following sequence: Porto (1895), Lisbon (1901), Sintra (1904), Coimbra (1911) and Braga (1914).  The first three of these networks are still in operation; the remaining two have been closed.

==Lisbon==

The "amarelos da Carris" (English:Yellows of the Rails) are a symbol of Lisbon, plying the narrow streets, steep and winding.
The Lisbon tramway network is operated by Carris.  It presently comprises 5 lines, and has a total length of [tpl]convert|48|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] in [tpl]RailGauge|900mm[/tpl] gauge, of which [tpl]convert|13|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] is on reserved tracks.
Carris employs 165 brakemen (conductors of trams, funiculars and an elevator (the Santa Justa lift) and a runs a fleet of 57 tram vehicles (39 historical, 10 articulated trams and 8 light rail cars), based at a single depot - Santo Amaro.

==Porto==

The tramway network in the city of Porto is operated by Sociedade de Transportes Colectivos do Porto (STCP).
There are three different Porto tram routes:
The STCP tram fleet is housed at the Massarelos depot next to the STCP Tram Museum.

==Sintra==

The Sintra tramway is a seasonal narrow gauge tourist line linking the town of Sintra with Praia das Maçãs, Portugal, over a distance of less than [tpl]convert|13|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl], passing through Colares and close to the Praia Grande.
Following denationalisation of Portugal's provincial bus services in the 1990s, ownership of the line was assumed by Stagecoach Portugal, but the tram services - operated during the peak tourist season - passed later to the Municipality of Sintra, who re-extended the line over its long-abandoned formation from Ribeira towards central Sintra.
Damage to the infrastructure occurred in late 2011 - a 1 km stretch of overhead copper wires was stolen. The city council has since then replaced the wires at a cost of €160.000 and the tramway has now reopened for the 2012 season.

==Coimbra==

Coimbra saw its first tram circulating in the streets on 10 November 1911.  For decades, with more or fewer lines, the tram was an efficient way to move citizens around Coimbra.
Although in this period there was not environmental awareness in its present form, trams were a means of non-polluting transport that allowed Coimbra have an air quality unmatched today.
Nevertheless, in the late 1970s the trams were considered to be old fashioned, noisy and uncomfortable.  Politicians and others were then promoting their rapid decline with the closing of the different lines. The last tram circulated in Coimbra on 9 January 1980.

==Braga==

The Braga tramway network opened on 5 October 1914, replacing the old Braga horsecar network.  It consisted of two routes:
The network was finally closed in 1963, and replaced by the Braga trolleybus system. The tracks remained in place until the 1980s.
