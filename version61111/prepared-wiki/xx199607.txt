==History==

Founded as the Texas Fine Arts Association (TFAA) in 1911, the organization's initial purpose was to maintain the studio and collection of sculptor Elisabet Ney, now the Elisabet Ney Museum.[tpl]cite book |title=Texas, A Guide to the Lone Star State |author=Federal Writers' Project |publisher=US History Publishers |isbn=1-60354-042-3 |pages=146 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zUI26u0B_VEC&pg=PA146&vq=%22Texas+Fine+Arts+Association%22&dq=%22Texas+Fine+Arts+Association%22&num=100&as_brr=3&source=gbs_search_s&sig=QBE61xvvlF8hZ0uiXFiFProch9c |accessdate=2008-06-24[/tpl] The Association's early leadership helped to establish the studio art department at The University of Texas at Austin, promote the formation of a state arts commission, and found some of the state's major art museums.[tpl]cite book |title=Free Tours, Museums and Sites in America: The Southern States Series |last=Ellis |first=Lee |year=2003 |publisher=Americana Group Publishing |isbn=0-9667961-9-5 |pages=231 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4wTVH46NXjkC&pg=PA231&dq=%22Texas+Fine+Arts+Association%22&num=100&as_brr=3&sig=gFS7mp7wG2XrIaly0SuomGAcO7M |accessdate=2008-06-24[/tpl]

In 1995 TFAA's Board of Directors purchased the property at 700 Congress Avenue in Austin, TX. Three years after the building's purchase, TFAA opened its new headquarters, the Jones Center for Contemporary Art, in November 1998.
In November 2002, the name of the organization was officially changed from the Texas Fine Arts Association to Arthouse.[tpl]cite book |title=Art Guide Texas: Museums, Art Centers, Alternative Spaces, and Nonprofit Galleries |last=Cohen |first=Rebecca S. |year=2004 |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=0-292-71230-8 |pages=15 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SB14CfTSud0C&pg=PT31&dq=%22Texas+Fine+Arts+Association%22&num=100&as_brr=3&sig=HGsVzclwPArhStQqK0vRhsZ5XNc |accessdate=2008-06-24[/tpl]
In 2010 Lewis.Tsurumaki.Lewis (LTL) architects completed radical expansions and renovations to Arthouse at the Jones Center. As part of the remodeling, LTL and award-winning New York City-based lighting design firm LumenArch installed 177 LED-lit rectangular laminated glass blocks perforating the southern and eastern walls of the building to create a “glowing” effect.[tpl]cite web| title=Arthouse at the Jones Center|publisher=Architectural Record|url=http://archrecord.construction.com/projects/Building_types_study/adaptive_reuse/2011/arthouse.asp|accessdate= 2010-02-02|ref=archrecord 2010[/tpl]
