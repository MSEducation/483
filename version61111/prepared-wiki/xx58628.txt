[[Italic type]]

CATEGORIES: Typography

In typography, italic type is a cursive typeface based on a stylized form of calligraphic handwriting. Owing to the influence from calligraphy, such typefaces often slant slightly to the right. Different glyph shapes from roman type are also usually used—another influence from calligraphy. True italics are therefore distinct from oblique type, in which the font is merely distorted into a slanted orientation. However, uppercase letters are often oblique type or swash capitals rather than true italics.
This style is called "italic" for historical reasons. Calligraphic typefaces started to be designed in Italy, for chancery purposes. Ludovico Arrighi and Aldus Manutius (both between the 15th and 16th centuries) were the main type designers involved in this process at the time.

==History==

Italic type was first used by Aldus Manutius and the Aldine Press in 1501, in an edition of Virgil dedicated to Italy.  According to Lynne Truss, Manutius invented the italic typeface.[tpl]Citation |title= Eats, Shoots & Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation|last= Truss|first= Lynne|year= 2004|publisher= Gotham Books|location= New York|isbn= 1-59240-087-6|page=77[/tpl] Based on the Humanist cursive script first developed in the 1420s by Niccolò de' Niccoli,Berthold Louis Ullman, The origin and development of humanistic script, Rome, 1960, p. 77 it served as a condensed type for simple, compact volumes.[tpl]citation |first=D.B. |last=Updike |title=Printing Types: Their History, Form and Use |publisher=Harvard University |year=1927[/tpl] The punches for these types were cut by Francesco da Bologna (whose surname was Griffo). In 1501 Aldus wrote to his friend Scipio:
Unlike the italic type of today, the capital letters were upright roman capitals which were shorter than the ascending lower-case italic letters and used about 65 tied letters (ligatures) in the Aldine Dante and Virgil of 1501.
This Aldine italic became the model for most italic types. It was very popular in its own day and was widely (and inaccurately) imitated. The Venetian Senate gave Aldus exclusive right to its use, a patent confirmed by three successive Popes, but it was widely counterfeited. The Italians called the character Aldino, while others called it Italic.
The slanting italic capital was first introduced by printers in Lyon[tpl]When|date=February 2011[/tpl] and is now used in nearly all italic fonts.

==Examples==

An example of normal (roman) and true italics text:
The same example, as oblique text:
Some examples of possible differences between roman and italic type, besides the slant, are below. The transformations from roman to italics are illustrated.

Image:E-curved-bowl.svg|an e whose bowl is curved rather than pointed,
Image:F-tail.svg|an f with a tail (known as a descender),
Image:k-loop-or-ballterminal.svg|a k with a looped bowl, a k with a ball terminal,

Image:Vw-swash-curve.svg|a v and w with swashes and curved bottoms,
Image:Z-stress.svg|a z with the stress on the horizontal strokes as opposed to the diagonal vertical one.

None of these differences are required in an italic; some, like the p variant, do not show up in the majority of italic fonts, while others, like the a and f variants, are in almost every italic. Other common differences include:
Less common differences include a descender on the z and a ball on the finishing stroke of an h, which curves back to resemble a b somewhat. Sometimes the w is of a form taken from old German typefaces, in which the left half is of the same form as the n and the right half is of the same form as the v in the same typeface. There also exist specialized ligatures for italics, such as a curl atop the s which reaches the ascender of the p in sp.
In addition to these differences in shape of letters, italic lowercases usually lack serifs at the bottoms of strokes, since a pen would bounce up to continue the action of writing. Instead they usually have one-sided serifs that curve up on the outstroke (contrast the flat two-sided serifs of a roman font). One uncommon exception to this is Hermann Zapf's Melior. (Its outstroke serifs are one-sided, but they don't curve up.)
 
Outside the regular alphabet, there are other italic types for symbols:

==Usage==

===When to use===

===Alternative representations===

====Oblique type====

Oblique type (or slanted, sloped) is roman type which is optically skewed, but lacking the individual letter forms and cursive accoutrements of true italics.
In many computing interfaces, the text leaning effect is called Italic, whether or not an italic font is used to render the text. Many font families, primarily sans-serif fonts, have called the oblique fonts italic. Although updated versions of those font families begin to incorporate italic features, some font families, such as Avenir Next, Linotype Univers, Neue Helvetica, do not. In expansions of some existing font families (e.g.: Helvetica), the newly introduced fonts are named italic (Helvetica Hebrew, Helvetica Thai),[tpl]Clarify|date=October 2013[/tpl] while existing fonts are still called oblique. The name 'Inclined' is also used to name oblique type fonts (e.g.: Helvetica Greek).
Although an oblique font can be generated by simply tilting the base font, some designers use optical correction to correct the distorted curves this introduces. Some font families have fonts with both italic and oblique variants. In these cases, the oblique font may have a different tilt angle from the italic font. For example, Univers 65 Bold Oblique has a smaller leaning angle than the Univers 66 Bold Italic.

====Italics within italics====

If something within a run of italics needs to be italicized itself, the type is normally switched back to non-italicized (roman) type: "I think The Scarlet Letter had a chapter about that, thought Mary". In this example, the title ("The Scarlet Letter") is within an italicized thought process and therefore this title is non-italicized. It is followed by the main narrative that is outside both. It is also non-italicized and therefore not obviously separated from the former. The reader must find additional criteria to distinguish between these. Here, apart from using the attribute of italic–non-italic styles, the title also employs the attribute of capitalization. Citation styles in which book titles are italicized differ on how to deal with a book title within a book title; for example, MLA style specifies a switch back to roman type, whereas The Chicago Manual of Style (8.184) specifies the use of quotation marks (A Key to Whitehead’s "Process and Reality").

====Left-leaning italics====

In certain Arabic fonts (e.g.: Adobe Arabic, Boutros Ads), the italic font has the top of the letter leaning to the left, instead of leaning to the right. Some font families, such as Venus, Roemisch, Topografische Zahlentafel, include left leaning fonts and letters designed for German cartographic map production, even though they do not support Arabic characters.

=====Iranic font style=====

in the 1950s Gholamhossein Mosahab invented the Iranic font style, a back-slanted italic form to go with the right-to-left direction of
the script.[tpl]cite journal |last=Esfahbod |first=Behdad |url=http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb23-1/farsitex.pdf |format=PDF |title=FarsiTeX and the Iranian TeX Community |coauthors=Roozbeh Pournader |journal=TUGboat |volume=23 |issue=1 |date=March 2002 |pages=41–45 |accessdate=3 January 2013[/tpl]

====Upright italics====

Fonts such as Jan van Krimpen’s Romanée, Eric Gill’s Joanna and Martin Majoor’s FF Seria have italic fonts that only have cursive designs, but not the leans typically associated with italic types.

====Parentheses====

The Chicago Manual of Style suggests that to avoid problems such as overlapping and unequally spaced characters, parentheses and brackets surrounding text that begins and ends in italic or oblique type should also be italicized (as in this example). An exception to this rule applies when only one end of the parenthetical is italicized (in which case roman type is preferred, as on the right of this example).
In The Elements of Typographic Style, however, it is argued that since Italic delimiters are not historically correct, the upright versions should always be used, while paying close attention to kerning.

====Substitutes====

In media where italicization is not possible, alternatives are used as substitutes:

====Web pages====

In HTML, the i element is used to produce italic (or oblique) text. When the author wants to indicate emphasized text, modern Web standards recommend using the em element, because it conveys that the content is to be emphasized, even if it cannot be displayed in italics. Conversely, if the italics are purely ornamental rather than meaningful, then semantic markup practices would dictate that the author use the Cascading Style Sheets declaration font-style: italic; along with an appropriate, semantic class name instead of an i or em element.
