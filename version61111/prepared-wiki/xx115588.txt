Zygoballus is a genus of jumping spiders found in North and South America.

==Taxonomy and history==

The genus was first described in 1885 by American arachnologists George and Elizabeth Peckham based on the type species Zygoballus rufipes.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Peckham|first1=George|last2=Peckham|first2=Elizabeth|title=On some new genera and species of Attidae from the eastern part of Guatemala|year=1885|journal=Proceedings of the Natural History Society of Wisconsin|url=http://www.peckhamia.com/editions/Peckham%201885%20On%20some%20Attidae%20from%20Guatemala.pdf|pages=62–86[/tpl] The name derives from a combination of the Ancient Greek word ζυγόν (zygon), meaning "yoke", and the genus name Ballus. The etymology of Ballus is unknown, but may be related to the Greek word βαλλίζω (ballizo), meaning "dance" or "jump about".[tpl]cite book|title=Spiders of North America: An Identification Manual|editor1-first=D.|editor1-last=Ubick|editor2-first=P.|editor2-last=Paquin|editor3-first=P.

The genus Messua, based on the type species Messua desidiosa, was synonymized with Zygoballus by Eugène Simon in 1903. Simon argued that Messua desidiosa was a transitional species which differed "much less from typical Zygoballus than would seem to be indicated by Peckham's description."[tpl]cite book|title=Histoire Naturelle des Araignées|edition=2nd|first=Eugène|last=Simon|location=Paris|year=1903|language=French|page=863[/tpl] This synonymy was reversed by Wayne Maddison in 1996, and Messua restored as a valid genus.[tpl]cite journal|title=Pelegrina Franganillo and other jumping spiders formerly placed in the genus Metaphidippus (Araneae: Salticidae)|first=Wayne P.|last=Maddison|authorlink=Wayne Maddison|journal=Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology|publisher=Harvard University|year=1996|volume=154|pages=215–368[/tpl]
The genus Amerotritte, based on the type species Amerotritte lineata, was synonymized with Zygoballus in 1980 by María Elena Galiano. Galiano stated that the holotype of Amerotritte lineata was actually a very young Zygoballus specimen.[tpl]cite journal|title=Catalogo de los especimenes tipicos de Salticidae (Araneae) descriptos por Candido F. de Mello-Leitão|last=Galiano|first=María Elena|journal=Physis, Revista de la Sociedad Argentina de Ciencias Naturales|volume=39|pages=31–40|year=1980|location=Buenos Aires[/tpl]
Zygoballus is currently classified in the subfamily Dendryphantinae of the family Salticidae (jumping spiders).[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1006/mpev.2000.0883|title=A Combined Molecular Approach to Phylogeny of the Jumping Spider Subfamily Dendryphantinae (Araneae: Salticidae)|first1=Marshal C.|last1=Hedin|first2=Wayne P.|last2=Maddison|authorlink2=Wayne Maddison|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|volume=18|issue=3|pages=386–403|date=March 2001|pmid=11277632[/tpl]

==Description==

Spiders of the genus Zygoballus share a strong resemblance in appearance.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Peckham|first1=George|last2=Peckham|first2=Elizabeth|title=Spiders of the Homalattus group of the family Attidae|year=1895|journal=Occasional Papers of the Natural History Society of Wisconsin|volume=2|issue=3|pages=157–178|url=http://peckhamia.com/editions/Peckham%201895%20Spiders%20of%20the%20Homalattus%20group.pdf[/tpl] The cephalothorax is high and roughly square when viewed from above.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Peckham|first1=George|last2=Peckham|first2=Elizabeth|title=Revision of the Attidae of North America|year=1909|journal=Transactions of the Wisconsin Academy of Sciences, Arts, and Letters|volume=16|pages=355–646|url=http://www.peckhamia.com/editions/Peckham%201909%20Revision%20of%20the%20Attidae%20of%20North%20America.pdf[/tpl] It is widest at the posterior eyes, with the ocular quadrangle occupying approximately three-fifths of the cephalothorax. The cephalothorax slopes steeply behind the posterior eyes and the sides of the cephalothorax are nearly vertical. The labium is as long or longer than it is wide.[tpl]cite book|title=Spiders of North America: An Identification Manual|editor1-first=D.|editor1-last=Ubick|editor2-first=P.|editor2-last=Paquin|editor3-first=P. E.|editor3-last=Cushing|editor4-first=V.|editor4-last=Roth|publisher=American Arachnological Society|year=2005|page=213|isbn=0-9771439-0-2| displayeditors=4[/tpl] The anterior (first) pair of legs are the largest, with three pairs of spines on the ventral surface of the tibia.[tpl]cite book|title=Spiders of Connecticut|last=Kaston|first=Benjamin Julian|year=1981|edition=Revised|publisher=State of Connecticut|page=496[/tpl] Males have obliquely oriented chelicerae with long fangs.
Many species exhibit wide variation in color, size, and markings.

==Distribution==

Zygoballus is a genus from the New World, ranging from Argentina to Canada. Three species from India were originally placed in Zygoballus, but have been reassigned to other genera.[tpl]cite journal|last=Kaldari|first=Ryan|title=Reassignment of the Indian species of Zygoballus to Bianor and Rhene (Araneae: Salticidae)|journal=Peckhamia|issue=82.1|year=2010|url=http://peckhamia.com/peckhamia/PECKHAMIA%2082.1.pdf[/tpl]

==Species==

As of 2010, twenty recognized species are classified in the genus Zygoballus.[tpl]cite web|title=The World Spider Catalog, Version 10.0|first=Norman I.|last=Platnick|url=http://research.amnh.org/entomology/spiders/catalog/SALTICIDAE.html|publisher=American Museum of Natural History|year=2009[/tpl] One species, Z. quaternus, was previously recognized (prior to 2008), but is now considered a nomen dubium.[tpl]cite journal|title=Revision of the jumping spider genus Sassacus (Araneae, Salticidae, Dendryphantinae) in North America|first=David B.|last=Richman|journal=Journal of Arachnology|volume=36|issue=1|doi = 10.1636/H07-03.1 | pages=28–48 |year=2008|url=http://www.americanarachnology.org/JoA_free/JoA_v36_n1/arac-36-1-26.pdf[/tpl] Several other species are known only from single specimens. In addition to the species listed below, a recent phylogenetic analysis suggests that Rhetenor texanus may also belong in Zygoballus.
