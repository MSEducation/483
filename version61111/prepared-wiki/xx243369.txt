The pilot episode of the television series Modern Family, written by Steven Levitan and Christopher Lloyd and directed by Jason Winer, premiered on ABC in the United States on September 23, 2009. The pilot introduces viewers to three sets of people who make up a single family. The episode is shot in a mockumentary style, with a cameraman following the characters around their everyday lives and interviewing them at various intervals. It cuts between the experiences of the three separate units before they all come together at the end of the episode. 
In the episode, Jay's family tries to function despite the age difference between himself and his wife. Claire's family tries to punish their son and watch over her daughter and her new boyfriend. Mitchell  tries to hide the fact that he and his partner Cameron have adopted a daughter in Vietnam from his family until Cameron invites Mitchell's family without consulting him (which is revealed to be the other two families). 
Reviews for the pilot episode compared Modern Family to shows such as Married...with Children (which starred Ed O'Neill), Frasier (which the creators of this show worked on), Malcolm in the Middle and, most strongly, Arrested Development.[tpl]cite news |first=Ginia |last=Bellafante |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/23/arts/television/23modern.html |title=Television Review - 'Modern Family' - Dispatches from the Home Front in an ABC sitcom with Ed O'Neill |work=New York Times |date=2009-10-22 |accessdate=2009-10-20[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117941145.html?categoryid=32&cs=1 |title=Modern Family Review - TV Show Reviews - Analysis of Modern Family The TV Series |publisher=Variety |date=2009-09-20 |accessdate=2009-10-20 | first=Brian | last=Lowry[/tpl] In the United Kingdom, reviewers saw similarities between Modern Family and Outnumbered.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2009/oct/15/outnumbered-modern-family-sitcom |title=Does Sky1's Modern Family remind you anything |publisher=The Guardian |date=2009-10-15 |accessdate=2009-10-20 | location=London | first=Vicky | last=Frost[/tpl] The episode has received multiple nominations and has won Episodic Comedy at the Writers Guild of America Awards 2009 and also a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series.

==Plot==

The episode begins at the home of Phil (Ty Burrell) and Claire (Julie Bowen) Dunphy and their three children Haley (Sarah Hyland), Alex (Ariel Winter) and Luke (Nolan Gould). Claire and Phil shout up the stairs to the children. When Haley emerges, Claire tells her that her skirt is too short but Phil allows her to wear it. In side interviews, Phil calls himself a "cool dad" while Claire says that if she can prevent her children from making the same mistakes she did when she was growing up, she has "done our job". Alex comes downstairs to complain Luke has shot her with the toy gun Phil bought him. Claire forces Phil to follow through on his deal with Luke: if Luke shoots someone, Phil will shoot him.
Gloria Delgado-Pritchett (Sofia Vergara) and her husband, Jay (Ed O'Neill), are watching Gloria's son Manny (Rico Rodriguez) play soccer. Gloria is overenthusiastic, shouting encouragement to her son and arguing with another parent. Gloria and Jay are then interviewed, where Gloria discusses the differences between their backgrounds: she comes from a small village in Colombia which is "number one for murders", while he comes from the city and owns a big business. Back on the pitch, Manny misses a goal when he spots a beautiful sixteen-year old girl riding by on a bicycle. Gloria speaks to the father of one of the other players, who assumes that Jay is her dad.
The scene shifts to Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) and Cameron (Eric Stonestreet), a gay couple, who are on a plane returning from Vietnam having adopted a baby, Lily (Ella Hiller/Jaden Hiller). The other passengers admire Lily, with one man commenting, "You and your wife must be thrilled". When Cameron walks onboard and sits down beside Mitchell, an uneasy silence develops. In an interview the characters say that they have been together for five years. Back on the plane, Mitchell threatens to make a speech and does so when a woman says "look at that baby with those cream puffs", which he believes is a reference to him and Cameron. In fact, she is referring to the cream puffs Lily is eating. Cameron apologizes by offering to pay for headsets for all the passengers.
Back at the Dunphy residence, Haley has invited Dylan (Reid Ewing), a senior boy from her high school, over. Claire instructs Phil to "scare him", but Phil hurts his back in the process and Dylan is forced to carry Phil to the couch. Haley brings her boyfriend upstairs and grows annoyed when Claire constantly checks on them. Haley goes downstairs to complain to Phil, who is preparing to shoot Luke. Phil accidentally shoots Luke, Dylan, and then himself.
After the soccer game, Jay is mistaken for a mall walker so he decides to buy some 'hip' new clothes. Meanwhile, Manny reads a poem for the sixteen-year old and is crushed when she says she has a boyfriend.
The last scene is at Mitchell and Cameron's house where Lily is going to be introduced to the rest of the family. Before Lily is introduced, Jay, who is uncomfortable having a gay son, says that Mitchell and Cameron shouldn't adopt and, if they're bored, should get a dog. Cameron enters, holding Lily aloft before the family while "Circle of Life" from The Lion King plays and the whole family accepts and welcomes Lily as part of their family now.

===Conception===

While working in the office Lloyd and Levitan were telling stories about their family and they thought that could be a show idea, and started working around the idea of a families being observed in a mockumentary style show. They then later decided it would be a show about three families and their experiences.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.movieweb.com/tv/TVGq2MLMWvjIKN/VI0o9228q8SM28 |title=Modern Family Season 1: Christopher Lloyd Interview |publisher=MovieWeb.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-04[/tpl] The show was originally called My American Family.[tpl]cite web|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/35297872/ns/entertainment-television/ |title=‘Modern Family’ a freshman hit for ABC - Entertainment - Television - TODAYshow.com |publisher=Today.msnbc.msn.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-04[/tpl] Originally, the camera crew would be run by a fictitious Dutch filmmaker named Geert Floortje who had lived with Jay's family as a teenage exchange student and developed a crush on Claire (while Mitchell had a crush on him), but decided against it.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/tv/index.ssf/2010/01/modern_family_co-creator_steve.html |title=Modern Family: Co-creator Steve Levitan weighs in |publisher=NJ.com |date=2010-01-14 |accessdate=2010-09-04[/tpl] The creators pitched it to three of the four major networks (they did not pitch it to Fox due to problems Lloyd had with the network with previous shows). CBS, not ready to use the single-camera style of filming, nor ready to make another large commitment, did not accept the series. NBC, already having two shows of similar style (mockumentary), The Office and Parks and Recreation, decided against accepting the series until the success of the other two series decreases. ABC accepted the series.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.thewrap.com/awards/column-post/its-modern-family-affair-emmys-19278?page=0,1 |title=It's a 'Modern Family' Affair at the Emmys  |author=Pond, Steve |date= |work=The Wrap |accessdate=2010-07-16 [/tpl]

===Casting===

Casting for Modern Family was very difficult for the final cast (except for Jesse Tyler Ferguson) to be cast. Initially Ed O'Neill had lost the part to Craig T. Nelson (who would later go on to play Zeek Braverman on Parenthood on NBC) although he was eventually cast after Nelson turned down the part due to money problems.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2011/01/27/craig-t-nelson-turned-down-modern-family-for-money-lone-sta/ |title=Craig T.

It was also difficult for Julie Bowen as she was pregnant with twins during filming, while Ty Burrell had to test for the role of Phil Dunphy three times. Initially Jesse Tyler Ferguson had auditioned for the role of Cameron before he, Christopher Lloyd and Steven Levitan thought he would be better suited for the role of Mitchell.[tpl]cite web|author=December 18, 2009 |url=http://www.dailyactor.com/2009/12/jesse-tyler-ferguson-talks-modern-family-improvising-on-set-and-audition-for-the-role/ |title=Jesse Tyler Ferguson talks ‘Modern Family’, improvising on set and audition for the role | Daily Actor - The Actors Online Entertainment Resource |publisher=Daily Actor |date=2009-12-18 |accessdate=2010-11-14[/tpl]

===Filming===

The episode was filmed in Los Angeles in the United States and is set in a nameless suburban neighborhood. It was written and produced by Christopher Lloyd and Steven Levitan, who had worked together on Frasier. When Julie Bowen, who plays Claire Dunphy, read the script, she "desperately wanted to do it" but was pregnant with twins.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.projo.com/tv/content/lb_julie_bowen_09-21-09_AKFJV7O_v13.2864702.html |title=Brown grad Julie Bowen stars in ‘Modern Family’ on ABC | projo.com | The Providence Journal TV | |publisher=projo.com |date=2009-09-21 |accessdate=2010-11-14[/tpl] Bowen "auditioned, begged and pleaded", eventually convincing the show makers to film around her stomach.

===Reviews===

The pilot episode received universal acclaim, with some reviewers highlighting it as one of the best new comedies of 2009. 
Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode a 8.8 saying it was "Great" and "The premiere episode does a fantastic job of introducing us to these family units, and it was fun to see how they would be connected to each other in the realm of the series. The smaller issues aside - the mildly unclear format, some forced clichés - the pilot episode of Modern Family is a must see comedy".[tpl] cite web | title=Modern Family: "Pilot" Review | url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/102/1027162p1.html | author=Robert Canning | accessdate=2010-03-10 | date=2009-09-22 | publisher=IGN.com[/tpl] Variety wrote "Easily the new season's best comedy pilot, Modern Family deftly serves up laughs on multiple levels, from understated one-liners to deft sight-gags." 
Mary McNamara of the LA Times commented "Just when we were thinking it couldn't be done, ABC's Modern Family has single-handedly brought the family comedy back from the dead...Modern Family is sharp, timely and fresh, complicated enough to be interesting but with a soft, sweet center".[tpl]cite news |first=Mary |last=McNamara |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-modernfamily23-2009sep23,0,4726840.story |title='Modern Family' |work=LA Times |date=2009-09-23 |accessdate=2009-10-20[/tpl] 
The New York Times' Gina Bellafante called the series "the best new half-hour of funny television in a season rife with half-hours of funny television". She also felt it was a replacement for Arrested Development, the "last great family comedy" which ended in 2006. 
The success of the pilot led to the series holding a rating of 86/100 on Metacritic from 25 reviews.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/shows/modernfamily |title=The Modern Family reviews at Metacritic.com |publisher=Metacritic |accessdate=2009-10-20[/tpl] ABC ordered a full 22-episode season of the show.[tpl]cite web |first=Michael |last=Ausiello |url=http://ausiellofiles.ew.com/2009/10/08/abc-orders-full-seasons-of-modern-family-cougar-town/ |title=ABC orders full seasons of Modern Family, Cougar Town, The Middle |publisher=Entertainment Weekly |date=2009-10-08 |accessdate=2009-10-20[/tpl]
