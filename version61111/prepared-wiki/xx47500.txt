==Chess career==

===First steps===

Anderssen first came to the attention of the chess world when he published Aufgabe für Schachspieler (literally "Task for chess player"), a collection of 60 chess problems, in 1842. He continued to publish problems for many years, both in magazines and as a second collection in 1852.[tpl]cite book | author=Weenink, H.G.M. | editor=Hume, G., and White, A.C. | title=The Chess Problem | year=1926 [/tpl][tpl]cite book | title=Classic Chess Problems by Pioneer Composers | author=Howard, K.S. | publisher=Courier Dover | year=1970 | isbn=0-486-22522-4 | url=http://books.google.com/?id=PzNBButOy3oC&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22Classic+Chess+Problems+by+Pioneer+Composers%22+howard   | accessdate=2008-06-17 [/tpl] These brought him to the attention of the "Berlin Pleiades" group, which included some of the strongest players of the time, and he played matches against some of them. Anderssen's development as a player was relatively slow, largely because he could spare neither the time nor the money to play many matches against strong players. Nevertheless by 1846 he was able to put up a good fight against another Pleiades member, Tassilo von Heydebrand und der Lasa, who may have been the world's strongest player at the time.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.chesscafe.com/text/baron.pdf |format=PDF| author=Diggle,G.H. | title=The Baron | publisher=chesscafe.com  | accessdate=2008-06-17 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080626153454/http://www.chesscafe.com/text/baron.pdf| archivedate= 26 June 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] In 1846, he became the editor of the magazine Schachzeitung der Berliner Schachgesellschaft (later called Deutsche Schachzeitung) when its founder Ludwig Bledow, one of the "Berlin Pleiades", died. Anderssen held this post until 1865.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www3.sympatico.ca/g.giffen/periodicals.htm | title=Chess Periodicals  | accessdate=2008-06-17 [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

===London 1851===

In 1848 Anderssen drew a match with the professional player Daniel Harrwitz. On the basis of this match and his general chess reputation, he was invited to represent German chess at the first international chess tournament, to be held in London in 1851. Anderssen was reluctant to accept the invitation, as he was deterred by the travel costs. However the tournament's principal organizer, Howard Staunton, offered to pay Anderssen's travel expenses out of his own pocket if necessary, should Anderssen fail to win a tournament prize. Anderssen accepted this generous offer.[tpl]cite web | url=http://batgirl.atspace.com/Anderssen.html | title=Morphy's opponents: Adolf Anderssen | accessdate=2008-06-17 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080511165040/http://batgirl.atspace.com/Anderssen.html| archivedate= 11 May 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
Anderssen's preparations for the 1851 London International Tournament produced a surge in his playing strength: he played over 100 games in early 1851 against strong opponents including Carl Mayet, Ernst Falkbeer, Max Lange and Jean Dufresne.  The 1851 International Tournament was a knock-out event in which pairs of competitors played short matches, and Anderssen won it by beating Lionel Kieseritzky, József Szén, Staunton, and Marmaduke Wyvill – by margins of at least two games in every case. His prize was two-thirds of the total prize fund of £500, i.e. about £335;[tpl]cite book | title=The Chess Tournament | author=Staunton, H. | publisher=Hardinge Simpole | isbn=1-84382-089-7[/tpl] can be viewed online at or downloaded as PDF from Google Books that is equivalent to about £240,000 ($370,200) in 2006's money.Conversion based on average incomes, which are the most appropriate measure for several days' hard work. If we use average prices for the conversion, the result is about £27,000.
