[[Sir Yellow]]

CATEGORIES: ITV sitcoms

Sir Yellow was a British TV sitcom aired on ITV from 15 July - 19 August 1973. It starred Jimmy Edwards in the title role and also featured Melvyn Hayes, Alan Curtis, and Michael Ripper. The show was set in the 13th century and followed the misadventures of a cowardly, womanising, alcoholic knight. The programme was axed after just one series following bad reviews and was never brought back for a second; in 2003 the TV critic Mark Lewisohn named it "the 20th worst British sitcom of all time" in his book The Radio Times Guide to TV Comedy.
