Billy Gibbons, breaking three decades of silence on the subject, stated reasons for a change in their direction as he discussed a fellow named Linden Hudson to a journalist (Joe Bosso) in June 3, 2013, Gibbons said: “He (Linden) brought some elements to the forefront that helped reshape what ZZ Top were doing, starting in the studio and eventually to the live stage. Linden had no fear and was eager to experiment in ways that would frighten most bands. But we followed suit, and the synthesizers started to show up on record."[tpl]cite web|author=Joe Bosso |url=http://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/billy-gibbons-talks-zz-top-the-complete-studio-albums-1970-1990-575728/8 |title=Billy Gibbons talks ZZ Top: The Complete Studio Albums (1970-1990) | El Loco (1981) |publisher=MusicRadar |date= |accessdate=2013-08-14[/tpl] However, the Eliminator album was not without controversy. According to former stage manager David Blayney (15 years as ZZ Top's stage manager) in his book, Sharp Dressed Men (Hyperion Books), sound engineer Linden Hudson co-wrote much of the material on the album (Eliminator) as a live-in high-tech music teacher to Beard and Gibbons. And, despite continued denials by the band, it settled a five-year legal battle with Hudson, paying him $600,000 after he proved he held the copyright to the song "Thug" which appeared on Eliminator.^ Blayney, David (1994).
