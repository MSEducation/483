The Lee House facing front street was built as a hotel  by Peter Lee in 1844.  It was considered one of the finest inns of the day and hosted a number of prominent guests including Henry Clay and Governor John Chambers.   The inn became a popular stop on the way for summer tourists destined for the Blue Licks Spring.  A number of parties and masked balls were held in its generous rooms.[tpl]cite web|url=http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NRHP/Text/77000634.pdf|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form|accessdate=2010-12-31|work=National Register of Historic Places|publisher=National Park Service[/tpl]
The complex consists of an original structure facing Sutton Street built by Dr. William Murtagh (circa 1798), the building facing Front Street (1844) and a three story addition of 16 hotel rooms (circa 1850).  Most of the design elements are Greek Revival and the brickwork is Flemish bond.   Construction of the floodwall in the early 1950s protected the structure from flooding, but blocked the river view from the lower two stories. 
The structure was bought in 1863 by Charles B. Hill and was known for some time as the Hill House.  In 1977, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
