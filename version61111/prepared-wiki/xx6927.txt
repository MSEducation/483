Lung cancer (also known as carcinoma of the lung) is a malignant lung tumor characterized by uncontrolled cell growth in tissues of the lung. If left untreated, this growth can spread beyond the lung by process of metastasis into nearby tissue or other parts of the body. Most cancers that start in the lung, known as primary lung cancers, are carcinomas that derive from epithelial cells. The main primary types are small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), also called oat cell cancer, and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The most common symptoms are coughing (including coughing up blood), weight loss, shortness of breath, and chest pains.
The most common cause is long-term exposure to tobacco smoke, which causes 80–90% of lung cancers. Nonsmokers account for 10–15% of lung cancer cases, and these cases are often attributed to a combination of genetic factors, and exposure to; radon gas, asbestos, and air pollution including second-hand smoke. Lung cancer may be seen on chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans. The diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy which is usually performed by bronchoscopy or CT-guidance. Treatment and long-term outcomes depend on the type of cancer, the stage (degree of spread), and the person's overall health, measured by performance status.
Common treatments include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. NSCLC is sometimes treated with surgery, whereas SCLC usually responds better to chemotherapy and radiotherapy.[tpl]cite book | last=Chapman | first=S | coauthors=Robinson G, Stradling J, West S | title=Oxford Handbook of Respiratory Medicine | edition=2nd | chapter=Chapter 31 | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2009 | isbn=978-0-19-954516-2 [/tpl] Overall, 15% of people in the United States diagnosed with lung cancer survive five years after the diagnosis, while outcomes on average are worse in the developing world. Worldwide, lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related death in men and women, and was responsible for 1.38 million deaths annually, as of 2008.

==Signs and symptoms==

Signs and symptoms which may suggest lung cancer include:
If the cancer grows in the airways, it may obstruct airflow, causing breathing difficulties. The obstruction can lead to accumulation of secretions behind the blockage, and predispose to pneumonia.
Depending on the type of tumor, so-called paraneoplastic phenomena may initially attract attention to the disease. In lung cancer, these phenomena may include Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome (muscle weakness due to autoantibodies), hypercalcemia, or syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). Tumors in the top of the lung, known as Pancoast tumors, may invade the local part of the sympathetic nervous system, leading to Horner's syndrome (dropping of the eyelid and a small pupil on that side), as well as damage to the brachial plexus.
Many of the symptoms of lung cancer (poor appetite, weight loss, fever, fatigue) are not specific. In many people, the cancer has already spread beyond the original site by the time they have symptoms and seek medical attention. Common sites of spread include the brain, bone, adrenal glands, opposite lung, liver, pericardium, and kidneys. About 10% of people with lung cancer do not have symptoms at diagnosis; these cancers are incidentally found on routine chest radiography.

==Causes==

Cancer develops following genetic damage to DNA and epigenetic changes. These changes affect the normal functions of the cell, including cell proliferation, programmed cell death (apoptosis) and DNA repair. As more damage accumulates, the risk of cancer increases.[tpl]Cite book | last=Brown | first=KM | coauthors=Keats JJ, Sekulic A et al. | title=Holland-Frei Cancer Medicine | publisher=People's Medical Publishing House USA | year=2010 | chapter=Chapter 8 | edition=8th | isbn=978-1-60795-014-1 [/tpl]

===Smoking===

Smoking, particularly of cigarettes, is by far the main contributor to lung cancer. Cigarette smoke contains over 60 known carcinogens, including radioisotopes from the radon decay sequence, nitrosamine, and benzopyrene. Additionally, nicotine appears to depress the immune response to cancerous growths in exposed tissue. Across the developed world, 90% of lung cancer deaths in men during the year 2000 were attributed to smoking (70% for women). Smoking accounts for 80–90% of lung cancer cases.
Passive smoking—the inhalation of smoke from another's smoking—is a cause of lung cancer in nonsmokers. A passive smoker can be classified as someone living or working with a smoker.

Passive smoking causes about 3,400 deaths from lung cancer each year in the USA.
The tar from  marijuana smoke contains many of the same carcinogens of that of tobacco smoke.

===Radon gas===

Radon is a colorless and odorless gas generated by the breakdown of radioactive radium, which in turn is the decay product of uranium, found in the Earth's crust. The radiation decay products ionize genetic material, causing mutations that sometimes turn cancerous. Radon is the second-most common cause of lung cancer in the USA, after smoking. The risk increases 8–16% for every 100 Bq/m³ increase in the radon concentration.[tpl]cite journal |author=Schmid K, Kuwert T, Drexler H |title=Radon in Indoor Spaces: An Underestimated Risk Factor for Lung Cancer in Environmental Medicine |journal=Dtsch Arztebl Int |volume=107 |issue=11 |pages=181–6 |date=March 2010 |pmid=20386676 |pmc=2853156 |doi=10.3238/arztebl.2010.0181 |url=[/tpl] Radon gas levels vary by locality and the composition of the underlying soil and rocks. For example, in areas such as Cornwall in the UK (which has granite as substrata), radon gas is a major problem, and buildings have to be force-ventilated with fans to lower radon gas concentrations. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates one in 15 homes in the US has radon levels above the recommended guideline of 4 picocuries per liter (pCi/l) (148 Bq/m³).

===Asbestos===

Asbestos can cause a variety of lung diseases, including lung cancer. Tobacco smoking and asbestos have a synergistic effect on the formation of lung cancer. Asbestos can also cause cancer of the pleura, called mesothelioma (which is different from lung cancer).[tpl]Cite book | last=Davies | first=RJO | coauthors=Lee YCG | title=Oxford Textbook Medicine | publisher=OUP Oxford | year=2010 | chapter=18.19.3 | edition=5th | isbn=978-0-19-920485-4 [/tpl]

===Air pollution===

Outdoor air pollution has a small effect on increasing the risk of lung cancer.[tpl]Cite book | author=Alberg AJ, Samet JM | title=Murray & Nadel's Textbook of Respiratory Medicine | publisher=Saunders Elsevier | year=2010 | chapter=Chapter 46 | edition=5th | isbn=978-1-4160-4710-0 [/tpl] Fine particulates (PM2.5) and sulfate aerosols, which may be released in traffic exhaust fumes, are associated with slightly increased risk.[tpl]cite journal | last=Chen | first=H | coauthors=Goldberg MS, Villeneuve PJ | journal=Reviews on Environmental Health |date=Oct–Dec 2008 | volume=23 |issue=4 | pages=243–297 | title=A systematic review of the relation between long-term exposure to ambient air pollution and chronic diseases | pmid=19235364 [/tpl] For nitrogen dioxide, an incremental increase of 10 parts per billion increases the risk of lung cancer by 14%.[tpl]cite journal | last=Clapp | first=RW | coauthors=Jacobs MM, Loechler EL | journal=Reviews on Environmental Health |date=Jan–Mar 2008 | volume=23 |issue=1 | pages=1–37 | title=Environmental and Occupational Causes of Cancer New Evidence, 2005–2007 | pmid=18557596 | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2791455/?tool=pubmed | pmc=2791455 | doi=10.1515/REVEH.2008.23.1.1[/tpl] Outdoor air pollution is estimated to account for 1–2% of lung cancers.

===Other causes===

Numerous other substances, occupations, and environmental exposures have been linked to lung cancer. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) states there is "sufficient evidence" to show the following are carcinogenic in the lungs:[tpl]cite journal|last=Cogliano|first=VJ|coauthors=Baan, R; Straif, K; Grosse, Y; Lauby-Secretan, B; El Ghissassi, F; Bouvard, V; Benbrahim-Tallaa, L; Guha, N; Freeman, C; Galichet, L; Wild, CP|title=Preventable exposures associated with human cancers.|journal=Journal of the National Cancer Institute|date=21 December 2011|volume=103|issue=24|pages=1827–39|pmid=22158127|url=http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Classification/Table4.pdf|doi=10.1093/jnci/djr483[/tpl]

==Pathogenesis==

Similar to many other cancers, lung cancer is initiated by activation of oncogenes or inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. Oncogenes are believed to make people more susceptible to cancer. Proto-oncogenes are believed to turn into oncogenes when exposed to particular carcinogens. Mutations in the K-ras proto-oncogene are responsible for 10–30% of lung adenocarcinomas. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) regulates cell proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and tumor invasion. Mutations and amplification of EGFR are common in non-small-cell lung cancer and provide the basis for treatment with EGFR-inhibitors. Her2/neu is affected less frequently. Chromosomal damage can lead to loss of heterozygosity. This can cause inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. Damage to chromosomes 3p, 5q, 13q, and 17p are particularly common in small-cell lung carcinoma. The p53 tumor suppressor gene, located on chromosome 17p, is affected in 60-75% of cases. Other genes that are often mutated or amplified are c-MET, NKX2-1, LKB1, PIK3CA, and BRAF.

==Diagnosis==

Performing a chest radiograph is one of the first investigative steps if a person reports symptoms that may suggest lung cancer. This may reveal an obvious mass, widening of the mediastinum (suggestive of spread to lymph nodes there), atelectasis (collapse), consolidation (pneumonia), or pleural effusion. CT imaging is typically used to provide more information about the type and extent of disease. Bronchoscopy or CT-guided biopsy is often used to sample the tumor for histopathology.
Lung cancer often appears as a solitary pulmonary nodule on a chest radiograph. However, the differential diagnosis is wide. Many other diseases can also give this appearance, including tuberculosis, fungal infections, metastatic cancer, or organizing pneumonia. Less common causes of a solitary pulmonary nodule include hamartomas, bronchogenic cysts, adenomas, arteriovenous malformation, pulmonary sequestration, rheumatoid nodules, Wegener's granulomatosis, or lymphoma.[tpl]Cite book | last=Miller |first=WT | title=Fishman's Pulmonary Diseases and Disorders | publisher=McGraw-Hill | year=2008 | page=486 | edition=4th | isbn=0-07-145739-9 [/tpl] Lung cancer can also be an incidental finding, as a solitary pulmonary nodule on a chest radiograph or CT scan done for an unrelated reason.[tpl]Cite book | last=Kaiser | first=LR | title=Fishman's Pulmonary Diseases and Disorders | publisher=McGraw-Hill | year=2008 | pages=1815–1816 | edition=4th | isbn=0-07-145739-9 [/tpl] The definitive diagnosis of lung cancer is based on histological examination of the suspicious tissue in the context of the clinical and radiological features.

===Classification===

Lung cancers are classified according to histological type. This classification is important for determining management and predicting outcomes of the disease. Lung cancers are carcinomas—malignancies that arise from epithelial cells. Lung carcinomas are categorized by the size and appearance of the malignant cells seen by a histopathologist under a microscope. For therapeutic purpose, two broad classes are distinguished: non-small cell lung carcinoma and small cell lung carcinoma.

====Non-small-cell lung carcinoma====

The three main subtypes of NSCLC are adenocarcinoma, squamous-cell carcinoma and large-cell carcinoma.
Nearly 40% of lung cancers are adenocarcinoma, which usually originates in peripheral lung tissue.[tpl]cite book | last=Lu | first=C | coauthors=Onn A, Vaporciyan AA et al. | title=Holland-Frei Cancer Medicine | edition=8th | chapter=78: Cancer of the Lung | publisher=People's Medical Publishing House | year=2010 |isbn=978-1-60795-014-1 [/tpl] Most cases of adenocarcinoma are associated with smoking; however, among people who have smoked fewer than 100 cigarettes in their lifetimes ("never-smokers"), adenocarcinoma is the most common form of lung cancer.[tpl]cite journal | last=Subramanian | first=J | coauthors=Govindan R |title=Lung cancer in never smokers: a review | journal=Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume=25 | issue=5 | pages=561–570| publisher=American Society of Clinical Oncology |date=February 2007 | pmid=17290066 |doi=10.1200/JCO.2006.06.8015 [/tpl] A subtype of adenocarcinoma, the bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, is more common in female never-smokers, and may have a better long term survival.
Squamous-cell carcinoma accounts for about 30% of lung cancers. They typically occur close to large airways. A hollow cavity and associated cell death are commonly found at the center of the tumor. About 9% of lung cancers are large-cell carcinoma. These are so named because the cancer cells are large, with excess cytoplasm, large nuclei and conspicuous nucleoli.

====Small-cell lung carcinoma====

In small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), the cells contain dense neurosecretory granules (vesicles containing neuroendocrine hormones), which give this tumor an endocrine/paraneoplastic syndrome association. Most cases arise in the larger airways (primary and secondary bronchi). These cancers grow quickly and spread early in the course of the disease. Sixty to seventy percent have metastatic disease at presentation. This type of lung cancer is strongly associated with smoking.

====Others====

Four main histological subtypes are recognized, although some cancers may contain a combination of different subtypes.[tpl]cite book | last=Maitra | first=A | coauthors=Kumar V | year=2007 | title=Robbins Basic Pathology |edition=8th | publisher=Saunders Elsevier | pages=528–529 | isbn=978-1-4160-2973-1 [/tpl] Rare subtypes include glandular tumors, carcinoid tumors, and undifferentiated carcinomas.

===Metastasis===

The lung is a common place for the spread of tumors from other parts of the body. Secondary cancers are classified by the site of origin; e.g., breast cancer that has spread to the lung is called metastatic breast cancer. Metastases often have a characteristic round appearance on chest radiograph.
Primary lung cancers themselves most commonly metastasize to the brain, bones, liver, and adrenal glands. Immunostaining of a biopsy is often helpful to determine the original source.[tpl]cite journal |author=Tan D, Zander DS |title=Immunohistochemistry for Assessment of Pulmonary and Pleural Neoplasms: A Review and Update |journal=Int J Clin Exp Pathol |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=19–31 |year=2008|pmid=18784820 |pmc=2480532 [/tpl]

===Staging===

Lung cancer staging is an assessment of the degree of spread of the cancer from its original source. It is one of the factors affecting the prognosis and potential treatment of lung cancer.
The initial evaluation of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) staging uses the TNM classification. This is based on the size of the primary tumor, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis. After this, using the TNM descriptors, a group is assigned, ranging from occult cancer, through stages 0, IA (one-A), IB, IIA, IIB, IIIA, IIIB and IV (four). This stage group assists with the choice of treatment and estimation of prognosis.[tpl]Cite journal | last=Rami-Porta | first=R | coauthors=Crowley JJ, Goldstraw P | title=The revised TNM staging system for lung cancer | journal=Annals of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery | volume=15 | issue=1 | pages=4–9 |date=February 2009 | url=http://www.atcs.jp/pdf/2009_15_1/4.pdf | pmid=19262443 [/tpl]
Small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) has traditionally been classified as 'limited stage' (confined to one half of the chest and within the scope of a single tolerable radiotherapy field) or 'extensive stage' (more widespread disease). However, the TNM classification and grouping are useful in estimating prognosis.
For both NSCLC and SCLC, the two general types of staging evaluations are clinical staging and surgical staging. Clinical staging is performed prior to definitive surgery. It is based on the results of imaging studies (such as CT scans and PET scans) and biopsy results. Surgical staging is evaluated either during or after the operation, and is based on the combined results of surgical and clinical findings, including surgical sampling of thoracic lymph nodes.

==Prevention==

Prevention is the most cost-effective means of decreasing lung cancer development. While in most countries industrial and domestic carcinogens have been identified and banned, tobacco smoking is still widespread. Eliminating tobacco smoking is a primary goal in the prevention of lung cancer, and smoking cessation is an important preventive tool in this process.[tpl]cite journal | last=Goodman | first=GE | title=Lung cancer. 1: prevention of lung cancer | journal=Thorax | volume=57 | issue=11 |date=November 2002 | pages=994–999 | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1746232/pdf/v057p00994.pdf | pmid=12403886 | pmc=1746232 | doi=10.1136/thorax.57.11.994[/tpl]

More rigorous studies have not demonstrated a clear association between diet and lung cancer risk.

===Screening===

Screening refers to the use of medical tests to detect disease in asymptomatic people. Possible screening tests for lung cancer include sputum cytology, chest radiograph (CXR), and computed tomography (CT). Screening programs using CXR or cytology have not demonstrated benefit.[tpl]Cite journal | last=Manser | first=RL | coauthors=Irving LB, Stone C et al. | title=Screening for lung cancer | journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue=1 | pages=CD001991 | year=2004 | pmid=14973979 | doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001991.pub2 [/tpl] Screening those at high risk (i.e. age 55 to 79 who have smoked more than 30 pack years or those who have had previous lung cancer) annually with low-dose CT scans may reduce the chance of death from lung cancer by an absolute amount of 0.3% (relative amount of 20%).[tpl]cite journal | last=Jaklitsch | first=MT | coauthors=Jacobson FL, Austin JH et al. | title=The American Association for Thoracic Surgery guidelines for lung cancer screening using low-dose computed tomography scans for lung cancer survivors and other high-risk groups | journal=Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery |date=July 2012 | volume=144 | issue=1 | pages=33–38 | pmid=22710039 | doi=10.1016/j.jtcvs.2012.05.060[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | last=Bach | first=PB | coauthors=Mirkin JN, Oliver TK et al. | title=Benefits and harms of CT screening for lung cancer: a systematic review | journal=JAMA: the Journal of the American Medical Association |date=June 2012 | volume=307 | issue=22 | pages=2418–2429 | pmid=22610500 | doi=10.1001/jama.2012.5521[/tpl] There is, however, a high rate of falsely positive scans which may result in unneeded invasive procedures as well as substantial financial cost.[tpl]cite journal|last=Boiselle|first=PM|title=Computed tomography screening for lung cancer.|journal=JAMA: the Journal of the American Medical Association|date=20 March 2013|volume=309|issue=11|pages=1163–70|pmid=23512063|doi=10.1001/jama.2012.216988[/tpl] For each true positive scan there are more than 19 false positives.[tpl]cite journal |author=Bach PB, Mirkin JN, Oliver TK, et al. |title=Benefits and harms of CT screening for lung cancer: a systematic review |journal=JAMA |volume=307 |issue=22 |pages=2418–29 |date=June 2012 |pmid=22610500 |doi=10.1001/jama.2012.5521 |url=[/tpl] Radiation exposure is another potential harm from screening.[tpl]cite journal|last=Aberle|first=DR|coauthors=Abtin, F; Brown, K|title=Computed tomography screening for lung cancer: has it finally arrived?

==Management==

Treatment for lung cancer depends on the cancer's specific cell type, how far it has spread, and the person's performance status. Common treatments include palliative care,[tpl]cite journal | last=Ferrell | first=B | coauthors=Koczywas M, Grannis F, Harrington A | title=Palliative care in lung cancer | journal=Surgical Clinics of North America | volume=91 | issue=2 | pages=403–417 |date=April 2011 | pmid=21419260 | doi=10.1016/j.suc.2010.12.003[/tpl] surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.

===Surgery===

If investigations confirm NSCLC, the stage is assessed to determine whether the disease is localized and amenable to surgery or if it has spread to the point where it cannot be cured surgically. CT scan and positron emission tomography are used for this determination. If mediastinal lymph node involvement is suspected, mediastinoscopy may be used to sample the nodes and assist staging.[tpl]Cite book | author=Kaiser LR | title=Fishman's Pulmonary Diseases and Disorders | publisher=McGraw-Hill | year=2008 | pages=1853–1854 | edition=4th | isbn=0-07-145739-9 [/tpl] Blood tests and pulmonary function testing are used to assess whether a person is well enough for surgery. If pulmonary function tests reveal poor respiratory reserve, surgery may not be a possibility.
In most cases of early-stage NSCLC, removal of a lobe of lung (lobectomy) is the surgical treatment of choice. In people who are unfit for a full lobectomy, a smaller sublobar excision (wedge resection) may be performed. However, wedge resection has a higher risk of recurrence than lobectomy.[tpl]Cite book | author=Kaiser LR | title=Fishman's Pulmonary Diseases and Disorders | publisher=McGraw-Hill | year=2008 | pages=1855–1856 | edition=4th | isbn=0-07-145739-9 [/tpl] Radioactive iodine brachytherapy at the margins of wedge excision may reduce the risk of recurrence.[tpl]cite journal | last=Odell | first=DD | coauthors=Kent MS, Fernando HC | title=Sublobar resection with brachytherapy mesh for stage I non-small cell lung cancer | journal=Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery | volume=22 | issue=1 | pages=32–37 |date=Spring 2010 | pmid=20813314 | doi=10.1053/j.semtcvs.2010.04.003[/tpl] Rarely, removal of a whole lung (pneumonectomy) is performed.

In SCLC, chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy is typically used.[tpl]cite journal |author=Simon GR, Turrisi A |title=Management of small cell lung cancer: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (2nd edition) |journal=Chest |volume=132 |issue=3 Suppl |pages=324S–339S |date=September 2007 |pmid=17873178 |doi=10.1378/chest.07-1385 |url=http://chestjournal.chestpubs.org/content/132/3_suppl/324S.long[/tpl] However the role of surgery in SCLC is being reconsidered.

===Radiotherapy===

Radiotherapy is often given together with chemotherapy, and may be used with curative intent in people with NSCLC who are not eligible for surgery. This form of high-intensity radiotherapy is called radical radiotherapy. A refinement of this technique is continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy (CHART), in which a high dose of radiotherapy is given in a short time period.[tpl]Cite journal | last=Hatton | first=MQ | coauthors=Martin JE | title=Continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy (CHART) and non-conventionally fractionated radiotherapy in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer: a review and consideration of future directions | journal=Clinical Oncology (Royal College of Radiologists) | volume=22 | issue=5 | pages=356–364 |date=June 2010 | pmid=20399629 | doi=10.1016/j.clon.2010.03.010[/tpl] Postoperative thoracic radiotherapy generally should not be used after curative intent surgery for NSCLC.

For potentially curable SCLC cases, chest radiotherapy is often recommended in addition to chemotherapy.
If cancer growth blocks a short section of bronchus, brachytherapy (localized radiotherapy) may be given directly inside the airway to open the passage.[tpl]Cite journal | last=Cardona | first=AF | coauthors=Reveiz L, Ospina EG et al. | title=Palliative endobronchial brachytherapy for non-small cell lung cancer | journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue=2 | pages=CD004284 |date=April 2008 | pmid=18425900 | doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004284.pub2[/tpl] Compared to external beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy allows a reduction in treatment time and reduced radiation exposure to healthcare staff.[tpl]Cite journal | last=Ikushima | first=H | title=Radiation therapy: state of the art and the future | journal=Journal of Medical Investigation | volume=57 | issue=1–2 | pages=1–11 |date=February 2010 | url=http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jmi/57/1,2/1/_pdf | pmid=20299738 [/tpl]
Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) is a type of radiotherapy to the brain, used to reduce the risk of metastasis. PCI is most useful in SCLC. In limited-stage disease, PCI increases three-year survival from 15% to 20%; in extensive disease, one-year survival increases from 13% to 27%.[tpl]Cite journal | last=Paumier | first=A | coauthors=Cuenca X, Le Péchoux C | title=Prophylactic cranial irradiation in lung cancer | journal=Cancer Treatment Reviews | volume=37 | issue=4 | pages=261–265 |date=June 2011 | pmid=20934256 | doi=10.1016/j.ctrv.2010.08.009[/tpl]
Recent improvements in targeting and imaging have led to the development of stereotactic radiation in the treatment of early-stage lung cancer. In this form of radiotherapy, high doses are delivered in a small number of sessions using stereotactic targeting techniques. Its use is primarily in patients who are not surgical candidates due to medical comorbidities.[tpl]Cite journal | last=Girard | first=N | coauthors=Mornex F | title=Stereotactic radiotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer: From concept to clinical reality. 2011 update | journal=Cancer Radiothérapie | volume=15 | issue=6–7 | pages=522–526 |date=October 2011 | pmid=21889901 | doi=10.1016/j.canrad.2011.07.241[/tpl]
For both NSCLC and SCLC patients, smaller doses of radiation to the chest may be used for symptom control (palliative radiotherapy).[tpl]Cite journal | last=Fairchild | first=A | coauthors=Harris K, Barnes E et al. | title=Palliative thoracic radiotherapy for lung cancer: a systematic review | journal=Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume=26 | issue=24 | pages=4001–4011 |date=August 2008 | pmid=18711191 | url=http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/26/24/4001.full | doi=10.1200/JCO.2007.15.3312[/tpl]

===Chemotherapy===

The chemotherapy regimen depends on the tumor type. Small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), even relatively early stage disease, is treated primarily with chemotherapy and radiation.[tpl]cite journal |author=Hann CL, Rudin CM |title=Management of small-cell lung cancer: incremental changes but hope for the future |journal=Oncology (Williston Park)|date=30 November 2008|volume=22|issue=13|pages=1486–92 |pmid=19133604[/tpl] In SCLC, cisplatin and etoposide are most commonly used. Combinations with carboplatin, gemcitabine, paclitaxel, vinorelbine, topotecan, and irinotecan are also used. In advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), chemotherapy improves survival and is used as first-line treatment, provided the person is well enough for the treatment. Typically, two drugs are used, of which one is often platinum-based (either cisplatin or carboplatin). Other commonly used drugs are gemcitabine, paclitaxel, docetaxel,[tpl]Cite book | author=Mehra R, Treat J | title=Fishman's Pulmonary Diseases and Disorders | publisher=McGraw-Hill | year=2008 | page=1876 | edition=4th | isbn=0-07-145739-9 [/tpl] pemetrexed,[tpl]cite journal |author=Fuld AD, Dragnev KH, Rigas JR |title=Pemetrexed in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer |journal=Expert Opin Pharmacother |volume=11 |issue=8 |pages=1387–402 |date=June 2010 |pmid=20446853 |doi=10.1517/14656566.2010.482560 [/tpl] etoposide or vinorelbine.
Adjuvant chemotherapy refers to the use of chemotherapy after apparently curative surgery to improve the outcome. In NSCLC, samples are taken of nearby lymph nodes during surgery to assist staging. If stage II or III disease is confirmed, adjuvant chemotherapy improves survival by 5% at five years.[tpl]Cite journal | last=Carbone | first=DP | coauthors=Felip E | title=Adjuvant therapy in non-small cell lung cancer: future treatment prospects and paradigms | journal=Clinical Lung Cancer | volume=12 | issue=5 | pages=261–271 |date=September 2011 | pmid=21831720 | doi=10.1016/j.cllc.2011.06.002 [/tpl][tpl]Cite journal | last=Le Chevalier | first=T | title=Adjuvant chemotherapy for resectable non-small-cell lung cancer: where is it going? | journal=Annals of Oncology | volume=21 | issue=Suppl. 7 | pages=vii196–198 |date=October 2010 | pmid=20943614 | url=http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/suppl_7/vii196.long | doi=10.1093/annonc/mdq376[/tpl] The combination of vinorelbine and cisplatin is more effective than older regimens. Adjuvant chemotherapy for people with stage IB cancer is controversial, as clinical trials have not clearly demonstrated a survival benefit. Trials of preoperative chemotherapy (neoadjuvant chemotherapy) in resectable NSCLC have been inconclusive.
Chemotherapy may be combined with palliative care in the treatment of the NSCLC. In advanced cases, appropriate chemotherapy improves average survival over supportive care alone, as well as improving quality of life.[tpl]cite journal|author=Souquet PJ, Chauvin F, Boissel JP, Bernard JP |title=Meta-analysis of randomised trials of systemic chemotherapy versus supportive treatment in non-resectable non-small cell lung cancer |journal=Lung Cancer |volume=12 Suppl 1 |issue= |pages=S147–54|date=April 1995 |pmid=7551923 |doi=10.1016/0169-5002(95)00430-9 [/tpl] With adequate physical fitness maintaining chemotherapy during lung cancer palliation offers 1.5 to 3 months of prolongation of survival, symptomatic relief, and an improvement in quality of life, with better results seen with modern agents.[tpl]cite journal |author=Sörenson S, Glimelius B, Nygren P |title=A systematic overview of chemotherapy effects in non-small cell lung cancer |journal=Acta Oncologica |volume=40 |issue=2–3 |pages=327–39 |year=2001 |pmid=11441939 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Clegg A, Scott DA, Sidhu M, Hewitson P, Waugh N |title=A rapid and systematic review of the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of paclitaxel, docetaxel, gemcitabine and vinorelbine in non-small-cell lung cancer |journal=Health Technology Assessment |volume=5 |issue=32 |pages=1–195 |year=2001 |pmid=12065068 [/tpl] The NSCLC Meta-Analyses Collaborative Group recommends if the recipient wants and can tolerate treatment, then chemotherapy should be considered in advanced NSCLC.[tpl]cite journal |title=Chemotherapy in Addition to Supportive Care Improves Survival in Advanced Non–Small-Cell Lung Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Individual Patient Data From 16 Randomized Controlled Trials |journal=J.

For individuals who have more advanced disease, hospice care may also be appropriate.

==Prognosis==

Prognosis is generally poor. Of all people with lung cancer, about 15% survive for five years after diagnosis in the United States. Outcomes are generally worse in the developing world.[tpl]cite book|last=Majumder|first=edited by Sadhan|title=Stem cells and cancer|year=2009|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-0-387-89611-3|page=193|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=HaErOupWnO0C&pg=PA193|edition=Online-Ausg.[/tpl] Stage is often advanced at the time of diagnosis. At presentation, 30–40% of cases of NSCLC are stage IV, and 60% of SCLC are stage IV.
Prognostic factors in NSCLC include presence or absence of pulmonary symptoms, tumor size, cell type (histology), degree of spread (stage) and metastases to multiple lymph nodes, and vascular invasion. For people with inoperable disease, outcomes are worse in those with poor performance status and weight loss of more than 10%.[ref]
