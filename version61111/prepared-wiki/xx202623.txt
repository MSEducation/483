</ref> One thunderstorm produced several tornadoes across [[Kingfisher County, Oklahoma|Kingfisher]] and [[Garfield County, Oklahoma|Garfield]] Counties south of [[Enid, Oklahoma|Enid]]. Most tornadoes were caught on tape by a helicopter reporter for [[KWTV-TV]] in [[Oklahoma City]] which was also repeatedly broadcast on [[CNN]]. One of the tornadoes captured live on CNN and KWTV destroyed a hog farm. None of the employees who worked at the farm were injured, although a few pigs inside the structures were hurt. However, none of the pigs were found dead.<ref>
