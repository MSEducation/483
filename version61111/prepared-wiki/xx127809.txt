[[Magmatism]]

CATEGORIES: Geological processes

The formation of igneous rocks from magma is known as Magmatism.
Magmatism is a process responsible for mountain formation. The process of magmatism produces an additional mass and volume to the Earthâ€™s surface. For example the formation of volcanoes or island arcs at convergent plate boundaries. Or mid-ocean ridges and therefore ocean-floor spreading at divergent plate boundaries.
Magmas form by partial melting of silicate rocks either in Earth's mantle, the continental or the oceanic crust.
