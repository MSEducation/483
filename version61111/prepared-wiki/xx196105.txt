Leading interpreters of Harmonium give Colloquy a wide
berth. Buttel omits it from his index catalog of the collection's
poems. Bates steers clear of it similarly. The poem is a contribution to one of Stevens's major themes,Vendler writes, "Some readers have seen his subject as an epistemological one, and have written about his views on the imagination and its uneasy rapport with reality. Others have seen his subject as a moral one, a justification of an aesthetic hedonism. Still others have seen his subject as a native humanist one, the quest of the American Adam for a Paradise in the wilderness." (3) the relationship between imagination and reality. The poet's imaginative dream transforms the common drudge into women swathed in indigo, etc.
