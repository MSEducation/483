</ref>  In the 1990s, Kodak planned a decade-long journey to move to digital technology. CEO [[George M. C. Fisher]] reached out to Microsoft and other new consumer merchandisers. [[Apple Inc.|Apple's]] pioneering [[QuickTake]] consumer digital cameras, introduced in 1994, had the Apple label but were produced by Kodak.  The [[Kodak DC Series#Kodak DC20|DC-20 and DC-25]] launched in 1996. Overall, though, there was little implementation of the new digital strategy. Kodak's core business faced no pressure from competing technologies, and as Kodak executives could not fathom a world without traditional film there was little incentive to deviate from that course. Consumers gradually switched to the digital offering from companies such as Sony. In 2001 film sales dropped, which was attributed by Kodak to the financial shocks caused by the [[September 11 attacks]]. Executives hoped that Kodak might be able to slow the shift to digital through aggressive marketing.<ref name="businessweek1">[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_48/b4011421.htm |title=Mistakes Made On The Road To Innovation |publisher=Businessweek.com |date=November 27, 2006 |accessdate=January 19, 2012[/tpl]</ref>
Under Daniel Carp, Fisher's successor as CEO, Kodak made its move in the digital camera market, with its EasyShare family of digital cameras. Kodak spent tremendous resources studying customer behavior, finding out that women in particular loved taking digital photos but were frustrated in moving them to their computers. This key unmet consumer need became a major opportunity. Once Kodak got its product development machine started, it released a wide range of products which made it easy to share photos via PCs. One of their key innovations was a printer dock, where consumers could insert their cameras into this compact device, press a button, and watch their photos roll out. By 2005, Kodak ranked No. 1 in the U.S. in digital camera sales that surged 40% to $5.7 billion.
Despite the high growth, Kodak failed to anticipate how fast these digital cameras became commodities, with low profit margins, as more companies entered the market in the mid-2000s.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-19/kodak-bankruptcy-may-shed-photography-bet-on-digital-printing.html | work=Bloomberg | first1=Beth | last1=Jinks | first2=Mary | last2=Childs | title=Kodak Bankruptcy May Shed Photography, Bet on Digital Printing | date=January 20, 2012[/tpl] In 2001 Kodak held the No. 2 spot in U.S. digital camera sales (behind Sony) but it lost $60 USD on every camera sold, while there was also a dispute between employees from its digital and film divisions.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/kodak-what-led-to-bankruptcy/article1-800633.aspx |title=Kodak:What led to bankruptcy - Hindustan Times |publisher=HindustanTimes.com |date= January 22, 2012|accessdate=January 31, 2014[/tpl] The film business, where Kodak enjoyed high profit margins, fell 18% in 2005. The combination of these two factors resulted in disappointing profits overall. Its digital cameras soon became undercut by Asian competitors that could produce their offerings more cheaply. Kodak had a 27 percent market-leading share in 1999, that dwindled to 15 percent by 2003. In 2007 Kodak was No. 4 in U.S. digital camera sales with a 9.6 percent share, and by 2010 it held 7 percent in seventh place behind Canon, Sony, Nikon, and others, according to research firm IDC.[tpl]cite news|last=Scheyder |first=Ernest |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/12/24/us-eastman-kodak-idUSTRE7BN06B20111224 |title=As Kodak struggles, Eastman Chemical thrives |publisher=Reuters |date= December 24, 2011|accessdate=January 19, 2012[/tpl] Also an ever-smaller percentage of digital pictures were being taken on dedicated digital cameras, being gradually displaced in the late 2000s by cameras on cellphones, smartphones, and tablets.
In a critical essay, physicist Frank Duarte has argued that several major analog-era imaging companies (including Canon, Nikon, Leica, and Fuji) successfully transitioned from analog to digital, thus indicating that the switch to digital technology is not the only reason for Kodak's decline.F. J. Duarte, Laser Physicist (Optics Journal, New York, 2012) pp. 133-136. A significant factor, in addition to managerial ineptitude, he argues, was the transformation (begun in the early 1990s) from a widely diversified chemical manufacturer to a company mainly focused on imaging.

===New strategy===

Kodak then began a strategy shift: Previously Kodak had done everything in-house, but CEO Antonio Perez shut down film factories and eliminated 27,000 jobs as it outsourced its manufacturing.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505124_162-57336641/kodak-yahoo-and-rim-death-comes-for-us-all/ |title=Kodak, Yahoo and RIM: Death comes for us all |publisher=CBS | work = News | accessdate = January 19, 2012[/tpl] Perez invested heavily in digital technologies and new services that capitalized on its technology innovation to boost profit margins. He also spent hundreds of millions of dollars to build up a high-margin printer ink business to replace shriveling film sales.  Kodak's ink strategy rejected the razor and blades business model used by the dominant market leader Hewlett-Packard in that Kodak's printers were expensive but the ink was cheaper.[tpl]cite news | url= http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/21/business/kodaks-bet-on-its-printers-fails-to-quell-the-doubters.html?pagewanted=print | work =The New York Times | first=Andrew | last=Martin | title=Kodak's Bet on Its Printers Fails to Quell the Doubters | date=October 20, 2011[/tpl] As of 2011, these new lines of inkjet printers were said to be on verge of turning a profit, although some analysts were skeptical as printouts had been replaced gradually by electronic copies on computers, tablets, and smartphones. Home photograph printers, high-speed commercial inkjet presses, workflow software, and packaging were viewed as the company's new core businesses, with sales from those four businesses projected to double to nearly $2 billion in revenue in 2013 and account for 25 percent of all sales. However, while Kodak named home printers as a core business as late as August 2012, at the end of September declining sales forced Kodak to announce an exit from the consumer inkjet market.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2012/09/28/kodak-quits-printer-business/1600265/|title=Kodak quits printers, wants new deadline|publisher=USA Today|date=September 28, 2012|accessdate=September 29, 2012[/tpl]
Kodak has also turned to litigation in order to generate revenue. In 2010, it received $838 million from patent licensing that included a settlement with LG.
In 2011, despite the turnaround progress, Kodak rapidly used up its cash reserves, stoking fears of bankruptcy; it had $957 million in cash in June 2011, down from $1.6 billion in January 2001.[tpl]cite web|url = http://ibnlive.in.com/news/kodak-prepares-for-bankruptcy-filing-report/218047-7.html | title= Kodak may file for bankruptcy | type = Report | work = IBNLive | publisher = IN | accessdate = January 19, 2012[/tpl] In 2011, Kodak reportedly explored selling off or licensing its vast portfolio of patents in order to stave off bankruptcy. By January 2012, analysts suggested that the company could enter bankruptcy followed by an auction of its patents, as it was reported to be in talks with Citigroup to provide debtor-in-possession financing.[tpl]cite news| last= Haunss |first= Kristen |url = http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-13/kodak-said-to-hold-talks-with-citigroup-on-bankruptcy-financing.html | title= Kodak Said in Talks With Citigroup on Bankruptcy Financing | publisher = Bloomberg | date =January 13, 2012 |accessdate=January 19, 2012[/tpl] This was confirmed on January 19, 2012, when the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and obtained a $950 million, 18-month credit facility from Citigroup to enable it to continue operations.  Under the terms of its bankruptcy protection, Kodak had a deadline of February 15, 2013 to produce a reorganization plan.[tpl]cite news| title = Kodak gets 2013 deadline to reorganise| publisher = IN | url = http://ibnlive.in.com/news/kodak-gets-2013-deadline-to-reorganise/222878-11.html | accessdate =January 21, 2012| work =IBNLive[/tpl]
In April 2013, Kodak showed its first Micro Four Thirds camera, to be manufactured by JK Imaging.[tpl]Citation | last = 明 | first = 星编辑 | date = 2013‐4‐19 18h40 | url = http://dcdv.zol.com.cn/368/3680754.html | title = P&E：单电外观曝光 柯达重现展会现场 | year = 2013 | publisher = Zol | place = CN | language = Chinese[/tpl][tpl]Citation | url = http://www.43rumors.com/new-pictures-of-the-kodak-s1-mft-camera/ | title = New pictures of the Kodak S1 MFT camera… | publisher = Four Thirds Rumors | date = April 25, 2013[/tpl]
On September 3, 2013, Kodak announced that it emerged from bankruptcy as a technology company focused on imaging for business.  Its main business segments are Digital Printing & Enterprise and Graphics, Entertainment & Commercial Films.
On March 12, 2014, Kodak announced that Jeffrey J. Clarke had been named the new CEO. http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20140312005708/en/Jeff-Clarke-Elected-CEO-Kodak#.UyBnas51nsL

===GECF===

====Graphics====

Kodak’s Graphics business consists of computer to plate (CTP) devices, which Kodak first launched in 1995 when the company introduced the first thermal CTP to market. In CTP, an output device exposes a digital image using SQUAREspot laser imaging technology directly to an aluminum surface (printing plate), which is then mounted onto a printing press to reproduce the image.  Kodak’s Graphics portfolio includes front-end controllers, production workflow software, CTP output devices, and digital plates.

====Global Technical Services====

Kodak’s Global Technical Services (“GTS”) for Commercial Imaging is focused on selling service contracts for Kodak products, including the following service categories: field services, customer support services, educational services, and professional services.

E&CF also offers Aerial and Industrial Films including KODAK Printed Circuit Board film, and delivers external sales for the company’s component businesses: Polyester Film, Specialty Chemicals, Inks and Dispersions and Solvent Recovery.

====Motion picture and TV production====

The Kodak company holds a vital role in the invention and development of the motion picture industry. Many cinema and TV productions are shot on Kodak film stocks.[tpl]cite news | url= http://variety.com/2013/biz/news/kodak-emerges-from-bankruptcy-1200597234/ |title=Kodak Emerges From Bankruptcy | date=September 3, 2013 | accessdate= January 31, 2014 | work=Variety[/tpl]
The company helped set the standard of 35 mm film, and introduced the 16 mm film format for home movie use and lower budget film productions.
The home market-oriented 8 mm and Super 8 formats were also developed by Kodak. Kodak also entered the professional television production video tape market, briefly in the mid-1980s, under the product portfolio name of Eastman Professional Video Tape Products. In 1990, Kodak launched a Worldwide Student Program working with university faculty throughout the world to help nurture the future generation of film-makers. Kodak formed Educational Advisory Councils in the US, Europe and Asia made up of Deans and Chairs of some of the most prestigious film schools throughout the world to help guide the development of their program.
Kodak previously owned the visual effects film post-production facilities Cinesite in Los Angeles and London and also LaserPacific in Los Angeles.  Kodak sold Cinesite to Endless LLP, an independent British private equity house.[tpl]cite news | url= http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2012/05/kodak-sells-cinesite-visual-effects-depp-stranger-tides.html#sthash.Jv1AxyyD.dpuf |title=Kodak sells British visual effects house Cinesite| date=May 10, 2012 | accessdate= January 31, 2014 | work=Los Angeles Times[/tpl]

Kodak also sold Pro-Tek Media Preservation Services, a film storage company in Burbank, California, in October 2013.[tpl]cite news | url= http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lac-group-acquires-kodaks-pro-tek-film-preservation-subsidiary-to-expand-information-curation-and-stewardship-services-227997511.html | title= LAC Group Acquires Kodak's PRO-TEK Film Preservation Subsidiary to Expand Information Curation and Stewardship Services | date=October 16, 2013 | accessdate= November 11, 2013[/tpl]

====Technical support and on-site service====

Aside from technical phone support for their products, Kodak offers onsite service for other devices such as document scanners, data storage systems (optical, tape, and disk), printers, inkjet printing presses, microfilm/microfiche equipment, photograph kiosks, and photocopiers, for which they dispatch technicians who make repairs in the field.

====Other====

Kodak markets Picture CDs and other photo products such as calendars, photo books and photo enlargements through retail partners such as CVS, Walmart and Target and through its Kodak Gallery online service, formerly known as Ofoto.

===Former===

====Still film cameras====

On January 13, 2004, Kodak announced it would stop marketing traditional still film cameras (excluding disposable cameras) in the United States, Canada and Western Europe, but would continue to sell film cameras in India, Latin America, Eastern Europe and China.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3394183.stm | work=BBC News | title=Kodak embraces digital revolution | date=January 13, 2004 | accessdate=May 1, 2010[/tpl] By the end of 2005, Kodak ceased manufacturing cameras that used the Advanced Photo System. Kodak licensed the manufacture of Kodak branded cameras to Vivitar in 2005 and 2006. After 2007 Kodak did not license the manufacture of any film camera with the Kodak name.

====Instant cameras====

After losing a patent battle with Polaroid Corporation, Kodak left the instant camera business on January 9, 1986. The Kodak instant camera included models known as the Kodamatic and the Colorburst.
Polaroid was awarded damages in the patent trial in the amount of $909,457,567.00, a record at the time. (Polaroid Corp. v. Eastman Kodak Co., U.S. District Court District of Massachusetts, decided October 12, 1990, case no. 76-1634-MA. Published in the U.S. Patent Quarterly as 16 USPQ2d 1481).

Kodak was the exclusive supplier of negatives for Polaroid cameras from 1963 until 1969, when Polaroid chose to manufacture its own instant film.

====Image sensors====

As part of its move toward higher end products, Kodak announced on September 15, 2006 that the new Leica M8 camera incorporates Kodak's KAF-10500 image sensor. This was the second recent partnership between Kodak and the German optical manufacturer. In 2011, Kodak sold its Image Sensor Solutions business to Platinum Equity, who subsequently renamed it Truesense Imaging, Inc.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.truesenseimaging.com/about-us/history | title=History — Truesense Imaging, Inc.[/tpl]

====Digital cameras and video cameras====

Many of Kodak's early compact digital cameras were designed and built by Chinon Industries, a Japanese camera manufacturer. In 2004 Kodak Japan acquired Chinon and many of its engineers and designers joined Kodak Japan.
The Kodak DCS series of digital single-lens reflex cameras and digital camera backs were released by Kodak in the 1990s and 2000s, and discontinued in 2005. They were based on existing 35mm film SLRs from Nikon and Canon and the range included the original Kodak DCS, the first commercially-available digital SLR.
In July 2006 Kodak announced that Flextronics would manufacture and help design its digital cameras.

====Digital picture frames====

Kodak first entered the digital picture frame market with the Kodak Smart Picture Frame in the fourth quarter of 2000. It was designed by Weave Innovations and licensed to Kodak with an exclusive relationship with Weave's StoryBox online photo network.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.gadgetcentral.com/weave_storybox.htm | title=Weave Innovations StoryBox | date=April 4, 2000 | publisher=Gadget Central[/tpl] Smart Frame owners connected to the network via an analog telephone connection built into the frame. The frame could hold 36 images internally and came with a six-month free subscription to the StoryBox network.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.twice.com/article/CA66632.html | title=Digital Frames Make Inroads In Consumer Market | date=March 12, 2001 | first=Greg | last=Scoblete | publisher=Twice | accessdate=January 7, 2008[/tpl]
Kodak re-entered the digital photo frame market at CES in 2007 with the introduction of four new EasyShare-branded models that were available in sizes from 200 to 280 mm (8 to 11 inches), included multiple memory card slots, and some of which included wi-fi capability to connect with the Kodak Gallery—that gallery functionality has now been compromised due to gallery policy changes (see below).

====Kodak Gallery====

In June 2001, Kodak purchased the photo-developing website Ofoto, later renamed Kodak Gallery. The website enables users to upload their photos into albums, publish them into prints, and create mousepads, calendars, etc. On March 1, 2012, Kodak announced that it will sell the Kodak Gallery to Shutterfly for $23.8 million.[tpl]cite news|last=Rubin|first=Ben Fox|title=Kodak Agrees to Sell Gallery to Shutterfly|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203753704577255783463040036.html|accessdate=12 March 2012|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=1 March 2012[/tpl]

====Document imaging====

Kodak provides document imaging solutions.  Historically this industry began when George Eastman partnered with banks to image checks in the 1920s. Through the development of microfilm technology, Eastman Kodak was able to provide business and government with a solution for long term document storage. Document imaging was one of the first imaging solutions to move to "digital imaging" technology. Kodak manufactured the first digital document scanners for high speed document imaging. Today Kodak has a full line of document scanners providing imaging solutions for banking, finance, insurance,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.microdea.com/insurance/case-studies.aspx?id=744 |title=Insurance | Case Studies | Gore Success Story |publisher=Microdea.com |date= |accessdate=December 11, 2011[/tpl] healthcare and other vertical industries. Kodak also provides associated document capture software and business process services. Eastman Kodak acquired the Bowe Bell & Howell scanner division in September 2009.

====Photographic film and paper====

Kodak continues to produce specialty films and film for newer and more popular consumer formats, while it has also discontinued the manufacture of film in older and less popular formats.
Kodak is a leading producer of silver halide (AgX) paper used for printing from film and digital images. Minilabs located in retail stores and larger central photo lab operations (CLOs) use silver halide paper for photo printing. In 2005 Kodak announced it would stop producing black-and-white photo paper.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,159782,00.html | title=Kodak to Stop Making Black-and-White Paper | publisher=Fox News | date=June 16, 2005 | accessdate=January 7, 2008[/tpl]

====Photo kiosks====

Kodak is a manufacturer of self-service photo kiosks that produce "prints in seconds" from multiple sources including digital input, scanned prints, Facebook, the Kodak Gallery and orders placed on-line using thermosublimation printers. The company has placed over 100,000 Picture Kiosks in retail locations worldwide.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.kioskmarketplace.com/article.php?id=16331 | title=KODAK, Esprida offer Remote Business Manager for photo kiosks | date=October 10, 2006 | publisher=Kiosk Marketplace | accessdate=January 7, 2008[/tpl] Employing similar technology, Kodak also offers larger printing systems with additional capabilities including duplex greeting cards, large format poster printers, photobooks and calendars under the brand name "APEX".[tpl]cite web|url=http://wwwde.kodak.com:100/global/de/business/retailPhoto/products/APEX/index.jhtml?pq-path=2300879/12640 |title=Kodak.com |publisher=E.kodak.com:80 |date=June 24, 2010 |accessdate=January 19, 2012[/tpl]

==Controversies==

===Better Business Bureau===

On March 26, 2007, the Council of Better Business Bureaus (CBBB) announced that Eastman Kodak was resigning its national membership in the wake of expulsion proceedings initiated by the CBBB Board of Directors.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.bbb.org/us/article/eastman-kodak-resigns-from-council-of-better-business-bureaus-after-expulsion-proceedings-are-initiated-697 | title=Eastman Kodak Resigns from Council of Better Business Bureaus After Expulsion Proceedings are Initiated | date=March 26, 2007 | publisher=Better Business Bureau | accessdate=January 31, 2014[/tpl]
In 2006, Kodak notified the BBB of Upstate New York that it would no longer accept or respond to consumer complaints submitted by them. In prior years, Kodak responded by offering consumers an adjustment or an explanation of the company’s position. The BBB file contains consumer complaints of problems with repairs of Kodak digital cameras, as well as difficulty communicating with Kodak customer service. Among other complaints, consumers say that their cameras broke and they were charged for repairs when the failure was not the result of any damage or abuse. Some say their cameras failed again after being repaired.
Kodak said its customer service and customer privacy teams concluded that 99 percent of all complaints forwarded by the BBB already were handled directly with the customer. Brian O’Connor, Kodak chief privacy officer, said the company was surprised by the news release distributed by the Better Business Bureau:

===Patent litigation===

In 2010, Apple filed a patent-infringement claim against Kodak. On May 12, 2011, Judge Robert Rogers rejected Apple's claims that two of its digital photography patents were being violated by Kodak.Don Reisinger, CNET. "Kodak wins key battle in Apple patent case." May 13, 2011. Retrieved May 13, 2011.
On July 1, 2011, the U.S. International Trade Commission partially reversed a January decision by an administrative law judge stating that neither Apple nor Research in Motion had infringed upon Kodak's patents. The ITC remanded the matter for further proceedings before the ALJ."Notice of Commission Determination."

===Class action lawsuit===

On September 22, 2011, a class action complaint was filed in the Superior Court of California, County of Orange, Daniela Apostol v. Eastman Kodak Company.[tpl]cite web|url=https://ocapps.occourts.org/civilwebShopping/Login.do#top | title=Superior Court of California, County of Orange: CIVIL CASE ACCESS[/tpl]
The complaint alleges that Kodak engaged in wrongful business practices by not informing consumers that its All-In-One inkjet printers are designed in such a way, that both black and color inkjet cartridges are always used during printing, regardless of printer settings.
The complaint also alleges that the printer design necessitates that both black and color cartridges be installed for the printer to operate, even when the intent is to print a black and white document, and that the combination of these design aspects results in forced purchases of color inkjet cartridges.[tpl]cite web |  url=http://www.topclassactions.com/lawsuit-settlements/lawsuit-news/1404-kodak-all-in-one-color-inkjet-printer-class-action-lawsuit | title=Kodak All-In-One Color Inkjet Printer Class Action Lawsuit[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.courthousenews.com/2011/09/26/ink.pdf | title=Class action complaint filing for case: 30-2011-00510342-CU-FR-CXC[/tpl]
