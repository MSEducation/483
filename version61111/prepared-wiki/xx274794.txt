VeriShow is built on a software as a service (SaaS) model, and based around a set of integrated applications, that serve different purposes, such as web-conferencing and real-time multimedia content sharing for customer support.  The platform's live help can be accessed by visitors by clicking the website-embedded call-button. Using the platform's mobile version, users can use VeriShow on Android devices.

The service has audio and video conferencing capabilities, along with a number of other features such as image and document sharing, text co-editing, a live video feed, and a form completion application. These applications are intended to be used by web-site representatives in the online sales or live support process. The representatives can show and annotate documents, share screens, review web pages, collaborate on a whiteboard and use a number of different calculators. A chat translation application enables automatic translation between languages while using the chat.
