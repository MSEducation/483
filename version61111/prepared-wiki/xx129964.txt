==History==

Ängelholms IF were founded in 1905 and Skörpinge GIF were founded in 1950. Ängelholms IF had their most successful period in the 1930s when they played in Swedish Division 2 against clubs such as Malmö FF, Halmstads BK and Helsingborgs IF. Ängelholms IF were the most successful club in Ängelholm until Skörpinge GIF were founded and later seriously started to compete for the best talents of the town.
Discussions of a possible merger initiated in 1975 after the two clubs realised the potential in a merger. Both clubs realised that the best opportunity for Ängelholm to have a professional club would be to merge the two clubs. They merged in 1976 and founded Ängelholms FF. However the success that the two clubs had in vision took until the 1990s to aspire. Between 1997 and 2001, Ängelholms FF were promoted from Division 4 to the second highest tier, Superettan. The club was relegated back to Division 2 and played there until they were promoted to the newly created tier three, Division 1. The club was once again promoted in their second season of the league and found themselves in Superettan for the second time in the clubs history. In 2008 the club reached their highest position in the Swedish league system yet, 5th place in Superettan.
