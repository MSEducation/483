In the UK, the complete series is now available through 20 volumes. the first volume became available in late 2008, with the first 32 episodes. Each new volume was released every few months, all containing 32 episodes and eight discs per set; with the exception of volumes 17 through to 20. Volume 17 contains 40 episodes on 10 discs. Volumes 18 and 19 contain 48 episodes on 12 discs on each set. The final volume contains 44 episodes on 11 discs. The reason for this was that distribution company Fremantle UK would keep in line with the Australian releases. Two Australian releases are the equivalent of one UK release making a total of 20 volumes in the UK and 40 volumes in Australia. The increase in episodes on later sets were so that they finished releasing on their target volume. The final UK volume which was originally supposed to be released in April 2013, was released one month later in May.
In Australia, distribution company Shock Records began releasing the UK volumes in 2011, as their original volumes are now out of print. The final volume was released in early 2014.
