==Influence on Egyptian music==

Being one of the very first professional Egyptian bands, Eftekasat's debut album upon its release made quite a fuss that many magazines and newspapers, which only covered Egyptian pop music, started to write about Eftekasat and their album. Eftekasat, together with other bands, the most notable of which is Wust El Balad, started a musical revolution in Egypt as people started to notice the 'bands' music more. The album generally, and the track "Mouled Sidi El-Latini" specifically, made quite an impact that fans of pop music were impressed. Eftekasat reached as far as having their tracks played on radios which was quite an impossibility for bands in Egypt.

==Trivia==

 
 "no human can listen to one type of music, you'll end up getting bored! You can't listen to Om Kalthoum for a whole day or week, nor to Eftekasat! The media should show the audience what is there and present the varied option"

The band's logo which spells the band's name in English and Arabic support that together with the multilingual tracks on which Salah commented:
 
 "Eftekasat is an international band, for many reasons; we are aiming towards a position in the international music scene because we play music that is influenced by different cultures."

Eftekasat are indeed now considered to be an international band due to their participation in the Carthage Jazz Festival 2008 in Tunis.
 
 "I was playing my guitar in a garden and there were ducks. I could hear the music in my vision. The ducks were dancing to the music. The weather was great and there were birds in the skies. Suddenly, the skies turned grey and the ducks started to march very seriously, then the clouds turned red, a storm blew and the ducks started dying and then i fell to the ground. All of a sudden, things started to brighten up again and the ducks started playing once more and the vision went on looping in my mind many times."
