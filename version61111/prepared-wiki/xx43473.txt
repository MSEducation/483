Connexxion is a large public transport bus company in the Netherlands, operating in the west, middle, east and south-west part of the country. It was formed in 1999 as result of a merger between the public transport companies NZH, ZWN, Midnet and Oostnet. Its name is a mutation of the French word 'connexion' meaning "connection". Connexxion also owns the bus companies Hermes and Novio.
Besides bus services, it also operates the train lines Almelo–Mariënberg (until December 2013) and Amersfoort–Ede–Wageningen, the tram line between Utrecht and Nieuwegein (until December 2013),[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/qbuzz-wins-utrecht-sneltram-concession.html|accessdate=2010-10-31|title=Railway Gazette: Qbuzz wins Utrecht sneltram concession|quote=s[/tpl] a few ferry routes, an ambulance service and a taxi service.
Trains use rail infrastructure supplied by ProRail. For trains there is partly a common tariff system with the other four public transport railroad companies in the country.
In 2007, Transdev bought a 66% stake in Connexxion, with an option to purchase the whole within 5 years. It has since merged into Veolia Transdev.
